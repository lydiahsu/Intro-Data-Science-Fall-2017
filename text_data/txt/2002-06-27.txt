23	P R O C E E D I N G  S45 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good evening.6 My name is Marvin Markus .  I'm7 Chairman of the New York City Rent  Guidelines8 Board.9 And I would like to welcome  you10 to this meet ing today, public meeting of the11 Board , where the Board is anticipated to vote on12 the guidel ines that will apply to resident ial13 apartments, loft apartments and hotel  apartments14 beginning October 1, 2002 and ending the end  of15 September,  2003 .16 We have a pretty full agenda17 today.18 I would like to have the Board19 Members introduce themselves .20 We will deviate a little bit21 from past pract ice. We will deal with hotels22 first because at least it has been my observat ion23 that the hotel sector gets short shrifted in  the24 debate because we spend all the time on  the25 residential side and we 're tired out . So we are7 
2 going to spend some time on the hotels,  assessing3 that issue, and then we will go to  the4 residential sector.5	It 's my intention to read what6 is before the Board and we will go from there,  to7 make sure that everybody understands, on  the8 Board in part icular, exactly what we are vot ing9 on and so that the record reflects exactly  what10 we adopted because it is a legal document. And  we11 want to make sure there is no confusion as  to12 what has been adopted by the  Board.13 If the Board Members could14 introduce themselves beginning with  Mr.15 Castellano to my right.16 MR.  CASTELLANO:	Well , as Peter17 Lawford once said, I 'm the late Vince Castellano,18 owner representative.19 MR. LUBELL:	Harold Lubell. I'm20 an owner' s representative.21 MR. RUBENSTEIN:	David22 Rubenstein, public member.2 3	MR. RIVERA:	Agustin Rivera,24 public member.25 MR. CARMODY:	Bart Carmody,24 
2	public member.3	MR. STAROBIN:	Mort Starobin,4	public member.5	MR. PAGAN:	David Pagan, tenant6	member.7	MS. HOLDER:	Adriene Holder,8	tenant member.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me10 reiterate, we appreciat e if everybody here try to11 keep some degree of decorum, they didn' t  scream,12 yell  out , didn't heckle in particular.	I don' t13 mind at all if there' s applause or cheering from14 time to time or even booing for  specific15 situations. But we really want to try to keep   the16 level of reasonable discourse going. So we  would17 appreciate if nobody heckl es.18 As I said , we are first going to19 take up rent stabilized  hotels.20 Let me indicate that in  the21 packet to the Board Members, in your packet is   a22 memorandum prepared by Anita Visser of the   staff23 discussing  the hotel sector in particular.24 It contains	I'll take you25 through  it a little bit	- - definitions  of exactly
2 the class of units that are being regulated here ,3 ranging from the so- called Class A hotels, the4 single room occupancies, Class B hotels,  rooming5 houses and lodging houses.6 It then goes through the  ability7 and the way that people achieve permanent  rent8 stabilized tenancy in rent stabilized  hotels.9 And there are definit e met hods10 described.11 One is just asking for the  lease12 and the issues associated with that .13 Two is if you stay in your  hotel14 room for at least six months, and how  that15 happens.16 Then it discusses:17 Leases in rent stabilized18 hotels;19 The hotel uses that exist  for20 other than permanent  stabilized tenants;21 The eviction process and how  one22 could evict  somebody in a rent stabilized   hotel ,23 -  it goes through several ;24 The process of deregulation  of25 stabilized hotel rooms which can be  deregulatedROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2	in several ways which are discussed  there;3	And then, finally, the issue  of4 certif icate of no harassment.5 And also then has the statutory6 provisions of the Rent Stabilization  Code.7 So, you know, you should feel8 free to look at that. This memorandum, as  the9 Board Members are aware , was also passed out10 yesterday and the Board Members hopefully  had11 time and a chance to study  it.12 Let me indicate that from  a13 procedural  standpoint we are going to be  - -  we14 adopted  on May 20th a hotel  - a potential ,15 proposed Hotel Order No. 32 . And let me try to16 indicate what we adopted in that , and then I 'll17 take a motion for adoption. And from there on  we18 will go to debate.19 "Applicability.	This Order .. II20 - I'm going to read this for the record so you' ll21 have to bear with me  for a  while .22 II	. .This Order  shall apply to23 units in buildings subject to the Hotel  Section24 of the Rent Stabilization Law. " Then it goes on25 to describe those sections.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167

II4 - - and I will change that to " . . .adopts the5 following rent adjustments:6 "The allowable level of rent7 adjustment over the lawful rent actually  charged8 and paid on September 3 0, 2002 shall be:9	"Resident ial Class A	(apartment)10	hot els, two percent ;11	"Lodging houses, two percent ;12 "Rooming houses	(Class B13 buildings) containing less than thirty  units),14 two percent ;15 " Class B hotels,  two percent ;16 " Single  Room Occupancy17 buildings . . .two percent.

1	102 controlled tenants paying no more than the  legal3 regulat ed rent , at the t ime that any rent4 increase in this Order would otherwise  be5 authorized.6	" (2) On any individual unit if7 the owner has failed to provide to the  new8 occupant of that unit a copy of the Rights  and9 Duties of Hotel Owners and Tenants, pursuant  to10 Section 2522. 5 of the Rent Stabilizat ion Code.

No addit ional charges may be3 made to a tenant for such services, however  such4 charges may be called or identif ied.5 'STATEMENT OF BASE AND PURPOSE.6	11  The Rent Guidelines Board is7 authorized to promulgat e rent guidelines8 governing hotel units subject to the  Rent9 Stabilization Law of 1969, as amended , and the10 Emergency Tenant Protect ion Act of 1974, as11 amended. The purpose of these guidelines is  to12 implement the public policy set forth in  Findings13 and Declaration of Emergency of the  Rent14 Stabilization Law . ..11	and then it goes on to15 quote sections 11   •   •   •  and the Legislative Findings16 contained in the Emergency Tenant Protection  Act17 of 1974. 11	It also goes on to quote  sections.18 I will entertain a motion  to19 adopt this resolution.20 Do I hear a mot ion?21 Anybody?22 MR. LUBELL:	So move.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell.24 Second?25 MR. RUBENSTEIN:	I'll second.
1	122 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Second, Mr.3 Rubenstein .4 I open the floor to debate and5 amendments .6 Any debat e? Any amendments?7 (No response. )8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I would like9	to offer an amendment as soon as I find it .10 I would like to amend the so-11 called proviso,  Section 1, beginning  after  - -12 where  it says  11     (1) Fewer than seventy  percent .	II13 et cetera, et cetera on page  two.14 It would  now read:  " If permanent15 rent stabilized or rent controlled tenants  paying16 no more than the legal regulated rent , at the17 t ime that any rent increase in this Order would18 otherwise be  authorized , constitute  fewer  than19 seventy percent of all units in the building  that20 are used  or occupied  or intended ,  arranged or21 designed to be used or occupied in whol e or in22 part as the home, residence or sleeping place  of23 one or more human beings ."24 The reason I'm suggesting  that25 this amendment be made is that there has  beenROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC .521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175
2 some confusion in the field about our  existing3 language and exactly what the denominator and  the4 numerator are in adjudicating and deciding on  the5 particular formula.6	Specif ically, I intend , if this7 amendment is adopted , to have the explanatory8 language in the Board' s Order to read: " The9 Board' s intent ion for the meaning of this proviso10 is that all dwelling units in the hotel , whether11 occupied, vacant ,  rented  to tourists,  transients,12 contract clients, students or other  non-permanent13 tenants or to permanent  rent stabilized tenants14 be counted in the denominator of the  calculation.15 The only type of units in the hotel that may  be16 excluded from the denominator are units that  are17 used for stores or similar business purposes  such18 as doctors' offices. The numerator of  the19 calculation is the number of units occupied  by20 permanent rent stabilized or rent controll ed21 tenants.22 "Here are two exampl es.23 " (1) A hotel has a hundred  units24 and two stores. Thirty- two units are rented to25 permanent rent stabilized tenants. Ten are  vacant
1	142 and fifty- eight are rented to transients and3 tourists.4 "The calculat ion is as follows:5 "The denominator is a hundred6 and the numerator is thirty- two. This calculat ion7 results in an occupancy of less than  seventy8 percent under the formula, thirty- two percent ,9 and an increase cannot be taken for the  permanent10 stabilized tenants.11 " Example  two: A hotel has a12 hundred and fifty units, two of which are used  by13 a dent ist and doctor for their businesses, eight14 are rented to tourists and twenty are vacant  and15 a hundred and twenty are occupied by  permanent16 rent stabilized tenants.17 "The denominator would be one18 forty- eight , and the numerator would be one19 hundred and twenty. This calculation results  in20 an occupancy percent of greater than  seventy21 percent under the formula, eighty- one percent ,22 and an increase can be taken for the  permanent23 stabilized  tenants. "24 I'd like to make that motion  to25 amend.
1	152	Do I hear a second?3 MR. CARMODY:	Second.4 MR. LUBELL:	I would like to5 make a friendly amendment to your  clarifying6 amendment.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well , I'm not8 sure - - we checked on Robert' s Rules of Order and9 I think we don' t need to worry about friendly10 amendments or otherwise.11 If I can get a second , you can12 then try to amend that. It doesn't have to  be13 friendly or otherwise.14 MR. LUBELL:	Well , I don' t want15 to make it an unfriendly.16CHAIRMAN MARKUS:That 's okay.17Idon' tcarewho my friends are.18 MR. CARMODY:	I'll second.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.20 MS. HOLDER:	Point of order.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.22 MS. HOLDER:	So the vot e , as it23 would stand , would be for the two percent on24 hotels plus your amendment of this proviso  as25 read?18 
1	162 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No.3 The vot e we are taking right now4 is just to amend the proviso. There will be  a5 vote on the - - because  this is an amendment   to6 the Order that is before us.7 So right now we are vot ing on8 changing the language of the provision   - -9	MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.10 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	- - only.11 MS . HOLDER:	Thank you,12 Chairman.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.14 MR . LUBELL:	I think15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Go ahead.16 MR . LUBELL:	I think, Mr .17 Chairman, that the proviso, which has been  the18 intent basically of the Board in past years,  is19 onerous when it 's applied to small buildings.20 Take a building under ten  units21 or less. And the same provision of  seventy22 percent , that ' s not as applicable  to or shouldn' t23 be as applicable to a small building as it is   to24 the two examples that you gave , one example being25 a hotel with a hundred units and , two, a hotel
1	172 with a hundred and fifty units, because  here3 these small buildings need a little relief , and4theseventypercent is really an onerous  amount5forthem.67So my suggest ion or amendment toyour amendment is to have this applied  to8buildingswith, or hotels with more than  ten9units.10 Actually it 's unf air to11 buildings with ten to twenty units, but I  think12 as a modest and reasonable cutoff ten units  at13 least makes sense.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there a15 second to that?16 MR. CASTELLANO:	Second , Mr.17 Chairman.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.19 Any discussion  on - -  I know this20 is gett ing hard to follow - - the amendment to the21 amendment.22 So the suggestion is that the23 proviso be changed to - actually that there be  no24 proviso to apply for any regulated entity  under25 this Order that has less than ten units; is  that
1182correct?3MR. CASTELLANO:	Correct.4MR. LUBELL:	Yes.5CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.6Any discussion? Any debate?7(No response. )8CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We are taking9a vote on Mr.Lubell 's amendment.10Mr. Carmody?11MR. CARMODY:	No.12CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.13Castellano?14MR.

Let me just say that , but I	the24 reason we are spending more time on  this25 hopefully and the reason we had the staff  prepareROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 the memorandum	is this is a very misunderstood3 part of the rent regulatory system, and at  least4 in my way of thinking has a lot of  confusion5 going on with very, very confused and  dichotomous6 public policy goals.7	Because on one hand we  are8 trying to preserve these units because I  think9 the advocat es of SRO housing legitimately want10 SRO housing to be preserved.11 There was years ago a  mistaken12 movement to try, in fact , to eliminate all SROs13 in New York City, which actually succeeded to  a14 great degree.15 And then now the movement	is to16 make  sure that , in fact , they stay. So  we've17 created sort of an anomalous situation where  we18 sort of tend to penalize people when they do  what19 we want them to do, however, with the sort  of20 illogic of so- called public policy.21 I concluded after considerable22 study that probably our act is probably the  most23 logical of acts in an illogical  system.24 So I'm prepared to vote for  it25 and I just want to make that statement because   I
2 do think it ' s really been an area that  cries out ,3 if an area cries out for signif icant public4 policy reform.5 With that I'll take a vote.6	Mr. Carmody?7	MS. HOLDER:	What is it that we8	are actually take a vote  on?9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	On the10 adopt ion of  the guideline ,  the hotel guideline.11 MR. LUBELL:	Including the12 proviso?13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Including the14 amended proviso.15 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.16 I have a motion.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.18 Then you have an amendment.19 MS. HOLDER:	I have an20 amendment I would like to  move.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	To the22 overall motion.23 MS. HOLDER:	To the overall24 motion .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Fine.
2 MS. HOLDER:	On that part that3 talks about the rent guideline for  hotels,4 rooming houses, single room occupancy  buildings5 and lodging houses.6 And I would propose to  amend7 what was proposed, the allowable level of  rent8 adjustment over the lawful rent actually  charged9 and paid on September 3 0, 2002 shall be:10	For	(1) ,	(2) ,	(3) and	(4) and11 (5) as listed in our proposed 2002 Hotel Order12 No. 32 as zero percent.13 (Applause.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there a15 second on that?16 MR. LUBELL:	Then you don 1    t17 need the proviso.18 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Well ,19 actually, the mistake was made. The  proviso20 should be in there to make it look good. So  we21 will leave the proviso in at least for now.  We22 can deal with it if this amendment  passes.23 MR. PAGAN:	Mr. Chairman, I24 second the mot ion.25 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Second , Mr.
2	Pagan.3	MS. HOLDER:	I would like to4	just say that5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.6	Sure. Absolutely.7	MS. HOLDER:	- - we are talking8 about housing of last resort.9 And for the same reason why  this10 year it is not justified that there be any  types11 of rent increases, especially for this class  of12 housing in New York City.13 (Audience participation. )14 MS. HOLDER:	We cannot allow15 the proposed rent hike of two percent to  remain.16 So I ask that this Board17 seriously consider voting for a zero  percent18 increase on this and we hereby mandate to try  and19 preserve affordable housing.20 This is the housing  - -21 (Audience participation. )22 MS. HOLDER:	- - of last resort .23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	If I could25 debate that ,  I will  sort of reiterate my
2 statement I made before because actually I  should3 have made it after you made this mot ion, which4 is, you know, we are a little confused I think   in5 our public policy goals where we want people  to6 stay in the SRO business because we believe  that7 SROs are an important part of our housing  stock,8 yet we attempt to penalize those that are,  in9 fact ,  in the SRO business.10 So I think it 's totally11 illogical. I understand the need for the  seventy12 percent which actually, you know, you might13 quarrel as to whether seventy percent is  the14 right number or not , but  I think that 's been  the15 historical number the Board , at least recently,16 has adopted .17 But , in fact , there is an18 irrationality telling people we want you to  stay19 in the business, but we won' t give you consistent20 and necessary, in my opinion - I appreciate  that21 some people might disagree -  necessary22 compensation.23 And so I think that  the24 compromise and the procedure that we've adopted ,25 which is a relat ively minimal rent increase2 
2 associated only with those SROS that have  a3 significant commitment to stay as an SRO,  makes4 eminent sense again in a largely non- sensical5 system.6 So I am prepared and I will be7 vot ing against your amendment to the overall8 (Audience participation.)9 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Mr. Rivera .10 MR. RIVERA :	I agree that there11 is sort of a mixed signal that is given  with12 regard to policy .13 On the other hand , in all the14 t ime that I have been here there has been very15 little, practically absent	at this time I16 think one person from the SRO has come  to17 test ify. And this has been true generally18 throughout  the years.19 I think that the real problem  is20 not what we give them, but the enforcement . There21is a diff icultyin enforcing the laws that are  on22the books.23And so I'm going to vote for  the24zero .25(Audience participation. )
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell.3	MR . LUBELL:	Mr. Chairman, just4 a footnote to your comment. I've been here  even5 longer than Augie.6 One of the reasons that the  SRO7 owners don't show up  is - - a perfect  example  is:8	In Order No. 25, 1995 - 1996 ,9	zero;10	In '96 to  ' 97, zero;11	' 97 to	' 98, zero;12	'98 to  '99, zero;13 Four percent with a proviso,14 then two percent , two  percent.15 We've really driven a lot of16 these SRO owners out of business .17 (Audience participat ion .)18 MR. LUBELL:	And I think that19 if we send some kind of signal that public  policy20 is at least support ive of SRO units in our City,21 then it may be helpful .22 For that reason I support it.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.24 MS. HOLDER:	I think it 's25 interest ing that my colleague is saying that we13 
2 are driving them out of business and that 's why3 they don' t show up.4	Interestingly, yesterday, a  lot5 of my colleagues were talking yesterday about  how6 we were actually moved by the turnout of  tenants7 and landlords yesterday to give testimony  on8 their respective posit ions about what this Board9 does.10 There were a number of  small11 landlords who came and who said they  will12 cont inue to come.13 And so it 's of interest to me to14 think that if small landlords as well as some   of15 the large landlords would continue to show up   at16 these hearings, if the SRO and hotel owners   are17 not showing up, I'm actually inclined to   think18 they don' t show up not because they are19 discouraged	- - because  there' s a lot of people20 who are discouraged  in this room, some of  them21 who do not agree22 (Audience participation.)23 MS. HOLDER:	but I think24 more likely is the attitude that they' re making  a25 lot of money without any type of assistance  from
2	this Board.3 (Audience participat ion. )4 MS. HOLDER:	So they don' t need5	these increases. They don't need them at  all.6	And , once again, I would like to7	just move on to my mot ion.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.9 MS.

PAGAN:	Mr. Chairman, I10 want to make an amendment .11 I must say that the experience12 of last night was one of the most enlightening  in13 my short time as a Rent Guidelines Board  Member.14 The many tenants that presented15 their cases convinced me more than ever that  the16 action that we took on May 20th was not a  proper17 one.18 From the very first tenant19 speaker, Anita Romm, to the last speaker,  Angela20 McClain, the message was clear.  Tenants21 understand that these are diff icult times, that22 we, as a Board , need to be more conscious about23 our actions.24 We need to take into25 considerat ion the unusual economic conditionsROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 that are happening now.3 Tenants would like to see  an4 action by this Board that takes into  account5 their problems, whether it has to do with  their6 personal problems as well as the  many7 diff iculties they encount er in dealing with the8 providers of housing.9 We recognize that not all  owners10 are bad. As in any other population, you  will11 have extremes : owners that are very good and  care12 for their clients, or clients as some people  call13 them, that understand that they provide  a14 service , and in order to provide that service15 they have to maintain a happy client and  take16 pride in their work and property ; as well as17 those that are there to get rich in a very  short18 period of t ime without caring about the service19 they provide and who they hurt in the  process.20 The vast majority of units  are21 owned not by the extreme , but those that are in  a22 business and do a good job. Their  buildings23 provide a fair return to the owners as well as   a24 fair housing product to the  tenants.25 These owners have done well  in
2 the past year, better than they had expected.  As3 good businessmen,	they had made their plan  to4 continue their business well beyond a  one-year5 period. In most cases they are looking how  they6 will do over a five-year plan.7	They take into account not  only8 the net operating income, but the wealth that  is9 being created by improving and maintaining  their10 asset.11	In turn, we are here to make a12 short - term decision that we are able to correct13 in the following year.14 In prior years when there was no15 merit for increases this  Board provided	increases16 of two and four percent , and when there was a17 problem, we provided a larger than  needed18 increase of up 5.5 percent and nine  percent.19 The two and four was true in  20	'94, '95, '97, ' 98 and	' 99, years in which the21 PIOC was at 2. 0 or below, but none of those years22 had a negative PIOC.23 This year for the first time  we24 do have a negative PIOC, yet we find excuses  why25 the increases should be at the base of two  andROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.
2 four or higher.3 (Audience participation. )4	MR. PAGAN:	The tenants were5 very disappointed and expressed that last  night.6 This indicates that in the future no matter  what7 happens the voice is not  heard.8	Today, I implore that  you9 reconsider your prior decision and send a  message10 that we care for the well - being of the many New11 Yorkers that have placed their faith in the  RGB12 to do the fair thing.13 I move for a rent decrease.14 (Audience participation. )15 MR. PAGAN:	For one year 3 .516 percent , and 1.75 percent for two years, and zero17 percent increase on the  lofts.18 (Audience participation. )19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We will have20 no outbreak from the  audience.21 MS. HOLDER:	I second that22 motion and I too have a  comment.2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.24 MS. HOLDER:	Think about it ,25 New York. Think about where we are right  now.
2 There is no basis in  logic,3 experience or public policy for a rent  increase4 this year. Everyone, including the  landlords,5 know this is the year for a rent  rollback.6 (Audience part icipation.)7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	In a8 preliminary vote on May 20th, the Rent  Guidelines9 Board , this body, projected	calls for a rent10 rollback on rent stabilized apartments  and11 instead recommended increases.12 Interest ingly, this Board did13 this despite the study by our own  analysts,14 released in April , that found a decl ine in15 landlords' operat ing costs for the first time16 since an index of such costs was created in  1969.17 Also, interestingly, the  Board18 did this despite the fact that , according to the19 new Income and Expense Report , landlords' average20 net operating  income rose by 3 .5 percent , a21 figure higher than the Consumer Price  Index.22 In fact , average net  operating23 income is at forty- four percent. Landlords are24 doing well.25 When is enough enough?ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.
2 (Audience participat ion.)3 MS. HOLDER:	But what about the4 tenants? They're not doing so well. They  could5 use a break.6	The adjustment , without regard7 to our mandate, this body recommended  increases8 at a time when peopl e of the City are still9 reeling from the severe impact of recession  and10 economic and emotional fallout from the  September11 11th attacks.12 They' ll have you believe that13 that should not be an issue here. But it is  about14 income and affordability  and  it ' s an issue in15 every aspect of our life here in New York  City,16 every aspect from how they are passing  their17 budget in the City and in the State, to how it  is18 that we have to consider increases for our  City19 workers.20 It is an issue and it def initely21 is an issue that we have to keep before  this22 Board today.23 (Audience participation. )24 MS. HOLDER:	The legally25 mandated task of this Board is to set  increasesROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	462 in a manner that serves to protect the  public3 healt h, safety and welfare and to prevent4 exactions of unjust , unreasonable and oppressive5 rents in rental agreements .6	Yet by approving increases  this7 year, we will have ignored this mandate  all8 together .9 This process has not only  been10 responsive to the demands	has only been11 responsive to the demands of landlords  for12 increases. Those demands have been the  primary13 focus of most of the deliberat ions by this body14 that has been set up by this process .15 The RGB has in the past all but16 ignored the inabil ity of tenants to pay higher17 rents.18 We have a responsibil ity to19 preserve affordable housing  for New Yorkers.20 (Audience participation. )21 MS. HOLDER :	No comparable22 study for condit ions and the ability of tenants23 to pay RGB authorized rents, nor is  affordability24 a signif icant focus of the RGB deliberat ions,25 although the Rent Stabil izat ion Law specifiedROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175
1	472 that the RGB must f irst establish whether rents3 for housing accommodations shall be  adjusted4 prior to authorizing any  increases.5 This Board operates on the6 premise that rents will be increased and  then7 decides how much the increases will  be.8 Can City workers be assured  that9 yearly the City is operat ing on a premise that10 their salaries will be increased and then  decide11 how much those increases will  be?12 (Audience participat ion.)13 MS. HOLDER :	Can any of us make14 that assumption?15 (Audience participation.)16 MS. HOLDER:	The facts before17 the Board are simple and straightforward  and18 overwhelmingly	in favor of a rent rollback.19 (Audience participation.)20 MS. HOLDER:	Again, the21 landlords are doing well .22 All relevant indicators say  they23 are doing very well and the tenant s are doing24 horribly. We are reminded daily that New  York25 City is currently in the midst of a  serious2 
1	482 recession, one that began prior to  September3 11th . However, more than two- thirds of the job4 decl ine experience to date has occurred in the5 wake of September 11th.6 In one index it has fallen by7 150 , 000 from its peak of December of 2000   through8 March, the latest mont h for which data are9 availabl e.10 Economists forecast that  the11 City might even lose as many as 200 , 000 jobs12 before the local recession  ends.13 The City' s weak economy has even14 put small increases out of the reach of  low,15 moderate  and middle - income people.16 The most recent New York  City17 Housing and Vacancy Survey found that half of  all18 stabilized households have annual incomes  below19 $27,000 and hundreds of thousands of families  in20 stabilized housing have incomes below the  poverty21 level .22 In the past year with the23 recession in the wake of September 11th  these24 figures have risen to even more  critical25 elements .ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175
2 In New York City more than  1.83 million residents and thirty- eight percent of all4 children, fifty percent of all non- white children5 live in poverty.6 Stabilized housing with7 affordable rents is essent ial to ensure the8 health, well - being and safety of these children9 and their families.10 In addit ion, the escalating,11	accelerating  costs	excuse me - - loss of12 affordable  apartments coincides with another13 alarming phenomenon in New York City. Despite  the14 decade long economic expansion for many  New15 Yorkers, homelessness  in New York City continues16 at record levels.17 I work for the Legal Aid18 Society. We know this too well , as you all know19 in recent days. There are currently  33 , 00020 homeless men, women and children residing in   an21 abysmal shelter system each night and  thousands22 more on the streets, if only we could count  them.23 14,000 of our homeless are24 children.25 This is an historic  opportunity12 
2 for New York City. The RGB must  correct3 inequities of past increases that have more  than4 covered landlords' expenses as well as  finally5 meet our obl igation to reverse this trend and6 protect tenants from oppressive rent  increases.7 If not now, when?8 (Audience participation.)9 MS. HOLDER:	In the history of10 the RGB, never have we had rent increases  less11 than two and four percent.12 Are we now then establishing  a13 policy that says to landlords, I ask you, that  no14 matter how high the rent rolls go and how low   the15 operating cost , no matter how bad the economy  is16 and decrease in renters' income, you  landlords17 can always be assured of rent increases of  two18 and four percent?19 New York has experienced  an20 economic stagnat ion and tremendous tragedy. Let21 us prove tonight that New York City cares for   all22 its citizens  -  the poor,  the middle  class, the23 moderate  income, and not just the wealthy.24 Roll back the rents.25 (Audience part icipation.)

LUBELL:	Our major mandate6 should be to help preserve our housing stock  for7 the future.8 (Audience participation.)9	MR. LUBELL:	There is a great10 danger in not recognizing a worsening  inflat ion11 of operat ing expenses .12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. LUBELL:	It 's very clear14 that housing is not a bed of roses out there  in15 most of Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx and even   in16 large parts of Manhattan where the vast  majority17 of renters live.18 So- called - - we've had19 references to this - - so- called increases  -20 increased values of real estate are not  reality21 based , but fundamentally generated by the  absence22 of alternative investments .23 It 's an irrational exuberance.24 And no one is lining up behind a red velvet   rope25 to buy a ten- unit building in Rockaway. And even
2 if they could sell , it 's likely that  their3 accountant would say you can't afford to  sell.4	And in any event the buyer  of5 that building would be faced with the  same6 problem of increased costs and  inadequate7 returns.8 (Audience part icipation .)9	MR. LUBELL:	The core operating10 expenses for owners has increased  from - - this   is11 a fact - - 3 .8 percent in 2000 to 5 .4 percent in 12	2002.13 (Audience part icipation.)14 MR. LUBELL:	Real estate taxes -15 this is a fact - rose 6.6 percent this year,  and16 I bet that owners are facing a larger  increase17 next year - -18 (Audience part icipation.)19 MR. LUBELL:	- - particularly20 with the City facing a huge shortfall .21 I'm sure I don' t have to remind22 you - - Mort , I promised  I wouldn' t say much about23 insurance costs - - but  I'm sure I don't have   to24 remind you about insurance costs and how  they've25 gone up, not sixteen percent but in  many
2 instances we've heard examples of three  hundred3 percent  and four hundred percent  .4 (Audience participation. )5	MR. LUBELL:	And don' t forget6 that owners were not compensat ed for fuel  spikes7 far in excess of a decrease last year when  there8 were fuel spikes for two years in a  row.9 (Audience part icipation.)10 MR. LUBELL:	Two years of11 dramat ic increases.12 There was not adequate13 compensation for owners.14 Incidentally,  fact ,  oil prices15 shot up in March and it is reported that they  may16 be up by as much as fifty percent by the end   of17 the year.18 Operating ratios continue to19 rise and New York we know compared  unfavorably20 with the rest of the  country.21 All of this jeopardizes  the22 housing here in this  City.2 3	(Audience participation. )24 MR.

It does3 exist , but  it was reported as fact , it was4 reported as recently as June 17th in The New  York5 Times that the scope of poverty is distort ed .6 Eric Kober - - fact - - Eric7 Kober, Director of Housing, Economic  and8 Infrastructure Planning for the New York  City9 Department of Planning at Reade Street , works  for10 the City  - we also are employed by the City    -11 this expert says, speaking about census  data,12 stated that the numbers about poverty are  wrong13 because  there is, quote -  this is not me,  this  is14 this expert , Eric  Kober  - he  says the numbers are15 wrong because, quote, there is a  growing16 unwillingness by people  in certain groups  to17 answer the detailed income quest ions on the18 census long form, unquot e.19 (Audience participation.)20 MR . LUBELL:	Mr. Kober goes on21 to say about census data that it  also22 underest imates employment in New York City and ,23 therefore , the extent of reported unemployment	is24 exaggerat ed .25 (Audience participation .)

LUBELL:	- - the existence -910	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.11	MR. LUBELL:	of poverty and12 homelessness. This is important and important   for13 you as tenants as well as for owners. No  one14 denies the existence of poverty and  homelessness15 in New York City. It 's a problem, it 's a major16 problem, but it 's a probl em that has to be dealt17 with by Federal , State and local governments.18 (Audience part icipation.)19 MR.

LUBELL:	I want to defer to20 my phlegmatic colleague.21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. CASTELLANO:	I first want23 to apologize for being late tonight  because,24 unfortunately,	I live and work in a place that25 most of these heckling tenants would not  even
2 live in because it is not the center of  the3 universe.4 (Audience participation. )5 MS . HOLDER:	Is there a mot ion?6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The motion is7	going to be offered .8	MR . CASTELLANO:	Like Mr.9 Pagan, I found yesterday' s public hearing very10 interest ing and illuminating because I hear11 things that are just not true . People repeat them12 in the hope that you will  - - they will make  you13 believe that they are  true.14 How many times last year - -  not15 last year, yesterday did you hear that costs  are16 down. I heard it dozens of times. I heard it   from17 a member of this Board within the last  ten18 minutes.19 A PARTICIPANT:	It 's true.20 MR. CASTELLANO:	No, it 's21 factually incorrect . Costs are not down .22 (Audience participation .)23 MR. CASTELLANO:	If you want to24 place a bet , we can place a bet.25 What is down is a theoret ical
2 calculation of prices, ma' am. And some people3 understand the difference and some people don't .4 And there is a critical5 difference because that is supposedly prices  that6 some theoretical	landlord paid.7 (Audience participation .)8	MR. CASTELLANO:	There is no9	proof. There' s no proof.10 (Audience part icipation.)11 MR. CASTELLANO:	Nobody12 bothered to mention13 (Audience part icipation.)14 MR. CASTELLANO:	Nobody15 bothered to mention that the Consumer Price  Index16 is up 2. 8 percent.17 (Audience part icipation.)18 MR. CASTELLANO:	It is rising19 and accel erating.20 Nobody bothered to ment ion that21 tenant incomes are up six percent	in real22 dollars.23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. CASTELLANO:	The fact25 Mr. Chairman,ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I agree.3	MR. CASTELLANO:	I'm being4 heckled with every breat h. I did not hear that5 when Ms. Holder was speaking and Mr . Pagan was6 speaking. And  I resent  this .7 (Audience participat ion.)8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Look, we need9 to allow people to make their statements.  Really,10 it 's not going to help your cause to heckle him.11 It ' s not going12 (Audience part icipat ion.)13 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	- - to do any14 good.15 Sir, please ,  let  the gentleman16 finish.17 A PARTICIPANT:	Is he speaking18 to the mot ion?19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Please.20 MR. CASTELLANO:	How many times21 did I hear yesterday that landlord prof its are up22 forty percent	in four years.23 I asked the staff where  does24 this number come from . I haven' t seen this25 number. Nobody on the staff could tell me  the
2 source of this number. Yet I heard it a  dozen3 times yesterday. It 's not true. It doesn' t come4 from our research.5 People have questioned whether6 preferent ial rents exist. Everybody in the7 business knows they're widespread  although8 because they' re not on the Isle of Manhattan.9	Sadly I 've come to the10 conclusion that because of politics and  ideology11 a majority on this Board does not exist to  adopt12 sensible rent increases that would take  into13 account the long- term trend in the core PIOC.14 For several years the core  PIOC15 has been between two and three percent a year  and16 that ' s why this Board adopted rent increases   of17 two and four percent.18 This year the core PIOC is  5.419 percent.	It 's almost doubl e the Consumer Price20 Index.21 (Audience participation. )22 MR.  CASTELLANO:	It ' s the23 highest it 's been in a decade and I didn' t hear24 anybody even mention it .25 That would easily justify a  one-
2 year increase of five or even six percent .3 Politics don't permit that .4 But I ask you to consider5 the negative consequences of adopting  policies6 that are not stable and are not defensible on  a7 long - term basis . Changing policies year by year8 on the basis of whim is not a good way to run  a9 railroad .10 Some suggestions for the  Board.11 The rate for a two- year lease12 should be more than twice the increase for a  one-13 year lease. You've got voluminous testimony  that14 the cost of maint aining an apartment in New York15 is at least $500 a month . There is no rational16 publ ic policy that compels owners to rent17 apartments below the cost of providing  basic18 services that we mandate.19 One member of this Board  has20 repeatedly said in response why not sell  the21 building. All that does is transfer a  problem22 from you to him. It doesn' t solve the publ ic23 policy issue. Instead of this guy  complaining24 this year, we have somebody else complaining  next25 year . It doesn' t solve the problem.2 
2 We should stop the annual  debate3 about the sublet allowance. We've had  endless4 debate and all the legal opinions, and it  should5 remain at  ten percent .6 We should stop the annual  debate7 about the special guideline. We've had the  same8 formula for three years.  It works.  It ' s9 unambiguous.	It 's fair to all sides. It 's easy to10 administ er and it does not require extensive11 litigation to resolve unless the owner wants  to12 charge a very heavy increase, in which case he' ll13 have to defend in court and  should.14 We've had evidence over  the15 years of long- term tenants paying very cheap16 rents, so cheap that ,  in fact ,  family planning is17 necessary to ensure the legal succession can  be18 maintained.19 (Audience participation. )20 MR. CASTELLANO:	In fact , I was21 amazed how many people yesterday said  they've22 been living in the same apartment for  twenty,23 thirty and in one case forty  years.24 (Audience participation. )25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet .
2MR.  CASTELLANO:	Last - -3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let 's have4order here.5A  PARTICIPANT:	What ' s the6motion?7MR. CASTELLANO:	A one time8	long- term renewal increase of six percent	for any9	tenant - -10	(Audience participat ion.)11	MR.  CASTELLANO:	- - in12 cont inuous occupancy for more than ten years is13 fair and reasonable.14 When it comes to public  policy15 on this Board we always talk about the  average16 landlord , the average  cost , the average rent , the17 PIOC, which is by its very nature a measure  of18 average prices.19 But we never talk about  the20 average tenant. We always talk about the  poorest21 tenant :22 (Audience participation. )2 3	MR.  CASTELLANO:	- - his income,24 his expenses, his misery factor in his  life.25 We've heard a lot of talk  aboutROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 fairness, a lot of talk about leveling  the3 playing field. I would like to make a  suggestion4 before  I make a mot ion, Mr . Chair.5	I would like the Board to  decide6 which is fair . If we talk about the average7 landlord, then let 's talk about the average8 tenant. Let 's contrast those two. Okay?9	And if we are going to talk10 about the poorest tenant , let 's talk about the11 poorest landlord . Let 's set public policy on that12 level.13 (Audience participat ion.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do you have a15 motion?16 MR. CASTELLANO:	Mr. Chair,17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Yes.18 MR. CASTELLANO:	in light of19 these factors, I would like to amend the  language20 of the preliminary  to include  - - regarding  the21 Section A issue	is it? - - of the  increases.22 A one year increase of four 23	percent ;24		A two- year increase of seven 25	percent ;ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167

CASTELLANO:	Yes, sir.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any debate?14 The motion is four percent  for15 one year and seven for a two- year.16 Mr. Carmody would like to make  a17 comment in debate.18 MR. CARMODY:	I would like to19 state some facts that come from the RGB  staff20 reports. This is for the 2002 Price Index  of21 Operating Costs, page  1.22 The core PIOC, which  excludes23 the erratic changes in fuel oil prices,  natural24 gas and electricity costs, is useful  for25 analyzing  inflationary trends.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 The core rose 5.4 percent  this3 year.4 Real estate taxes rose  6.65 percent due mainly to the strong rise  in6 assessments.7 Labor costs rose 4.0  percent ,8 the same increase as last year' s growth.9 Insurance costs grew by  16.510 percent , a significant rise , from the	.7 percent11 the previous year.12 I would just like to make  sure13 that everyone has some idea of the  facts.14 (Audience part icipat ion.)15 A PARTICIPANT:	Open your books.16 MR. CARMODY:	The books are17 opened by the landlords report ing through their18 Income and Expense Reports. We get a report , a19 summary of all of that.20 If you want us to audit  the21 books, we' re not in a position to do that.22 A PARTICIPANT:	Why not?23 (Audience participation.)24 MR.

I23 would like to see a rent rollback for a one  year24 lease of 2.3 percent and for a two- year lease a25 rent rollback decrease of 1  percent.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167

HOLDER:	Andzero for6lofts.7I just also wouldlike to state8 quickly, based upon what my colleague,  David9 Pagan, and I have said earlier, it still  stands.10 I want folks to know that I'm  extremely11 distressed that we still haven' t gone with what  I12 think was proper, which was our first motion  in13 light of what the economic indices tell  us.14 I think it 's misleading when15 folks are talking about what informat ion is16 before this Board. We know when the  information17 comes in what it 's based on.18 What we are talking about is  a19 correct ion for previous years. David Pagan20 outlined quite succinctly what those  increases21 have been for previous years. There is time for  -22 -  there  is a need  for a correction.2 3	In terms of unemployment , I24 think there is a lot of unemployment. There  is25 also underemployment . We should not get those
1742confused.3(Audience part icipation .)4MS. HOLDER:	In my work5 throughout  the City of New York  - -  I work in a6 unit of the Legal Aid Society that is a  citywide7 unit  - what we have  seen as a trend  is that , yes,8 a lot of our clients have gotten jobs, but  they9 have two and three and four jobs for a  household10 and they are still unable to pay their  rent.11 (Audience part icipation.)12 MS . HOLDER :	There is an issue13 of underemployment here in this City  also.14 Affordability	is an issue that15 we cannot miss . And at the same time that folks16 are going to tell us, and that we have  colleagues17 on this Board that are going to tell us  that18 there are public policy issues that the Federal ,19 the State and the local government need to  take20 care of , let us be mindful of the fact that we21 still have a responsibility.22 But what we do look at some  of23 the landlords, whose biggest cost actually  are24 their property taxes, I say to my colleagues  that25 that is a local problem that needs to  beROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 addressed by our local  government.3 (Audience participation.)4	MS. HOLDER:	Why tenants should5 have to pay for that is beyond me .6 Let me insist what our  arguments7 are and what our message is.8 I 'm encouraged  because  there are9 new members on this Board who would like to  see10 us move towards perhaps galvanizing the City  to11 deal with what their responsibil ities will be to12 tenants and to landlords. And I hope that we  will13 be able to do that.14 But for now, tonight , for what15 is before this Board right now, we need a  rent16 decrease of 2.3 percent for one - year leases, 117 percent for two- year and zero for lofts.18 (Audience participation.)19MR.

STAROBIN:No.19CHAIRMAN MARKUS:TheChair20votes no.21The motion fails;  seven/two.22Mr. Castellano, you had a  motion23on the specialguideline.24MR. CASTELLANO:	The special25guideline.
2	For the past few years, Mr.3 Chair, this Board has adopted a formulation  for4 the special guidel ine which is a special case5 where an apartment goes from rent control to   rent6 stabilizat ion .7 This happens to be the 59th  year8 of the Emergency Rent Control Act of 1943 . I'm9 sure we all look forward to its demise  somewhere10 in its tenth generat ion.11 The purpose of the  special12 guideline is to provide guidance to DHCR  in13 resetting that first  rent.14 I have seen numerous  complaints15 from small owners where they set a  reasonable16 first rent , any rent , the tenant  can  challenge17 without expense. DHCR will prosecute.  The18 landlord often needs to hire an attorney  to19 defend himself against the State of New York  for20 a first rent on an apartment that has been  rent21 controlled for fifty- nine years. I find that22 unreasonable.23 (Audience part icipation.)24 MR. CASTELLANO:	I feel that it25 is fair for this Board to provide a safe  harbor.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 And anybody who is an accountant or a lawyer   on3 this Board knows that that means a safe  harbor4 where the owner can pick a number, a rent , that5 is not subject to challenge.6 Therefore, I would like  to7 support that we adopt the same language for  the8 special guideline from last year, which is  the9 appropriate fair market rent for Sect ion 810 apartments as established by HUD annually as  of11 October  1st , or 250 percent  of Maximum  - - or 15012 percent of Maximum Base Rent plus a  fuel13 adjustment ,  whichever  is higher.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Fuel15 adjustment?16 MR . LUBELL :	Adjusted  for gas17 and electric.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me just19 make sure I understand	the motion .20 The motion  - - the draft today21 says 50 percent above the Maximum Base Rent . You22 want to change that to 150 percent  above?23 MR. CASTELLANO:	I want to24 change that to the language we had last year.  In25 that language we had last year is 150 - - it 's   theROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
 2 higher up - 150 percent of the Maximum Base  Rent3 plus fuel adjustments or the appropriate  fair4 market rent for Section 8 housing as  established5 by HUD for New York City PMSA adjusted for  gas6 and electric charges and room size,  whichever7 is - -  room, the number  of bedrooms,  whichever is8 greater.9 (Audience participat ion.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Just to11 clarify, last year was the fuel  adjustment12 language in the13 MR. CASTELLANO:	Yes. Yes, sir.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.15 Could I get a copy of last  year?16 I will read it so that we all clear as to what - 1718 Let me just read it so that  it19 is clear to everybody.20 And you want to leave the21 Maximum Base - you want exactly what it was  last22 year.2 3	MR. CASTELLANO:	Yes, sir.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.25 (1) 150 percent above the24 
2 Maximum Base Rent as existed or would  have3 existed plus the allowable fuel cost adjustment ;4 or5 (2) the Fair Market Rent for6 exist ing housing as established by the United7 States Department of Housing and  Urban8 Development  for the New York City Primary9 Metropolitan	Statistical Area pursuant  to Section10 8 (c)(1) of the United States Housing Act of 1937,11 with such Fair Market Rent to be adjusted  based12 upon whether the tenant pays his or her own  gas13 and/or electric charges as part of his or  her14 rent as such gas and/or electric charges  are15 account ed for by the New York City Housing16 Authority.	Such HUD determined Fair Market  Rents17 will be published	in The Federal Register to  take18 effect on October 1,  2002.19 MR.

RIVERA:	I am going to vote  8 against this amendment specifically because  I9 think that the recent rent deregulations  that10 were promulgated	from Albany, which gave  luxury11 decontrol , together with this part icular Order12 has made it possible , I think, and I see a lot of13 indication of this, that these properties,  which14 would be suitable for middle income, are  being15 classif ied as deregulat ed because of this16 particular item.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And how18 does - -19 (Audience part icipation.)20 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	- - make them21 deregulated?22 MR. RIVERA:	It makes them23 deregulated because of a number of  things.24 First of all , there' s the MCI - 258 
3	MR. RIVERA:	Let me finish. Let4	me finish.5	The MCI , and I 'm told - -	we've6 asked DHCR whet her or not they monitor any7 individual apartment improvements and they  said8 that they don't.

RIVERA:	I don't think I12 need to discuss that .13 MR . CASTELLANO:	You voted for14 it the year before, the year before and the  year15 before .16 MR . RIVERA :	The  argument that17 was given at that part icular time , which made18 some sense, was that it didn't affect  anybody.19 Now it 's taking housing out of rent20 stabilizat ion.21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. CASTELLANO:	Mr. Chair,23 (Audience participation.)24 MR.  CASTELLANO:	- - there are25 different	- -12 
3	MR.  CASTELLANO:	- - factors.4 The Rent Reform Act of 1997  had5 nothing to do with rent controlled apartments .6 And that ' s what this is about. It 's about  rent7 controlled apartments, not rent  stabilized.8	Number two, MCis don't affect9	rent controlled apartments.10	(Audience participation. )11	MR. CASTELLANO:	Number three ,12 these apartments are not being  deregulated13 because if you look at the table of rents  from14 Section 8 they are nowhere near $2000 a  month.15 You' re looking at a nine - bedroom apartment .16 MR. LUBELL:	I call the17 quest ion, Mr . Chairman.18 MS. HOLDER:	Well , I have19 some - -  I want  to be recognized by the  Chair.20 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS :	Go ahead.21 MR. RIVERA:	I want to go on22 further because I am hearing that there is  no23 impact that is being made here.24 And I just wanted to give  you25 the information that DHCR gave us, that  we
2 requested , by the way.3 At first they told us that  there4 was 18,000 apartments that had been regulated   as5 a result of the luxury  decontrol.6	MR. LUBELL:	What does this7	have to do with it?8	MR. RIVERA:	Then we were told9 recently now that it 's 14,000, and we got  a10 figure from another study that said it  was11	80 , 000.12 We' re in a murky world here  - -13 MR. CASTELLANO:	Did you get14 that study?15 MR. RIVERA:	We' re in a murky16 world here about knowing what the impact of   this17 regulation is on these properties.18 And I think we have to know  what19 this impact is before we give 150   percent.20 MR. CASTELLANO:	Mr. Rivera, do21 you have a copy of that study? I would like   to22 know - -23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. RIVERA:	I'm saying - -25 MR. CASTELLANO:	I would like -
23 (Audience participat ion. )4 MR . CASTELLANO:	- - to know5	where the study is that said - -  I saw a   newspaper6	report. But  you used  the word  II  study. 11	I would7 like to know where is the study that said 80 , 0008 apartments have been deregulated.  Please ident ify9	it .10	(Audience participation. )11	MR. RIVERA:	Test imony from12 there was test imony at our hearing to that13 ef fect.14 MR. CASTELLANO:	They are15 claims. They're claims.16 MR. RIVERA:	Yes. And there have17 been claims on both sides.18 MR. CASTELLANO:	You said19 study.20 MR. RIVERA:	We do not know21 (Audience participation. )22 MR. RIVERA:	We do not know what23 the figure is. We are at the point where we' re24 not gett ing the information.25 (Audience participation.)
2	MR. LUBELL:	They are going so3 far afield that  - - we are going so far af ield  and4 we are entering into areas that have no  bearing,5 no bearing on the amendment .6 I call the question .7	MS. HOLDER :	I would like to be8	recognized at some point .9	MR. LUBELL:	Let 's move on it .10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms . Holder .11	MS. HOLDER:	I'm the only woman12 on the Board and I would like to be  heard.13 A PARTICIPANT:	Come on!14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder,16 there' s no need to play that card or any other17 card.18 (Audience part icipat ion. )19 MS. HOLDER:	What  I think is - 2021	(Audience participation.)2 2	MS. HOLDER :	What I think is23 relevant is what is the mandat e of the Board.24 It is true it is a murky world25 out there to figure out how many apartments  are
1	892 out there, but one apartment taken out of  rent3 regulat ion is too many.4 (Audience participat ion. )5 MS. HOLDER:	What I understand6 and what we understand is going on when  these7 apartments are taken out is that they are  taken8 off the market beyond the fair market rent  appeal9 stage. It's a point of no  return.10 And until we have more data,  I11 think it would be irresponsibl e for this Board.12 This Board is mandated to try and deal with   these13 issues of affordability,  to deal with these14 issues of protect ing New Yorkers in this real15 t ight housing market.16 I can't understand why we would17 think that at this time - -  if people want   to18 reconsider what is going on as opposed to  what19 they may have done years and years ago, I  think20 the conditions that we have before us now and  the21 facts before us now, why don' t we go ahead and22 vot e against this proposed amendment of 15023 percent.24 (Audience participat ion. )25 MR .

HOLDER :	I have another8 motion.9 I still would like to go back  to10 discussing the apartment and loft  renewals.11 Can we go back to that?12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.13 MS. HOLDER:	I have a motion of14 zero percent	for a one- year lease;15 Zero percent for a two-year16 lease;17 And zero percent lofts, one  and18 two years.19 (Audience part icipation .)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there a21 second?22 MR. PAGAN:	Yes.23 MS . HOLDER:	I would welcome24 this Board to consider at the very least a  rent25 freeze if we cannot make the correct ion of a rent8 
2rollback.3Atthe very least this year4tenants deserveatleast a correction of a rent5freeze.6Wecome back every year. And if7 there is a correct ion to be made, it 's supposed8 to be made in a year that we have with the  data9 that we have before us . A correct ion is supposed10 to be made this year.11 I would ask at the very least12 that we have a rent freeze.13 Thank you.14 MR. PAGAN:	I second.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The motion to16 amend the language is to change the two and  four17 to zero, zero, and to change the loft numbers  to18 zero, zero.19 Is that correct?20 MS. HOLDER:	Yes.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.22 Mr. Rubenstein?23 MR. RUBENSTEIN:	I would like24 to tell you why I 'm going to vote against this25 amendment .
1	932	(Audience participation.)3	MR. RUBENSTEIN:	I heard4 testimony about net income from the Income  and5 Expense forms. I think it 's important to look6 within that especially when we look at  core7 Manhattan and compare it to what 's happening in8 the rest of the City.9 In core Manhattan  it ' s true net10 income was up. According to the studies that  the11	staff did in the boroughs, it was down. So it 's12 already starting to  shrink.13 I think it 's a very troublesome14 sign for the industry as a whole as we look  at15 the core price index climbing.16 For those reasons I will  vote17 against the zero.18 (Audience participation. )19CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Call the20question.21The vote is zero across  the22board.23Mr. Carmody?24MR.

2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.3	MR. CASTELLANO:	My primary4 concern is that the landlords, especially  the5 small landlords have  limited  resources  - -6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you7 yield to me? Let me make a mot ion on the special8 guideline.9 I would like to make a mot ion10 that it would read the permissible	increase for11 decontrolled units as referred in Order 3a  which12 become decontrolled after September 3 0, 2002,13 shall be:14 50 percent above the Maximum15 Base Rent as it existed or would have existed , or16 50 percent above the Maximum17 Coll ect ible Rent as actually  - - 50 percent above18 the Maximum Base Rent as it existed or would  have19 existed, because putting in the  Maximum20 Collectible Rent is a moot point because I'm  not21 aware of any situation where  that , in fact ,  could22 be higher than the Maximum Base Rent . And it says23 whichever  is greater; so whichever is greater.24 And then include from your earlier amendment  the25 fair market rent language which I will  read.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2	The Fair Market  Rent - -3	(2) The Fair Market Rent for4 existing housing as established by the U. S.5 Department of Housing and Urban Development  for6 the New York City Primary Metropolit an7 Statist ical Area pursuant to Section 8 (c)(1) of8 the United  States Housing  Act of	' 3 7, which such9 fair market rents would be adjusted based  upon10 whether the tenant pays his or her own gas  and/or11 electric charges as part of his or her rent  as12 such charge and/or electric charges are  accounted13 for by the New York City Housing Authority.  Such14 HUD determined fair market rents will  be15 published	in The Federal Register to take  effect16 on October 1, 2002.17 Do I have a second to that?  This18 is the special guideline.19 Let me make sure we - -  the20 special  guideline	- -21 (Audience participation.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.23 The above language is the24 special guideline of so- called decontroll ed25 units.

RIVERA:	I - -11CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.12 Sorry. Mr. Rivera, go ahead.13 MR. RIVERA:	I'm not even sure14 how relevant the fifty percent is given the  fact15 that we had testimony that the DHCR, in fact ,16 chooses the highest rest within the  building.17 So I 'm not sure whether or not ,18 if we do fifty percent , forty percent , a  hundred19 and fifty percent , but  I see adding this to   it20 just adds another higher figure than that  fifty21 percent.22 The argument is still the same,23 that we do not have enough information, we  have24 not been given enough information and , therefore,25 I 'm going to vote against this.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2	(Audience participat ion. )3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder.4 MS . HOLDER :	The HUD  fair5 market rent is just too high a figure. And so  I6 agree with everything that my colleague, Mr .7 Rivera, has said. It ' s - by placing  that in  there8 and not striking that , it 's going to just - -  it9 just increases the amount and it ' s going to   take10 that apartment again off the market.11 The HUD fair market rents  that12 come out through The Federal Register  are13 extremely high for a lot of the neighborhoods  in14 which they are placed and it 's not a good15 indicator of what should be used to  calculate.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well , I would17 say I think that ' s a very  interesting argument18 because, in fact , most of the Legal Aid Societ ies19 around the United  States including  - -  sue HUD20 because they think it 's too low because  it ' s21 insuff icient for their clients who, in fact , they22 view this.2 3	So I do not agree with that.24 That 's not the fact. And  I 'm sure your Section  825 clients would not agree with that  particular
