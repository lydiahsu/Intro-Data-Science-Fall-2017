MR. WENK:	Present.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Wenk isChair is present.All board members are present.	WeThe final vote will take place  on
9 June 20 th starting at 5 : 30 p. m.	It will be held in10 the Great Hall at Cooper Union, 7 East 7 th  Street,11 the corner of Third Avenue in  Manhattan.12 Directions to the final vote can13 be found on our website, nycrgb. org in the " About14 Us" section meeting schedule.15 To board members, please note that16 there are drafts of both the hotel and  apartment17 explanatory statements in your folders.	We request18 that your comments or suggested additions to  the19 statements be received no later than June 19 th.20 Revised drafts will be sent to you via e- mail on21 Monday, June 17 th, reflecting additions resulting22 from today' s hearing.	Any questions, please see23 Andrew.24 Before we begin our hearing,  I25 would like to read some of the rules and  parameters9 
2 for those who are testifying before the  board.3 I believe all speakers have4 received a copy of the  rules.5 Each speaker will have three6 minutes to give his or  her testimony.	In the event7 that large numbers of people wish to speak,  I8 reserve the right to reduce the allotted  speaking9 time.	The clock, which is right in front,  will10 beep once when the speaker has 30 seconds left  to11 speak.12 Speakers must confirm their13 presence with the RGB staff at the  registration14 table located near the entrance to this  Hall.15 Speakers will not be called if they have  not16 checked in at the registration  table.17 I' ll try to call several names in18 advance.	If your name is called, it is  advisable19 that you move towards the front row.	If you have20 materials to distribute to the board, you  should21 give them to the RGB staff sitting at the sign- in22 table near the entrance.	And I ask you to  please23 try to stay within your allotted time so that  we24 can get through as many speakers as  possible.25 With that in mind, our  first2 
2 speaker, Anita Romm.3 Anita, welcome.4 MS. ROMM:	Oh, good morning.5 My name is Anita Romm.	I am the6 songwriter for the Metropolitan Council on  Housing.7 I' m speaking to you on behalf of8 an endangered species, rent stabilized tenants.9 Over the years, apartments have gone out of  rent10 regulation, not only causing the rents to  become11 unaffordable but taking away protections against12 arbitrary and capricious evictions.	No wonder we13 have so much homelessness.14 According to the Income and15 Affordability Study, the median gross rent  to16 income ratio has increased for the  fourth17 consecutive year.	Since people are paying18 ridiculous percentages of their income on  rent,19 they can spend less on goods and services  so20 businesses are more likely to fail, which  will21 increase the amount of unemployment  and22 homelessness.23 Landlords' net operating income24 increased by 5 . 6 percent for the second consecutive25 year according to the Income  Expense Study.	And2 
2 according to Bobbie Sackman of the Council  of3 Senior Services, homelessness is increasing among4 the elderly and one- third of seniors have food5 insecurity.6 Our seniors, who have worked so7 hard to build up our community, deserve  better.8 But half of them are -- are so proud or   so9 intimidated by the application process that  they10 haven' t applied for SCRIE or food stamps.11 Over the years, you have granted12 rent increases much higher than necessary, even  in13 years such as 2002 when there should have been  a14 rollback.	It is in your power to right this  wrong15 and give us a rent freeze now - Laissez faire   mon16 derriere.17 ( Singing.) Where have affordable18 apartments gone?	Long time passing.	Where have19 affordable apartments gone?	Long time ago.	Where20 affordable apartments gone?	Up to market rents one21 by one.	When will you ever learn?	When will you22 ever learn?	Where will working people live?	Long23 time passing.	Where will working people live?24 Where can they go?	They will end up on  the25 street.	Big increases they can' t meet.	When will2 
2 you ever learn?	When will you ever learn?3 ( Applause.)4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,5 Anita.6 The next speaker will be James7 Anderson.8 Who will be followed by  William9 Stanford.10 Who will be followed by  Patrick11 Siconolfi.12 MR. ANDERSON:	Good morning.13 I am here to bring facts,  evidence14 and proof.	I cannot sing here.	Because singing15 against the rule.	You must to stop singer  anybody16 who do not concern the problem, just kill the  time.17 The biggest problem that tax can18 never coming down.	Never.	City, state and federal19 government offices fill up with parasites  in20 different people with big salary.	So they cost too21 much for -- for us to pay tax to them in any --   any22 ticket to the City.23 You probably don' t know that we24 have 45 departments in the City.	We don' t need 45 .25 United States, all the country, 312 million  people2 
2 has 16 departments.	New York City, 8 million  and3 400 people has 25 .4 Commissioner received $ 200 , 000 and5 something more.	They don' t work.	They' re against6 the City.	They are liberals, old people, most7 crack head anyway.	Nobody don' t want to straighten8 this problem.9 So about the real estate business,10 only the landlord -- many jail in super must to   be11 -- City has to take care for the building  and12 tenants to be nice to keep it clean and to pay   in13 the time, even a little late,  no problem.	Nobody14 else of -- Albany or  no --	Albany small city, fill15 up with criminals.16 We are here before Joseph Bruno17 and Sheldon Silver and they cheating -- one of  them18 cheating the landlords and Small  Business19 Administration and other tenants.	They don' t know20 -- they don' t do nothing - political gangsters.21 Governors and mayors when they22 step into office, they dreaming and declare  they23 run for president, vice president, state  secretary.24 They no -- they no good for the City how yet to   be25 good for the federal government?	That no can2 

2	happen.3
So let' s see that -- that you make
4 right decision because of this corner two  people5 probably incompetent, declare that expenses is6 zero.	Expenses become zero when men go  in7 cemetery.	That' s completely zero.	Place for a8 re- election silence.9 So what we should do now, you  make10 right decision to raise; how much, that' s up to  you11 anyway.	Mayor appointed you.	Mayor don' t care12 nothing.	He' s one -- a rich bum.	A re- election13 make money in stock market.	City Councils have14 different ethnic groups.	Got no -- they definitely15 don' t care.16 So problems -- everybody must  to17 know definitely.	Landlord and his people who take18 care for the building and  the tenant.	And we go in19 the court, even the judge go by  the court.	It' s so20 easy when majority of judges  against landlord.	So21 big deal.22 Anyway.	Any question or you23 continue to discriminate to me?24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Any questions?25 ( No response.)4 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Hearing none,3 thank you, Mr. Anderson.4 MR. ANDERSON:	Oh, yeah.	Reject5 me -- you -- you great -- you great at   rejecting.6 You rejected the men who present the  landlords.7 You don' t reject the wrong people who present the8 tenant.	Continue to be more be more rejected  until9 we become the biggest rejecter in the  universe.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Anderson,11 thank you.12 MR. ANDERSON:	Bye- bye.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Bye- bye.14 MR. ANDERSON:	Have a nice day15 and nice night.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You too.17 William Sanford.18 MR. SANFORD:	The name is Mr. X!19 You need to stop increasing the20 rents because jobs are getting cut.	Okay.	Raises21 -- no one' s getting a raise.	Okay.	They' re still22 earning the same salary.	Okay.	They' re not making23 more.24 The rich are getting richer.	The25 poor are getting poorer.	And what are yous doing?2 
2 You' re still increasing rents.	Even though some of3 these building owners, landlords and tenant --  and4 superintendents don' t make the necessary repairs to5 give tenants a safe place  to live.	That' s6 unacceptable.7 You don' t check their records.8 You side with them and you say, well, we' re  going9 to increase the rents.	That' s not why the RGB was10 created.	It was created to help those who  have11 rent paying problems.	In 1969 , the same year the12 Mets won the World Series, but apparently  you13 forgot that.14 So are you more concerned about15 helping us pay our rent in a timely matter to   avoid16 late fees and eviction or are you just  more17 concerned about jacking up the prices,  like18 Cablevision?19 The problem is you think the  world20 evolves around you.	The world doesn' t evolve21 around you.	It never did.	You should put a  freeze22 on rents until further notice.	Because year after23 year, I' ve been here the last six or seven years24 and tenants have told you how they were living,  the25 poor conditions.	Yet you increase the rent.2 
2 There' s no excuse for that.3 And another thing, there' s also no4 excuse for the two board members on my left  how5 they treated Adrienne Holder over the years  either.6 They treated her like a  stereotype.7 I guess you -- maybe that' s why8 she retired.	She got tired of Mr. and Mrs.  Stephen9 Schleider treating her like a stereotype,  almost10 like J. J. from Good Times.	And you, as a Chair  let11 that happen.	Your predecessor let it happen.12 Disagreeing with each other is one13 thing but mistreating each other, abusing  each14 other is another.	There' s no excuse for that.15 There' s no -- there' s no time or place -- there' s16 no excuse for stereotype profiling.	And that' s17 what I see on this board over the last seven   years,18 stereotype profiling.	There' s no excuse for that.19 You could disagree if you want  but20 let' s, you know, treat -- you know, treat people21 how you want them to treat  you.22 And as far as the rents  go,23 there' s no need to increase any more rents.	That' s24 not why the RGB was created and you  know that.	But25 you don' t care.	Dealing with you is like dealing2 

2	with the MTA.3
And, also, another thing, if  you
4 hold events here, you need to tell these  guards,5 this way, they don' t hassle us.	I encountered four6 of them today -- before I checked in, before  I7 entered the bathroom -- there' s no excuse for that.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Sanford,9 draw to a close.10 MR. STANFORD:	You need to get it11 together or throw in the towel like we did for   Bob12 Backlund in Madison Square Garden in 1983 .13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.14 MR. STANFORD:	Get it together.15 ( Applause.)16 MR. STANFORD:	Or get the hell17 out of 51 Chambers Street.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Patrick19 Siconolfi.20 MR. SICONOLFI:	Good morning.21 I' m Pat Siconolfi, Executive22 Director of the Community Housing Improvement23 Program.24 I promise you my testimony will  be25 quite dull.	The -- the CHIP represents 2 , 7004 
2 building owners in the City and they own  between3 them about 300 , 000 units of housing.4 The first point we' d like to make5 is that it' s crucial that the RGB reconstitutes the6 PIOC.	It' s severely outdated and accounts for7 almost none of the increase in  governmental8 mandates over the last 40  years.9 A partial listing of items  not10 recognized in the PIOC, includes 32 new  mandates.11 Accordingly, the PIOC only recognizes a small --  a12 portion of the actual costs associated  with13 building operation and maintenance.14 Next, the income expense --  the15 Income and Expense Analysis is fundamentally  in16 error.	And I' ve pointed this out before.	While it17 recognizes capital expenses, it does not  recognize18 -- I' m sorry, while it recognizes capital revenues,19 it does not recognize capital expenses.	This is20 unbalanced and creates a severe misstatement  of21 building finances.	Revenues are overstated and22 expenses are understated.23 And what that does is, it  makes24 the buildings look like they' re more profitable.25 Either you include both capital revenue and  capital2 
2 expenses or you exclude both to get a fair  picture.3 But the current -- the current4 report gets it wrong.	And, therefore, net5 operating income is wrong.	A better indicator6 would be net operating income after  capital7 expenses and taxes.	This is because neither of8 those items is discretionary.	Capital income --9 capital expenses are not discretionary.	It' s an10 intrinsic part of the cost of providing a unit  of11 housing.	And taxes are famously not  discretionary.12 So that' s what you need to -- to be looking at,  is13 the net income after capital expenses and  taxes.14 Also, the RGB is reporting15 prejudicial numbers by accounting for tax  subsidies16 for owners but ignoring rent subsidies to  tenants.17 Either both subsidies should be reported or  both18 should be ignored.	Tax subsidies to owners have19 the effect of lowering costs associated  with20 operating of the building and it makes them  appear21 more profitable.22 Recording tax -- rent subsidies to23 tenants lower the rent burden and, actually, it' s a24 very, you know, it' s a very prejudicial way because25 there are programs that help tenants with the  rent2 

2	burden.3
The last thing I would say is  that
4 owners need a low rent supplement.	Outside of core5 Manhattan, legal rents typically fail to  cover6 expenses.	The biggest expenses is payments to  the7 City of New York and -- and there' s essentially  no8 discretionary expenses in providing a unit of  rent9 stabilized housing.10 So I' m almost out of time.11 The new guideline that we' re12 recommending is 7 for a one- year, 11 for a  two13 year.	And the low rent supplement of $ 70 and $ 11014 for apartments under $ 1 , 000 .15 Thank you.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Got it in under17 the wire.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Question.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for21 your testimony.22 MR. SICONOLFI:	Sure.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You made mention24 of a few items that have been brought up during   the25 deliberations this -- this season.	And on the PIOC4 
2 we had many discussions about the inadequacies  and3 inequities of the -- the items that aren' t being4 reported.	And you made mention of 32 items  --5 MR. SICONOLFI:	Yes.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- that are7 mandated expenses that aren' t captured in the PIOC.8 But, overall, the PIOC showed that9 operating expenses for rent stabilized buildings10 increased almost 6 percent.11 MR. SICONOLFI:	Right.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You don' t have an13 issue with that other than that it' s under14 reported?15 MR. SICONOLFI:	Well, it' s 616 percent.	That part you know is real.	But then you17 ignore the additional stuff which is these  items18 that I' m referring to.	So that if you were  to19 count them all, it would be a much  different20 picture.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	About how much22 higher than 6 percent would you  --23 MR. SICONOLFI:	Well, you know,24 that' s -- that' s something that we could work on.25 But it would certainly be greatly in excess and  it2 
2 would certainly be in the area of 10  percent.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Um- hum.	All4 right.5 Thank you.6 Now on the capital revenue, you' re7 speaking of the MCI increases --8 MR. SICONOLFI:	MCIs and9 individual apartment improvements.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- and that the11 expenses necessary to -- to secure the  MCI12 increases, those capital expenses aren' t recorded13 in -- or reported or captured in the  PIOC?14 MR. SICONOLFI:	That is correct.15 And that is prejudicial because they' re not16 discretionary and that' s the thing we want the17 board to understand.18 Those expenses are not19 discretionary.	They must be paid.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.21 MR. SICONOLFI:	You' re welcome.22 MR. EPSTEIN:	Mr. Chair, may I?23 I have a question.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Epstein.25 MR. EPSTEIN:	I' m just not clear2 
2 with what you' re saying.	You' re saying owners of3 rent stabilized buildings -- buildings with  rent4 stabilized apartments are not making profits in  New5 York City?6 MR. SICONOLFI:	Well, some of7 them clearly are not.8 MR. EPSTEIN:	So some of them9 are, you' re saying?10 MR. SICONOLFI:	Some of them11 clearly are not is what I' m saying.	And what I' m12 saying --13 MR. EPSTEIN:	But some of them --14 MR. SICONOLFI:	Just let me15 finish.	Okay.16 You see, right now the way --  the17 way the expenditure profile typically works,  is18 that you' re looking at certain very narrowly19 defined operating expenses.	And you' re not even20 looking at all of them.	Okay.21 So if you were to take the --  the22 ones that you recognize, plus the real ones  that23 you don' t recognize, plus the non- discretionary24 costs, which owners must invest and they' re25 required by law to invest, which are the  capital2 
2 expenses and then certain additional tax  expenses,3 if you put all those numbers together, you will  not4 -- you will see a very different profit  picture5 than what you' re seeing in the reports that -- that6 are issued by the board.7 MR. EPSTEIN:	And to my question,8you' re saying no owners are making profits?9MR. SICONOLFI:	I didn' t say --I10didn' t say that.11MR. EPSTEIN:	So answer my12question --13MR. SICONOLFI:	We' re not14saying --15MR. EPSTEIN:	So you' re saying16they are making profits?17MR. SICONOLFI:	When you say18" they," you' re not defining they.	They is a very19broad topic.	Now if you' re -- and I' m compelled to20give you a precise answer.	Some are.	Very many21are not.22And the point that I' m making23here, which your question sort of leaves aside,  the24point that I am making in my testimony, is   that25when you look at the real numbers, very many  more
2 than you report are not making a  profit.3 MR. EPSTEIN:	So you are saying4 some are making profits?5 MR. SICONOLFI:	I' m saying very6 many more are not.7 MR. EPSTEIN:	Okay.	So some are8 making profits --9 MR. SICONOLFI:	You are saying --10 MR. EPSTEIN:	I' m asking a11 question.	I' ll finish.	I let you finish. Okay?12 MR. SICONOLFI:	Right.13 Please.14 MR. EPSTEIN:	So some are making15 profits.	Are some making profits who have16 unregulated units in a building that was --  was17 historically rent regulated?18 MR. SICONOLFI:	Well, that -- I' m19 so glad you asked that question because I think  the20 -- I think what' s behind that is -- and I wish  the21 board would follow me on  this one.	Because I think22 what' s behind that question is your thought, and23 you can correct me if I' m wrong, but your  thought24 is that unregulated apartments in a given  building25 can help subsidize the regulated  apartments.2 
2 I' m not sure if that' s where3 you' re going.	But that' s -- sometimes where I' ve4 heard that line of reasoning going.	And if that' s5 the case, then what that means is that you  would6 seek to -- and you' ll correct me if I' m wrong, but7 you would seek to confiscate some of the  revenue8 from apartments over which you and the  Rent9 Stabilization Law have no authority.	You would10 seek to confiscate some of that revenue to  operate11 rent stabilized apartments.12 ( Applause.)13 MR. SICONOLFI:	Now if that' s14 what you' re suggesting, you don' t have the15 authority to do that.	But I' m not sure if that' s16 what you' re suggesting.17 MR. EPSTEIN:	So are you saying18 that buildings that have unregulated units in  them19 are not making profits?20 MR. SICONOLFI:	Some may and some21 many not.	And your, you know, you know that  --22 MR. EPSTEIN:	So my next question23 is --24 MR. SICONOLFI:	-- my answer' s25 not done.2 
2 You know that there are 18 , 000 or3 so rent stabilized buildings in  the City.	And4 depending on so many things in their profile,  the5 answer to your question, which is a very  valid6 question, but the answer to your question will  vary7 quite a big from scenario to  scenario.8 MR. EPSTEIN:	Would you say that9 buildings that have more are a great percentage  on10 regulated units than could potentially be  making11 more profit, the ones that have fewer  unregulated12 units?13 MR. SICONOLFI:	And my answer to14 you is that that question is outside your  legal15 purview because you' re attempting to confiscate16 that -- I' m thinking, this is what I' m reading into17 your question, is that that revenue is  somehow18 yours to subsidize the other apartments with.  And19 the law never gives you that  authority.20 MR. EPSTEIN:	So the answer is,21 yes, they make more profit; right?22 MR. SICONOLFI:	No.	The answer23 is not.	The answer is the answer I gave  you.24 MR. EPSTEIN:	The answer is, they25 make more profit.2 
2 MR. SICONOLFI:	No.	The answer3 is the answer I gave  you.4 MR. EPSTEIN:	Okay.	Thanks.5 MR. SICONOLFI:	Okay.6 ( Applause.)7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Schleider.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Pat -- Pat.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	There' s another11 question.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Maybe I can clear13 something up.	I know with the acoustics in  here,14 I' m having difficulty following some of the15 conversation.16 But I know that in our  empowering17 documentation, it says that we don' t consider18 profit because profit cannot uniformly defined19 across the spectrum of rent stabilized  properties.20 So by introducing profit into this discussion is  --21 is inflammatory, at best.	And there is no way  to22 do it.23 The other thing is about, you' re24 saying that some landlords are making  profit.25 Obviously, some are making profits.	Some are not,2 

2	as you say.34
MR. SICONOLFI:	Yes, I said that. MR. SCHLEIDER:	The -- the other
5 hand is that there are some tenants who can' t  pay6 rent and there are lots of tenants who can  pay7 rent --8 MR. SICONOLFI:	Correct.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- and can pay the10 increase.	So I don' t see where this argument or11 this discussion line serves any purpose for  these12 meetings.13 Thank you.14 MR. SICONOLFI:	Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.16 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. SICONOLFI.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz.18 MS. CRUZ:	I have one --19 MR. SICONOLFI:	Yes.20 MS. CRUZ:	I have one question21 just to follow up from the -- the point,  perhaps,22 that Mr. Epstein was making.23 MR. SICONOLFI:	Yes.24 MS. CRUZ:	Going back to25 deregulated apartments and how that impacts  the5 
2 finances of a building.3 MR. SICONOLFI:	Yes.4 MS. CRUZ:	Your membership5 constitutes, you said about 27  --6 MR. SICONOLFI:	Twenty- seven7 hundred building owners.8 MS. CRUZ:	Twenty- seven hundred9 buildings.	And in 2009 the decision by the  Court10 of Appeals in Roberts vs. Tishman- Speyers, held11 that unit owners -- owners across the City that  had12 deregulated apartments for over 15 years could  now13 not deregulate apartments if they received J- 51 tax14 benefits.15 ( Applause.)16 MR. SICONOLFI:	Correct.17 MS. CRUZ:	Is that correct?18 MR. SICONOLFI:	Correct.19 MS. CRUZ:	Could you -- could you20 tell me how that impacted, that decision  impacted21 your membership?	How many deregulated units, in22 fact, now are re- regulated again?23 MR. SICONOLFI:	Well, it' s --24 MS. CRUZ:	Roughly.	I don' t want25 -- obviously, you don' t know the precise numbers.2 
2 MR. SICONOLFI:	Right.3 MS. CRUZ:	But can you just4 describe for the board how that decision  --5 MR. SICONOLFI:	Sure.6 MS. CRUZ:	-- impacted your7 membership?8 MR. SICONOLFI:	Sure.	It' s --9 it' s an excellent question.	I think it does bear10 on what Harvey was asking.11 I guess the -- we don' t have an12 exact number but based on what we can see among  our13 members, you know, we would guess that some tens  of14 thousands of units were --15 MS. CRUZ:	Tens of thousands of16 units?	Okay.17 MR. SICONOLFI:	Yes, yes.	Were18 re- regulated and put back into the system.	And19 then the question, of course, became -- and by  the20 way, the thing I would emphasize about that is  that21 those were people who were paying, you know,  who22 had signed on, rented the apartment paying,  you23 know, very high rents.24 MS. CRUZ:	That' s right.25 MR. SICONOLFI:	So these were not2 

2	the people -- 3
MS. CRUZ:	So these are -- these
4 are impacted tenants who had rented  apartments5 believing they could afford the market rents.	So6 we' re talking about higher income tenants that were7 affected; correct?8 MR. SICONOLFI:	Yes, yes.	That' s9 the irony of it.	It was high income tenants who10 were protected.	And the people who are -- who  have11 been speaking here with some very valid concerns  on12 the tenant' s side, they' re not helped by this.13 It' s a very -- it' s a very ironic decision.14 And then so, of course, then  the15 down stream problem that -- that the owners had  is,16 okay, so now what' s the rent?	And, of course, the17 -- you know, the various owners and various  tenants18 have gone to court attempting to seek  some19 clarification about what that rent is.	And the20 court has said, it' s this.21 MS. CRUZ:	Yeah.22 MR. SICONOLFI:	So, you know,23 we' re in a -- we' re in a -- and, by the way,  new24 regs that the Housing Department, the Division  of25 Housing has proposed, don' t -- they don' t address4 
2 it.	They just -- they took a -- they took    a pass.3 MS. CRUZ:	Um- hum.4 MR. SICONOLFI:	So who knows is5 part of the answer.6 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.7 MR. SICONOLFI:	Okay.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Pat.9 Larry Wood.10 Who will be followed by  Robert11 Rosenberg.12 Who will be followed by  Nicole13 Zanardi.14 I won' t take that off your time,15 Larry.16 MR. WOOD:	Okay.17 Well, once again, as I  do18 traditionally, I want to thank each and  every19 member for their service.20 It' s -- I know this is largely a21 thankless task and you have to work within  certain22 parameters which make it difficult, but  not23 impossible, to differentiate about, you know,  the24 economics in the buildings.25 I' m a little fascinated about the2 
2 notion that profits don' t matter when it came to3 arguing that some buildings were unprofitable  and4 needed that supplemental increase, certainly the5 landlords felt it was perfectly reasonable  to6 differentiate and give a much higher increase  for7 tenants in low rent apartments.8 But somehow when we want to9 consider high rent or market rate apartments  and10 their impact on the building, all of a sudden  it' s11 off base.12 So, I think, you have a lot  more13 power than you think in terms of  differentiating14 among the -- the different economics in  the15 buildings out there.16 So, again, the tenant reps, I  want17 to thank you for your service.	The five public18 members, I really want -- particularly want  to19 address Tanya and Carol.	You replaced Guideline20 board members who had traditionally voted zero  for21 SROs in the past, across  the board.	I hope you can22 keep that tradition up.23 Tanya, I know in the  preliminary24 vote you didn' t vote on zero.	You abstained.	So25 in my mind you' re open to the concept.	So I hope2 
2 you really listen to the  presentations,3 particularly, the tenants who testify later  because4 I think all the information we have and  present5 before you will lead credence to the notion that  it6 should be zero across the board.7 And even Steven and Magda, I  want8 to thank you for when you have proposed  guidelines,9 you' ve always wanted an increase for SROs.	You10 have seen the wisdom of the provisos and how it   can11 differentiate.	I just hope you could expand  that12 concept to apartment buildings as well because I  do13 think it' s warranted at this point.14 And, Jonathan, you know, last  year15 when you proposed a guideline, you made  a16 particular point that what broke the camel' s back17 and what convinced enough public members to  vote18 for the zero, was the testimony of the  tenants.19 And it meant a lot to the tenants who did come   and20 testify because often they believe the fix is  in21 and nothing they say matters.	But I do know you' re22 listening and trying to make a determination on  a23 very difficult -- a very difficult  decision.24 But, please listen again this  year25 and hopefully we can, you know, our ask is  zero2 
2 across the board.	We believe that the proviso --3 the memos that have been produced by the  board4 demonstrate that over half the buildings and  units5 would not qualify for the increase because of  the6 high numbers of deregulated units and  warehousing.7 And on top of that, the memos  also8 show the mean and median rents for the  rent9 stabilized units.	They subtract out the exempts10 and the vacant units but if you look at the   mean11 and median rents, they are  sky high.	They approach12 upward -- exceed apartment rents in some  instances.13 And we' re talking about units that are a fraction14 of the size of an  apartment.15 They' re the most profitable units16 on a square- foot basis in terms of income.	And17 they' re the cheapest to run on a square- foot basis.18 And you really have to bear that in  mind.19 The -- the --20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You' ve got to21 wrap up, Larry.22 MR. WOOD:	Well, I' d like to23 expound on the memos.	If there' s any questions, I24 could do that.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Any questions?2 
2 Harvey.3 MR. EPSTEIN:	Hey, Larry, can you4 explain how the provisos might apply to  rent5 stabilized apartments not just the SROs?6 MR. WOOD:	Sure.	The provisos in7 the case of apartments, I mean in the case of   SROS,8 actually, go back 25 years.	They were first9 instituted around the warehousing when many  owners10 were trying to empty rooming houses and  hotels.11 And we made the argument that if the  landlord12 needed to maximize his rental income and needed  an13 increase, they should rent out the empty  units14 first before they asked for a rent increase of  the15 remaining tenants.16 And the Rent Guidelines Board17 understood that and it became a tool.	And it' s18 been, you know, renewed over the years.	Then as19 the City and other institutions started turning  to20 SROs and using them for  other means.	So when units21 got deregulated and they were rented to tourists  or22 they were -- you know, rented to tourists  at23 exorbitant rates or rented to City programs  to24 house homeless families or the special  needs25 populations, those owners were getting huge  rental2 
2 income from those non- rent stabilized uses.3 So, again, the percentages have4 changed.	It started, you know, closer to  405 percent or more deregulated a landlord would  not6 get an increase.	And I think a similar thing  could7 be argued for apartments.	Certainly, if a landlord8 has a half a building -- there were some  landlords9 last year that testified half their building  empty10 but they were crying that they needed a  rent11 increase.	You know, they should rent up  the12 building first.13 And, I think, despite the14 testimony of the prior person, they said, you  know,15 the deregulated units somehow we were  confiscating16 profit.	You need to look at the rate of return  on17 the building, each and every unit.	And, again, if18 they' re going to make the argument that, you know,19 that buildings have a lot of low rent  apartment20 somehow need a supplemental increase, the flip  side21 of this is buildings that have  significant22 deregulated units are making a great rate  of23 return.24 And I -- I think, strongly, it' s25 something you should look at to differentiate  among2 
2 the different economics in the buildings out  there.3 So I think it can  apply.4 MR. EPSTEIN:	So you would say at5 some percentage if it' s not 60 percent rent6 stabilized or 50 percent not rent stabilized,  then7 there would be a proviso in effect; is that  what8 you' re suggesting?9 MR. WOOD:	Well, that' s up to you10 guys to propose that.11 And I think it would be a  smart12 move to do some research similar to what was  done13 with the SROs.	If you did a proviso for  apartments14 and said, 30 percent or more deregulated,  that15 owner is presumably making a great rate of  return,16 therefore, zero or low increase for that  building.17 You can do some research to  see18 well, where would that have an impact?	Is that19 just Manhattan, the central core?	How much -- how20 many deregulated units exist in other parts of  the21 City?	What are the mean and median rents in  those22 kinds of buildings?	It' s -- it' s a huge database23 but, presumably, you could do some research  and24 then make an informed choice about  this.25 Because it' s a lot of conjecture2 
2 now about it would impact, you know, the  notion3 that the landlords are not making profits or  that4 significant numbers of landlords are not making  a5 good rate of return, it' s just conjecture.	We --6 we need some data to help you guys make an   informed7 decision.8 MR. EPSTEIN:	Thank you.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,10 Larry.11 MR. WOOD:	Thank you.12 ( Applause.)13 MR. CHEIGH:	Actually I have --14 oh, I' m sorry.	Sorry.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Brian.16 MR. CHEIGH:	Larry, I actually17 want to go back to the issue of rooming  houses.18 And I know that every year we have time slots  set19 aside for, you know, hearings and deliberations  for20 owners of hotels and rooming houses to SROs to  show21 up and speak about, you know, speak to the  board22 directly, not in a public forum  --23 MR. WOOD:	Right.24 MR. CHEIGH:	-- but they never25 come.	And we will -- for me, I' ve always2 
2 interpreted that as to say that they don' t --  they3 do not want to come because there' s so many  things4 that are happening in this side of the  industry5 that they don' t want to talk about.	That if we6 talk more deliberately about it, that it  becomes7 kind of an ugly scene of warehousing, of very  small8 units, 200 square feet where people have to  share,9 you know, bathrooms and the rents are $ 900 , $ 1 , 00010 in places.11 And I want -- essentially, if  they12 were to come and testify, I mean, to come to   our13 actual hearings, I will feel that it will be  kind14 of a, you know, they' re not coming.	And I think if15 you could shed some light on why they' re not16 coming, what is the -- what are the conditions  that17 we' re talking about?	What are -- what have you18 seen in the -- in the field of why this is such   a19 controversial issue that they -- that they don' t20 come?21 MR. WOOD:	Sure.	Okay.22 MR. CHEIGH:	If you could23 elaborate on that.24 MR. WOOD:	I mean, obviously,25 they need to speak for themselves but I could --   I2 
2 could give you some thoughts that we had on  it.3 We -- you actually will be  hearing4 from some rooming house tenants.	Because I know5 Jonathan had asked at the panel we had  earlier6 about that and whether the rent freezes or  the7 provisos, were they unduly hurting small owners  or8 the rooming houses.	So we' re going to have some9 tenants testify.10 I think, you know, historically  in11 the past, big SRO owners did come down and  testify.12 But it became pretty clear that it was  rather13 embarrassing.	Because when you started asking14 questions about well, how many of your units  are15 still occupied by rent stabilized tenants?16 A lot of those big owners,  I17 mean, a building like I' d use an example, the  Ben18 Franklin, which is now on the avenue and up at  77 th19 and Broadway, when I first came into the  Rent20 Guidelines Board, it was 90 percent  rent21 stabilized.	Now we only have about, I think it' s22 roughly 40 rent stabilized tenants in a  building23 that' s got 400 units.24 So there' s no way that owner' s25 going to say I need a  rent increase.	I have 3602 
2 units that I' m renting out for out tourists at  top3 dollar and I need an increase for those  remaining4 rent stabilized tenants.	It doesn' t pass the laugh5 test.	And other owners who are emptying  their6 buildings, they don' t want to come down and testify7 about that.8 And, I think, you know, in a  memo9 that you all have a copy of, the one point I   just10 really want to underscore, if you could look at  the11 mean and median rents, it' s just unbelievable.	If12 you turn to page 2 , the table there shows  the13 median rents of $ 1 , 065 citywide for an SRO unit.14 Thirteen hundred, over $ 1 , 300 is15 the mean, the average rents in an SRO  unit.16 MR. CHEIGH:	These are just the17 rent stabilized units in the --18 MR. WOOD:	And these are the rent19 stabilized units.	Rooming houses also have much20 smaller units.	They tend to have to be  smaller,21 closer to the 80 square feet, 100 square feet,  as22 opposed to some of the larger units you' ll --23 you' ll have in an apartment -- in a  hotel.24 So these -- this table really25 illustrates and this is -- the buildings outside  of2 
2 Manhattan, the number of units, you know, there' s3 close to 3 , 000 in Brooklyn, those tend to be in4 rooming houses and you see rents over $ 1 , 000 and5 $ 1 , 200 .	Those are high rents.6 So I believe even those  buildings7 that wouldn' t qualify for the increase because8 they' re 100 percent rented as stabilized and they9 don' t have these deregulated units, they' re still10 making a lot of money on a square- foot basis  and11 are very profitable and I don' t think an  increase12 is warranted.	They' re doing quite well.13 I think the other thing that' s14 extraordinary is, despite the history of  zero15 increases or increases with provisos, the mean  and16 median rents have skyrocketed over the years.	You17 know, you go back to the -- the last time you   did18 housing and vacancies surveys, the mean and  median19 rents in ' 96 was $ 350 -- was the medium rent, $ 42120 was the mean, the average.	In 2002 , the average21 rent was $ 705 .	And then these memos, you know,22 every year they go up.23 So despite the zero guideline,24 despite the provisos, the mean and medium  rents25 have continued to skyrocket over  the years.	So I2 
2 -- it' s just astounding in my mind.3 MR. CHEIGH:	Yeah.	I mean, you4 -- just from this memo it says, 2011 the mean  legal5 rent was $ 983 and 2012 the mean legal rent6 increased to $ 1 , 065 .7 MR. WOOD:	And that was after the8 year there was a zero guideline in  effect.9 MR. CHEIGH:	Right.	That was a10 zero and what -- why are these stabilized  rents11 going up if there was a zero -- zero   guidelines?12 MR. WOOD:	Well, clearly, these13 are potential overcharge cases in  my mind.	I -- I14 -- the tenants either don' t know that there was  a15 zero guideline and maybe they' re being charged16 apartment guidelines or maybe the landlord' s just17 operating out of the rent regulations  system18 altogether.	You know, there' s a lot of19 three- quarter houses and illegal SROs out there.20 I -- but there' s a tendency that21 people who live in rooming houses and hotels not  to22 know that they' re rent stabilized, particularly in23 the outer boroughs because they don' t have the SRO24 law projects really focusing on that stock  and25 educating the tenants as needed.2 
2 MR. CHEIGH:	Thank you.3 MS. CRUZ:	Just one question, how4 many members are -- are in your  organization?5 MR. WOOD:	How many members in6 the SRO?7 MS. CRUZ:	Yes.8 MR. WOOD:	Well, we, I guess,9 serve hundreds of tenants a year.	In terms of the10 number of stock left, I don' t know if they' re11 considered members, per se.	There was 165 , 00012 units in 1971 .	The Blackburn Study back in ' 86 was13 the most definitive and we found about 65 , 000 units14 were left.	Seventy percent of them in Manhattan,15 40 percent in rooming houses.	The bulk of them,16 you know, are in Manhattan.17 The current number is really hard18 to project.	We think there might be between 30 ,19 40 , 000 SROs out there.	We know a lot have --  are20 now managed by non- profit organizations.21 The registration data that we get22 from DHCR has varied between 16 , 000 and 24 , 00023 units.	So, I mean, that' s the best we have is  the24 registration data, which we don' t think captures25 all of the rent stabilized units  left.2 
 2 But the most recent memo shows3 about 16 , 000 units out there that are, at least,4 registered.	So, I -- I think there' s probably, you5 know, thousands more.	Did that help?6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,7 Larry.8 MR. WOOD:	Thank you.9 Zero across the board, please.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Robert11 Rosenberg.12 ( Applause.)13 MR. ROSENBERG:	Good morning,14 honorable members of the Guidelines Board.15 I think that affordable housing16 owners and renters must work together in  keeping17 the system going and providing affordable  housing.18 Affordable housing has been my19 life' s work.	My company has renovated every single20 property in my portfolio.	I do not have any  rent21 of $ 2 , 000 .	No rent of all of my  tenants pay 22	$ 2 , 000 .23 I have hundreds of apartments  that24 pay below $ 750 .	And the ability to pay  our25 expenses are getting very difficult under  those23 

2	conditions.3
Scores of agencies are out  there.
4 I know everybody' s getting fined in New York.5 That' s -- that' s obvious we' re not alone;6 restaurants, whatever.	But the affordable housing7 and the real estate, we get ever increasing  fines8 and taxes to the City.	We are fined by9 approximately 15 different agencies overseeing us.10 New York City is in a  feeding11 frenzy right now for fees and fines.	We have12 additionally been saddled with mandates, local13 laws.	All of these things increase our  costs.14 I don' t think a small owner can15 run a property any more because of the  bureaucracy16 and the -- what you have to do to keep up   with17 these mandates.18 Okay.	So our rents are regulated19 while the cost of doing business in New York  City20 is skyrocketing with the water and sewer and  taxes,21 which -- which you know.22 So I' m not going to waste your23 time by overstating what we already  know.24 Affordable housing needs help to simply continue  as25 a resource.	For that to happen, we need to  bring4 
2 up the below market rents.	I' m here to fight only3 for one thing and that' s a supplement of $ 75 for4 rents under $ 750 .	And that won' t cure the below5 market crisis but it will help and it will  not6 cripple the affordability of that apartment.7 We want to provide decent, clean,8 safe housing.	But all the costs associated are9 making it very difficult, near impossible.10 So please help affordable housing11 stay affordable.	I ask you to implement a $ 75 low12 rent supplement.	And this supplement will keep the13 rent way below the market rent and will help  defray14 the cost of rising costs.	It' s fair and it' s15 important and I believe the time is  now.16 Thank you.17 ( Applause.)18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.19 Rosenberg.20 Mr. Schleider.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for22 your testimony.23 Of these 15 City agencies, is24 there any redundant efforts?25 MR. ROSENBERG:	Yeah.	There' s2 
 2 usually no cross talk, whether it' s an HPD, a3 Building Department, a Health Department.	There' s4 -- there' s a lot of duplication and there' s a lot5 of agencies.	There are so many super agencies  and6 now they have the Harassment Agency.	There' s so7 many new agencies keep popping up and, I  think,8 they' re popping up for revenue.	Because when I9 looked at like what the DHCR just came out  with,10 they came out with, I don' t know, 10 or  1511 different new possible rules.	And one of the12 rules is to have the tenants -- you don' t have  to13 tell your owner or your super, go right to the   DHCR14 and file a complaint.15 So if I owned a building and  I16 give good service and have a super and have  a17 renovated building, they' re suggesting to go to the18 DHCR, which will create a docket, a fine,  a19 complaint and revenue.	We' re faced with that with20 so many agencies.	There' s a lot of duplication.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Now, how many22 buildings do you manage?23 MR. ROSENBERG:	Approximately 50 ; 24	2 , 500 units, 3 , 000 units.25	MR. SCHLEIDER:	And you have a  --
2 a management organization to oversee  it?3 MR. ROSENBERG:	Yes, I do.4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right.	So you' re5 in a position where your ownership  infrastructure6 can, as best they can, deal with not only  the7 ongoing operations and -- and oversight, but  this8 additional layer of -- I' m not going to call  it9 harassment, this additional layer of -- of  public10 interest duplication.11 MR. ROSENBERG:	You can call it12 harassment.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	Now14 how would a -- an owner that has maybe one,   two,15 three or four properties, how would they deal  with16 this?17 MR. ROSENBERG:	You know, that' s18 what I said before.	I don' t really think that they19 can handle it.	In the old days maybe if  somebody20 had some money.	They' re working people.	They21 tucked money away.	It' s a doctor, they want to22 invest in a piece of property.	Today with the23 bureaucracy and the rules and regulations,  you24 can' t.25 I, approximately, have four --2 
2 probably four or five people that I would  not3 ordinarily have.	So it' s good for the City for4 working people because I' m hiring extra people to5 run these properties to handle the mountains  of6 paperwork that are necessary just to keep up  with7 all the new filings and  benchmarking it.	There' s8 so many things.9 So you need a lot of extra  people10 on your staff.	You can' t do it unless you have a11 lot of property.12 The small owners that are coming13 before you, I don' t know how they do it.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	So taking15 it to the next level of -- of this  discussion16 point, do you see the City or the government,  in17 essence, or the City government, trying to  take18 over the housing industry?19 MR. ROSENBERG:	I don' t believe20 they are trying to take over.	I just believe they21 don' t know what they' re doing.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.23 MR. ROSENBERG:	I believe the24 City Council has no clue about what' s going on.25 ( Applause.)2 
2 MR. ROSENBERG:	They' re going to3 -- they have their jobs.	They have their power.4 They sit around every day -- maybe when they  go5 home and watch TV they get a new idea of how   to6 harass you.	But they have no idea of what' s going7 on.8 I' ve never been asked to testify9 or to give any feedback of importance  --10 ( Applause.)11 MR. ROSENBERG:	-- about what' s12 going on.	I mean, if I ran the City, I' d  have13 every group in my office when it comes to  this14 situation.15 I -- we don' t get asked though.16 So they don' t -- they don' t know.	And I don' t17 think they' re trying to take over property because18 we all know what happened in the ' 80 s where19 property was taken over, where hundreds  of20 thousands, where Koch spent billions -- we' re21 taking over.	The City couldn' t run them because22 the City spends twice to three times as  much23 running a property as a private owner  could.24 ( Applause.)25 MR. ROSENBERG:	If there' s a2 
 2 boiler breaks down, the City changes it.	If it3 breaks down the next month, the City' ll change the4 boiler again.	So, I mean, they don' t want the5 property back again.	It' s just that they don' t6 know what they' re doing.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.8 ( Applause.)9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.10 Ms. Cruz.11 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you for your12 testimony and for making it very clear that you  are13 one of the providers of affordable housing in  the14 City of New York.	Truly affordable housing, as you15 indicate, you don' t have a single tenant that pays16 over $ 2 , 000 in your buildings.17 MR. ROSENBERG:	I do not.	Out of 18	3 , 000 , nobody pays $ 2 , 000 .19 MS. CRUZ:	The -- the programs20 that are available to low income tenants,  programs21 like SCRIE and DRIE and Section 8 , do you22 participate in those programs?23 MR. ROSENBERG:	We have a Tenant24 Relations Department.	If anybody is in trouble on25 their rent, the first thing we try to do is   get19 
2 them access to funds to get them to avoid  any3 eviction.	We have an in- house Legal Department.4 And we have people that reach out to take them   to5 FEPS, to Bronx Works to anyplace where they can  get6 funds and keep their houses.7 So there are plenty of  programs8 out there to help tenants.	Yes, there are.	But9 some tenants are professional deadbeats and  they10 won' t pay.11 MS. CRUZ:	But just going to your12 request for the low rent supplement, you  indicated13 in your testimony that you did not believe  that14 that would adversely impact the tenants in  your15 building that pay less $ 750 a month.	And is that16 because those that cannot afford a $ 75 flat rate17 increase, have the ability either to be exempt  from18 that increase, for example, under the SCRIE  Program19 or have that increase subsidized through  the20 Section 8 program?21 MR. ROSENBERG:	I' m not sure what22 all the subsidies are.	SCRIE for senior citizens23 are certainly protected.	But we' re basically --24 but there are safety nets in  the City.	And I know25 that.	And we send people all  over there.	There2 
2 are plenty of safety nets.	I do not want to  see3 people get thrown out because they can' t afford it4 on an average rent.	We try to make sure we  get5 them help.6 So there is help available.	But7 you have to understand that with no rents at $ 2 , 0008 and five, six, seven- hundred dollar rents, $ 75 is9 not bringing that rent up.	And how can you run  it?10 Eventually you' re going to lose it.	Then your11 question about will the City take it back  over?12 Good possibility.13 All you have to do right now,  are14 we making a profit?	Look at the lien list.	It' s15 starting to grow for water and sewer.	So are16 owners making a profit?	I' d like -- as Pat said,17 some yes and some no.	But look at the lien list.18 It' s heading towards trouble.19 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.20 ( Applause.)21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Brian.22 MR. CHEIGH:	I' m sorry.	I forgot23 your name, sir.	What was your name, sir?24 MR. ROSENBERG:	Robert Rosenberg.25 MR. CHEIGH:	Thank you for your2 

2	testimony, Robert.3
It is my third year on the  board
4 and I' ve heard you -- this is my third  year5 listening to your testimony.6 And I do want to thank you  for7 providing affordable housing.8 I do thank you for seeing that  as9 a mission.10 I like your first statement saying11 that renters and building owners have to make  the12 system work to make it feasible for a City with   a13 diversity of incomes, diversity of people,  diverse14 communities.	How long have you been  providing15 affordable housing in New York City?16 MR. ROSENBERG:	I lie about my17 age so -- over 40  years.18 MR. CHEIGH:	Forty years.	And19 how long -- how long have you had so many --   you20 said you had 3 , 000 units under your management and21 ownership.	And how long have you had so  many22 units?	Have you acquired property over --23 MR. ROSENBERG:	Over the years,24 acquired them.	I -- I participated --  sometimes25 you have to -- you have to know  your business.	You4 
2 have to love your business.	You have to want to3 provide good housing and you have to  be4 professional about it.5 I did.	I followed all the City6 programs.	When the City took over properties7 because owners couldn' t pay, that' s exactly what8 happened.9 MR. CHEIGH:	So your answer is10 simply, you were able to acquire the  properties,11 turn them around --12 MR. ROSENBERG:	Some through the13 City.	Some from banks --14 MR. CHEIGH:	Right.15 MR. ROSENBERG:	--	some from16 putting together money and paying mortgages.	But17 trying to keep your head above water.	Some can' t18 survive.	Some buildings can' t and some can.	But,19 just over the years.20 MR. CHEIGH:	And -- and over the21 years, the -- you know, the building owners  are22 asking for 4 to 7 percent increases for a  one- year23 lease and that -- that high of an increase has   not24 happened in quite a  long time.	And from what25 you' re saying, over 40 years with increases that2 
 2 are much more modest and incremental, it seems  like3 you' ve been able to make your portfolio grow.4 You' re able to use existing City programs.5 You' re able to take advantage of6 the Rent Guidelines Board increases that all  owners7 have access to; MCI increases, end unit  apartments,8 vacancy turnover increases.	You do take advantage9 of those programs.	You' re making your portfolio10 work and you' re making a case that this makes11 business sense for these modest increases.12 But 7 percent, that is a  game13 changer, not just for your portfolio but if  you14 think the devastation that it has  on tenants.	And15 I can tell you that there' s a lot of tenants  who16 can tell you that a $ 75 increase will make  them17 have to move out --18 MR. ROSENBERG:	Under $ 700 .19 MR. CHEIGH:	-- they' ll have to20 find someplace else to live.	And they' ll have to21 -- and they' ll be a vacant unit in which you  can22 increase to the vacancy increase.	So I see those 23	7 --24 MR. ROSENBERG:	I would question25 how many people would have to move out if they' re24 
2 paying $ 500 and it went to $ 75 .	How many would3 really have to move out?	Or could they get help or4 come up with someone to subsidize that $ 75 ?5 ( Applause.)6 MR. ROSENBERG:	They' re not7 moving out.8 MR. CHEIGH:	And I have to9 say --10 MR. ROSENBERG:	You can' t move11 out psychologically from $ 700 .	You can' t move.12 You' ll find a way.13 MR. CHEIGH:	They' re -- what14 neighborhoods do you provide housing  in?15 MR. ROSENBERG:	All over the16 Bronx.17 MR. CHEIGH:	All over the Bronx.18 And as we all know, that the Bronx has still  the19 lowest incomes in the City, in  the country.	We20 have a lot of people who pay over 50 percent   of21 their income on rent.	And we' ve heard those22 testimonies.23 We know that there' s not much24 economic opportunity up in the  Bronx still.	We25 know that other parts of Manhattan there' s,2 
2 obviously, lots of gentrification, lots of  higher3 incomes.	But the Bronx is still  the Bronx.	But4 you' re able to show that it works and you' re asking5 for a 7 percent increase plus a  supplemental6 increase for -- for units that maybe are  studios,7 one bedrooms, maybe that' s why they have low rents.8 Maybe the population that you serve can' t afford9 it.10 Also, you say that you have  no11 units where you can charge over $ 2 , 000 .12 MR. ROSENBERG:	I didn' t say I13 couldn' t charge.	I don' t.14 MR. CHEIGH:	Right.15 MR. ROSENBERG:	That' s the market16 rent.17 MR. CHEIGH:	You don' t charge?18 MR. ROSENBERG:	Yeah.19 MR. CHEIGH:	That' s the market20 rate in the Bronx.21 MR. ROSENBERG:	Yeah.	I don' t22 charge $ 2 , 000 .	And don' t forget I' m a23 professional.	I' ll look for a good tenant and if24 it' s a little lower rent, I take the lower  rent25 and, hopefully, I have tenants who are going  to2 
2 stay there and pay.3 I do want to maintain the  building4 with people.	But I don' t have any rents that are5 -- are near that amount anyway.	And don' t forget,6 they have to earn $ 250 , 000 .	So, therefore, if the7 -- if what you' re saying about the Bronx, that' s8 not going to happen anyway.9 MR. CHEIGH:	And how many units10 do you have that have preferential  rents?11 MR. ROSENBERG:	Oh, I don' t know12 off the top of my head.	Hundreds and hundreds --13 MR. CHEIGH:	Hundreds of units14 out of 3 , 000 units.15 MR. ROSENBERG:	Yes.	That I16 don' t charge because that' s the Bronx and we17 provide that and we have to keep sort of in   line18 with what' s fair.19 But I' m saying to you, I don' t20 know about that 7 - and- a- half percent or how much it21 takes.	But be aware of the feeding frenzy of  fines22 and agencies and application fees and doubling  and23 tripling of all this, where is the money going  to24 come from?	So if the City wants us to  provide25 subsidized housing and you want to keep the  rent2 
2 low, cut the water, cut the taxes, cut all  the3 fines and stop that -- stop being our  worst4 expense.5 ( Applause.)6 MR. CHEIGH:	I think the best7 part of --8 MR. ROSENBERG:	We' re providing9 the tenants and the city' s killing us.10 MR. CHEIGH:	I think the best11 part of your testimony is that you, as a   successful12 businessman, shows that our modest increases  are13 providing you with the means to maintain  your14 business.	That the City' s fines are burdensome but15 you' re able to make it work.16 I thank you for your  testimony.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Rosenberg.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Rosenberg,21 another question.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	With your 40 years23 of ownership and management experience, starting24 from a small group of property holdings  and25 building up to -- to the portfolio you have  today,2 
2 and if a tenant advocate, the tenant  representative3 -- tenant member wishes to accept your testimony,  I4 don' t think they have the right, given your5 experience and such, just to accept those  parts6 they feel comfortable with and not the part  where7 you mention that you didn' t feel that all tenants8 would move if -- if you had a rent  increase.9 This -- the part of my  question10 though is, given your experience, given the  amount11 of City agencies and, as you termed it,  harassment,12 it took you 40 years to build this portfolio,  if13 you were starting out now, how many years would  it14 take you to -- to match this portfolio,  given15 what' s in place now?16 MR. ROSENBERG:	Yeah.	I don' t17 know the answer to that.	But, you know, I always18 say to everybody, there' s opportunity all ways.19 Maybe you' ll have where buildings are taken over by20 the City again and they' ll decrease --21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No, I understand22 but --23 MR. ROSENBERG:	-- rent.	I don' t24 know the, you know --25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- would it take2 
2 more than 40 years given the level of  bureaucratic3 influence?4 MR. ROSENBERG:	Oh, yeah.	Oh,5 yeah.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.7 MR. ROSENBERG:	Today is tough.8 Absolutely.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.10 MR. ROSENBERG:	Thank you.11 ( Applause.)12 MR. CHEIGH:	Seven percent13 increases are mean.	I' m sure you could acquire a14 huge portfolio with 7 percent increases.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But not every16 owner has a huge portfolio.17 MR. ROSENBERG:	Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Harvey.19 MR. EPSTEIN:	Sir, excuse me, sir.20 Can I -- you said that for some -- hundreds of   your21 units, you' re charging below what you could22 otherwise collect under the market rent; is  that23 what you said?24 MR. ROSENBERG:	Yes.25 MR. EPSTEIN:	And so for -- and2 
 2 you' re still asking for a 7 percent increase for3 all of the -- all rent stabilized  units?4 MR. ROSENBERG:	Yes.	I' ll have a5 higher preferential that I wouldn' t collect.	If it6 was added to those --  rents.7 MR. EPSTEIN:	So for those higher8 units, you' re thinking you couldn' t -- you wouldn' t9 be able to collect that 7 percent  increase?10 MR. ROSENBERG:	In my market rents11 in my buildings, the rents that I do not  collect12 are too high to collect.13 MR. EPSTEIN:	They' re just too --14 the rents are just too high to  collect.15 MR. ROSENBERG:	I mean, the base16 rent of those hundreds of units out of the 3 , 00017 are just arbitrarily they got high.	But it' s not18 in the ballpark.	If I would rent a one- bedroom for 19	$ 1 , 000 and $ 1 , 100 and it said $ 1 , 600 , I am not20 getting that in the Bronx.21 MR. EPSTEIN:	So that 7 percent22 wouldn' t help for those units?23 MR. ROSENBERG:	It would not help24 at all.	The -- the rents that are going to  go25 higher that I don' t collect, I don' t care what20 
2 increase you give me.3 MR. EPSTEIN:	So how about if you4 were -- owned a building where you did  have5 deregulated units, would that affect your  economic6 calculation?7 MR. ROSENBERG:	I don' t have any8 and I don' t know.	But I would say there is  enough9 to offset.	I can' t say it wouldn' t help at all if10 I had $ 2 , 500 or a $ 3 , 000 rent, it would be good for11 the building.12 MR. EPSTEIN:	So let' s say you had13 a 20 - unit building and there was only one rent14 stabilized tenant left and the rest were  all15 market, would that --16 MR. ROSENBERG:	I' ll take the17 building.	Where is it?18 ( Laughter.)19 MR. EPSTEIN:	All over New York20 City, in Manhattan and the Lower East  Side,21 Harlem --22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Not true.23 MR. EPSTEIN:	So what is the --24 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Epstein, you have25 statistics for that?2 

23	those tenants -- 4
MR. EPSTEIN:	-- you know, forMS. CRUZ:	Do you have statistics?
5 Do you have any data to back up  --6 MR. EPSTEIN:	-- who are still7 there.8 MS. CRUZ:	-- that statement?9 MR. EPSTEIN:	I -- I' m -- I didn' t10 interrupt you, Magda.	I' ll be finished and then11 you can ask your question.12 So for those buildings which have13 high numbers of deregulated units, do you think  the14 calculations for those building owners are15 different than they are for you?16 MR. ROSENBERG:	First of all, I' m17 not really as connected to  those buildings.	We18 also get some help from the City for  different19 programs which probably the higher rent  buildings20 will not.	The higher rent buildings probably have21 much higher taxes than I do  as well.	So I' m not22 sure about that.23 MR. EPSTEIN:	Okay.	Thank you.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25 ( Applause.)5 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I' m going to3 insert another speaker here out of order,  Public4 Advocate Bill Di Blasio.5 MR. DI BLASIO:	Thank you so6 much.7 Thank you, Chair Kimmel and8 members of the board.9 Thanks for the opportunity to10 speak before you today.11 New York City at this point  is12 becoming a tale of two cities.	Wall Street is13 hitting record highs and the number of  millionaires14 and multi- millionaire dollar penthouses has soared15 over the last decade.16 Working people face a very17 different story.	Nearly half of the City is  living18 at or dangerously close to the  poverty level.	A19 third of New Yorkers spend at least half of  their20 incomes on rent and even as the economy  has21 deteriorated for working people, affordable housing22 has become scarcer.23 Approximately 120 , 000 rent24 stabilized apartments have been lost since 2004 ,25 virtually erasing any gains we' ve made building new2 

2	affordable homes.3
We live in one of the  worst
4 economic time since the Great Depression.5 Unemployment is above eight percent.	Wages are6 stagnant.	The cost of living keeps increasing.7 And middle and low income families are  struggling8 to make ends meet.9 We cannot deepen this inequality10 any further.	Economic inequality is the challenge11 of our time and it is a problem this board can   help12 alleviate through its decisions.13 Last month the board proposed14 increases of 3 percent to 6 . 25 percent for one year15 leases and 5 to 9 . 5 percent for two- year leases.16 These latest proposals follow four  consecutive17 years of rent hikes during this economic  crisis.18 This must end.19 ( Applause.)20 MR. DI BLASIO:	Heaping another21 $ 500 , $ 1 , 000 or more in rent each year, the22 equivalent of a week' s wages for many families, is23 absolutely unacceptable in these hard times.	These24 repeated increases cut into the foundation of  our25 City forcing working people out of their homes  and4 
2 pushing the middle class out of  entire3 neighborhoods.4 We need a rent freeze  that5 acknowledges these stark realities.6 ( Applause.)7 ( Audience participation.)8 MR. DI BLASIO:	This -- this is9 the only acceptable outcome for tenants at  this10 time.11 I also need to note it is  deeply12 regrettable that the board has coupled its  proposed13 rent hike with a complete failure to engage  the14 people most affected by its decision by not  holding15 a single hearing in the outer boroughs, the  board16 has marginalized the voices of more than 700 , 00017 renters who face the prospect of higher  rents.18 ( Applause.)19 MR. DI BLASIO:	The board' s20 solitary hearing in Lower Manhattan is not just  an21 inconvenience, it' s an outright failure of the22 democracy.	I urge the members of this board  to23 take into consideration the factors I  have24 discussed today and freeze the rents of hundreds  of25 thousands of working families who simply  cannot2 
 2 afford another hike.3 Put the interest and the welfare4 of the renters first and vote no to an  increase5 and yes to a  freeze.6 Thank you.7 ( Applause.)8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.9 Mr. Schleider.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	First, I wish you13 luck with your campaign.14 MR. DI BLASIO:	Thank you.15 ( Laughter.)16 ( Applause.)17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But I do have some18 questions for you and some comments  really.19 Of the 700 renters that --  that20 you noted in the outer boroughs who didn' t have 21	a --22 MR. DI BLASIO:	Seven hundred23 thousand.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes, 700 , 000 .25 Thank you.22 
2 Last year when we held a  meeting3 in the Bronx, 12 of those 700 , 000 showed up.	So4 that' s first.5 The other thing about your6 subtractions from the rent stabilized housing7 stock, I know each year we -- we speak about   the8 additions and the subtractions from the  rent9 stabilized housing stock, I think you may want  to10 go back to those numbers a bit because it  would11 take about -- at the current pace of  subtractions12 and additions, it would take at least 100 years  to13 run out of the rent stabilized housing  inventory.14 Now I know that you' re an advocate15 for affordable housing and for tenants  rights,16 which is all fine.	But where do you stand  on17 supporting and defending the business owners in  the18 City that follow the rules?	And how much energy19 and commitment from you can be counted on to  foster20 and protect the tax generating base in New  York21 City, specifically, as it reflects from real  estate22 -- housing?23 MR. DI BLASIO:	So a couple of24 quick answers.	The -- on the first on the  hearing25 that was held in the Bronx, I wasn' t there at  that2 
2 Bronx hearing last year.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That' s fine.4 MR. DI BLASIO:	But I was at a5 hearing that a CASA New Settlement put together  in6 the Bronx a few nights back that had a couple   of7 hundred people at it.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No, I recognize9 that.	But we' re just going by -- you -- you10 chastised us for this.	And I' m just telling you11 that --12 MR. DI BLASIO:	Well, I appreciate13 you giving me the facts.	But what I' m saying is,14 I' ve seen a real life example of where an  actual15 effort to engage the renters can bring out a   very16 high attendance.	I would urge you to try  that.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Fine.18 ( Applause.)19 MR. DI BLASIO:	Second -- and20 second, on the question of what we' ve lost, we  can21 all debate the numbers.	I think the number I' m22 providing is accurate.	But, remember, it' s not23 just a question of units that have left  rent24 regulation, it' s also the losses we sustained with25 Mitchell Lama units leaving that program.2 
2 We' re talking about an overall3 downward pressure on a number of different  sources4 of affordable housing.5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No, I can6 appreciate that.	But -- but the staff reports7 differ from -- from your interpretation.8 MR. DI BLASIO:	Well, we would9 love to compare notes.	I think we can safely  say10 that despite some good efforts by the  current11 administration to create affordable housing and12 preserve it, we' ve also seen a very sustained loss13 on other fronts.14 On the question of working with15 landlords, my office has worked with landlords  in16 several ways, I think, are indicative of the  kind17 balance we have to strike.	We have worked with18 many good landlords who are part of the Section  819 program who have, I think, been treated  unfairly20 particularly by NYCHA in terms of inspections  and21 reimbursements.22 We have worked to try and  reduce23 some of the arbitrary fines on good  landlords.24 I' ve gone after the worst landlords.	I have a25 watch list that' s all about that when those are not2 
2 providing heat and hot water and  repairs.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I know.	I know.4 And that' s --5 MR. DI BLASIO:	But -- but there6 are plenty of good landlords  --7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.8 MR. DI BLASIO:	-- who get unfair9 violations and we' re trying to help them like small10 businesses get unfair violations, to get  relief.11 I think there' s plenty of ways to strike a  balance.12 My macro point here is  this13 though, we think back to the  Great Depression.	The14 role of government in the Great Depression was  to15 find a way to sustain people through the  crisis.16 Exceptional actions were taken to help  people17 through a crisis.	You have raised rents throughout18 the crisis.	It' s time to stop doing that and19 provide people relief.20 ( Applause.)21 MR. DI BLASIO:	This is getting22 unsupportable.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Harvey.24 MR. EPSTEIN:	First, I just want25 to thank you for coming to the Bronx last week   at2 
2 -- at our Rent Guidelines Board hearing and to  see3 the over 200 tenants who came and to see  people4 testify on behalf of Bronx residents about  their5 concerns about the Guidelines' increases.6 I really applaud your effort to  be7 there and to be a part of  that.8 And I hope in the future, as  you9 stated, since it was clear that 200 people came  to10 the Bronx that this board will take that  into11 consideration as we move forward.12 My question to you is about  this13 disparity that you' re talking about. And so we see14 this throughout the City.	And we need to think15 about solutions.	And I appreciate what you' re16 saying about a rent freeze.17 But I' m also concerned about the18 -- in these buildings where there' s a dwindling19 number of rent stabilized units in buildings  that20 are now surrounded by market rate rent  units,21 whether it' s in Brooklyn where you live or22 Manhattan, what do you think the Guidelines Board' s23 responsibility is to those tenants who  are24 struggling in buildings that are being  gentrified,25 neighborhoods are being gentrified?2 
2 What is our obligation to them  and3 what do you think -- do we have to put people   who4 are situated differently in different  scenarios5 when we' re thinking about Guidelines' increases?6 MR. DI BLASIO:	Well, I would say7 two answers.	I think for those individuals,  and8 they are sort of on the front line of this   very9 painful reality of people being forced out of  their10 neighborhoods by overall economic conditions.11 I think it' s even more incumbent12 to think about that example when we talk about  a13 freeze because we have to recognize, this has  never14 happened in the history of our City before the  last15 few years, where more and more places that  were16 supposed to be real enclaves for working class  and17 middle class people are being closed off to  them.18 So, I think, when you think  about19 the freeze, you have to think about the piece  of20 the puzzle -- I think, picking up on your   point,21 the piece of the puzzle that this board plays  in22 arresting a trend that is, basically, creating  a23 City where there will only be rich  and poor.	You24 plan a central role in trying to stop that  and25 allow us to address that more  holistically.2 
2 I think the second part of  this3 equation and, again, I want  to differentiate.	The4 vast majority of landlords, in my opinion,  are5 doing their job and following the law.	I have gone6 after the minority who are breaking the  law7 regularly.8 But we know within that  minority,9 is a group that pressures tenants out in  every10 conceivable manner when they want to catch up  with11 market conditions around them in a  neighborhood.12 We know all sorts of efforts have been made  to13 harass and push tenants out so certain  landlords14 can take advantage of favorable  economic15 conditions.16 That is putting additional17 pressure on these macro dynamics.	So I would18 summarize it by saying, you have a very tough  job19 to do.	And I want to say, we all may  have20 different views, but I don' t envy the challenge you21 face.	But, I think, you have to see yourself  as22 historical actors.	You have to see yourself as23 part of a bigger equation.24 Right now, this affordability25 crisis is so out of hand in this City that New   York2 
2 City will not resemble what it has been  for3 generations if we don' t stop this problem now.	And4 you have a chance to do something about right  now5 and I urge you to do  that.6 ( Applause.)7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 MR. DI BLASIO:	Thank you very9 much.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Nicole Zanardi.11 Who will be followed by  Judith12 Seigel.13 MS. ZANARDI:	Hi.	My name is14 Nicole and I' m a tenant organizer at Tenants and15 Neighbors.16 I work in rent stabilized17 buildings in Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn  and18 Queens.	Building sizes range from five to  16919 units.	I work with tenants from Trinidad,  Jamaica,20 Puerto Rico.	I work with African Americans,21 Eastern Europeans and people from across the U. S.22 I work with musicians, receptionists and  dentists,23 with tenants who are unemployed, retired and  in24 school.25 Most are low to moderate  income2 
2 adults who work long hours to support their  family.3 Despite differences in location, size and  tenant4 demographics, all buildings I work with  share5 distinct problems; poor management, bad  conditions6 and rent overcharges fester in hundreds  of7 buildings in the City.8 These problems, illegal under the9 Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 , cannot be rewarded10 and justified to continue by approving the  rent11 increases and handing undeserved money to  landlord12 corporations.13 Buildings across the City are14 managed with incompetence and neglect of  tenants'15 rights and needs.	At 3224 Grand Concourse in  the16 Bronx, there is one super for all eight  buildings.17 He is not qualified or certified to make  the18 repairs he is responsible for.19 In addition, tenants have no20 reliable means of contacting management and  there21 is no system for inspections or  repair22 appointments.	So tenants have ongoing maintenance23 issues like major leaks and inoperable toilets  that24 are ignored for months or fixed  insufficiently.25 Management systems like this2 
2 create uncertainty and frustration for  tenants.3 The proposed rent increase is not4 acceptable if the landlord cannot ensure  that5 management correctly and effectively provides6 required services and operates a  transparent7 system.8 This situation at 9016 171 st9 Street in Queens highlights the horrible  conditions10 I have seen in buildings across  the City.	At this11 particular 23 - unit building, there are 271 HPD12 violations, 217 are classified as hazardous.	The13 building has not had gas since April 3 rd, which14 means tenants are not able to cook in  their15 apartments.16 In addition, tenants suffer from17 leaks, mice and lead paint exposure.18 The landlord owes the Department19 of Buildings $ 2 , 500 for failure to comply with20 mandated boiler conditions.	The boiler is too21 small to provide adequate heat to all units in  the22 building.	Tenants cannot afford to pay  higher23 rents while simultaneously funding supplemental24 purchases like take- out meals and space heaters25 made necessary by inhabitable conditions.2 
 2 Landlords must be held accountable3 for maintaining legal conditions before a  rent4 increase is approved.5 As you know, the system of  rent6 stabilization creates huge incentives for  landlords7 to raise rent in an apartment above $ 2 , 500 .	I have8 seen evidence of rent overcharge in a number  of9 buildings.	Tenants at 259 Nostrand Avenue in10 Brooklyn are charged over $ 20 each month for the AC11 unit in their apartment, the legal fee for which  is12 around $ 5 .13 And tenants at 854 West 180 th14 Street are moving into units with  illegally15 deregulated leases and skyrocketing rents  justified16 by inflated IAIs.	One units rent jumped from 17	$ 1 , 477 . 17 to $ 2 , 150 , an increase that --18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Nicole, I' m19 going to ask you to start to wrap up,  please.20 MS. ZANARDI:	Okay.	-- that21 cannot be explained through vacancy bonus or  major22 construction costs.23 Rent stabilization exists to keep24 acceptable and comfortable living affordable for25 the City' s people.	Approving the rent increase18 
2 will further break down the distorted  intended3 purpose of the system by allowing and  strengthening4 the negative side effects I have  discussed.5 And I can say this from  personal6 experience, I have worked in these buildings  and7 formed relationships with these tenants --8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Nicole, wrap it9 up.10 MS. ZANARDI: -- to hand  landlords11 an increase in profits under these circumstances  is12 absurd at this point.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.14 The only reason I say is we have  a15 room full of people.16 MS. ZANARDI:	I know.17CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I' m not trying18tocutyouoff.19MS. ZANARDI:	Thanks.20CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.21Any questions?22MS. CRUZ:	I have a question.23MR. SCHLEIDER:	Question.24CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Magda.25MS. CRUZ:	So -- so you' re a
2 tenant organizer and I assume then you' re very3 familiar with the rights that tenants have  under4 the Rent Stabilization Code and the  Rent5 Stabilization Law; is that correct?6 MS. ZANARDI:	Yes.7 MS. CRUZ:	So isn' t it a fact that8 if a tenant has a defective condition  like9 something as extreme as a non -- inoperable  toilet10 or not enough heat, that a DHCR order would  be11 issued for that kind of condition providing  that12 the owner would not get any kind of a rent   increase13 until the -- until that condition was  corrected?14 Don' t your people that you15 represent apply for rent reduction orders,  rent16 freeze orders, as well as rent abatements  whereby17 they can withhold rent if the warranty  of18 habitability is not being abided by by the  owner?19 MS. ZANARDI:	Right.	Well, first20 of all, I mean, the first -- ideally,  tenants21 should be able to contact their management and  get22 these issues fixed before they have to go to  that23 step.	Because it' s unacceptable that they have to24 deal with these conditions in the first  place.25 MS. CRUZ:	I' m not debating that.2 
2 Absolutely.	You' re correct.3 MS. ZANARDI: And -- and --  right.4 MS. CRUZ:	But I' m -- I' m talking5 about your -- your position that there should  not6 be a rent increase because these  conditions7 exist --8 MS. ZANARDI:	Right.	Often9 when --10 MS. CRUZ:	-- the tenants that11 have these conditions have multiple remedies to  not12 have to pay a  rent increase.	And, in fact, are13 able to withhold their rents until these  conditions14 are rectified.15 MS. ZANARDI:	Right.	I have16 worked with a lot of tenants who have filled  out17 these DHCR forms and turned them in.	And they wait18 weeks and months and more months to get  this19 process moving --20 ( Applause.)21 ( Audience participation.)22 MS. ZANARDI:	-- and oftentimes --23 and DHCR isn' t always accommodating to tenants and24 the landlords claim that things are fixed  and25 things have been done when, in fact, they haven' t,2 
2 in which case it takes more months for  more3 inspectors to come out and verify that and talk  to4 the landlord again.5 ( Applause.)6 MS. ZANARDI:	So the process is7 very long and really nothing ever gets done  and8 I' ve seen that.9 MS. CRUZ:	What -- what you' re10 describing is an administrative problem that  is11 part of the bureaucracy.	Owners have to confront12 the same types of problems.	It does not, however,13 mean that no rent increase should be  provided14 across the City of New York because the --  the15 numbers of people that you' re representing have16 very serious conditions.	They have remedies and17 rights.	And owners should not be able to get  rent18 increases that are not providing services.	That' s19 what the law says.20 MS. ZANARDI:	Right.	All I' m21 saying is, based on what I' ve seen, it' s22 unacceptable that landlords should --  that23 landlords are getting any sort of increase  when24 they' re not held accountable for legal25 responsibilities that they have.2 
2 ( Applause.)3 MS. CRUZ:	Again, owners do not --4 are not entitled to rent increases when those  kinds5 of conditions are in their units and they' re not6 providing services.7 MS. ZANARDI:	Right.	But in8 reality they are getting increases when  these9 things exist.	And so I' m just --10 ( Applause.)11 MS. CRUZ:	Then the tenants are12 not -- they' re not exercising their legal rights13 because there are multiple laws in place  and14 enforcement agencies that are -- that' s their job15 to enforce the tenant rights to have  these16 conditions rectified --17 MS. ZANARDI:	Right.	Right.18 MS. CRUZ: -- before they can  pay19 any increases.20 MS. ZANARDI:	And ideally, you21 know, in a perfect world that would be the case   but22 that' s just not what' s happening -- so.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Harvey.24 MR. EPSTEIN:	Hi, Nicole.25 MS. ZANARDI:	Hi.2 

23	testifying here.4
MR. EPSTEIN:	So thank you forSo how many organizers are at
5 Tenants and Neighbors; do you  know?6 MS. ZANARDI:	Right now only a7 few.	We only have a few  organizers.8 MR. EPSTEIN:	And this is for the9 one million rent stabilized units that are in  New10 York City?11 MS. ZANARDI:	Right.	Um- hum.12 MR. EPSTEIN:	And when you go to13 buildings, do you find that the vast majority  of14 tenants understand what their rights are?15 Understand what DHCR versus HPD versus DOB  versus16 EDC, versus anything?17 MS. ZANARDI:	No, no.	I mean, no.18 I have to explain a lot of things to tenants and   if19 I wasn' t there helping them through these20 processes, they would have no idea that  these21 things existed, that they could use these --  these22 things.23 MR. EPSTEIN:	So what do tenants24 mostly do when you find -- when you go to   their25 buildings and they' re living with serious repair5 
2 problems?	What -- what do tenants mostly  just3 doing in response to that?4 MS. ZANARDI:	They are trying to5 contact their super or management to get  the6 repairs done through phone calls, e- mails, in7 person and nothing ever comes from  that.8 MR. EPSTEIN:	So I know Magda made9 reference that there are legal avenues  available10 for tenants.	Do you find that most tenants  can11 exercise those avenues?12 MS. ZANARDI:	As I said, no.13 Because they don' t know they exist and they don' t14 know how to navigate them without some sort  of15 help, for example, the assistance I' m giving them.16 MR. EPSTEIN:	And what percentage17 of the tenants that you see are -- English isn' t18 their first language?19 MS. ZANARDI:	I don' t know.	But20 like over half of the tenants that I work  with,21 speak a different language and most of  those22 tenants do not feel comfortable either speaking  or23 writing in English.24 MR. EPSTEIN:	And do you know the25 percentage of tenants who are immigrants or  maybe2 
2 new to the United States or new to New York or   Rent3 Stabilized?4 MS. ZANARDI:	Can you repeat the5 question?6 MR. EPSTEIN:	I just didn' t know7 if you knew like whether it was a large  immigrant8 population --9 MS. ZANARDI:	Oh, oh.	Yeah.	I10 mean, again, from my experience, the tenants I  work11 with, over 90 percent are not from the  United12 States.13 MR. EPSTEIN:	Great.	And just one14 last question, you mentioned that at a  certain15 point maybe because of conditions, landlords16 shouldn' t get increases.17 What are you -- what level  of18 violations are you really talking about?	Are you19 talking about like five violations, 100  violations?20 MS. ZANARDI:	In most of the21 buildings I work with there are hundreds of  HPD22 violations listed.	And most all the buildings  have23 more violations than number of units in  the24 building.	And in buildings I work in, over half  of25 those violations are C violations, which  are2 
2 considered the most hazardous.	So they are serious3 issues.	They' re not minor things that tenants can4 fix on their own, things like  that.5 MR. EPSTEIN:	Thank you.6 ( Applause.)7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 Judith Seigel.9 MS. SEIGEL:	My name is Judith --10 have I got this right?	Can you hear me?11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes.12 MS. SEIGEL:	Yeah.	My name is13 Judith Seigel and I' m an 83 - year old artist.14 Our house on Morton Street15 acquired us in 1957 .	I say acquired us because16 when you have an old house, you are its  person.17 We could almost afford the 183518 brownstone because it was dilapidated and  heavily19 infested.20 Back then whenever the inspectors21 came around and gave us X number of violations,  and22 it was always a slew of them, they told us   bluntly,23 these old buildings should be torn down.	And that24 was the mantra of the City in those days of   urban25 renewal.2 
2 We and others like us saved  the3 old buildings, which is what made the  neighborhood4 so wonderful.	But those renovations took all  our5 time, energy and life savings.6 I also worked with other  villagers7 to save Washington Square Park, improve our  schools8 and save the Village as an historic district,  which9 passed a decade later.10 Today, the Village has become the11 new Gold Coast with neighbors more often  movie12 stars than artists as the old residents  are13 squeezed out or pass on.	But we are still here.14 Morton Street is our home.15 In the last ten years our  property16 tax doubled from $ 20 , 438 in 2002 to $ 41 , 002 today.17 This year the building will start losing  money.18 The rents in our four rental apartments, which  we19 don' t occupy, are rented out are strictly20 controlled at low rates yet we are assessed at  full21 market rent for the space we occupy, though it  is22 unrenovated.23 We filed for certiori -- what  is24 the word, certiori tax reduction this year but  were25 summarily dismissed.	Though, as I say, we  are2 
2 assessed at full market rent though our space  is3 unrenovated.4 We -- when we were dismissed,  we5 got no explanation and we have not found a   lawyer6 who will take the case as small  as ours.	One7 attorney practically hung up when we called to  ask8 for help.9 The controlled rents range from10 one- half to one- quarter of market rate.	One tenant11 pays $ 850 for a studio with a separate kitchen  and12 outdoor patio on the --13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Seigel, I' m14 going to ask you to -- I' m going to ask you  to15 please wrap up.16 MS. SEIGEL:	There' s barely17 enough to cover the real estate tax, fuel and  water18 on that space alone.	Our expenses continue to rise19 at a rate far beyond the  rent increases.	Major20 repairs have been long delayed.	It is urgent that21 we fix the crumbling back wall and decayed  windows,22 lintels and cornice.23 I have had quotes from  five24 contractors ranging from one to $ 200 , 000 .	Under25 current major capital improvement rules, we  would2 
2 only be able to recoup some 20 percent of  that3 cost, ever.	It' s because half of our tenants are4 low income senior citizens.5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Please wrap it6 up.7 MS. SEIGEL:	So we can' t get rent8 increases to even approach the cost.9 These senior citizen tenants are10 protected by many layers of regulations.	But I' m a11 senior citizen too.	Who is protecting me?	I' ve12 heard --13 ( Applause.)14 MS. SEIGEL:	-- I' ve heard people15 say, tough.	They say we should not have  bought16 this house and should move out.	But it' s our home.17 We' ve spent years repairing a 180 - year old house18 that was a shambles, with our own labor and  hired19 specialists.20 My husband would come home from21 his job as a buyer in training at  Bloomingdales.22 Change his clothes and lay bricks and scrape  paint23 until midnight.	Back then we could never imagine24 that World War II emergency rent controls  would25 last beyond 1984 --2

RAMOS:	Hello everybody.18 I' m Johary Ramos, an upper west19 side resident, SRO resident, for more than  ten20 years.21 I' ve been living there pretty much22 -- I' m representing today, the artistic class also,23 the performers and, also, people with  mobility24 issues.25 Even though I work three to  four2 
2 jobs as a part timer, I' m still considered as a  low3 income resident.4 In the building that I  live5 there' s 110 units or more.	Many of them are empty,6 vacant after a big horrible process or  renovation7 that we went through.8 Instead of a rent increase, I  will9 ask you guys to think about probably make  those10 empty spaces or vacant spaces of those  many11 buildings in the City to be occupied for  permanent12 residents like me instead of trying to increase  the13 rent to people like me or other people that  cannot14 be here today to give their  testimony.15 I' m here not to give complaints of16 any issue or use this forum as a complaint  issue17 but just note I have filed two complaints with  DHCR18 and I won one as overcharging for many, many  years.19 And I was the one that  started20 this movement in my building because a lot of   other21 residents didn' t know anything about that.	And22 they thought that they were being charged  correctly23 but they were not.	And thank God I have  received24 that after many years of being overcharged,  finally25 I received that money back.2 
2 I want zero or less  increase3 because this threatening every year about our  rent4 being increased or not increased, is causing  stress5 in us.	I mean, as an artist, as a performer and  as6 a person with mobility issues, I had  several7 surgeries in my right leg that it' s making me  being8 less workable than before.	We have a lot of  stress9 in the City already.	We are dealing with food10 issues, with work issues, with health issues  --11 ( Applause.)12 MR. RAMOS:	-- that having another13 issue of being threatened of having our rent  being14 increased next year, the following year	the next15 -- it' s another stress that we don' t need.	So I' m16 asking for zero increase or a frozen kind  of17 increase that you can give to all these  residents18 of New York City.19 We need better opportunities of20 housing and, please embrace our artistic  class,21 artistic groups, performers and people with22 mobility issues.23 For example, my neighbor, it' s a24 hearing impaired person and whenever I approach  him25 with this kind of issue so he can move forward  and2 
2 not being from a landlord pushed to pay more,  he3 doesn' t know because every time our landlord give4 us a letter or give us something in writing,  it5 says Albany or it says State of New York and   my6 neighbors think that that' s, you know, enough7 reason to be fair and to be  right.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Ramos, I' m9 going to ask you to wrap  up.10 MR. RAMOS:	So that' s all I' m11 asking you guys.	I' m asking you to be conscious,12 to be fair and to, please, erase this  nonsense13 increases and threatenings every year.	We don' t14 need that.	We need support from you.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.16 ( Applause.)17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.18 Michael Vincour.19 MR. VINCOUR:	Good morning.20 My name is Michael Vincour and  I21 come here as a modest size landlord with  a22 fractional interest in a few buildings  in23 Washington Heights.24 The early 20 th- century walk- ups25 that we owned were decrepit when we first  purchased2 
2 them with hundreds of HPD violations in each  of3 them.	They now are significantly improved4 buildings with zero or close to zero violations  in5 each.6 We consider ourselves good7 landlords and good stewards of the housing stock  we8 manage.	However, these improvements happened only9 by digging into our own pockets and foregoing  any10 real return on our investments, as RGB  increases11 continually lagged our increased operating  costs.12 Though I appreciate the struggles13 to pay rent encountered by some of our lower  income14 tenants, many of them, in fact, are well  insulated15 from rent increases through programs such as  the16 SCRIE and DRIE program.	And when tenants of ours17 have found themselves in Housing Court  for18 nonpayment of rent, they often get one shot  deals,19 often annually, where the City will come and  pay20 their back rent if they' re experiencing financial21 hardship.22 I know there' s little sympathy for23 landlords in this room but I' m here to appeal  to24 you to consider an increase this year that at  least25 keeps pace with the Price Index of Operating  Costs.2 
2 Though this index understates the real cost  of3 maintaining a building, leaving out things  like4 capital expenses and legal costs related  to5 difficult, problem tenants, it' s still, as you6 know, is pegged at 5 . 9 percent this year.7 Thus, I think it fair that  your8 one- year renewal rate should at least be in this9 ballpark.10 I' d also encourage you to maintain11 a minimum dollar increase for apartments  under12 $ 1 , 000 , of which we have quite a few.	Subjecting a13 $ 600 a month apartment to a straight percentage14 increase just doesn' t generate enough additional15 dollars to keep up with our increased  expenses16 attributable to that unit.17 From 2007 to 2012 , the Rent18 Guidelines Board one year- renewal increases have19 totaled 17 - and- a- half percent but my water and20 sewage bill during that same time period has  gone21 up 76 percent.	That' s four times what I got as22 rent increases.	My heating costs have gone up  more23 than 17 - and- a- half percent during that time frame.24 So have my material costs for repairs, so  have25 salaries for supers.2 
2 Insurance premiums are starting to3 creep up much faster than the rate of the  RGB4 Guidelines, particularly post Sandy, we' re getting5 really hit by the insurance companies.	I have one6 building on 182 nd Street where my tax bill in  the7 last five years went up  80 percent.	Now this is8 while values were declining post  Lehman.9 My revenues have gone up  2010 percent in that building but my tax bill' s gone  up11 over 80 percent.12 And don' t forget that in certain13 parts of the City, tax rates are now being  pegged14 at 30 percent of your gross  rent revenues.	So if15 you increase by, you know, 6 percent, a third  of16 that is going to go to the  City.17 In light of last year' s absurdly18 lean 2 percent increase, I ask you at a minimum,   to19 allow us to keep up with our increased  annual20 expenses.	If you want a healthy housing stock  in21 New York City, RGB increases should generally  keep22 pace with the real increased cost of  properly23 operating and maintaining our nearly 100 - year old24 buildings.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I' m going to ask2

MR. VINCOUR:	I' m done.Thank you.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.Thank you. ( Applause.)MR. VINCOUR:	Any questions. CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.Mr. Schleider.MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you forHow long ago did you make  this
14 investment in these properties?15 MR. VINCOUR:	We bought the first16 building in 2003 .17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Ten years.18 MR. VINCOUR:	Um- hum.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And over the ten20 years have you seen an increase in the amount  of21 City agencies coming through to check on  things,22 let' s say.23 MR. VINCOUR:	Yeah.	They' re down24 our throat.	We' re a very good landlord.	So I' ve25 got an incredibly clean building but I have a   book14 
2 I bought for apartment management that is  an3 inch- and- a- half thick and that is the only way I4 know what I' m required to do.	Because between5 fire, DEP and HPD and DOB, it' s just -- it takes  a6 special person to be able to deal with this  these7 days.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	So9 you wouldn' t recommend this for the faint of heart?10 MR. VINCOUR:	No.	And I question11 very often my getting into it.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.13 MR. VINCOUR:	Thank you.14 ( Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Brian.16 MR. CHEIGH:	Excuse me, sir.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Vincour, a18 question.19 MR. CHEIGH:	Thank you very much20 for your testimony and, again, thank you  for21 explaining to us what your expenses  are.22 And I do thank all the  landlords23 who -- building owners who do  come testify.	I do24 appreciate that they' re providing affordable25 housing and they' re meeting all the guidelines and2 
2 the codes.	And I know it' s very difficult to3 operate a small business. My parents were a  small4 retail owner for many years.5 So one thing I want to ask, we  do6 hear a lot about expenses rising.	You cited all7 your percentage increases and the water, taxes  and8 we hear all those numbers.	And one of the things9 that our PIOC research that the staff does,  is10 factor in increases for vacancy turnover and  we11 also want to -- we also think about -- the   thing12 that we don' t -- if what you' re saying is true13 about all these expenses climbing is that, if  our14 17 percent increases and some vacancy  turnover15 increases are so low compared to the  actual16 expenses, where are you getting your income  from?17 And I have to assume that it' s only coming from  the18 market rate rents that you have.19 Do you have other substantial20 market rate units within your buildings?21 MR. VINCOUR:	Well, the first22 building we bought in 2003 , I think I have  three23 market rate units.	But market rate up there could24 be $ 1 , 600 a month on a renovated unit where we25 spent $ 40 , 000 renovating it.2 
2 MR. CHEIGH:	Um- hum.3 MR. VINCOUR:	So I' m not even4 getting the return that' s calculated on -- on the5 vacancy renovations.6 MR. CHEIGH:	But you only have7 three market rate units right now?8 MR. VINCOUR:	Out of the 21 - unit9 building, there' s three in that building.	And I' ve10 got people that are there 30 years.	I' ve a lovely11 relationship with them.	I go into their homes.12 You know, we were the evil new landlord when  we13 bought and now, you know, we fixed up the  building14 so they feel good about  us.15 But I have taken not a dollar  out16 of that building in ten years.	Thank God I was17 able to refinance at a lower  interest rate.	That18 was a salvation to a lot  of landlords.	But when19 taxes take out what they take out, when water  goes20 up that high, when we' re -- when things are --  and21 if you had any idea what we deal with  with22 incompetency at HPD, bad inspectors that don' t show23 up and then file reports.24 MR. CHEIGH:	Um- hum.25 MR. VINCOUR:	You know, I2 
2 sympathize with the tenants but you have  to3 understand there' s good landlords out there who,4 you know, are trying to do the right thing but   the5 City makes it so hard.6 MR. CHEIGH:	I -- I believe  you.7 MR. VINCOUR:	And add so much8 expense that when you' re concerned about housing9 costs, you have to look at the amount of  expense10 that the City puts on  the system.	You don' t have11 this outside of New York City.12 MR. CHEIGH:	And when you said13 you' re modest, how many buildings and units?	Could14 you say that again.15 MR. VINCOUR:	A total, I -- we  --16 that we own collectively, 76  units.17 MR. CHEIGH:	I' m sorry.18 MR. VINCOUR:	Seventy- six units.19 MR. CHEIGH:	Seventy- six units20 across how many buildings?21 MR. VINCOUR:	Three.22 MR. CHEIGH:	Three buildings.	And23 what -- do you have any preferential  rents?24 MR. VINCOUR:	Yes.	Because when25 we do a $ 50 , 000 renovation and the legal rent goes2 
2 over $ 2 , 000 , but I only can charge $ 1 , 600 , that' s a3 preferential rent.4 MR. CHEIGH:	So you' ve taken --5 MR. VINCOUR:	So anything that we6 renovate typically is preferential.7 MR. CHEIGH:	So you' ve taken8 advantage of the MCI increases, the  vacancy9 increases, the end unit apartment upgrade  increases10 and now you have several preferential  rents.11 MR. VINCOUR:	Yes.12 MR. CHEIGH:	And what percentage13 of your units do you feel like are below  market14 because of the rent stabilization restrictions  on15 the units?16 MR. VINCOUR:	Eighty or 90 .17 MR. CHEIGH:	So 90 percent of your18 units are actually charged the legal rent  --19 MR. VINCOUR:	Yes.20 MR. CHEIGH:	-- and not21 preferential?22 MR. VINCOUR:	Yes.	But when23 you' ve got a tenancy -- we bought the first24 building thinking they' d be all kinds of turnover.25 But I' m not harassing anybody.	If they leave, they2 
 2 leave.	If they pass away, they pass away.	But,3 you know, these people have been there 30  years.4 They' re not going anywhere.5 So that earlier comment about a6 $ 75 increase on a $ 700 unit, those people are going7 to find a way to stay there because there is   no8 alternative housing at $ 775 .	So I know --9 MR. CHEIGH:	There' s no10 alternative housing.11 MR. VINCOUR:	I know it' s a lot of12 money for somebody that' s only making $ 20 , 000 a13 year but it' s New York City.	It' s a $ 700 apartment14 and the water bill alone is $ 950 per apartment now 15	--16 MR. CHEIGH:	Um- hum.17 MR. VINCOUR: -- under the18 multi- family plan.19 You take an oil bill and divide  it20 by the number of units and you probably have $ 1 , 50021 to $ 2 , 000 a unit for oil.	You know, so it' s --22 MR. CHEIGH:	Water is --23 MR. VINCOUR:	-- so just be24 sympathetic to us.25 MR. CHEIGH:	Right.	Right.16 
2 And in terms of your, the --  what3 neighborhood is this in, you  said?4 MR. VINCOUR:	Washington Heights.5 MR. CHEIGH:	Washington Heights.6 And do you find are most of  these7 -- you said, most of your residents are long- time8 residents there, that they' ve been there for a long9 time --10 MR.	VINCOUR:	Yeah.11 MR. CHEIGH:	-- because of the12 service that you provide.13 MR. VINCOUR:	They' re families.14 They' ve grown up.	They' ve got second generation.15 I' ve got, you know, grand -- you know, then you' ve16 got abuses of SCRIE and DRIE where you' ve got17 grandmothers who aren' t there and the grandson' s18 living there and getting the SCRIE  benefit.19 MR. CHEIGH:	So you' re20 providing --21 MR. VINCOUR:	And, also, you know,22 there' s those programs, yes, they do get us our23 rent increases, but you have no idea of  the24 bureaucracy we have to go through to make sure  that25 on lease renewal that the SCRIE application gets  in2 
2 and that the City credits us.	And then you get the3 money after the fact rather than at the time of   the4 rent.	And so, you know, we live  with it.	That' s5 the business I' m in.6 But it' s -- you can try to be a7 good landlord and it' s still tough and you feel8 like you get beat up all the  time.9 MR. CHEIGH:	Well, thank you for10 providing your testimony and thank you  for11 providing affordable housing.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Harvey.13 MR. EPSTEIN:	Yeah, I also want to14 thank you for doing this for the last ten  years.15 I guess you decided you wanted to become a   property16 owner in New York?17 MR. VINCOUR:	Well, it was not a18 full time now it' s full time.19 MR. EPSTEIN:	It' s not a --20 MR. VINCOUR:	But it has to --  it21 has to be because I don' t think you can do it  as22 sort of a passive investor  anymore.23 MR. EPSTEIN:	Right.	And so, you24 know, we have people like you who, you have  three25 buildings, 76 units, 80 to 90 percent of them  are2 
2 rent stabilized.	And then we have people who  own3 thousands and tens of thousands of  units.4 Do you feel like people who are  in5 you situation and the people who are in  situations6 where they are large landlords who maybe have a  lot7 of unregulated units, should be treated exactly  the8 same?	Do you feel like you' re in the same9 situation as them?10 MR. VINCOUR:	I don' t think you --11 I don' t know.	But the problem is this is --  this12 is Rent Guidelines Board that goes across --  I13 don' t think all five boroughs should be treated the14 same.	But -- but that' s the way the law is.	So --15 MR. EPSTEIN:	So it' s really a16 good point.	You -- if you feel like the  boroughs17 shouldn' t be treated the same and you feel like18 people who are paying a certain low rent should  be19 treated differently.20 MR. VINCOUR:	Well, look, I think21 there' s a reality of operating -- the cost of22 operating a building.	If you have rent controlled23 units, you can apply for an MBR  --24 MR. EPSTEIN:	Right.25 MR. VINCOUR:	-- and that' s2 
2 7 - and- a- half percent.	And I don' t hear anybody up3 in arms about how unreasonable  that is.	But when4 you have a $ 400 or $ 500 rent- controlled apartment5 and your taxes go up every year and water' s  going6 up -- I have one rent- controlled tenant, and I  had7 to sit down with her.	She' s second generation.8 She inherited it.	And you run through our per  unit9 operating costs and her rent is below the cost  with10 no mortgage to maintain that  apartment.11 MR. EPSTEIN:	But you do have12 rent --13 MR. VINCOUR:	But what' s your14 response to that?	Is it -- are we supposed  to15 subsidize people to the point where they don' t even16 -- and that' s not even looking at a  capitalized17 cost of what it costs to build this  apartment.18 You know, to build new housing,19 what is $ 200 , $ 300 a square foot. If you had to20 capitalize that, how do you rationalize a $ 60021 rent --22 MR. EPSTEIN:	But you have legal23 remedies.	Like you could apply to the DHCR for  a24 hardship increase if you' re not making sufficient25 money; right?2 
2 ( Audience participation.)3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	What did he say?4 MR. VINCOUR:	I have no idea.5 MR. EPSTEIN:	You have no idea.6 MR. VINCOUR:	I don' t want to7 involve the government subsidizing me.8 MR. EPSTEIN:	Okay.9 MR. VINCOUR:	So I go into my10 pocket.11 MR. EPSTEIN:	So you don' t know if12 that' s available to you?13 MR. VINCOUR:	I have no idea.	But14 do you realize how much time it would take for   one15 apartment to try to see if there' s -- first of  all,16 a hardship means -- a hardship means that I  can' t17 afford to maintain my building.18 I bought these things with  extra19 money put aside.20 MR. EPSTEIN:	Right.21 MR. VINCOUR:	If I have to go  to22 the bank, I go to  the bank.	I' m not looking to the23 government to subsidize me.24 ( Applause.)25 MR. EPSTEIN:	Okay.	So you' re2 
2 figuring out a way to  make it.	So the question3 really becomes like, so these tenants who are  lower4 income are paying lower rents, you feel like  they5 should have to pay at a larger percentage  increase.6 But at the same time, property owners who  maybe7 have larger units of unregulated apartments,  maybe8 they should get a lower increase because they' re9 doing better.10 MR. VINCOUR:	I don' t know what11 unregulated apartments have to do with  regulated12 apartments.13 MR. EPSTEIN:	Well, if you14 have --15 MR. VINCOUR:	Is the idea that the16 rest of the market that can afford to,  should17 subsidize everybody else?	If that' s -- if that' s18 the mission here, then let' s not have this19 discussion.	Because that' s -- that' s --20 ( Applause.)21 MR. VINCOUR:	-- you know, if you22 want to take over the private  housing stock.	Let23 the City do it.	NYCHA does a great job.24 MR. EPSTEIN:	You know what,25 you' re asking us to subsidize you by allowing a2 
2 larger increases because you made an  economic3 decision --4 ( Audience participation.)5 MR. EPSTEIN:	-- Hold on.	You6 made an economic decision to purchase a building  --7 MS. CRUZ:	How could you say8 that --9 MR. EPSTEIN:	-- and we want to10 hear that.	But there is an economic decision  about11 what the cost to run that  building is.	And by12 running a building, it' s the whole cost of running13 the building from every single landlord.	So if14 some landlords are doing better, isn' t there some15 economic analysis that says, well, if you' re doing16 better, why should you have a huge  increase.17 And there' s only one or two rent18 regulated tenants left, rent stabilized tenants19 left, and you have mostly market- rate tenants,20 aren' t you in a different position than you, who21 have 90 percent of people who are rent  stabilized?22 MR. VINCOUR:	I think we' re just23 -- we' re at a philosophical --24 MR. EPSTEIN:	Okay.25 MR. VINCOUR:	-- block.	Because I2 
2 just don' t see -- if there' s costs associated with3 that unit, what' s the difference what' s happening4 with the others?5 MR. EPSTEIN:	Because you' re6 talking about needing to run the building  because7 the water goes up, the sewer goes up, the taxes  go8 up.9 MR. VINCOUR:	The water -- my10 water is charged on a per unit basis, not on   the11 building.12 MR. EPSTEIN:	You' re being --13 you' re paying your taxes for the building.	You' re14 paying the water and sewer for the  building.15 You' re paying your insurance for the building.16 You' re paying your costs for the building.17 MR. VINCOUR:	Yes.	But DEP18 charges me on a multi- family program based on19 units.	Because if I paid on a frontage basis  when20 I have six people in an apartment, it would be   5021 percent higher.	So I take their great deal of $ 95022 an apartment.23 MR. EPSTEIN:	So you' re24 distinguishing per unit versus your building.25 MR. VINCOUR:	Well, if you look at2 
2 that -- if you look at heating costs, if I  didn' t3 have, you know, there is a cost to heat per   square4 foot.	When people underwrite buildings, they look5 at per square foot, per apartment, per  door.6 MR. EPSTEIN:	Right.7 MR. VINCOUR:	So these costs do8 vary.9 MR. EPSTEIN:	So at some units,10 you' re doing better.	So that a higher rent, at  a11 $ 1 , 600 rent that you' re paying versus the $ 80012 rent, you' re doing better at that $ 1 , 600 rent than13 you are at the $ 800 rent.14 MR. VINCOUR:	Yeah.	So what.	I' m15 still not getting a return on my  investment.16 MR. EPSTEIN:	Okay.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	First,19 just to clear the air with this hardship  fallacy20 that the landlords can apply for.	You need a tax21 certiori in order to complete your application  for22 the State.	And as we' ve had testimony from -- from23 Ms. Seigel, is that it -- you can' t get  it.24 All right. So your application  is25 DOA, basically.	So you' re never going to get a2 
2 hardship.	And we' ve had testimony from DHCR that3 confirms this.	That there' s a -- there' s a4 dwindling backload because the owners aren' t filing5 because they can' t get the City to do the  certiori.6 So the hardship just doesn' t work.7 Second, I' d like to thank the8 tenant members for bringing out testimony from  you9 that really supports the plight of the  landlords10 and really illustrated the cost structure and  the11 anatomy, so to speak, of small property owners  and12 their properties.	So I want to thank them  for13 helping to promote a rent  increase.14 Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.16 MR.

ENGEL:	Good morning.18 My name is Matt Engel and I  am19 vice president of Langston Property Services.20 For 65 years my firm has  provided21 third- party property management services for22 clients throughout the City.23 Langston currently manages 8 , 00024 apartments scattered throughout 250 buildings.	Of25 the apartments, approximately 95 percent of  them2 
2 would be considered affordable housing.	The vast3 majority of these properties are in the Bronx  and4 upper Manhattan.5 The average one- bedroom apartment6 rent in our portfolio is $ 710 . The average7 two- bedroom is $ 835 per month.	Nearly 80 percent8 of our apartments are below the $ 1 , 000 mark.9 The margins on most of  these10 properties are slim to none. Most of our  clients11 own only one property and the typical property  is12 about 45 apartments.	Costs continue to rise for13 these properties and with nearly every item,  the14 cost is unavoidable; taxes, water, insurance,  the15 continuation of high heating fuel costs are  all16 numbers that no property owner, no matter  how17 efficient they run their property, can afford  --18 can avoid.19 Repairs and maintenance and the20 super' s salary is no longer the significant factor21 in a building. Operating, repairs and  maintenance22 in aging housing are more than significant and  eat23 up any remaining revenue.	It is not uncommon to24 operate in the red.25 This does not take into  account2 
2 any capital improvements.	Gas or oil conversions3 required by the Mayor' s ban on 6 oil, can result  in4 capital costs in excess of $ 75 , 000 , even without5 replacing the burner or the boiler.	With no monies6 left, the idea of coming up with these kinds  of7 capital is incomprehensible for most  owners.8 And while the system of  rent9 regulation is unfair to owners as it is,  continues10 -- one segment of the population continues to  place11 a back breaking, unfair burden on the  system.12 Super low rent tenants with --  in13 many cases rents that are nearly  unimaginable,14 restrict and choke the financials of a  building.15 On one building I manage  on16 Trinity Avenue, on one floor of the building  the17	rents are as follows:	$ 483 , $ 542 , $ 507 , $ 630 .	How18 can one expect an owner to be able to his   financial19 obligations while still having the ability  to20 perform repairs?21 The low rent supplement is22 imperative to bring these rents in line with  the23 rest of the tenants who are already still  below24 market.	These extra dollars can mean the25 difference between barely breaking even and  being18 
2 completely under water.3 Each year small property owners4 come before this board to ask for a fair  shake.5 Our expenses are controlled by government, the  free6 market and the increasing maintenance costs  of7 properties for buildings built 80 years  ago.8 Yet unlike in nearly every city,9 their income is restricted. They do not see  their10 income rise along with their expenses11 automatically.12 The decision is made by this  body13 and I come before you to plead to you that it   truly14 does matter.	The percentage points you approve15 make the difference between a building which  has16 the necessary income to meet its ordinary  operating17 expenses and one that does not.18 Still, the most important item you19 have before you is the low rent supplement,  which20 can improve the poor balance of rents  between21 tenants and, actually, help save neighborhoods  in22 New York' s lower income areas.23 For 65 years my firm has  provided24 affordable housing in this City.	Adequate rent25 increases to preserve the City' s housing stock is2 
2 vital to continuing the trend. The $ 75 low rent3 supplement is critical to the future of  our4 affordable housing stock.5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Matt.6 ( Applause.)7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Harvey.8 Question for you.9 MR. EPSTEIN: So I -- I hear  what10 you' re saying about needing -- you' re talking about11 a low rent supplement.	I' m just trying to figure12 out how you balance this out.13 So are you saying what people  who14 have -- you have a higher percentage of  market15 rents that should affect whether you should have  a16 higher increase.	If you are lower rent, it  should17 affect what those increases are  looking like.	Are18 you saying that' s what the balance you' re asking us19 to consider?20 MR. ENGEL:	No.	I' m suggesting21 that a Guidelines' increase should follow in  line22 with operating expenses.	But that a low rent,23 which is substantially below even the cost  of24 operating that unit, has to be brought  up.25 As has been brought up, I  think,2 
2 earlier today, the ability for an owner to keep  up3 where the costs on a -- on a unit are, you   know,4 far exceed that one --  those apartments.	I mean,5 as you can see in my speech, you know, I' m  not6 talking about one out of 17 apartments in the  East7 Village here.	I' m talking about 50 - unit buildings8 where, you know, 15 units might be below $ 575  a9 month.10 MR. EPSTEIN:	So -- so what you' re11 saying is you think there' s a need to balance  out12 the low rents. You need them higher. My question  to13 you though is, if there are buildings which  have14 higher rents, right, which are then subsidizing  the15 building and making it more profitable, shouldn' t16 we take that into consideration if you' re asking us17 to take into consideration the lower  rents?18 MR. ENGEL:	Well, no, I would --  I19 would -- sorry.	I would suggest that if a rent  is20 below market, a rent increase is necessary.	And if21 it is above market, then the rent increase will  be22 somewhat irrelevant and theoretically, a23 preferential rent will result and it won' t hurt the24 tenant.25 MR. EPSTEIN:	So for those higher2 
2 units then we don' t -- you don' t think those are3 appropriate increases because the low ones  are4 really the ones you' re focusing on?5 MR. ENGEL:	No, actually, I think6 that' s not what I said.	I think what I said is,  if7 they the rents do increase, then they won' t  be8 passed through to tenants because they' re above the9 market.10 MR. EPSTEIN:	And those buildings11 with having a lot of vacant, deregulated  apartments12 in those buildings, does that make it -- is that  a13 consideration?14 MR. ENGEL:	I -- I don' t have a15 deregulated unit --16 MR. EPSTEIN:	You don' t.17 MR. ENGEL:	-- in the Bronx.18 MR. EPSTEIN:	All right.19 Thank you.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for your22 testimony.23 I' m curious how a property manager24 interprets the line of questioning that you  were25 just subjected to.	Balancing out a high rent2 
2 against a low rent, to me strikes a dissonant  chord3 that the tenant member is trying to cap what  kind4 of income, net operating income, this type  of5 property can -- can generate.6 How would that sit with your7 clients?8 MR. ENGEL:	Yeah.	I mean, like I9 said, I manage for most of my clients own one,   two,10 three buildings at most.	They' ve been in their11 family maybe for a generation in  many cases.	And12 the concept of the -- that a bottom line  income13 should be restricted by definition to them would  be14 a crazy concept.	You know -- you know, being  in15 the United States that they look to this  --16 ( Applause.)17 MR. ENGEL:	-- to this industry18 that they thought this is a business investment  I19 may get involved in.	You know, this will be  my20 pension.	I was a teacher in New York City for   3521 years.	I saved up enough money.	I bought a22 25 - unit building in the Bronx and I said, this is23 going to be my nest egg.	I' m going to provide24 good, affordable housing and my taxes are going  to25 go, they' re going to support the fire department,2 
2 the police department and I' ll be able to earn  my3 return.4 So, I think, the concept of --  of5 restricting the possible net operating income  that6 one can make is -- it seems to be, you   know,7 inappropriate, you know, in our  country.8 ( Applause.)9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Harvey.11 MR. EPSTEIN:	I guess, do you12 think we have a responsibility to balance those  --13 their income versus the -- the expense of the  cost14 -- for the cost for tenants living in the Bronx   to15 continue to live in those units?16 As you know, the Bronx is  the17 lowest income borough in the -- in  New York.	And18 it' s one of the lowest income places in the  United19 States.	Eleven thousand evictions a year in  201220 in the Bronx.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Excuse me.22 MR. EPSTEIN:	And do you think23 that' s a factor we should be looking at  when24 determining what kind of increases we should  be25 deciding on?2 

23	Chair.45
MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.	Mr.The fact that --MR. EPSTEIN:	That' s a question to
6 him, not to you.	It' s a question to him.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	All right.	He8 asked it to Matt.9 MR. ENGEL:	Could you repeat the10 question?11 MR. EPSTEIN:	Eleven thousand12 evictions in the Bronx in 2012 , Bronx residents are13 low income disproportionately.	And do you think14 that' s a factor we should look at when determining15 what kind of Guidelines increase we should  pass?16 MR. ENGEL:	No.	I think that17 11 , 000 evictions means that maybe there' s a18 situation where the government should look  for19 other opportunities to assist.	But I think the20 forcing of restriction on income in a -- in   a21 private sector industry doesn' t seem appropriate in22 the United States.23 MR. EPSTEIN:	Thank you.24 ( Applause.)25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,6 
2Matt.3City Council Speaker, Christine4Quinn.5( Applause.)6MS. QUINN:	Thank you.7It' s fun to see a council alum,if8 I can just digress for one  second.9 Carol, thank you for your10 continued service to the City of New York in  this11 new role.	I bet it makes Land Use hearings  look12 like a piece of cake.13 Anyway.	Thank you all for having14 me here today and for giving me this opportunity  to15 speak about the issues that affect so many  New16 Yorkers, tenants and building owners.17 Before I start on the substance  of18 my recommendations for the rent increases, I  want19 to comment on the lack of public hearings  this20 year.	I feel very strongly that public input  from21 all stakeholders is of the utmost importance to  the22 Rent Guidelines Board annual decision.	That' s why23 having multiple hearings, including hearings in24 multiple boroughs is really critical.25 The only way the RGB can  hear8 
2 every voice is they make sure every voice has  an3 opportunity that is to testify in a space that  is4 convenient for them.5 It' s my understanding that the6 board has said that outer borough events have  not7 always been well attended and at times  poorly8 attended.	If previous events have been under9 attended, perhaps the RGB should find ways  to10 increase attendance instead of simply giving up  and11 canceling other borough events.12 As I understand it, --13 ( Applause.)14 MS. QUINN:	-- the recent hearing15 in the voice had 200 plus individuals  at it.	And I16 just want to offer the council members'  offices,17 other elected officials, tenant advocates, tenant18 associations and others would be happy  to19 coordinate and outreach to bring more folks out  to20 the hearings.21 I also want to take a minute  to22 reiterate my support for Assemblymember Brian23 Kavanaugh and State Senator Dan Squadron' s Rent24 Guidelines Reform Bill.	The Council passed a25 resolution last year --2 
2 ( Applause.)3 MS. QUINN:	-- calling on the4 State and the Assembly to pass this bill and I   have5 stood with tenants and advocates in support of  it.6 I believe the Rent Guidelines7 Board appointee should have the advice and  consent8 of the City Council.	Since the board is balancing9 the needs of owners and tenants, its  appointee10 should have broad support from the Mayor and  the11 City Council no matter who the Mayor is and  no12 matter who is on the City  Council.13 ( Applause.)14 MS. QUINN:	And now I want to  talk15 about the decision facing the board as it  relates16 to rents and possible rent increases.17 This year I am, again, calling  for18 a rent freeze.	During the course of the  recession19 and the recovery, there have been no rent  freezes.20 And, in fact, it seems that none of the  increases21 passed during this time have even taken tenants  and22 the impacts of the recession on them  into23 consideration.	And this, despite the fact, that24 the recession has hurt tenants more than  owners.25 Multi- family apartment building2 
2 prices are down five percent from 2005 but  are3 still 81 percent higher than they were in 2000 .4 So, yes, there was a housing bubble but it is   clear5 that prices have been particularly resilient in  the6 City, especially -- and good thing, compared  to7 other cities across the country.8 Since 2005 , landlords have seen9 their costs as a percentage of revenues,  decrease.10 In other words, less and less of their  revenues11 appear to be going to  expenses.12 Net operating income has increased13 since 2005 at an annualized rate of 5 . 7 percent of14 a total increase of 54 percent over that --  5515 percent, excuse me, over that time.	In other16 words, profits are increasing every year  and17 increasing faster than inflation.18 Inflation rates nationwide have19 been less than 2 percent since the beginning of  the20 year.	Rent should be kept low to parallel  the21 economy.22 Interest rates are also very low,23 allowing owners to refinance or get repair lows  at24 very low cost.25 But tenants have not fared at  all2 
2 well in comparison during the  recession.3 Unemployment rates in this City are still too  high.4 It' s better than a year ago but the growth  is5 modest.	Unemployment is still too high.6 Median income growth for rent7 stabilized households between 2007 and 2010 , was8 less than one percent per year, lower  than9 inflation.	Rent stabilized household incomes are10 essentially stagnant.11 Median household income for12 renters is less than $ 38 , 000 , according to the13 Furman Center.14 In 2011 , 58 percent of tenants in15 rent stabilized units paid more than 30 percent  of16 their income in rent and one- third of renter17 households in the City paid 50 percent or more  of18 their income for rent in 2011 .	It' s clear from19 this data that owners have fared well and  tenants20 have not during the recession.	It' s time we21 finally considered the tenants and we need a  rent22 freeze.23 Thank you very much.24 ( Applause.)25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.2 
2 Questions?3 Steve.4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Speaker Quinn,5 thank you for your testimony.	Good luck with your6 campaign.7 MS. QUINN:	Thank you.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Two things.	You9 have a policy position for creating housing  for10 those tenants who make their communities  great.11 I' m think I' m paraphrasing your -- your speech12 here.	Are you suggesting that there would be  a13 certain residency requirement for those tenants  as14 a prerequisite?15 MS. QUINN:	I' m not sure what,16 exactly, you' re referencing from.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.18 MS. QUINN:	Of course --19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	Well,20 this might actually be from your website.	Your21 policy position --22 MS. QUINN:	Let me just interrupt23 for a second.24 My -- the policy statement here  is25 that, if you look around the City, there  are2 
2 neighborhood that are just doing, you  know,3 unbelievably high prices and sales, in  rents,4 neighborhoods that not so long ago, that wasn' t the5 case at all.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No, granted.	And7 this was clear.8 MS. QUINN:	Not so long -- wait,9 wait.	Not so long ago, neighborhoods that  people10 might not have really wanted to  live in.	My point11 is, we need to have housing options on the  table12 that allow the tenants and residents of  those13 neighborhoods, the folks who were there for  the14 long haul who helped make those  neighborhoods15 great, giving them the option to stay in  those16 neighborhoods.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Which is18 terrific.19 ( Applause.)20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Now do you21 have --22 MS. QUINN:	Right.	And at23 times --24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	What kind of25 residence requirements are you proposing?	How long2 
2 do they have to stay?3 MS. QUINN: Different -- different4 proposals and different plans have different5 options.	At times, working in collaboration with6 the Community Boards and others, you have  Community7 Board preference in that.8 But most of the decisions are  made9 on income, depending on what programs we  are10 putting in place.	But, clearly, if you bring to  a11 neighborhood housing options that are going  to12 allow people to stay there, that is going to be   a13 great resource for the City --14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Absolutely.15 MS. QUINN:	-- but an even better16 resource for the residents of that  neighborhood.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I just had a --  I18 think it' s a wonderful policy position or however19 you want to define that.	I was just curious as  to20 how you were going to frame a residency  requirement21 and if you --22 MS. QUINN:	I mean that' s a --23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- you answered24 that question.	That' s fine.25 MS. QUINN:	Okay.2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Now in your recent3 State of the City address, you proposed a cap  on4 real estate taxes in exchange for  landlords5 maintaining affordable housing.6 MS. QUINN:	Um- hum.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I think that' s8 terrific.	Because in light of your acceptance  that9 revenues are not sufficient to cover expenses  to10 support --11 MS. QUINN:	I' m sorry.	I can' t12 see but I' m having a little trouble hearing you.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m sorry.	I' ll14 slow down.15 In light of your acceptance that16 revenue streams are not sufficient to  cover17 expenses to preserve affordable housing, how do  you18 suggest we address the realities of  expenses19 increasing faster than Rent Guideline Board  rent20 increases?	Of course, we realize you' re not the21 Mayor yet, but we just want to know what you  --22 MS. QUINN:	Well, I think --23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- what do you24 suggest we do now?25 MS. QUINN:	Let me just, first2 
2 of all say, I' m not sure that the framework of3 what you' re saying about the proposal around a4 potential property tax cap to create long- term5 affordability --6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.7 MS. QUINN:	-- where you' ve taken8 that is not necessarily, I think, accurate to  my9 perspective on it.	You jumped to the --  that10 proposal is somehow a validation of some people' s11 position that rents have not kept up with  expenses.12 So let me back into your  question.13 I do not believe that there  is14 clear evidence.	But, again, if we want to  have15 landlords open up all of their books, we might  have16 more facts and numbers to look at  --17 ( Applause.)18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, you see,19 I' m just --20 MS. QUINN:	-- to really know21 that.22 MR. SCHLEIDER: I' m just confused23 by what you said --24 ( Audience participation.)25 ( Applause.)2 
2 MS. QUINN:	So I don' t --3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- in your State4 of the City speech.5 ( Audience participation.)6 MS. QUINN:	-- I don' t -- wait a7 minute.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Where you put this9 that in order to preserve affordable housing,  you10 would put a cap on  property taxes.	And I imagine11 it' s a quid pro quo for -- for having  affordable12 housing in an apartment building.13 MS. QUINN:	So first of all, let14 me just re- state.	Your assertion that I am  saying15 or implying or indicating, that expenses are  going16 up more than rents, as I indicated in my   testimony,17 is not true.	One.18 Two, we put out about a four  point19 plan in the State of the City to create  and20 preserve affordable housing. Part of that is  the21 creation of 40 , 000 new middle income housing units22 over the next --23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yeah, I --24 MS. QUINN: With all due  respect,25 you asked me a question and I' m going to answer  it.2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m sure.3 MS. QUINN:	Part of that is4 developing new housing.	Part of that is taking  on5 the challenge that in some neighborhoods in  this6 City, it is expensive to build new  housing.7 Therefore, as programs come out of things  like8 80 - 20 , we are going to work with those landlords to9 keep units affordable permanently in those10 neighborhoods.11 ( Applause.)12 MS. QUINN:	The question here is13 not rents and expenses.	The question that has led14 us to this additional part of our  affordable15 housing platform, is the reality that in  some16 neighborhoods in New York City now, building  new17 affordable housing is extraordinarily expensive.18 So let' s see what we can do with existing  housing19 residences to keep them permanently affordable  in20 those neighborhoods because I simply will not  yield21 to some people' s assertion that parts of Manhattan22 or other parts of the City will no longer  be23 affordable to working class New  Yorkers.24 And that' s what our plan is about.25 It is based on the reality of the expensiveness  of2 
2 building new not the fact that you attached it  to.3 ( Applause.)4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That' s fine.	Now5 if I just, by extension, once a property  is6 constructed and you provide this tax  exemption7 benefit --8 MS. QUINN:	This -- this tax9 exemption benefit is not for new  construction.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Fine.	Even11 better.12 MS. QUINN:	So -- but you need  to13 re- state your question.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Fine.15 MS. QUINN:	This is for existing16 built buildings that are coming out of a program  to17 keep them permanently affordable.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes, exactly what19 I' m saying because without --20 MS. QUINN:	No.	You said new21 construction.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Wait.	With -- all23 right.	So I mis -- I misunderstood your  new24 program.25 MS. QUINN:	Okay.2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I equated that3 with new construction.4 MS. QUINN:	Fair enough.5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But now I' m going6 back to my original premise --7 MS. QUINN:	Okay.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- which was to9 maintain affordability within existing structures,10 I -- I' m taking from this that you recognize  that11 in order to maintain affordable housing, the  City12 has to provide some sort of  subsidy.13 Granted you can pinpoint it  and14 say it has to be in this neighborhood and has to   be15 in that neighborhood.	Whatever.	But my takeaway16 is that you' re agreeing with the position that a17 subsidy is necessary in order to provide  affordable18 housing.19 MS. QUINN:	Not necessarily.	No.20 There are times when subsidies are necessary.	Yes.21 But to take -- what I think you' re trying to  take22 from that statement or belief to extrapolate  that23 there' s a larger subsidy or increase needed for all24 rent stabilized apartments is simply not  an25 accurate statement.2 
2 ( Applause.)3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That was not my4 intent.	That was not what I said.	And I also --5 MS. QUINN:	No, I said what I6 thought you were extrapolating to.7 MR. SCHLEIDER: Fine.	I8 understand.	I understand.	We both --9 MS. QUINN:	We' ve been there.10 We' ve danced this dance before, Steven.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- had some12 issues.	Yes.13 MS. QUINN:	We' re pretty clear on14 that.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Exactly.16 MS. QUINN:	And who' s leading when17 and who' s following when and what point we go  from18 waltz to fox trot.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	Now here' s20 maybe a philosophical question for  you.21 MS. QUINN:	All right.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The City budget.23 Okay.	From 2013 , $ 49 . 9 billion budget.	2014 , we24 have a $ 50 . 2 billion budget.	2015 , we have a25 projection of $ 52 . 9 billion.	Basically, we' re2 
2 increasing at a modest rate.	And these are the3 revenues coming in.4 MS. QUINN:	Um- hum.5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	We have expenses6 of $ 50 . 2 billion in 2013 , showing a shortfall7 against revenues.	We have expenses of $ 52 . 28 billion in 2014 , showing another shortfall.	And we9 have expenses in 2015 of $ 55 . 2 billion, effectively10 erasing any surplus the City has.11 Now those City expenses are12 increasing 2 . 8 percent from 2012 to 2013 .	They' re13 increasing 4 . 1 percent from 2013 to 2014 .	And14 they' re projected to rise 5 . 6 percent from 2014 to15 2015 .	Obviously, running a negative is  not16 sustainable.17 But I have a question  for you.	If18 we were to have the City subsidize tenants,  pick19 the tenants, who through some sort of means test  of20 what -- however, that couldn' t afford a rent21 increase --22 MS. QUINN:	That couldn' t afford a23 what?24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- couldn' t afford25 a rent increase.2 
2 MS. QUINN:	Okay.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Let' s say there4 was a couple of hundred thousand tenants like  this.5 They couldn' t afford a $ 35 or $ 40 rent increase.6 Multiply that out by $ 200 , 000 by 12 months.	It7 comes up roughly about $ 90 million. That' s . 038 percent of the projected increase in spending,  not9 of the budget, just of the increase in  spending,10 . 03 percent.	Why can' t the City do something to11 help the tenants?12 MS. QUINN:	I think the -- the13 question --14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	It' s a15 philosophical question.16 MS. QUINN:	It is.	And there' s17 another side to that philosophical question,  which18 is, it is an appropriate conversation  for19 government to have to talk about how we can  help20 folks who need help get housing and -- and  get21 housing they can afford.	And that' s why we have22 housing subsidy programs.23 Another philosophical way to look24 at your question is, we' re helping tenants in need.25 That' s appropriate.	That' s appropriate use in my2 
2 opinion, of taxpayer dollars to help New  Yorkers3 who need assistance.	It is not necessarily an4 appropriate use of taxpayer dollars to  help5 landlords make more money.6 ( Applause.)7 MS. QUINN:	That' s the flip side8 of your philosophical question.	It is not9 necessarily --10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	So11 you' re taking the position that government can12 dictate how much money or profit or return  a13 private owner can have; is that your  position?14 MS. QUINN:	My position is we are15 in a state of  housing emergency.	And based on16 that, this board exists and these rules  and17 regulations exist. And that is  the state.	And we18 are in that state. It' s yet documented again and19 that puts us in a situation where we are   focused,20 in my opinion, on the needs  of tenants.	And I' m21 not focused on the needs of using taxpayer  dollars22 to help landlords make more money.	Period.23 Nonetheless, when we are in a state of  housing24 emergency, as documented, under the confines of  the25 law.2

QUINN:	-- and note it on  our17 calendar.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And we would19 welcome that.20 MS. QUINN:	Okay.	We' re happy to21 do that.22 MR. EPSTEIN:	As we were.	You23 know, we were over over 200 tenants appearing  in24 the Bronx --25 MS. QUINN:	Which is terrific.2 
2 MR. EPSTEIN:	-- with 50 people3 testifying.	It was a really impressive event  that4 shows how important outer borough hearings  are.5 But there are some issues that6 have been brought up today I wanted your  opinion7 on.	And one is, what small property owners   here8 are talking about as a  poor tax.	It' s really for9 rents that are under $ 1 , 000 , having a much higher10 percentage increase -- much larger increase.	And I11 wanted your opinion on what you thought about  that12 as -- as a policy that the Guidelines Board  should13 incorporate this year.14 The second question is on15 buildings where there' s a lot of deregulated units,16 whether they' re private equity companies who are17 deregulating units or other landlords who have  a,18 you know, in your district where there' s -- when19 there' s few rent regulated tenants left in a  large,20 you know, it might be a 20 - unit building with two21 rent- regulated tenants left.22 What should the Guidelines Board23 look at when we' re seeing situations like that?24 MS. QUINN:	So just -- first on25 the question of the poor tax.	And, look, I think2 
2 that the ruling that -- that sustained the board' s3 position that you could create that, in essence,  a4 separate class, I accept the court' s ruling.	I5 disagree with it in the nature of its ruling but   it6 -- it has been determined so by  the court.	And7 that' s what it is.8 I have always, and remain  that9 today, in complete objection to the concept  and10 implementation of the poor tax.	It seems to me11 completely counterintuitive that tenants who are12 paying the lowest rent and have the least means  to13 pay rent, are going to end up with another --   with14 another tax assessed on them so to speak, that' s15 going to make it even harder  for them.	It just16 seems exactly the wrong place to be asking  people17 to take money out of their pocket when they have  so18 few resources in their pocket to begin  with.19 ( Applause.)20 MS. QUINN:	Now -- and it seems to21 me -- look, this is not a fact, this is just   my22 opinion.	It' s a way to try to push tenants who  are23 paying less rent out of buildings and then open  up24 those apartments for higher rents upon the  vacancy25 of that tenant.	Whether that' s deliberate or not,2 
2 that I think is what often can happen because  that3 extra amount may be just enough to make it so   that4 person just cannot keep up and will end up,  you5 know, homeless or having to double up in  some6 situation.7 The point you raise is one  we8 should explore. Because, actually, the courts' s9 ruling, notwithstanding I disagree with it,  may10 open up a position there for us to take  action11 relevant to those buildings.	I' ve not looked at12 this substantially and don' t, you know, have13 therefore looked at all of the details but it' s14 something we would be willing and more than  happy15 to follow up and take a look at the policy   impacts16 thereof.17 ( Applause.)18 MS. QUINN:	In as much as, now  the19 Council and the RGB can create classes,  apparently.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.21 MS. QUINN:	Thanks, very much.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Steve.23 MR.

CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:		A short one. MR. SCHLEIDER:	It is short.	ItOkay.	Am I to understand
6 correctly that in your mind every tenant that  pays7 a low rent and has been in occupancy for at   least8 five or six years of that apartment can' t afford  an9 increase?10 MS. QUINN:	That -- my belief is11 the vast majority of those  --12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No, wait, wait.13 But you said before, all  tenants.14 MS. QUINN:	I don' t believe the15 tenants -- let me just  be clear.	I believe the16 poor tax is an attempt to push low income  tenants17 who do not have financial ability to pay it, out  of18 their apartments so those rents can be  raised19 through those tenants being pulled out.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.21 MS. QUINN:	So, no, I do not22 believe the tenants that you will assess or  will23 attempt to assess a poor tax on, can afford  it.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.25 MS. QUINN:	Might you someday6 
2 find one tenant who will end up on the cover of   the3 New York Post who could pay  it, perhaps.	But I4 feel very confident saying, tenants who will  have5 to pay the poor tax cannot afford  it.6 ( Applause.)7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	So --8 MS. QUINN:	And it is wrong.9 ( Audience participation.)10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Are you saying11 that this is a de facto -- a de facto means   test.12 And, conversely, would you then support a  means13 test for all tenants?14 MS. QUINN:	I am saying it is  an15 attempt by landlords to find a back doorway  that,16 unfortunately, the court supported to levy  more17 charges on people who cannot afford it, to try  to18 get those low income tenants out of your  buildings19 so you can then raise the rents on those units  and20 eventually move them out of deregulation.	That' s21 what I believe.22 I would suspect we profoundly23 disagree.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I don' t profoundly25 disagree with anything.	I just want to make  sure2 
2 that I understand what you' re saying.3 MS. QUINN:	It' s not a means test.4 But it is a push- them- out- the- door mechanism, in my5 opinion.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.

LAPPIN:	Oh, well, you know.24 I was up half the night with my sick son so   you25 don' t have to.2 
2 Good morning, Chair Kimmel and3 Carol and other members of the  board.4 It' s wonderful to be here and to5 have this opportunity to testify today.6 I am Jessica Lappin, City7 Councilwoman.	I represent the Upper East Side  and8 Roosevelt Island.9 I' m going to submit full testimony10 but just give you some -- some brief points that  I11 wanted to make today.12 You know, there is a  perception13 that the Upper East Side is home to only  the14 wealthy.	And there are many, many people,15 particularly seniors in my district, who  depend16 upon rent protections to stay in their homes and  in17 many of the tenement homes along York  Avenue.18 This year, as you know  well,19 you' re proposing rent hikes between 3 - and- a- quarter20 percent to 6 - and- a- quarter percent for one- year21 leases and between 5 percent and 9 - and- a- half22 percent for two- year leases.23 These are very high, particularly24 in contrast to last year' s increases.	And while25 our economy has been getting better for some,  it2 
2 definitely has not been getting better for  tenants.3 They are having a tough time. More than half  of4 rent stabilized tenants earn less than $ 37 , 000 a5 year and one in five of the  estimated6 rent- regulated tenants live below the federal7 poverty level.8 And I will say, during  this9 recession, when I' ve been talking to tenants and10 constituents, I certainly have heard  firsthand11 about their really tough struggles to make  ends12 meet.13 So I am, as I have in the  past,14 I' m calling for a rent freeze. But I' m also calling15 for you to work with tenants, to talk to  the16 tenants when it comes to issues like  warehousing17 and, certainly, the poor tax, which we were  just18 discussing here at length.19 So I also should say that I  do20 support legislation to reform the Rent  Guidelines21 Board and the City Council resolution, which  I22 co- sponsored, that passed last year.23 But I would just leave you  with24 saying that it is really in your hands to  protect25 and to help these tenants that do make up  the2 
2 middle class, the working class in our City  and3 make it the City that it is.	And I don' t believe4 we would be a great world power if it wasn' t  for5 the diversity that we have here.	Diversity comes6 in so many forms and we ask for you to   protect7 these tenants.8 Thank you.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.10 Any questions?11 ( No response.)12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 MS. LAPPIN:	Right.

GOODSON:	Okay.	Yeah.	I just24 want to quickly first say, if you' re sitting out25 here listening, what becomes really apparent  right2 
2 away is there' s something very dysfunctional going3 on here because this whole process seems  to4 continually pit truly struggling landlords versus5 versus truly -- tenants and seems to put up a   smoke6 screen that keeps the affluent above and out  of7 this whole procedure.8 ( Applause.)9 MR. GOODSON:	Again, my name is10 Dale Goodson.	I have lived in my rent  stabilized11 apartment at the corner of Avenue A and 12 th  Street12 of the East Village since 1991 .13 I moved to New York in the  mid14 ' 80 s from Seattle to pursue my career as an artist15 and freelance writer and I' m now 60 years old.16 My work has always had a  topical17 and socially conscience bent and, consequently,  was18 not always the most commercially viable.19 I was drawn to New York because  of20 the vibrant mix of cultures, thriving  artistic21 scene and an economically feasible housing22 environment.	You didn' t have to be rich to be part23 of the fabric of the  City.24 In 2000 an opportunity came up  to25 work as a homeless outreach worker at the  Port2 
2 Authority bus terminal and that work became  the3 focus of my live.	Again, not the most financially4 lucrative job but tremendously satisfying and  made5 possible by a rent stabilized  apartment.6 Unfortunately, 2008 took its toll7 and that program was cut. In addition, in 2005 ,  my8 apartment building was sold.	The new owners began9 turning vacated apartments into market- rate housing10 for NYU students and the culture of the  building11 began to change immediately.	To date, about a12 third of the 40 apartments in our building  have13 gone market rate.	Virtually, all of the culturally14 diverse and senior tenants have moved out as  the15 building has turned into a college  dorm.16 I am now working part time  and17 make less than I did in 2008 . The social  work18 opportunities and artistic scene which once19 supported me, have all but dried up. I have  lived20 in New York City longer than any other place in   my21 life.	New York is my home but the  relentless22 increase by the Rent Guidelines Board -- are  rent23 increases are taking their toll.	It never stops,24 even in the worst of economic  times.25 I feel the vibrant cultural mix  of2 
2 New York is fast disappearing, giving way to  a3 culture of the affluent. Given this trend, I  know4 of no neighborhood in the five boroughs I  could5 afford to move to.	Though my rent is low  compared6 to market rate, it is all that I can afford   and7 each year becomes more precarious and  unviable.8 My landlord on the other hand,  has9 an ever increasing number of market rate  apartments10 to draw on for revenue, including  three11 street- level businesses in our building, as well as12 other properties.	And yet, every year the Rent13 Guidelines Board approves more money on his  behalf.14 This is a destructive policy  which15 not only brings hardships to those who can  least16 afford it but is fast turning New York City and  the17 East Village, in particular, into a high  income18 playground.19 Please do not approve this year' s20 extreme and unaffordable increases.	And on the $ 7521 one time -- or increase that is being proposed,  in22 2008 , I was making $ 33 , 000 .	Now I' m making $ 23 , 00023 a year and that $ 75 increase would be a  killer.24 Thank you.25 ( Applause.)2

CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.Eva Mallis.MS. MALLIS:	Good morning. My name is Eva Mallis.Can you hear me?	And I' m an owner
8 and operator of buildings in  Queens.9 My family has owned and  managed10 property in Queens for over  50 years.	We take11 pride in our management and I personally  maintain12 properties to a level that I would find  acceptable13 should I choose to live there  myself.14 I am here to strongly urge  the15 board to vote for equitable rent increases and  a16 low rent adjustment for the coming Rent  Guideline17 period.18 I would like to walk you through  a19 very simple calculation that I did  recently.20 I chose one average size  building21 for this exercise. I totaled this building' s22 operating expenses for the year 2012 and  divided23 that number by the total number of rooms in  the24 building.	The average operating cost per room  is25 equal to $ 298 per month.8 
2 Rephrase, $ 298 is my break even3 point for one room. It is my belief each  apartment4 should, at a minimum, carry its  own weight.	In5 other words, contribute its prorated share of  the6 expenses.	But this, of course, is not the  case7 otherwise I wouldn' t be standing here.8 Now I' d like to share with you the9 profile of some of my rent stabilized  tenants.10 There is a young man in his mid 30 s who' s been11 occupying a three- room apartment for over 15 years.12 His current rate is $ 582 . And as we just discussed,13 the average break even operating cost per room  is14 $ 298 .	Therefore, a three- room apartment has a15 break even point of $ 894 . His rent is only covering16 65 percent of its total operating  share.17 This gentleman resides in Queens.18 When he' s not shuttling back to his -- back  and19 forth to his second home  in Cypress.	This20 gentleman can well afford a low rent  adjustment.21 Or there' s the college professor22 in her mid 40 s, who has been occupying a three- room23 apartment for over 20 years.	Her rent stabilized24 rent is $ 707 .	And, again, the average operating25 cost of her three rooms is $ 894 .	She' s only2 
2 covering 79 percent of her carrying  costs.3 She, too, spends times in her4 second home, this one in Connecticut.	The college5 professor can readily afford a low rent  adjustment.6 What I learned is the  following:7 There are at least a  dozen8 apartments that are not paying their fair  share.9 They are being subsidized by their fellow  rent10 stabilized tenants and a small number  of11 unregulated units.12 And I would like to point  out,13 this calculation does not include the cost  of14 refurbishing our rapidly aging elevator, converting15 our No. 6 oil furnace to gas, installing  the16 mandated backflow preventer or exterminating the17 occasional bed bug infestation.18 The current rent roll does not19 adequately cover these expenses.	In fact, my real20 estate taxes and water alone went up 17 . 9 percent21 from the year 2011 to 2012 .22 Rhetoric aside, does this seem23 fair to you?	There are a handful of  deregulated24 apartments but not enough to carry the  rent25 stabilized units. It' s time each rent stabilized2 
2 tenant, at a minimum, cover their  fair share.	They3 enjoy a clean building, a well -- an  attentive4 superintendent.	They enjoy hearing the clanking of5 the heat as soon as the  temperature drops.	They6 must pay their fair share.7 It' s absolutely imperative the8 Rent Guideline Board adopt the $ 75 minimum rent9 adjustment.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Malice, I' m11 going to ask you -- I' m going to ask you to draw  to12 a close.13 MS. MALLIS:	I thank you for your14 time and consideration.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Oh, thank you.17 Mr. Schleider.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for your19 testimony.20 I did just did a  quick21 calculation.	And the $ 3 , 570 or so per unit per22 year, seems awfully low.	You said it' s an elevator23 building.24 MS. MALLIS:	$ 298 per room.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I understand it.2 
2 But times that by 12 , it' s $ 3 , 500 - 70 something3 dollars a year.4 MS. MALLIS:	Twelve being the5 month -- yes, yes.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The month.	Okay.7 Fine.8 The -- which is very low  so,9 obviously, you' re doing the management yourself?10 MS. MALLIS:	I am.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	So if you12 were to factor in a management fee, you' d be  even13 more under water.	So you' re doing all the14 management yourself?15 MS. MALLIS:	Correct.16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	And how17 much time do you spend  managing?18 MS. MALLIS:	I would say I  spend19 an average of four to five hours a day, four days   a20 week.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	So it' s not22 a casual --23 MS. MALLIS:	No.	Not at all.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	It' s very25 intensive.	This is in addition to whatever  else2 
2you do?3MS.MALLIS:	I' m a parent, as4well.5MR.SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	And full6time.7MS.MALLIS:	That' s a full- time8job.9MR.SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	Right.So10your operatingcostsare essentially much higher11because in ourfigures here, we would -- we  would,12if not impute,but wewould certainly account for13 management fees, something to pay yourself.	So14 you' re working, basically, for free?15 MS. MALLIS:	Well, as a part owner16 of the property, I am -- I am reaping the   benefits17 of whatever potential profits may be  reaped.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Potential.19 MS. MALLIS:	But as I just pointed20 out, we also have all these huge enormous  expenses21 coming down the pike that we have to begin  to22 escrow for in anticipation of -- of replacing  the23 elevator and the No. 6 oil furnace  --24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I understand.25 MS. MALLIS:	-- and, et cetera.13 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So you' re rolling3 everything back in that you can into the  building4 against the eventuality of having to do a  capital5 infusion?6 MS. MALLIS:	That' s right.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.8 Thank you.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.10 MS. MALLIS:	Thank you.11 ( Applause.)12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Daniel Cervini.13 Who will be followed by  Robert14 Klein.15 MR. CERVINI:	Good afternoon.16 My name is Daniel Cervini.	And17 I' m a resident of an SRO unit at 212 West 91 st18 Street in Manhattan since August 2003 .	I' ve been a19 resident since August 2003 .20 I believe it is necessary that  the21 cost of rent be held at its present amount for   the22 following reasons:23 1 .	The local and national economy24 is still reeling from the worst meltdown since  the25 Great Depression of the 1930 s.2 
2 I hold a Bachelors degree and  have3 additional formal training in paralegal and4 accounting fields.	Despite applying to well over5 1 , 000 , if not 2 , 000 jobs, in recent memory, I have6 been forced to accept almost whatever position  that7 will allow me to pay  my rent.	Almost all of these8 positions have been temporary assignments9 contracted by third- party agencies.10 It has been my experience that11 most companies in New York are still afraid to  hire12 permanent employees given they are uncertain  of13 what lies ahead for them economically.14 Jumping from temporary position to15 temporary position has made it extremely  difficult16 to reestablish and maintain personal  financial17 stability.18 I am by no  means alone.	I have a19 number of educated and hard working friends who  are20 attorneys, paralegals, accountants and business21 managers who are finding it very difficult to  make22 ends meet in these unusual and grueling  times.23 Despite aggressively pursuing employment, several24 of my friends have already lost their homes,  places25 they have lived at for many  years.2 
2 Regardless of whatever the media3 is reporting the official unemployment rate to  be4 or what the Dow is at, the truth is the majority   of5 New Yorkers are only scratching the surface  of6 recovery from the turmoil of 2008 and 2009 .7 While perhaps not unemployed, many8 people are underemployed.	Opportunities that allow9 people to utilize their skill sets and  education10 within a full- time employment capacity, is lacking11 on a large scale.12 While actively pursing work, I13 volunteer to support my community in a number  of14 ways.	I volunteer several time a week for a   number15 of months as a tutor at the Star Learning  Center.16 I have also volunteered many times as a  sighted17 guide for blind athletes through the Achilles  Track18 Club.19 Irrespective of my previous20 testimony, my landlord is doing  just fine.	There21 are many units in my building which  are vacant.	It22 is extremely reasonable to rent out  vacant23 apartments before collecting a higher rent  on24 occupied apartments.25 Furthermore, my landlord has2 
2 repeatedly offered money to long- standing tenants3 of my building to move out.	I strongly advocate4 that rents not be increased.5 Thank you for listening to  my6 testimony.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 ( Applause.)9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.11 Daniel, there' s a question.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m sorry.	I13 didn' t catch you. What is that you do?14 MR. CERVINI:	I' m a paralegal.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	A paralegal.16 MR. CERVINI:	That' s what --17 that' s what I' m currently doing.

SCHLEIDER:	Wait, wait a22 minute.23 Speak a little slower and  back24 away from the mic.	I' m having trouble hearing25 because it' s -- the echo in here is too  much.2 
2 MR. CERVINI:	Okay.	After the Dow3 dropped from about 14 , 000 to 6 - and- a- half thousand,4 and there was an employment -- an  unemployment5 rate, realistic unemployment rate of about  206 percent, I was -- I  was temping.	And I was working7 at significantly lower than what the market  rate8 is.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	All right.10 Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.12 ( Applause.)13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Robert Klein.14 Mr. Klein will be followed by15 Brenda Irizarry.16 And Andrew Hoffman.17 MR. KLEIN:	Board members, good18 afternoon.19 I' m one of the new owners of the20 small mixed- use building with eight residential21 units.	Four of these units, or 50 percent of  the22 apartments, in this building were previously23 classified by the Building Department as Class  B24 units, even though they have bathrooms  and25 kitchens.	The type of cooking facility, which  is2 
2 not a fixed stove, apparently led to  this3 classification.4 These tenants have been registered5 with the DHCR for decades and have all had  standard6 rent stabilized leases. There is no record of  any7 of these units being used as SRO, hotel  or8 transient occupancy housing.9 Due to the Building Department10 Class B designation, however, these units  are11 subject to SRO Rent Guidelines.	This has created a12 severe hardship in that alternate years there is  a13 zero percent rent increase allowed for these  SROs.14 And on alternate years for these units, there  is15 also a zero percent rent increase allowed for  units16 in this building because of the stipulation in  the17 Rent Guidelines that a permanent rent stabilized  or18 rent controlled tenants constitute fewer than  8519 percent of all units in a building used as a   home,20 residence or sleeping place, there will also be  a21 zero percent rent increase.22 Therefore, for these four23 apartments there are presently no rent  increases24 ever allowed on any of them for existing  tenants.25 Tenants presently occupying these apartments have2 
2 resided there from over three to over 30  years.3 There is no other situation in housing where  rent4 could be frozen like this while expenses  continue5 to increase based upon market conditions.6 The present SRO guidelines were7 not primarily established for small  residential8 buildings like this but for much larger  hotel9 buildings and rooming houses.10 We are asking that small  units11 like this, building consisting of eight units,  that12 you consider that these units, for their  SRO13 housing or SRO apartments, be granted the same  type14 of rent stabilization increases as the general  rent15 stabilized units on the market.16 And, further, that the stipulation17 prohibiting any rent increase on these  apartments,18 based upon the rent regulated makeup of  the19 building, be eliminated, again, for small  buildings20 like this.21 I think, you know, there is  a22 difference in the management of large  buildings,23 large SRO hotels, rooming houses versus  small24 buildings that may have four apartments,  eight25 apartments, ten apartments and the rules for  one,2 
2 although they may be good for the public  in3 general, may be detrimental to the small owner  and4 small operator.5 Thank you for your consideration.6 ( Applause.)7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.8 Klein.9 MS. CRUZ:	I have a question.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz.11 MS. CRUZ:	So -- so with these12 limitations, how -- could you describe a little  bit13 more how you' ve been making the building work for14 you?15 MR. KLEIN:	Well, again, we' ve had16 it just about a year.	So, you know, we have put  a17 lot of money into initially and, you know, this  was18 an area that we are exploring as far as what to   do.19 We didn' t realize the ramifications of this kind of20 unit when we first came into this  situation.21 And, you know, again, to  have22 certain apartments arbitrarily be given a zero  rent23 increase ongoing, just doesn' t make sense.	I don' t24 think it was within the spirit of what  the25 original, you know, SRO guidelines, you know,  were2

MS. CRUZ:	Thank you. CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Harvey.MR. EPSTEIN:	Can you just give us
6 some more details.	You own only one building;  is7 that the deal?8 MR. KLEIN:	Correct.9 MR. EPSTEIN:	And you bought it a10 year ago?11 MR. KLEIN:	Correct.12 MR. EPSTEIN:	And it' s eight13 units?14 MR. KLEIN:	Correct.15 MR. EPSTEIN:	And four of those16 units are SROs?17 MR. KLEIN:	Correct.18 MR. EPSTEIN:	And four of the19 other ones are then unregulated?20 MR. KLEIN:	No.	No, two of them21 are rent stabilized.	One is occupied by a  super22 and one is free market.23 MR. EPSTEIN:	And you don' t live24 in that building?25 MR. KLEIN:	Correct.6 
2 MR. EPSTEIN:	So there' s eight3 units.	Seven are rented.	One has a super.4 MR. KLEIN:	Correct.5 MR. EPSTEIN:	Right.	And there6 are four SRO units, you' re saying.	The other ones7 are all -- so, basically, six out of seven are   rent8 stabilized?9 MR. KLEIN:	Yes.10 MR. EPSTEIN:	Right.11 MR. KLEIN:	Yes.12 MR. EPSTEIN:	And you say you13 bought this a year ago knowing it was going to   --14 knowing it was an SRO?15 MR. KLEIN:	Well, we understood --16 I guess, we knew what the tenants' rights  were17 there.	But, you know, we intended to try  to18 modernize, you know, put in new cooking  facilities19 and such.	And we didn' t realize the ramifications20 of this type of limitation on -- on rent for   those21 units that were designated SRO.22 MR. EPSTEIN: So you didn' t23 understand the history of SROs and the  Rent24 Guidelines before you bought the building, is  that25 what you' re saying?2 
2 MR. KLEIN: We were familiar  with3 them but we thought that we would be able  to4 modernize the apartments and, you know, and  then5 would be able to take these units out of the   SRO6 status.7 MR. EPSTEIN:	That you would8 remove these units from the SRO  status.9 MR. KLEIN:	If we were -- well,10 the units for future tenants. The tenants that  are11 there are protected.	So it' s -- it was a question12 of just down the line to -- to just modernize  the13 units.14 It' s, you know, to put in cooking15 facilities that are safer, more up- to- date and, you16 know, which is a service to the -- to the   tenants17 living there.18 MR. EPSTEIN:	And so these tenants19 were all long- term tenants, these tenants that are20 there?21 MR. KLEIN:	As I mentioned, one22 has been there over 30 years, the most recent  is23 over three years.24 MR. EPSTEIN:	And so this has been25 their home for at least the 30 year- tenant, for 302 
2 years, they' ve stayed in this SRO for 30 years.3 MR. KLEIN:	Right.	I mean this is4 really, it' s -- they' re studio apartments with5 bathrooms, with kitchenettes.	Again, it was a6 Building Department designation.	I mean the DHCR7 does not say what type of cooking facility  you8 need.9 MR. KLEIN:	Right.10 MR. KLEIN:	The Building11 Department has different rules so -- but based  on12 the Class B status from the Building  Department,13 you know, we are following SRO rules.	But they14 were not intended, these -- again, these were  not15 transient units.	Every tenant there has had an16 annual lease, a rent stabilized lease.	It' s a17 little bit of a quirk in the system that --   that18 this has happened.19 MR. EPSTEIN:	Right.20 Thank you.21 MR. KLEIN:	Okay.	And, again, I22 think, you know, the rules for small tenants  or23 small owners and tenants of these buildings,  I24 think additional consideration sometimes may need25 to be given just for fairness of  everyone.2 
2 MR. EPSTEIN:	Can I -- can I  ask3 one more question, actually?4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Sure.5 MR. EPSTEIN:	These tenants, you6 said some have been there up to  30 years.	So7 you' ve developed a relationship with these tenants8 over the last year?	Do you know them at  all?9 MR. KLEIN:	Well, I know, you10 know, some of them.	Unfortunately, the storm hit11 and we have been tackling other problems, you  know,12 since the fall.13 MR. EPSTEIN:	Right.14 MR. KLEIN:	So we had a lot to  do15 initially.	We' ve done a lot of work in the16 building.17 MR. EPSTEIN:	Right.18 MR. KLEIN:	But, you know, we' re19 trying to get to know the tenants, you know, as   we20 go.21 MR. EPSTEIN:	So you don' t know22 their economic situation for the tenants that  are23 there?24 MR. KLEIN:	Some of them I  do25 know.	Some of them are, you know, they all  have,2 
2 you know, at least six of the seven have jobs  and,3 you know, are productive.	They' re well employed.4 MR. EPSTEIN:	Right.	And they' re5 choosing to stay there because this is  an6 affordable place for them.7 MR. KLEIN:	I would imagine so.8 Yes.	I mean, yeah.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And they' re all11 lucky to have you as a  landlord.12 MR. KLEIN:	They' re all what?13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	They' re all lucky14 to have you as a  landlord.15 MR. KLEIN:	I' m sure.16 Thank you.17 ( Applause.)18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Brenda19 Irizarry.20 MS. IRIZARRY:	Good afternoon,21 members of the board and the  audience.22 My name is Brenda Irizarry.	I23 live at 3215 Bainbridge Avenue in the  Bronx.24 I am a member of Tenants  and25 Neighbors and the Northwest Bronx Community  and2 

2	Clergy Coalition.3
I would like to request that  the
4 board consider zero percent on rent increase  for5 all tenants.6 ( Applause.)7 MS. IRIZARRY:	Thank you.8 I would like to use my building  as9 an example because I feel that other  buildings10 throughout the City are probably more or less  in11 the same situation.12 I have lived in my apartment  for13 30 years.	The landlord has upgraded the  building.14 He did wiring, heating, plumbing, windows,15 electrical -- we now -- he was given an  MCI16 increase of $ 11 per room.	That is a permanent17 increase.18 We have tenants in my  building19 that receive Section 8 so that rent is  subsidized.20 The landlord received J- 51 tax abatement.	He also21 received another loan through the City of New  York,22 8 A, low interest.	We were lucky.	We did not get a23 rent increase.24 Also in my building there was  a25 time there was a high turnover.	The landlord is4 
2 entitled to vacancy rates.	There was also a3 street- level apartment.	That was converted into4 commercial space.5 The landlord also received a  New6 York State Weatherization grant for the  heating7 system.8 For the past three years the  heat9 in my building has deteriorated.	The landlord is10 giving less heat and saving on fuel.	What I mean11 by that, we get heat for 45 minutes and we  don' t12 get heat again until like three  hours later.	He13 gets it up to 68 degrees indoor temperature  and14 once that happens, the heat starts  to descend.	It15 goes down.16 And there have been several nights17 when the temperature went below 40 degrees  after18 10 : 00 at night, there was no heat.	I had to use my19 oven.20 Also, when I was doing  tenant21 organizing back in 1984 , there was a tenant that22 was overcharged by $ 80 per month.23 Therefore, in closing, many24 tenants -- many low and moderate income tenants  are25 struggling to pay rent.	Any increase would create2 
2 a severe hardship.	Salaries are not going up  fast3 enough as -- as fast as rent  increases.4 ( Applause.)5 MS. IRIZARRY:	Please bear that6 in mind.7 And, also, I would like to  request8 that the RGB reinstate an out- of- borough meeting.9 This would give people an opportunity to attend  and10 be heard.11 Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Ms.13 Irizarry.14 ( Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: Let me ask you  a16 question.	The issues you raised about heat or  lack17 thereof in your building, did you contact  311 ?	Did18 you contact HPD?	Was anything done?19 MR. IRIZARRY:	No.	I contacted my20 City Councilperson, Oliver Koppel.	I spoke to21 someone there that deals with housing  issues.22 What I notice is this.	I did call23 311 .	I documented.	The problem is to prove24 inadequate heat.	Very difficult.	No inspector is25 going to come out in 2 : 00 in the morning or at2 
2 midnight to check and see the  boiler.3 Also, the inspectors for the  City4 contact the landlord to file the complaint and  say5 we have a complaint.	So they know ahead of time6 when that inspector comes everything is  fine.7 And we are moving into the age  of8 technology.	There will be more and more  heating9 systems converting into a computerized system.	It10 is unfair.11 I understand expenses are going up12 but to decrease heat, that is something that  is13 very basic and essential.	I don' t, you know, I14 can' t see that especially when a landlord has15 applied for a weatherization grant and I have  to16 think about putting on my oven or I have to use   my17 fan to circulate the heat because it' s not being18 heated.	I' m feeling cold.19 And I' ve spoken to several tenants20 throughout the Bronx and they' ve told me the same21 thing.	It is unfair.	And the only way you can  get22 a rent reduction through DHCR is that the  landlord23 has to be cited.	It has to be a violation.	If24 there is no violation, you don' t get any rent25 reduction.2 
2 And if you go to Housing Court,  if3 you don' t have any evidence, then you have no  case.4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.5 MR. IRIZARRY:	You' re quite6 welcome.7 ( Applause.)8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Hoffman.9 MR. HOFFMAN:	Good afternoon.10 My name is Andrew Hoffman.11 Thank you for allowing me  the12 opportunity to speak today.13 I am the vice chairman of  the14 Community Housing Improvement Program.	I' m a board15 member of the RSA.	But my day job is  managing16 multi- family buildings in New York City.17 My life is one of a  difficult18 business to run.	Our expenses are much too high,19 especially water, real estate taxes and  energy.20 Also, increased government regulations have21 impacted our business over the last couple  of22 years.	And as we' ve discussed over the past few23 years, these are not included in the  PIOC.24 This past year, I have lived  a25 life of extremely low Guidelines' increases; 2  and2 
2 4 percent.	The Rent Guidelines Board must3 transcend politics.	We' ve all heard all the4 elected officials today talk about a zero  increase.5 It' s time to transcend those politics and give6 sufficient increases for low rent apartments.	We7 need higher percentage increases and we need a  low8 rent supplement.9 Owners like myself who run good10 buildings are penalized by having long- term11 residents in place.	Tenants don' t move from well12 maintained buildings.	And when you set low13 increases for these low rents, it simply does  not14 give us enough money for our increased  operations.15 In fact, rent controlled16 apartments have now eclipsed rent- stabilized17 apartments because if we do our  applications18 correctly, we get a higher increase for our  rent19 stabilized tenants and the last couple of years  has20 seen something very odd that the rent  controlled21 apartments are actually more expensive than  the22 rent stabilized apartments.23 The other thing that' s happening24 is because of the two year increases, the one  and25 two year options that you give to residents,  the2 
2 tenants know how to play the  percentage game.	And3 they -- when the renter' s percentage is low, they4 take the two year.	And when it' s higher, they take5 the one year.	So they' re playing a percentage6 game.7 ( Audience participation.)8 MR. HOFFMAN:	Right now, half of9 my -- three- quarters of my tenants won' t even be10 affected by this year' s increase because11 everybody' s on a two- year, 4 percent increase.	And12 they know how to -- they know how to work   the13 numbers.	They' re statutory tenants.	They -- I14 must renew a rent stabilized lease.	And it15 actually, sometimes it works out in the tenant' s16 detriment because there are some times when  it17 spikes.18 We should have one- year increases,19 which will more accurately reflect the  increases20 and decreases in our expenses.21 You know, I went on the  website22 yesterday and the Rent Guidelines Board has  a23 simple mandate.	You need to review the  economic24 conditions of the residential real estate  industry,25 including such factors as the prevailing  and2 
2 projected real estate taxes, sewer and water  rates,3 gross operating and maintenance costs.	That' s what4 you guys need to do.5 Thank you very much.6 ( Applause.)7 ( Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,9 Andrew.10 Thank you.11 MR.

There is very little10 opposition, apparently, to my administration.11 I' ve been in that building since12 1970 .	I raised four kids, three of whom  continue13 to work in New York City.	I would suggest that as14 lawyers and urban planners, they are making all  our15 lives much better.	The fourth son, however, has16 become a real estate mogul out of state and  he' s17 making a lot of money but, hopefully, doing  good18 things in the process.19 Our building was built in 1966 .	I20 came in 1970 .	We came in as a Mitchell  Lama21 building.	I have a couple of my neighbors with  me.22 Lee, Elsie, would you stand up.23 These folks have been there since24 the building was opened in 1966 .25 ( Applause.)5 
2 MR. BRIAN:	We were all young and3 beautiful.	Some of us have remained beautiful  and4 our landlord is a very decent, we have a   pretty5 decent landlord but I think our longevity  is6 probably irksome to him.7 We went into -- so we really  know8 Mitchell Lama.	We were a Mitchell Lama until 19  --9 until 2008 .	And it was a  different story.	So what10 you folks do is new  to us.	Where under Mitchell11 Lama the landlord would make an application for  a12 rent increase every year.	There was no schedule.13 He would provide us with the documentation, we' d go14 before whatever agency it was at the  time.15 There were years, folks, where we16 got a zero percent increase.  Zero percent.	I17 mention that because I don' t know if that ever18 happened with -- with the Rent Guidelines  Board?19 A VOICE:	Never.20 MR. BRIAN:	Never.	Okay.	But we21 -- so we did know that.	We also got some big22 increases but there were times where we  zero23 percent.24 Frankly, I' m a little surprised25 that in the current economic climate that we' re not2 
2 looking at a zero percent increase as a base  for3 the one year.4 We' ve got the lowest interest5 rates in my lifetime.	We -- the Fed is  worried6 about deflation.	The stock market is soaring.	The7 tax code certainly favors the landlords in  many8 ways.	And yet we' re looking at, once again, we' re9 looking at big increases.	It' s as though zero is10 never considered.	And that' s a bit of a surprise11 to me.12 I would urge you to consider  the13 entire economic climate and all the  opportunities14 that landlords have to gain income through  MCIs,15 through individual apartment increases, through the16 benefit of the tax code.17 Our -- our building is  14018 apartments.	Twenty- three have gone to fair market19 now.	So the income of our landlord is   certainly20 enhanced by all these other things in addition  to21 rent.22 I would ask you that you  give23 those other factors a consideration when you  come24 up with your final decision.25 You also have a difficult  job2 
2 doing this for every rent stabilized apartment  in3 every borough sounds beyond Herculean.	And I4 appreciate the struggle that you have to go  through5 to deal with that.	But I' m sure you' re up to the6 task.7 Once again, thank you very much8 for the opportunity to speak to  you.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.10 Brian.11 ( Applause.)12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Constance13 Nugent- Miller.14 MS.

That when they sit on the toilet,  they14 don' t have to use an umbrella.15 I want a decent compensation  for16 this.	That' s all I' m asking.	I' m not asking for17 something that is way and far.	I' m just asking you18 to be fair with me and the other small,  hard19 working landlords, especially the ones that live  on20 their property.21 Any other questions?22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Harvey had a23 question.24 MS.

Because I cannot10 fit into the dress of a 110 - unit landowner.11 How dare you even think that12 somebody as small and -- and according to the  big13 -- insignificant as me on the landscape, should  be14 treated like these large landowners, these15 so- called developers.	It' s unfair.16 And in all conscience, and I  know17 all of you have a conscience and you' re reasonable18 thinking people with common sense, you know that' s19 not fair.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.21 ( Applause.)22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Raphael23 Schweitzer.24 MR. SCHWEITZER:	Good afternoon,25 members of the Rent Guidelines Board.2 
2 My name is Raphael Schweitzer and3 I represent the Bronx Park East  Community4 Association.5 We are in the northeast Bronx.	I6 live in a good, relatively safe neighborhood in  the7 Bronx in a 108 - unit owned by Mendle Management.8 The rent in my apartment in  20079 started at $ 900 a month, a reasonable rate for  a10 one- bedroom apartment.	Right now it' s $ 1 , 100 a11 month.12 These sorts of percentage13 increases for apartments are unsustainable and  very14 hard for working people like myself.	We -- our15 building, and it' s not like we get very good16 service, our building was without a super for  over17 eight months. There were rats getting into people' s18 cars in the garage.	There' s inadequate heat.19 This is a good neighborhood  and20 just recently, actually, all 108 units got  billed21 with a $ 25 charge for a carbon monoxide alarm  that22 we never got.23 As stated earlier by Bill24 Di Blasio, a third of New Yorkers spent half their25 income on rent.	Let me repeat that.	Half of their2 
2 income.	That is not sustainable for hard  working3 people.4 It' s a shame that this is the only5 public hearing that is being held and it' s being6 held on a work day.	I work in retail.	We work on7 weekends.	We work Saturdays.	Sometimes we work8 Sundays.	We need to have these hearings  on9 Saturdays.	We need to have these hearings  on10 Sundays when people can attend.	Not at 10 : 00 a. m.11 on a week day.	And then people come 5 : 30 p. m.,12 they get what, two hours to testify, three  hours.13 It' s not enough.14 And, of course, there' s no15 hearings held in the outer boroughs, like  our16 borough of the Bronx.17 I do have a couple of  suggestions18 to make life easier for people in New  York.19 First, of course, you have to  have20 hearings in outer boroughs.	Community Action for21 Safe Apartments, CASA, got over 200 people  to22 attend their hearing last week. Two hundred  people.23 They advertised.	They pushed it and they got a  lot24 of people to show up and made their voices  heard.25 For -- in terms of improving  the2 
2 life for tenants when they apply for DHCR  rent3 reductions and those types of things, we need  more4 funding for housing advocacy organizations like5 Neighborhood -- like NIDC, the Neighborhood6 Initiatives Development Corporation, which is  in7 our neighborhood.	They need more funding so  they8 can make life easier for tenants to  navigate.9 I admit the -- the confusing bureaucracy of  City10 government.11 We have to consider holding  forums12 -- forums and discussions on how land -- on  how13 tenants can help landlords.	How they could14 cooperate to counteract these bureaucratic hurdles.15 And we need to do this in conjunction with  housing16 advocacy organizations like NIDC and CASA for --  to17 help landlords who have a small amount of  units.18 The next thing we need to do  is,19 we need to consider making rent increases  for20 apartments over a certain amount, say at $ 1 , 000 , on21 a dollar basis instead of a percentage  basis.22 Because what happens with people like me who  stay23 in their apartment for six -- for six years,  seven24 years, it becomes a  snowball effect.	And we' re --25 I' ll keep it short.	And we really have to --  we2 
2 really have to stave off those  exponential3 increases.4 And the last thing, we have --  we5 have to -- we have to consider making a   Rent6 Guidelines Board for each borough.	Because the7 landscape of each borough, the intricacies,  the8 details, the cross section and make up of it  is9 very different and we need rent increases  geared10 toward each borough instead of the whole  citywide,11 because it' s a big job.12 I -- I' ll -- I can understand your13 work load.14 Thank you.15 Any questions?16 ( Applause.)17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.18 Questions?	Are there any19 questions?20 MR. CHEIGH:	Yes.21 MR. SCHWEITZER:	Sure.22 MR. CHEIGH:	You stated one idea23 which is, you said in counter to the poor tax   that24 you' re saying when -- when we made percentage25 increases and your rent is already  substantially2 
2 high and definitely in the Bronx this is the  case3 where, you know, a percentage increase on a $ 900 ,4 which is what you had before and a  percentage5 increase on $ 1 , 100 , even though it might be the6 same percent, dollar value wise, it' s substantially7 different.8 MR. SCHWEITZER:	And one --9 A VOICE:	One thing I wanted to10 say.	I come from the Bronx, a better   neighborhood.11 But I know a lot of people  are hurting.	I' m --12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I' m sorry.13 Could you just identify yourself for the  record.14 Just give us your name.15 MS. JONES:	Kathleen -- Kathleen16 Jones.17 A lot of people are hurting.	I18 know people that are -- not paying Con Edison to   be19 able to pay their rent.	And I know a lot of  people20 are -- and some people in my building,  maybe21 instead of five days a week, they have to work   or22 to keep their job, they have to give up  an23 increase.24 There are a lot -- Bronx has a   lot25 of unemployment.	Thirteen percent on record about.2 
2 But that -- that doesn' t tell you about all  the3 people that are under employed.	And then there is4 a lot of people that are immigrants and they  have5 jobs that were off the books and I know quite a   few6 that have lost those jobs.7 So the unemployment in the  Bronx8 is not 13 percent.	In my estimation it' s over 209 percent if you count the number of people,  the10 immigrants that lost their jobs that were off  the11 books.12 I know a lot of -- one of  my13 friends -- there' s a big unemployment for14 50 - something- year olds. And one of my friends has15 about seven friends that are currently  depressed16 and getting therapy because they are unemployed  for17 a long period of time.18 The Bronx is really hurting.	And19 I' m the face of the Bronx. This is one of  the20 better neighborhoods in the Bronx.	And there is a21 lot of unemployment even in our  neighborhood.22 I know somebody that' s gone about23 six weeks without Con Edison so they could try  to24 make their rent.	And about two years ago,  somebody25 that went eight weeks without their Con Edison  and2 
2 that was in a heat wave when it was 100 degrees   so3 they can make their rent.4 This unemployment has gone on  a5 long time and it' s affecting a lot of 50  something-6 year- olds.	We' re not being hired and yet we got to7 pay all these increases.8 Thank you.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.10 MR. SCHWEITZER:	That just goes to11 the point where -- where these Guideline  Board12 hearings, these protocols, these guidelines that13 are made, they need to be geared toward  each14 borough.	Maybe we have to have five different  Rent15 Guidelines Board because the unemployment situation16 in the Bronx is different from  Manhattan.17 And the most important thing,18 these people who live in their apartments, $ 1 , 00019 apartments, why do they have to pay  these20 percentage increases that total to much more  than21 -- not -- not to -- not to play the poor   against22 the poor, but these percentage increases that  play23 for much more than if you live in an  apartment24 that' s $ 800 or $ 900 .	And it' s a cumulative effect25 and when people lose their job, but did that  answer2 
2 your question, Brian?	Okay.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Harvey.4 MR. EPSTEIN:	I just wanted to ask5 you a question.6 What -- well, I guess a 6  percent7 increase in a one- year lease or, you know, 8 or 9 ,8 10 percent increase in a two- year lease, what would9 that mean to people you know in the Bronx and   your10 neighbors?11 MR. SCHWEITZER:	It would cut into12 their food.	It would cut into all sorts  of13 expenses that we all take for granted.	It' s not14 easy -- look, okay, you could say, oh, well,  you15 know what, your rent --- your rent' s getting to16 high.	And I' ll admit it, a lot of apartments in  my17 building -- like a one- bedroom apartment, my18 one- bedroom apartment with -- if you pass a 519 percent rent increase for one year, that' s about20 $ 55 .	My rent' s going to be $ 1 , 150 .21 My landlord, if he' s renting a new22 apartment, he' s not going to be able to rent a  new23 apartment for $ 1 , 150 .	He' s going to rent it for24 $ 1 , 050 .	So I end up paying the rent on above  --25 above -- at an above  market rate.	And I don' t want2 
2 to move out.	And then what if I get employed  --3 unemployed.	And my rent has to go up and up and   up4 every time.	It' s -- it' s really, it' s5 unsustainable.6 And it' s -- there needs to be7 reforms made.8 MS. JONES:	I just wanted to add9 that I know expenses are going up for landlords  but10 they can' t be put on the back of those that  are11 already hurting. We can' t handle it.	Maybe you12 could do some -- give the landlord some kind  of13 breaks or tax breaks. Lessen the fines if they' re14 really struggling but it can' t be put on the  backs15 of the tenants that are struggling to pay  their16 rent.	And they' re giving up Con Edison to do it.17 MR. SCHWEITZER:	Thank you very18 much.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.20 ( Applause.)21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Roger Melzer.22 MR. MELZER:	Good afternoon.23 My name is Roger Melzer.	I' m a24 property owner from Brooklyn.	And my philosophy as25 an owner is, I wouldn' t rent an apartment to  a2 
2 tenant unless I was willing to live in it   myself.3 I bought my first rent  regulated4 building in 1978 .	Raised my daughters in it.	And5 they' ve lived there continuously since that time.6 It was constructed in 1898 so  that7 makes it 115 years old  this year.	This building8 has eight units.9 I subsequently brought another10 building constructed in 1925 and a third  building11 constructed in 1927 .	So the cumulative age of12 these structures is 289 years and the average  age13 is 96 years.14 These buildings were built before15 I was born and they should be around after  I' m16 gone.	But it' s not guaranteed and you know the17 City lost hundreds of thousands of units in  the18 ' 60 s and ' 70 s because the rent rolls didn' t meet19 the expenses.20 All the politicians calling for21 rent freezes this year don' t know what they' re22 talking about.	None of them have any -- had  any23 experience in the day- to- day management of 100 - year24 old buildings.	In their own ways, buildings are  a25 living being.	They are made from the elements  just2 
2 as we are.	And as the buildings age, they  need3 regular care and investment to survive  and4 successfully provide housing now and into  the5 future.6 We don' t limit funding for people7 that age and we shouldn' t limit the funding for8 buildings that age either.9 The Rent Guidelines Board has been10 given the facts.	Costs have gone up substantially11 this past year and will continue  to rise.	So the12 rents must go up too.	In particular, the low rent13 adjustment for apartments under $ 1 , 000 is very14 important.15 I compared the rents of  rent16 stabilized and rent controlled apartments in  200117 and 2013 .	And for comparable apartments in  200118 the rent stabilized and rent controlled  apartments19 were just about equal.	But this year, the rent20 control level is $ 900 and the rent stabilized21 average is $ 720 .	So that' s $ 180 per month22 shortfall over 12 years between what the  rent23 control and the rent stabilization systems  have24 provided.25 Rent stabilized guidelines have2 
2 just not kept up with taxes, fuel and water  and3 sewer rates, let alone the whole panorama of  costs4 that go into keeping a 100 - year old building5 viable.6 So in conclusion, I  particularly7 recommend a minimum low rent adjustment of $ 75 for8 one- year leases and $ 100 a month for two- year9 leases when the rent is $ 1 , 000 per month or less.10 Thank you very much.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.12 ( Applause.)13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Harvey.14 MR. EPSTEIN:	How many units do15 you have?16 MR. MELZER:	At present I have 2717 units in one building. A second building,  I18 disagree with my partners on our future  philosophy19 and we sold it and -- and the third building,  which20 I still live in, I converted to a co- op  building.21 But I' ve had, you know, experience in managing22 these aged buildings since 1978 and  continual23 effort and what' s required to maintained.	So I24 have 27 rental units now.25 MR. EPSTEIN:	And those -- you2 
2 said those 27 rental units and how many of them  are3 market?4 MR. MELZER:	Excuse me?5 MR. EPSTEIN:	How many of the 276 rental units are market units?7 MR. MELZER:	About -- actually,8 they' re all -- some of them are deregulated but9 they' re all below market.10 MR. EPSTEIN:	How many are11 deregulated?12 MR. MELZER:	Seventeen units.13 MR. EPSTEIN:	Did you seven or14 eight?15 MR. MELZER:	Seventeen.16 MR. EPSTEIN:	Seventeen units are17 deregulated?18 MR. MELZER:	Yes.	Yes.19 MR. EPSTEIN:	And so ten are20 regulated?21 MR. MELZER:	Yes.	So my point is22 that for the regulated units that I was  talking23 about, the people have substantial incomes  and24 they' re paying a lot less than they could afford to25 pay their fair share of -- of maintaining  the2 

2	building.3
MR. EPSTEIN:	And you' re saying
4 you' re not making profit on this building?5 MR. MELZER:	No, I' m -- I have a6 positive cash flow which is enabling me to  maintain7 the services that everyone is entitled  to,8 including renovations.9 MR. EPSTEIN:	Thank you.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.11 Alexander Knoble.12 Who will be followed by Hal  Brill.13 Who will be followed by  Tim14 Collins.15 MR. KNOBLE:	Yeah.	Thank you very16 much.17 Thank you very much.18 My name is Alexander Knoble.	And19 I have worked for Con Edison for over 22   years.20 I live in Stuyvesant Town in  a21 rent stabilized apartment.	I need to live nearby22 because I work long, unpredictable shifts,  ensuring23 that I am providing reliable service.	This is24 common practice among many long- term renters with25 similar occupations.	This is the fire fighters,4 
2 New York police officers, nurses and so  on.3 As of now, my rent has growing  up4 -- growing and grow and now it' s to 50 percent  of5 my salary.	This is a rent stabilized  apartment.6 The next proposed range of increases to 9 . 5 percent7 threatens to evict countless middle class  renters.8 This increase would cause of  the9 middle class, emergency service providers to  seek10 refuge outside the City with a large proportion  of11 New York City of emergency personnel living  long12 distances from their job sites, emergency  response13 time would be much, much longer.14 Simply speaking, during this15 Hurricane Sandy, some of our employees couldn' t get16 arrived to our job site in the City because  they17 live 50 , 40 miles away.18 With the necessary support for our19 community of fire fighters, police  officers,20 nurses, electricians and so -- so forth, we  can21 continue to provide the reliable and timely help  to22 those in need.	The City of New York expects  my23 colleagues to be there in times of need and now   we24 are calling upon the City in our time of  need.25 We hope to find peace of mind  and2 
2 relaxation at home.	The proposed rent increases,3 9 . 5 percent, threaten to displace thousands of4 families out of City.	That' s why from one New5 Yorker to another, I simply say, let my family  keep6 our home and let me keep our City  safe.7 There is you -- this  proposed8 unpredictable increase of 9 . 5 percent raise gonna9 ruin -- gonna ruin middle class and gonna  ruin10 service of our City.	Service will be much worse.11 Thank you very much.12 Any questions?13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.14 Knoble.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.17 Hal Brill.18 MR. BRILL:	Good afternoon.19 I' m Hal Brill, owner and manager20 of a small Manhattan building.21 I do not understand when22 politicians could come here and ask for a  zero23 percent increases, not when every year the  real24 estate taxes go up, water rates go up, our  expenses25 go up.	It doesn' t make any sense to me.2 
2 And one of the most  important3 things to keep in mind, is the lower end  supplement4 is extremely important.	It must be continued and5 renewed this year.6 I think the inadequate Guideline7 increases have created long- term rentals with rents8 too low to cover costs. Water rates have  increased9 this year by 5 . 6 percent just this coming year.10 This -- the water rates have gone -- and  real11 estate taxes have gone through the roof.	Repairs12 and labor costs have always continued to go  up.13 And I heat my building with oil and the increase   in14 the price of oil continues unabated.15 So, I think, the minimum  increase16 rents have helped us a lot by providing a   minimum17 increase for probably a third of my building,  which18 have all rents under $ 1 , 000 .	This must be19 continued this year.20 And I urge you to implement  the21 highest increases because the Guidelines have  not22 kept up costs, the longer a tenant has been  living23 in our building, the lower the  rent is.	The system24 does not address merit income or family needs,  just25 longevity.	It' s not a good system.2 
2 This inspires also, tenant3 corruption.	Tenants fight to keep their apartments4 and choose their successors, you know, not me  with5 a choice after they move out or even die  or6 separate.	People with no rights to succession  get7 in via illegal sublets and roommates and then  relax8 while I try to evict them and pry them  out.9 So this costs us a lot of  money10 and a lot of time and energy and needless  legal11 fees.	So I think this convoluted biased  regulatory12 situation is, you know, creates a burden to  the13 legal system as well with illegal tenants  knowing14 they could fight the system and now they even  claim15 landlord harassment.16 I think the system is  skewed17 against all landlords in favor of tenants.	The18 overwhelming volume of paperwork that  just19 continues unabated.	The court cases are just a20 routine part of our lives.	Lead compliance laws,21 benchmarking -- you name it.	It just continues.	I22 think it all adds instability and uncertainty  to23 owning small residential buildings in New  York24 City.25 So I think the Guidelines  Board2 
2 has failed all New Yorkers and the small  landlords,3 like myself in particular, and allows  only4 minuscule increases that have not kept up  with5 inflation and, in fact, fall further behind  every6 year.	Clearly the situation can' t be rectified7 overnight but incremental steps really need to  be8 taken to gradually turn things  around.9 The Guideline increases,10 reinstitute vacancy allowances so apartment rents11 could raise to subsistence levels and provide  for12 minimum increases for the lowest  rents.13 Thank you very much.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Harvey.17 MR. EPSTEIN:	Mr. Brill.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Brill,19 there' s a question for you.20 MR. EPSTEIN:	I just wanted to21 know, you own one building; is that  right?22 MR. BRILL:	Yes, I do.23 MR. EPSTEIN:	And how many units24 are in there?25 MR. BRILL:	Twenty- eight.2 
 2 MR. EPSTEIN:	Twenty- eight units.3 And how many are rent stabilized?4 MR. BRILL:	Twenty.5 MR. EPSTEIN:	Twenty.	And the6 eight are unregulated?7 MR. BRILL:	Finally decontrolled.8 MR. EPSTEIN:	Right.	And you said9 a third of them are below $ 1 , 000 ?10 MR. BRILL:	That' s correct.11 MR. EPSTEIN:	And are those --12 for those third, have those people been in there 13	20 , 30 years?14 MR. BRILL:	If not more, yes.15 MR. EPSTEIN:	If not more.16 Right.17 Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.19 Tim Collins.20 MR. COLLINS:	Thank you, Mr.21 Chairman and members of the board - those of you   I22 know and -- and the new ones, I am   Tim Collins.	I23 was the executive director of the board for  seven24 years back in the early 1990 s.	I was kind of25 hoping that I would avoid a cameo appearance  this14 
2 year.	And after last year' s vote I kind of settled3 back and thought that things were sort of on  track.4 And then I -- I saw the proposed guidelines and   I5 became very concerned.6 I think that we all know  that7 we' re in the tail end of a recession.	Hopefully,8 it' s the tail end.	But since 2008 , things have9 been going downhill.	A lot of investors in  the10 country really took a sharp hit for a long  period.11 Fortunately, some of that is turning  around.12 But during this period, the Rent13 Guidelines Board continued to compensate owners14 based upon, in large part, the Price Index  of15 Operating Costs, which is incorporated into  the16 commensurate rent increases.	And it has been17 tracked fairly closely as a guideline.	And it' s18 eminently clear at this point that the price  index19 no longer is a reliable indicator of operating  cost20 changes.21 The price index for some --22 actually, fortuitous reasons, was a pretty  reliable23 indicator in its first year.	It was being off only24 about one- tenth of one percent after a full ten25 years.	But, you know, there was a review of  that2 
2 that was done around 2000 and it was concluded  that3 some of the components of the index were --  were4 off in one direction and some of the  components5 were off in another direction and they kind  of6 equalized each other.7 And the general sense was, is  that8 if it' s -- if it' s being heavily corroborated by9 the income and expense data that you all  were10 getting from the Department of Finance, then  it11 pretty much works.	And if it' s working, why spend12 the money to fix it or tear it  apart.13 That accuracy continued to a  good14 extent for the next four years when the --  the15 difference between the income and expense data  or16 the expense data and the Price Index was 1 . 417 percent.18 Since around 2005 , 2006 , the Price19 Index has completely lost its way.	I believe that20 the number is the average increase -- if  you21 average them out over time, the Price Index  would22 be about 5 . 8 percent, whereas the income and23 expense data shows operating costs going up  only24 about 3 . 43 - and- a- half percent.25 So the Price Index is  clearly,2 
2 consistently and substantially overstated operating3 costs.	And the income -- the expense data from  the4 Department of Finance is inherently more  reliable.5 It' s a much larger sample and much more detailed.6 And as we found out in the past, because of   audits7 that have been done, if anything that  data8 overstates the actual operating costs that  owners9 experience.10 So the consequence of this,11 relying on the Price Index and the  commensurate,12 which is a result of that, is that the owner has   --13 the board has over- compensated owners substantially14 throughout this recession, on average 5 - and- a- half15 percent increases annually in net operating  income,16 when everybody else in the country is taking  a17 wash.18 Now this issue was brought to  the19 board' s attention.	There were some projections20 that were in error by  the staff.	I mean this is --21 projection are very difficult to do, going back  to22 2008 and I -- I' m sure that they were all  innocent.23 I have great respect for the RGB staff  --24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Tim, I' m going25 to ask -- I' m going to have to ask you to  --2 

23	Okay.4
MR. COLLINS:	To wrap it up.The consequence is, owners have
5 been grossly overcompensated, nearly --6 ( Applause.)7 MR. COLLINS:	-- twice the level8 of increases that should have been  given.9 And if -- the one thing I  would10 like to do before I leave is make an apology   and11 that' s to all of the tenants in this room and  the12 number of appearances I' ve made over the last few13 years, the letters I' ve written, I have objected.14 I tried to bring things to the attention of  the15 board but I should have been far more  militant.16 Because what' s happened here is a17 monumental catastrophic blunder. You need to  fix18 it.	I' ve often said, tap the brakes.	Hold back a19 little bit.	We' re in a recession.	In a normal20 market, rents flatten out or  go down.	The board21 hasn' t done that.	And it now has to slam  the22 brakes on and freeze the  rents.23 I' m not saying that rhetorically.24 I' m saying you' ve lost your way. You are in the25 process now of deregulating the housing  stock.5 
2Thatis notyour job.3Thank you.4( Applause.)5CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Tim.6Brian.7MR. CHEIGH:	Thank you, Tim.8Thank you for your testimony.9And in years past before I  joined10thisboard,you know, what I' ve heard about your11 positions on the rent increases have been that  we12 have to provide modest increases to maintain the  --13 the financial viability of the -- of the  housing14 stock.15 MR. COLLINS:	That' s right.16 MR. CHEIGH:	That the expenses17 should be recognized and that we should  have18 increases to recognize that.	But what you' re19 saying now is that the way we' ve been determining20 our increases, the research that we' ve been doing21 with the PIOC has been dramatically off from  the22 income and expense statements.23 MR. COLLINS:	That' s right.24 MR. CHEIGH:	And on the one hand,25 previously, the expense statements have been11 
2 justifying that the PIOC is, to some  degree,3 accurate.	But right now you' re absolutely4 asserting that the PIOC is way overstating  the5 expenses that the building owners actually  have.6 MR. COLLINS:	Yeah.	Well, that' s7 -- that' s right.	And it' s overstating it.	And8 what I' m most concerned about, if it was9 overstating it for one or two or, perhaps,  three10 years, I would be less concerned.	I would say,11 well, maybe things will straighten themselves  out.12 You know, maybe the board has a little more  faith13 in the Price Index than I  do.14 We' re now going into the sixth,15 seventh year of these compounding errors.	And the16 report that you received, which is the March to  the17 Market , is starting to read a little less like  a18 research report or a general statistical  criticism19 and more like an indictment.	Because it is20 starting to appear that this board is  consciously21 and deliberately on -- embarked on a march to   the22 market and is abandoning its role of adopting  rent23 increases that are sufficient to compensate  owners24 for changes in operating costs, sufficient to  allow25 them a reasonable net operating income  but2 
2 protecting tenants from the -- the effects of  the3 housing shortage, which is precisely your  statutory4 role.5 If we had an 8 or a 9   percent6 vacancy rate, like they have in the rest of  the7 country, there wouldn' t be a problem because there8 would not have been rent increases of  this9 magnitude over the last seven years.	Because if10 there are empty apartments down the block this  way11 and empty apartments down here and Joe and Sam  are12 willing to give me a lower rent because they' ve  got13 a bunch of vacancies, then I can  bargain.14 And that' s what happens in the15 rest of the country.	It doesn' t happen in New York16 because we' ve got a housing shortage, which is17 largely institutionalized and to a large extent  by18 governmental factors, by artificial factors.19 ( Applause.)20 MR. COLLINS:	And this board21 cannot use that power to bestow a windfall  on22 owners.	And that' s what you' ve done now in the23 last five, six years.	The record is clear.	You' ve24 got to stop this.	You' ve got to freeze the rents25 now and, you know, at least for one- year leases and2 
2 you' ve got to hold back these rent increases for3 awhile to get this back on  track.4 If the State Legislature says the5 market is going to be the solution to our  housing6 woes, which I think is tremendously  problematic,7 we' ll have that debate in Albany.	We' ll have a8 full- fledged public conversation and look at all of9 the pros and cons of rent  regulation.10 That' s not the debate you need to11 have.	You need to have a debate about fair  rents12 based upon the factors that are  before you.	And13 those factors are changes in operating costs  and14 effects to the market, including tenant  incomes,15 not as a welfare consideration but tenant  incomes16 as an economic factor because in a normal  market,17 when unemployment goes up, when incomes go  down,18 rents stabilize.	And that' s what' s happened19 throughout the rest of the country, except in  New20 York.21 ( Applause.)22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Harvey.23 MR. EPSTEIN:	Tim, thank you for24 your testimony today.25 I wanted to ask you about  this2 
2 proposed poor tax and these, you know,  minimum3 increases on rents below $ 1 , 000 and kind of what --4 give us your take on  that.5 And the second piece I want  to6 hear about is, well, there' s so many unregulated7 units now in buildings where a majority  of8 buildings are unregulated.	I' m wondering what you9 think the solution of the Rent Guidelines Board  can10 use to address these problems?11 MR. COLLINS:	Okay.	Well, with12 respect to the unregulated units, there Albany  has13 spoken.	They' ve embarked upon a process of14 modified deregulation.	My -- my response to  that15 is, you have no business hastening that  process16 along.	That was a hard fought compromises  in17 Albany.18 Some people are very dissatisfied19 with the consequences.	And, in fact, Albany has20 retrenched to some extent, changing the  luxury21 decontrol rules and the vacancy decontrol  rules.22 That' s a battle that has to take place there.	It' s23 not your job to hasten it  along.24 The consequence of that25 deregulation is that in many respects a lot  of2 
2 owners are doing much better than they were in  the3 past.	And if they do much better than they have  in4 the past, for those reasons, that' s fine.	But it' s5 not just that.	They' re doing a lot better because6 of excessive guidelines adopted by  this board.	So7 that' s a problem.8 With respect to what' s described9 as the poor tax, it' s been my feeling in  fairly10 recent years -- in early years when they had the  --11 what was called the poor tax, the  additional12 increase, I didn' t oppose it.	When I was executive13 director of the board, I thought that there  were14 some rents that were so low that they were  simply15 not economic and that the poor tax may have  made16 sense.17 My problem is, is that over  a18 series of years, and there have been a number  of19 those additional increases, a number of years  ago20 and there was a long hiatus when we didn' t  have21 them.	And then more recently it was brought  back22 on occasion, is that they' ve largely done their job23 and that it' s really rough to hit up that  same24 group of people time and time again with  those25 kinds of rent increases.2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Magda.3 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Collins, you4 describe a disconnect between the PIOC and  the5 income and expense data.	Isn' t it a fact that the6 reason might be that the income and expense  data7 does not take into account small  buildings?8 MR. COLLINS:	I don' t believe that9 is significant.	Given the size of the sampling  and10 given the differences and methodology.	And, also,11 Ms. Cruz, and this is  vitally important.	We' re12 looking at longitudinal changes.	Longitudinal13 changes generally are not affected by the fact  that14 there' s a piece of the universe that' s missing.15 As you' re long at year- to- year16 changes of, you know, whatever 3 percent or  417 percent and if that section, segment of  the18 universe, had been included from day one, then  it19 might have been a lower level of overall income  or20 expenses but the point- to- point comparisons21 probably would not have differed very  much.22 ( Applause.)23 MR. COLLINS:	So looking at24 longitudinal data, it' s not going to have a  big25 effect.2

STEINBERG:	-- I was
22 listening to the radio one morning and  suddenly23 there was a clip concerning -- comparing  bacteria24 to people.	And as we all know, there' s good25 bacteria and bad bacteria.22 
2 The bad bacteria seeks out weak3 spots and preys on these areas.	It' s too bad we4 don' t simply have antibiotics to cure bad bacteria5 people and this from an 18 th, 19 th- century French6 writer.7 The rich of today are just  as8 ferocious in their exploitation of the poor as  the9 violent used to be in the vexation of the  helpless.10 All these financiers -- and I would add  landlords11 and the whole real estate agency, all  these12 important personages would bleed the entire13 population dry if they fancied its blood  might14 yield a few ounces of  gold.15 This board may congratulate itself16 on its participation in our City' s homeless17 population, now at an all- time high; 50 , 000 plus.18 Many of these homeless are families with  children.19 I find it so hard to understand the mentality  that20 would allow this.21 My landlord, in all his  wisdom,22 used to call the homeless bums.	When the Mayor23 first took office I heard his Deputy Mayor say  that24 the Mayor wanted to build new housing for a   million25 more people, with no regard for our environment  I2 

2	might add.3
The Mayor planned to build luxury
4 condos rather than affordable housing.	He probably5 wanted to build a new tax  base.6 I recently read a story in the  New7 Yorker of a man who owns a luxury condo in New   York8 City.	As you well know, if you live in New  York9 State for half year, you have to pay New York  State10 taxes.	He had his secretary keep tabs on how  many11 days he spent in his condo because he didn' t  want12 to pay New York State taxes.	So much for building13 luxury condos as a tax  base.14 Some of you may not want to  hear15 this.	But the whole real estate industry should  be16 regulated so that entrepreneurs can afford to  open17 manufacturing business like the garment industry  we18 used to have here with affordable housing  for19 working people.	I know the arguments that20 manufacturing is now computerized but there  will21 still be office jobs, shipping jobs,  programmers,22 input and upkeep of the computers.	And it will23 bring back taxes to the City.	It' ll help eliminate24 lots of the poverty and bring back a middle  class25 and make up for a less top heavy  society.4 
2 In the meantime, this board should3 not raise rents on those who are struggling  to4 maintain a bare subsistence.	It' s about time for5 the board to do right for the millions or  more6 people of our City.	Surprise us.	Zero increase in7 rents.	Housing is a basic necessity of  life.8 Thank you.9 ( Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.11 MR. PIPER:	Tim Piper.12 Hi.	Thank you for the  opportunity13 to speak.14 My name is Tim Piper and I' m a15 part owner of a rent stabilized apartment  building16 in Washington Heights. And I feel my  voice17 represents many of the small building owners in  New18 York City.19 It has already been established20 that the Price Index of Operating Cost  has21 increased by 5 . 9 percent in the last year.	But22 that does not paint the full picture and does  not23 include a lot of unrecognized  costs.24 As times have changed and the  City25 has made changes and continues to put a  greater2 
2 burden on building owners; installation of  backflow3 prevention devices and bed bug remediation are  two4 examples.5 The City also continues to6 increase the administrative burden through requests7 from the production unit and City agencies  have8 conducted overly harsh enforcement action such  as9 the Sanitation Department giving tickets for  mixing10 of recycling with regular trash by the tenants  that11 end up eventually being fined to the  landlord.12 Also, as well as the  Building13 Department has increased the requirements for14 testing and remediation of purported mold  problems.15 My building and the tenant16 delinquencies have remained the same and yet  costs17 continue to rise out of proportion with  the18 increases from the Rent Guidelines Board.19 As the building continues to  age,20 it requires more and more maintenance to keep  the21 building up and, ultimately, longer term  upgrades22 such as switching to cleaning burning natural  gas23 has to be further delayed and there' s both the  rent24 stabilized tenants, as well as the out of  market25 tenants who suffer.2 
2 Currently, I have 10 out of  113 rent stabilized tenants in my building who  have4 rents below $ 1 , 000 , several of which fall in the5 $ 400 to $ 600 range.	And that is why I  respectfully6 request that the board grant a minimum  dollar7 increase of $ 75 and increases of 7 and 11  percent,8 respectively.9 Thank you.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.11 ( Applause.)12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Harvey.13 MR.

MR. SILBER:	Good afternoon. I' m Jimmy Silber.	I represent
5 SPONY, the Small Property Owners of New  York.6 You have heard many of  our7 wonderful, special owners speak to you  tonight.8 These are the backbone of New York City  because9 they live in the buildings side by side in  harmony10 with their residents and they try as hard as  they11 can to make their buildings the best  maintained12 buildings in New York City.13 But small owners are an  endangered14 species.	They' re an endangered species because15 they have nice buildings that people don' t want to16 leave and stay in for long periods  of time.	And17 that is why when we meet with the public members  of18 this board and you specifically say to us, what  can19 we do to help small owners? We know they  are20 struggling.	We say to you, provide a low  rent21 adjustment.	That is the key.22 And you were mindful of it  last23 year and you passed the low  rent adjustment.	But24 you must also be aware that only 60 percent  of25 leases expired during that year when that low  rent5 
2 adjustment was in effect.	The preponderance of3 leases are two- year leases.4 So for you to accomplish what  you5 had in mind last year with a low rent  adjustment,6 must be a two- part process. There must be a  second7 part to it to capture all the other low  rent8 adjustments that are becoming available this  year.9 That is essential.10 That is the one thing this  board11 can do to help small property owners in New  York.12 And I just wanted to pick out  in13 my building an example of what happens when  a14 tenant lives in an apartment for a long  time.15 Apartment 6 G in my building, the16 tenant moved in April 1 st, 1975 .	The rent was17 $ 256 . 45 .	Now 40 years later, the tenant is  still18 there.	She' s a lovely lady.	I' m friendly with19 her.	I have no problems  with her.	Her rent now,20 40 years later is $ 844 . 81 .21 So because she' s been in that22 apartment for so long, she has had a net  increase,23 on average, of $ 14 . 72 a year for 40 years.24 So I looked at my building and  I25 looked at the maintenance for running my  building2 
2 to see how that would compare to say, if  my3 building were a co- op and we made no profit on  it4 at all, what would the basic cost be to  maintain5 her $ 845 unit.6 And I took out almost  everything7 out of our expenses, except four very  important8 costs that owners face in this city;  payroll,9 payroll taxes and union benefits.	That' s one10 category.	Real estate taxes, the second category.11 Repairs and maintenance to common areas of  the12 building, the third category.	And utilities,13 water, electric and heating oil as the  fourth14 category.	Those were the only four categories.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Jim, I' m going16 to ask you to wrap  it.17 MR. SILBER:	And when you -- when18 you saw what the maintenance was for those  four19 categories, her apartment, to break even,  would20 have to pay $ 1 , 221 . 61 a month.	Just to break even.21 These are the main costs, most  of22 them are imposed on us by the City. We have  no23 control of doing anything about them.	They are24 City imposed costs.	So for her apartment, we  --25 she is at a deficit of $ 376 . It costs the -- the2 
2 owner is losing $ 376 a month on that  apartment.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Jimmy, you got4 to wrap up.5 MR. SILBER: In conclusion, I  just6 want to tell you that that example appears all  over7 the City in small buildings.	And this, can you8 imagine having a 10 - unit building where you have9 tenants that have rents that don' t keep up with  the10 economic reality of running your building.	That is11 a dangerous situation.12 That' s -- we bring that to you13 now.	We ask you, please, pass the low   rent14 adjustment.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.16 ( Applause.)17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Harvey.18 Jimmy, Jimmy.	There' s a question19 for you.20 MR. EPSTEIN:	Again, how many21 units do you have?22 MR. SILBER:	I have 100 units in23 my building.24 MR. EPSTEIN:	A hundred what?25 MR. SILBER:	Units.2 
2 MR. EPSTEIN:	And how many of3 those 100 are unregulated?4 MR. SILBER:	I' m sorry.5 MR. EPSTEIN:	How many are not6 subject to rent stabilization?7 MR. SILBER:	Ten percent are rent8 controlled.	Forty- five percent are rent9 stabilized.	About eight percent are owner occupied10 and the rest are exempt.11 MR. EPSTEIN:	So 45 percent rent12 stabilized, ten percent rent controlled, eight13 percent owner occupied, 40 something percent  --14 MR. SILBER:	Approximately.15 MR. EPSTEIN:	-- are unregulated;16 right?17 And so you mentioned this person18 who makes -- whose rent is $ 844 .	Is that your19 average rent in your buildings?20 MR. SILBER:	No.21 ( Laughter.)22 MR. EPSTEIN:	What' s your average23 rent?24 MR. SILBER:	You know, I don' t25 know exactly.	It' s probably in the $ 1 , 800 range.2 
2 The example I gave you is  an3 example that exists in --4 MR. EPSTEIN:	You don' t know the5 average rent.6 MR. SILBER:	-- small buildings7 in New York City where tenants have lived in  place8 for 30 or 40 years.9 MR. EPSTEIN:	Right.10 MR. SILBER:	And in small11 buildings, eight to ten units, that is very  common.12 People don' t move.13 MR. EPSTEIN:	So you think you14 should treat --15 MR. SILBER:	My building is a16 little larger so I' ve had vacancies.17 MR. EPSTEIN:	So you think we18 should treat property owners with small numbers  of19 units differently than we should treat people  who20 have larger portfolios?21 MR. SILBER:	You know, I don' t22 know how you arrive at separating  --23 MR. EPSTEIN:	Well, you said we24 should treat people with small property  owners25 differently.	I wanted to make sure that' s what you2 

2	wanted us to do.3
MR. SILBER:	No.	I said that
4 small owners in this City are an  endangered5 species.6 MR. EPSTEIN:	Right.7 MR. SILBER:	Because they are8 subjected to the example that I presented to  you.9 MR. EPSTEIN:	Right.10 MR. SILBER:	They are the ones11 that are vulnerable.	So you -- this board has  on12 its own, proposed low rent adjustments to --  to13 help that situation directly for people in  that14 situation.	That' s what I' m suggesting you do.15 MR. EPSTEIN:	And so we should16 target it to those small property owners;  right?17 MR. SILBER:	In effect that does18 target the small property owner because those  are19 the ones who are losing out at  this.20 MR. EPSTEIN:	Okay.	I just wanted21 to make sure we were on the same page, that   we22 should target our energy to the small  property23 owners, the ones that are suffering.24 Thanks.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Steve.4 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Hi, Jimmy.3 Thanks for your testimony.4 Now with the SPONY, right, what5 percentage of your membership is this six to  ten6 unit building owner?7 MR. SILBER:	I would say probably8 40 , 50 percent.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	It' s a10 significant amount; right.	Now how many buildings11 would you say that represents?12 MR. SILBER:	We have 1 , 000 members13 in SPONY.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	So it' s at15 least 500 buildings, small buildings?16 MR. SILBER:	Well, there' s plenty17 of buildings -- the members are not  --18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m just talking19 about the -- the six to ten -- six to eleven   unit20 building.21 MR. SILBER:	If not -- 100 , 000 .22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Now what23 percentage of the entire, let' s say New York City24 building stock, and if you know  this, great.	If25 you want to guess at, fine.	Just give us an order2 

2	of magnitude.3
If your organization represents
4 about 500 buildings, could you kind of imagine  how5 many buildings there are out there that -- that  you6 haven' t captured within your organization?	We' re7 talking 600 --8 MR. SILBER:	A few hundred9 thousand.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- or are we11 talking a hundred of thousand?12 MR. SILBER:	Hundreds of13 thousands.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Hundreds of15 thousands.16 So it' s no insignificant inventory17 of the New York City housing stock;  correct?18 ( No response.)19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Correct?20 MR. SILBER:	No, it is not21 insignificant.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So for a specious23 argument to come before us and say that because  the24 -- our PIOC don' t capture these six to ten- unit25 buildings, that it' s a more accurate picture of the4 
2 expense profile for New York City rent  stabilized3 stock, how do you take that?	It' s lacking.	Not to4 lead you but --5 MR. SILBER:	You know, we just6 know from the building owners in our group who  tell7 us about the dilemmas they have in running their  --8 their properties.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, I10 understand.	But the PIOC seems to capture  those11 building owners in their questionnaires.	The --12 RPIEs do not.	So my question is, I mean, it may  be13 nice to think that the RPIEs are more a   accurate14 representation of the expense profile, but  in15 reality the PIOC is probably closer.16 MR. SILBER:	It is.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And we' ve heard18 testimony that the PIOC doesn' t capture all the19 expenses.20 MR. SILBER:	No.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So if anything,22 it' s understating the expense profile and not23 overstating.24 MR. SILBER: And the PIOC --  the25 PIOC is a current evaluation.	The RPIE is two2 

2	years behind us.3
MR. SCHLEIDER:	And doesn' t
4 capture hundreds of thousand of  buildings.5 MR. SILBER:	You know, you' re6 comparing a situation two years ago with what' s7 happening now.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Even 10 , 0009 buildings, it' s still a considerable stock.	Where10 the RPIEs are capturing maybe 13 , 000 building.	So11 it' s almost half the number.12 MR. SILBER:	The -- the small13 building owner does not get the vacancy, does  not14 get the turnover that the larger building  does.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No.	I' m just16 going on something that came before this  board17 before about the accuracy of one measurement  over18 another and -- and the argument that the RPIEs  seem19 to be a more viable or truthful statement of   the20 housing expense profile when, actually, it' s just21 the opposite.	That' s all I' m saying.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.23 Thanks, Jimmy.24 ( Applause.)25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Michael Mc Kee.4 
2 MR. MC KEE:	Good afternoon.3 My name is Michael Mc Kee.	I am4 the treasurer of the Tenants Political  Action5 Committee, which works to elect pro  tenant6 candidates.7 I am a board member of  the8 Metropolitan Council on Housing, the  citywide9 tenants union.	And I' m testifying today on behalf10 of the Real Rent Reform campaign, of which  both11 tenants back and Met Council are  members.12 This study, which you have before13 you, March to the Market , we are releasing today.14 It will be up on  our website.	In fact, it' s15 probably up on our website now.	I am not going to16 read it but I' m urging you to read it and  consider17 it carefully.18 This amplifies some of the19 comments that were made by Tim Collins before,  your20 former Executive Director.	But I want to back up  a21 little bit and talk about the history of the  .22 The Price Index was designed in23 the first place so that landlords would not have  to24 open their books.	That was acknowledged by the25 drafters of the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 ,2 
2 which was a committee, you might remember, if  you3 read Tim Collins' history, made up  of4 representatives of the Lindsey administration and5 representatives of the real estate industry.	In6 fact, two of the drafters of that law told  me7 personally that that' s why they designed the Price8 Index.9 The Price Index has been10 criticized for 40 years as an invalid  methodology.11 In fact, in the late 1980 s, the tenant movement12 convinced the Board of Estimate not to renew  the13 contract, to pay a consultant to perform the  Price14 Index.	Whereupon, the consultant performed for15 free for a year and then the City found ways to   pay16 for it through the City of University of New  York17 Foundation.	And now it' s done in house.18 Clearly, we now have proof in  this19 report that the measurement of operating costs  is20 inaccurate and that it has greatly overstated  the21 increases in landlord' s average operating costs,22 which you have passed along in the forms  of23 unjustified, excessive rent increases that  have24 swelled landlord profits and created more  rent25 burdens for an already burdened population  of2 
2 renters in New York City.3 But even if the Price Index,  I4 will not say PIOC by the way, that phrase makes   my5 teeth grind.	Even if the Price Index were  an6 accurate measure of operating cost increases  or7 changes, in fact, I want to remind you that in   20028 when the Price Index was actually negative,  Marvin9 Marcus, your then chairman stated, " We can never10 have rent increases lower than 2 and 4  percent."11 The world according to Marvin Markus.12 So even in the year when  the13 reduced, we still got hit with rent  increases.14 But even if it were an  accurate15 measure of operating costs, it is  one sided.	It16 looks at one side of the  profit equation.	It looks17 at expenses, ignoring incomes.	You cannot get a18 picture of the health of the real estate  industry,19 the residential real estate market in this  City,20 without looking at income and  expenses.21 ( Applause.)22 MR. MC GEE:	Our reform bill would23 eliminate the Price Index, among other changes  and24 would mandate that landlords of rent  stabilized25 properties, including six to ten- unit buildings,2 
2 file annual income and expense reports  directly3 with the Rent Guidelines Board, which is the  method4 that is used in the suburbs where rent  increases5 have been significantly lower.	Where both in6 Nassau County and the Westchester County  Rent7 Guidelines Boards have frozen rents in more  than8 one year, while we have been clobbered by  this9 board with unjust and excessive rent  increases.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Mc Kee, I' m11 going to have ask to -- to start to wrap   up.12 MR. MC KEE:	Excuse me.	I just13 want to finish -- I' ll finish my testimony.14 It is my view that the main  reason15 for this difference and why tenants in the  suburbs16 have had less of a rent burden than the City   is17 because of the Price Index methodology.18 We will continue to do  everything19 we can to stop the use of the Price  Index.20 Thank you very much.21 ( Applause.)22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.23 MR. CHEIGH:	Chairman -- Chairman,24 I have a question.25 Michael.2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Michael, you3 made reference to a study that was released that  we4 have in front of us.5 MR. MC KEE:	I' m sorry.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You made7 reference to a study that was released that we  have8 in front of us.	We don' t have it.9 MR. MC KEE:	I gave copies to the10 table.	I don' t know if you --11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Oh, okay.12 MR. MC KEE:	I don' t know if you13 have it.	But I gave copies.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	We' ll15 get them.	As long as we have them, we' ll get them16 later.17 MR. MC KEE:	Yes.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.19 MR. MC KEE:	It' s called the March20 to the Market.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.22 MR. MC KEE:	Thank you.23 MR. CHEIGH:	Michael -- Michael.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Brian.25 MR. MC KEE:	Sorry.2 
2 MR. CHEIGH:	Yeah.	One statement3 that you say here in the report, which is  very4 interesting to me, is that you' re saying that we' re5 too focused on profit and not on  fair rent.	And6 what do you think we should think about  when7 discussing fair rent as the Rent Guidelines  Board?8 MR. MC KEE:	I think you should9 consider the conditions that tenants in the  City10 live in -- live under.	I believe that the public11 members of this board, under this  administration,12 do not really think that' s a valid consideration.13 I believe the public members  of14 this board, historically, in the 11 years of  the15 Bloomberg administration, starting with the year16 2002 when we got hit with 2 and 4 percent   rent17 increases even though the Price Index was  negative,18 I think the public members have considered it  their19 job to keep landlords' profits up and/ or to --  and20 I recognize there are new members of --  public21 members of the board who were not on the board  the22 last time I testified, which was several years  ago.23 As I told the chairman at  the24 time, I refuse to participate in this  process25 because the process is really corrupt.	I' m not2 
2 calling you corrupt. I' m calling the process3 corrupt.	But, I think, the -- generally,  my4 observation is that the public members of  this5 board have considered it their job to  compensate6 landlords of rent stabilized properties for  the7 burden of having to live under the  rent8 stabilization system.9 I don' t think that' s a proper10 function for this board.	Your board is to shield11 tenants from the effects of a severe  housing12 shortage.	This board has failed that test.	And,13 certainly, the increases, the rent increases  that14 you have approved in the last five years is  proof15 of that.16 MR. CHEIGH:	Thank you.17 MR. MC KEE:	Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Mc Kee, thank20 you.21 Thank you, I guess, for  your22 testimony.23 Two things. One, I' d like you to24 point to me to where it says in our  enabling25 legislation for this board that we' re supposed to2 
2 protect the tenants.3 MR. MC KEE:	The explanatory4 statement -- the -- of the Rent Stabilization  Law.5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m sure you can6 point it out to me.7 The second thing is, how do  you8 define profit?9 MR. MC KEE:	I' m sorry.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	How do you define11 profit?12 MR. MC KEE:	Well, profit is --13 profit is profit.	I mean, you don' t know --14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No, no, no.15 That' s not an answer.	How do you define profit?16 MR. MC KEE: Excuse me.	Well, I' m17 trying to answer your question if you will let  me18 do that.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Go ahead.20 MR. MC KEE:	We don' t know what21 profits are because profits -- to analyze  profit22 would require information about an  individual23 building or property, including its tax  situation.24 We do know what net  operating25 incomes are --2 

23	understand that.45	haven' t finished.678910
MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right.	IMR. MC KEE:	-- which is -- IMR. SCHLEIDER:	Really? MR. MC KEE:	No.MR. SCHLEIDER:	Fine.MR. MC KEE:	Thank you.We do know what net  operating
11 incomes are and we do know how much they  have12 increased in this -- in the last several years  and,13 you know, while we don' t have information on14 profits, I think net operating income is a   pretty15 good surrogate that tells you the condition of  the16 residential rental market in the  City.17 And the net operating income18 numbers from this -- that this board produces,  that19 the staff produces, which I recommend to  everyone.20 I refer people to the Rent Guidelines Board  website21 all the time.	I think the income and  expense22 study, in particular, is extremely well done  and23 important.	But we see that landlords,  basically,24 are doing pretty well.25 And I would also observe that  some11 
2 of the same small landlords who come before  you3 today, have been coming before you for years.  Some4 of them back in the ' 80 s when none of you were on5 this board, when I was at every meeting of  this6 board, and somehow they' re still holding on.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You' re done now?8 MR. MC KEE:	Yeah, I' m done.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.10 Right.	So when you just now  said11 that there' s no real way to define profit but  yet12 used profit as a proxy for the health of   the13 landlords, specifically, about the health of  the14 landlords.	So I' m confused as to why you' re now15 backing off of a definition that you couldn' t16 provide to us.17 Second --18 MR. MC KEE:	Can I answer that?19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Wait.	I' m not20 done yet.	I gave you the opportunity.21 MR. MC KEE:	Okay.	Go ahead.	I22 can handle a two- part question.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Second, net24 operating income, as you' re looking at it, does not25 account for capital expenses.	So, again, it' s2 
2 going to challenge your definition of  profit.3 Now, also, if you look at your  net4 operating income and some of the other indices  that5 the staff reports have put out, how are  you6 conjuring up what landlords are making?	What --7 what -- what dynamic, what logic flow is  going8 through your mind to stand there and tell us  that9 landlords are making whatever they' re making and in10 your -- and in your presentation here it  just11 seemed to be an outrageous  amount.12 Could you walk me through your13 sequence to tell me how landlords are making out  so14 well?15 MR. MC KEE:	Well, first of all,16 Mr. Schleider, I would appreciate it if  you17 wouldn' t put words in my mouth.	I did not say that18 landlords were making outrageous amount of  profit.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.20 MR. MC KEE:	I said, they seemed21 to be doing very well.	And that' s based on the net22 operating income figures that this board  produces23 every year.	And if you track it over time,  there24 has been a steady increase in net operating  incomes25 for owners of rent stabilized  properties.2 
3 MR. MC KEE:	As I said before, to4 calculate profit would require information about  an5 individual property, including tax information,6 which you surely understand.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.8 MR. MC KEE:	But we -- so we don' t9 have that.	But what we do have is net  operating10 income, which we can take as a surrogate for  the11 condition of the residential rental real  estate12 industry in this City.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.14 MR. MC KEE:	And I think that is  a15 pretty good surrogate.16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	It' s a good place17 to start.	But as I said, it does not account  for18 capital expenses.19 MR. MC KEE:	Nor should it.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, you may21 say, nor should it, but you still have to  maintain22 the housing stock.	You still have to replace --23 MR. MC KEE:	I think one of the24 things that this board does correctly  --25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You still have3 
2 mandated improvements that need to be considered  in3 your equation.4 MR. MC KEE:	You can --5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But I accept that6 you' ve moved off the profit bases and have gone7 into something a little more accepted with the  net8 operating as a proxy.9 MR. MC KEE:	No.	I think you' re,10 again, putting words in my  mouth.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well --12 MR. MC KEE:	I think one of the13 things this board does --14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- then we' ll15 agree to disagree.16 MR. MC KEE:	I think one of the17 things this board does correctly, unlike a  couple18 of the suburban boards, is that it does not  treat19 debt service as an operating expense.	It' s not an20 operating expense.	It is excluded from your21 calculations and it should be.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.23 MR. MC KEE:	Thank you.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25 MR. MC KEE:	Thank you very much.2

CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Dave Whitmore. Who will be followed by Sam Stein. Who will be followed by  DennisMR. WHITMORE:	Good afternoon, RGBAs you know, my name is  David
10 Whitmore and I' m a small property owner in11 Brooklyn.12 I have an eight- family property in13 Park Slope that I would like to speak to you   about14 today that is, and has been, negatively impacted  by15 the annual small increases provided by RGB,  without16 the clear understanding of how difficult it is  for17 a small property owner to be able to provide all   of18 the needed and required services that a  property19 owner must do and the dollars available to do  so.20 My property' s gross rental income21 in 2010 was $ 3 , 715 higher than it was 2009 .	That22 is before I subtract the increased real  estate23 taxes and water and sewer charges from the 2009  to24 2010 , which total collectively, $ 1 , 211 .	That left25 me with an adjusted net increase of just $ 2 , 503 for10 

2	2010 .3
2011 , the adjusted net increase
4	was $ 1 , 575 .	And in 2012 , the adjusted net increase 5	was $ 1 , 565 .6 Said adjusted figures do not  take7 into consideration the unforeseen price increases8 to my suppliers, the utilities, legal and  insurance9 costs.	And if just one tenant doesn' t or cannot10 pay their rent for one to two months, I' m  behind11 the eight ball with my expenses versus my  rental12 income.13 And now we' re being targeted to14 install backflow preventers whose cost to  comply15 are in the $ 5 , 000 to $ 10 , 000 range.16 Let me also inform this board  that17 many, many small property owners, including myself,18 know our tenants and their families very  well19 because we interact with them daily either  by20 living in the building with them or by dealing  with21 them directly whenever the need  arises.22 We know them by name, not  by23 apartment number.	They know our family and  home24 telephone number.	For those reasons, amongst25 others, our residents become very comfortable6 
2 living in our buildings.3 However, the way regulations are4 enacted, they constantly work against us.	Why?5 Because without vacancies and their substantial6 vacancy allowance and individual apartment7 renovation increases it provides, we simply do  not8 have the financial ability to increase  our9 regulated rents by making massive building  wide10 improvements to our buildings.11 We, therefore, are very dependent12 on the low rent adjustment just to try and keep   our13 heads above water annually. In my building,  the14 last vacancy was nine years ago.	I also have four15 tenants who have lived there for at least 25  years16 or better.	It' s unreasonable to assume that17 someone would live somewhere where they don' t feel18 comfortable or content.	Yet we small owners are19 constantly penalized financially for being very20 good property owners and caring neighbors.21 We not only need a fair  and22 reasonable rent increase to properly maintain  our23 buildings and to cover our annual costs, we  also24 need for the low rent adjustment to be  increased25 because far too many of our rents are way  below2 
2 marketable rents simply due to rent  regulation.3 There are governmental programs to4 greatly assist those tenants whose income  cannot5 afford to pay a  market rent.	Why are we being6 forced to undertake this?	We are not getting a7 discount on our building costs for doing  so.8 Please also understand and realize9 that most small property owners have a full- time10 job to go to and then we come home to our  part- time11 job, taking care of our buildings.	This is at no12 weekly pay.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Whitmore,14 I' m going to ask you to wrap up.15 MR. WHITMORE:	We do this because16 our property is the biggest financial  investment17 that we have and we must protect it or  lose18 everything financially.19 I implore this board to  seriously20 look at our plight, to walk in our shoes and   to21 allow for us to be able to run our buildings with   a22fairrentalincome from our tenants.23And I thank you for  listening.24CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25( Applause.)
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Harvey.3 MR. EPSTEIN:	Hi, Mr. Whitmore.4 MR. WHITMORE:	Yes.5 MR. EPSTEIN:	You said you have a6 building in Park Slope?7 MR. WHITMORE:	That' s correct.8 MR. EPSTEIN:	And how many units9 is that building?10 MR. WHITMORE:	Eight.11 MR. EPSTEIN:	Eight units.	And12 do you live in that building?13 MR. WHITMORE:	Not any more.14 MR.

We had moved out when we  had21 children that were of age to go to school and   we22 didn' t want to send them to school in New  York23 City.24 MR. EPSTEIN:	So you left.

EPSTEIN:	And what' s your12 average rent?13 MR. WHITMORE:	Well, the rent14 varies.	I have $ 700 , $ 800 rents and I have as high15 as $ 1 , 700 rents.	They' re all -- but --16 MR.

2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.3 MR. WHITMORE:	Okay.4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Sam Stein.5 MR. STEIN:	Good afternoon.6 Thank you, Chairman Kimmel, for7 holding this hearing today and to all of you  for8 hearing the testimony of rent stabilized  tenants9 about the proposed guidelines for renewal  lease10 increases.11 My name is Sam Stein.	I am an12 organizer at New York State Tenants and  Neighbors,13 a grassroots organization that helps  renters14 preserve at- risk affordable housing and strengthen15 tenants' rights in New York.16 We represent approximately 2 , 50017 tenants, most of whom are rent stabilized,  almost18 all of whom have low or moderate incomes and  many19 of whom are elderly people on fixed  incomes.20 I' m also a tenant in a rent21 stabilized apartment in Elmhurst, Queens.22 As a representative of my23 organization and our members, I have attended  every24 public meeting that this board has held over  the25 past four months and read each report that  the2 
2 board' s staff has ably produced.3 Based on the information presented4 to the board by both the staff and invited  experts,5 as well as my experience counseling rent  stabilized6 tenants from around the City, I believe  the7 preliminary guidelines this board has approved  are8 far too high.9 As the Income and Affordability10 Report showed, tenants are facing dire  economic11 conditions with unemployment rising again, wages12 declining and nearly a third of rent  stabilized13 tenants citywide putting half their income  towards14 rent.15 As the Income and Expense study16 reported, landlords net operating incomes have17 risen for the seventh consecutive year. As  the18 mortgage survey showed, the market for  rent19 stabilized buildings remains strong even in  light20 of a national housing crisis.21 According to the RGB' s changes22 report, at least 9 , 499 apartments left rent23 stabilization last year. That is a  staggering24 number. It' s more New Yorkers than complained about25 bed bugs at the peak of  that crisis.	It' s more New2 
2 Yorkers than were killed by cigarettes last  year.3 It' s more New Yorkers than are on the organ donor4 waiting list.	It' s an ongoing crisis in this City5 and one that the RGB must take into account as   it6 considers an abnormally high preliminary range  of7 rent increases.8 I' d like to address the public9 members because how you choose to vote is of  the10 utmost importance.11 Mr. Kimmel, Ms. Levy- Odom, Ms.12 Moore, Ms. Shine and Mr. Wenk, on April 30 th you13 voted for a preliminary guideline of 3 . 25 to 6 . 2514 for one- year leases and 5 percent to 9 . 5 percent15 for two- year leases.16 We believe this entire range is17 above the level many tenants can afford and  beyond18 the need of most landlords.19 Additionally, the proposed20 guidelines under consideration today would send21 many apartments over the vacancy decontrol22 threshold, setting them to leave rent  stabilization23 when the current tenant leaves.	This would impact24 not just the rent stabilized tenants we and  our25 allied organizations represent but, also, disrupt2 
2 the stability and change the character of  the3 broader communities those tenants are a part of  and4 would have broader implications for our  City.5 As you are representatives of  the6 public and of the New Yorkers who care deeply  about7 their neighbors and about communities in which  they8 live, I would like to ask you each, personally,  to9 vote for a significantly lower adjustment this  year10 than what was approved at the preliminary  vote.11 Additionally, if a proviso12 targeting lower rent apartments is one  again13 introduced this year, I ask you to  reject it.	As14 data from the Community Service Society has  shown15 time and again, these provisos disproportionately16 fall on the backs of the poorest, oldest and  most17 long term of rent stabilized tenants. The  tenants18 we represent and many others simply cannot  afford19 these kinds of increases.20 We urge the board to  consider21 holding rents still in 2013 . If you determine that22 this is not possible, we encourage the board  to23 consider the lowest possible rent increase and  we24 ask you to remember the tenants who testify  here25 today and the hundreds of thousand more who  this2 
2 rent increase would affect.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Sam.4 ( Applause.)5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Questions?6 Harvey.7 MR. EPSTEIN:	Yes, Sam, can you8 talk a little more about the low rent proviso  and9 tell us what the -- what the concerns are you   have10 about them.	Because we' ve had a lot of11 conversations from small property owners saying12 that they really need those low  rent provisos.	And13 we' ve heard from tenants that they' re really14 struggling.15 So can you give us some  background16 to that?17 MR. STEIN:	Sure.	Both from my18 experience as a tenant counselor and also from  data19 that was provided to the board by the  Community20 Service Society, we know that it' s not as if  these21 low rent apartments are occupied by high  income22 tenants.	They are, by far, occupied by the  lowest23 income tenants as a -- as  a bracket.	And they are24 almost all seniors who have lived in  those25 apartments for a very long  time.2 
2 So we need to consider that  when3 we think about who these low rent tenants  are.4 Also, they tend to fall disproportionately in  the5 lowest income parts of the City.	So while we can6 find one or two cases where there' s a high  rent7 district with low rent apartments, it' s almost8 always in neighborhoods of the Bronx where  people9 have extremely low incomes at these low  rent10 apartments -- can be found.11 MR. EPSTEIN:	And can I ask you12 one more question about this, March to Market  Rate13 Housing and I' m wondering what you' re seeing in14 relationship to buildings where a percentage of  the15 units are going out of rent -- out of  rent16 stabilization and into market?	Are you seeing that17 as a factor and how -- what' s going on in  those18 buildings?19 MR. STEIN:	Yeah.	We certainly20 see that as a factor in the neighborhoods that   have21 been facing gentrification for a  long time.	We all22 know those parts of so- called core Manhattan. But23 we' re seeing that more and more in neighborhoods24 like Crown Heights in Brooklyn that have had  a25 sudden influx of new tenants and when that  happens,2 
2 there tends to be a huge amount of pressure  on3 those remaining rent stabilized tenants to  leave.4 And that' s when we get calls about5 harassment, about persistent bad conditions, hoping6 that the tenants will simply get up and leave  so7 that the landlord can have a fully market  rate8 apartment.	Oftentimes they then hope to sell  the9 apartment building and can get a much better  rate10 at that point.11 So there' s a -- there' s a great12 deal of pressure on those remaining few  rent13 stabilized tenants in a largely market  rate14 apartment.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Steve.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Now the Tenants18 and Neighbors Organization that you' re with, that' s19 the state level or that' s the local level?	That' s20 the state level; right?21 MR. STEIN:	Yeah.	We' re a22 statewide organization.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Do you feel that24 if the market rents were markedly lower, that  there25 wouldn' t be pressures so much on the rent2 
2 stabilized housing stock pricing level?3 MR. STEIN:	You mean if the4 general market rates were lower there would be  less5 pressure?6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yeah.7 MR. STEIN:	I think that' s8 partially true.	But we have to remember  --9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	Now --10 MR. STEIN:	Can I finish?11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, I didn' t12 realize you didn' t answer the question.13 MR. STEIN:	I just -- just the14 other point is that rent stabilization is also  a15 system of protections for tenants.	Like guaranteed16 lease renewal that we think is  --17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I understand that.18 I understand.	I' m just --19 MR. STEIN:	Right.	So that20 pressure would still affect us.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m just -- the22 statutory protection for guaranteed lease renewal23 doesn' t impact the economics unless there' s a24 disparity between the contract rent and a  market25 rent.	To the landlord it' s immaterial whether they2 
2 have a rent regulated unit at market or market  --3 or deregulated unit at market in terms of -- of   the4 collections.	All right.5 So let' s just -- all I' m asking6 about is --7 MR. STEIN:	Yeah.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- if the market9 rents were markedly lower, --10 MR. STEIN:	Um- hum.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- would there be12 the same pressure in your mind on -- on the   rent13 stabilized housing pricing levels?14 MR. STEIN:	I presume most of the15 -- it' s the rent gap.	It' s the gap between what16 the rents are right now.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I understand that.18 Right.	Now when we have a million  apartments,19 roughly, rent stabilized that are essentially20 locked out of the free market system and we  have21 demand for housing in New York because  our22 population is growing, --23 MR. STEIN:	Um- hum.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- do you see that25 as a contributing factor to price rise for  market2 
 2 rate units that aren' t so constrained or locked out3 of the market?4 MR. STEIN:	I don' t see rent5 stabilization as the reason that prices are  high6 outside of the rent stabilized stock.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Really?8 MR. STEIN:	Yes.9 ( Applause.)10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.11 It' s amazing.12 MR. STEIN:	I' d be happy to have a13 conversation about the many other factors that keep 14	--15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, all right.16 Where rent stabilization was removed from17 municipality --18 MR. STEIN:	Yeah.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- actually rents20 went down.21 ( Audience participation.)22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You look at -- you23 read about Boston.	Any time you want to read  about24 Boston go ahead.25 Go ahead.15 
2 MR. STEIN:	The audience seems to3 have an opinion about this.4 ( Audience participation.)5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You answered the6 question.	That' s fine.7 MR. STEIN:	No, I don' t believe if8 we got rid of rent stabilization market rents  would9 go down.	I mean, we' ve talked a lot on the  board10 at different times about zoning, for instance as  an11 impediment to more dense construction. I think  that12 has much more to do with it than  rent13 stabilization.14 Also, new construction, unless it15 takes a tax break, isn' t going to be in  rent16 stabilization, so I don' t see why that would be  an17 impediment to build new housing.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You don' t see it?19 MR. STEIN:	I don' t think that20 that' s the dominant factor that you' re pointing to.21 I mean, we' ve been fighting for new construction of22 affordable housing.	We have a program for a  new23 Mitchell Lama housing.24 We -- there needs to be  new25 affordable housing, absolutely.2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Which is fine.3 MR. STEIN:	But it' s not -- I4 don' t believe that it' s rent stabilization that' s5 holding back --6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That' s holding the7 pricing gap between market rent and rent  stabilized8 contracts.	If we got it rid of it all  --9 MR. STEIN:	So you think if we  got10 rid of rent stabilization, all rents would go  down.11 I think those rent stabilized rents would  go up.	I12 think there' s a huge amount of demand for high  rent13 luxury apartments in this City and there  will14 simply be --15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But if the market16 rents come down, --17 MR. STEIN:	Yes.18 MR. SCHLEIDER: -- there' s19 significantly less pressure on this type of --  of20 movement that you say to recapture rent  stabilized21 apartments.22 MR. STEIN: The -- the problem  is,23 I don' t see why market rates would go down  simply24 because we got rid of rent  stabilization.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You don' t see2 

2	that?3
MR. STEIN: Obviously no, because
 4 all the landlords who testified today, want to  see5 the rents go up because they believe that  rent6 stabilization is holding them back.7 ( Audience participation.)8 ( Applause.) 9 MR. STEIN:	The rent stabilization 10	--11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No.	They want to12 see the rents go up to a market  level.13 MR. STEIN:	I' m sorry.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The market level15 is high because of the demand for  housing.16 MR. STEIN:	Um- hum.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The demand is at a18 level because, partly, the constrained supply.19 MR. STEIN:	And you think rent20 stabilization constrains supply of housing?21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	When we have22 tenants that don' t move out of their apartments for 23	30 , 40 years --24 MR. STEIN:	Right.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- and let' s say24 
2 they have a nice two- bedroom, three- bedroom3 apartment.	They raise their family, which is  fine.4 MR. STEIN:	Yeah.5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That' s great.6 MR. STEIN:	Right.	There' s a7 social benefit there.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right.	Now the9 kids are out.10 MR. STEIN:	Uh- huh.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	They don' t move.12 It' s -- it' s -- it' s taking a two or three- bedroom13 family sized apartment --14 MR. STEIN:	Uh- huh.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- basically off16 the market.17 MR. STEIN:	That' s not the18 creation of a new apartment.	If they were to19 move --20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m not saying21 it' s the creation of new apartments.22 MR. STEIN:	Uh- huh.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m not -- I' m not24 talking about that.25 MR. STEIN:	Uh- huh.2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m saying right3 now the -- the supply may be  artificially4 constrained which leads to that pricing gap  between5 rent stabilized apartments, which don' t count6 because of the turnover, and the market  rate,7 because of the demand for housing in New York  City.8 MR. STEIN:	So our older tenants9 who have lived in their apartments for a long  time,10 should move out after their children  leave?11 ( Audience participation.)12 MR. STEIN:	I mean, I think we  see13 ourselves as a part of the  neighborhood14 stabilization here.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m saying -- no,16we can havethisdiscussion any time you want.17MR.

MAY:	So it' s sort of ironic11 that I find myself -- I' m a tenant  representative12 and I find myself actually testifying on behalf  of13 a group of landlords that doesn' t seem to be14 showing up here at all, which is the  large15 landlords.16 My -- my landlord, my  landlords,17 are John Harrison Stryker and Margaret  Stryker18 Porous.	John Harrison Stryker owns a  company19 called Centennial Real Estate, that consists  of20 almost 500 subsidiary companies, one of which  is21 our management company, which is owned by  his22 daughter, Margaret Stryker Porous.23 According to their website,24 Centennial manages $ 4 . 5 billion worth of properties25 and New Castle, which is Margaret' s company,2 
2 manages $ 400 million. They bought our building3 about a year ago for about $ 8 million.	There are4 50 units and only six are rent  stabilized.5 And so if you' re looking at6 percentages, I' d say the difference between a 67 percent and a 9 percent on a two- year lease for  us8 would be somewhere on the order of 20 - thousandths9 of 1 percent of their total housing  stock.10 So it' s sort of ironic that I' m11 now here to testify on behalf of  them.12 They bought -- as I said,  they13 bought my building a  year ago.	The first thing14 they did was take away every preferential rent  in15 the building.	That meant five people left.	They16 took away -- they raised the rents on all the   units17 that were already deregulated.	That meant another18 five people left.19 They gutted every apartment that20 was empty and all of those people are now  paying21 double or more of what the prior tenants  were22 paying, even the ones that were out  of23 stabilization.24 I' m only taking a minute and 3025 seconds.2

7 you told us, 50 units.8 MR. MAY:	About 50 units, yeah.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	Any10 questions?11 Oh, I' m sorry.	Harvey.12 MR. EPSTEIN:	Thank you for13 testifying today.14 And it' s really an important part15 of the rent stabilized housing stock that you' re16 talking about.17 And so what do you think  the18 Guidelines Board should do in a situation with  your19 landlord, who is really trying to use  whatever20 tools available to them to deregulate every unit  in21 the building?22 MR. MAY:	Well, I mean, it would23 be nice if DHCR would be a little more stringent  in24 enforcing the removal of units from the rent  rolls25 incorrectly, which happens pretty often.7 
2 There was one unit on the  first3 floor of our building that there was an  elderly4 couple that passed away.	They were under rent5 control.	That apartment went from $ 400 to $ 2 , 5006 in -- the four months that it took them to   renovate7 the apartment.8 I, obviously, have no way  of9 knowing how much they spent on the renovations  but10 given that they did it after the change in  minimum11 to $ 2 , 500 , they would have had to spend something12 like $ 120 , 000 and I don' t think they did.13 MR. EPSTEIN:	So what do you think14 our -- so for the Guidelines increases, what do  you15 look for Guidelines increases for tenants you,  the16 five remaining rent stabilized tenants in  your17 building?	Do you think we should treat  your18 landlord differently than the small six- unit19 property owner?20 MR. MAY:	I think given that21 Centennial owns properties in 28 states, the  vast22 majority of which have no rent stabilization,  I23 think it would seem reasonable to have the  tiny24 drop of the tiny drop of their housing stock  be,25 you know, 20 - thousandths of one percent less.2

I' ve25 been in the property management business for  over2 
2 30 years and specialize in community  development3 and the rehabilitation of affordable housing.4 Of the 480 apartments we  own5 and/ or manage, 316 rent for less than $ 1 , 000 .	Of6 that number, 40 rent for less than $ 500 .	All units7 are rent stabilized.8 Our most recent development is9 100 - unit preservation project consisting of four10 seriously distressed buildings in the southwest11 Bronx.	Of these 100 units, 89 rent for less  than12 $ 1 , 000 and of that, 18 rent for less than $ 500 and13 30 rent for less than $ 750 .14 Part of the reason these  buildings15 fell into disrepair or were foreclosed on, were  due16 to the fact that the rents did not cover  the17 expenses.18 Please, I ask you today  to19 remember the many of us in community housing  work,20 affordable housing and the not- for- profit owners21 that need the minimum dollar increase for  rents22 under $ 1 , 000 in order to adequately maintain our23 buildings, therefore revitalizing these target24 neighborhood.

CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Good to seeMS. CUNNINGHAM:	Thank you. Same here.Good after -- good afternoon, Mr.
7 Chairman, members of the Rent Guidelines Board  and8 all present.9 My name is Anne Cunningham.10 Since 1979 , when I moved into the11 Commander Hotel, now known as the Tempo, I  have12 advocated for tenants.13 For the past 11 - and- a- half years,14 I have served on the staff of Councilmember  Gale15 Brewer as a housing specialist and will  continue16 until December 31 st of this year.17 Since you have all heard it  from18 me for all these years, today' s testimony will be19 relatively short.20 Residential Class A hotels and21 SROs.22 The majority of the buildings in23 this category were classified as illegal  hotels24 until last year.25 Housing in this buildings are the7 
2 elderly -- rather, housed in these buildings  are3 the elderly, unemployed, disabled veterans, working4 poor and the challenged.	Many living in rooms5 without kitchens and sharing bathrooms.6 Any increase in rent would push7 them into destitution.	These buildings are beset8 by unsafe living conditions, harassment, criminal9 activities and warehousing.10 Example.	The Imperial Court Hotel11 on West 79 th Street in the City, out of 220  rooms,12 150 of those rooms are warehoused.	Keep in mind,13 noncompliance of housing codes and rent  regulation14 laws are also, sadly, the loss of  affordable15 housing.16 Several buildings in this category17 house the homeless, whereby landlords receive18 $ 3 , 300 a month per room and upwards sometimes.	The19 proviso must be intact. Please keep the  proviso.20 Rent control and rent stabilized21 tenants, currently it appears that rent  controlled22 tenants pay higher rents.	These tenants are older.23 Reside in older buildings and are beset  with24 increases such as MCRs, MBRs and MCIs and fuel  pass25 along and, also, surcharges for roommates.2 
2 In fact, many of the tenants  are3 grossly overcharged and pay the fuel bill for  the4 entire building.5 Stabilized rents have escalated6 beyond affordability.	What I did not include,  and7 I also attached, was a page about  certain8 discrepancies in my building, that' s page 2 .9 My message today is, there should10 be a memorandum on all -- a moratorium on all   rent11 increases until the millions of dollars in  fines12 owned to the City are paid and all the thousands  of13 violations are cured.14 And I thank you for the  pleasure15 of participation once again.16 ( Applause.)17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,18 Anne.19 Daniel Andrechuk.20 Please excuse me if I21 mispronounce.22 MR. ANDRECHUK:	It' s good.	It' s23 very good.	Almost perfect.24 Okay.	So you already said -- I' m25 sorry.	All of you heard my name.	My name is2 

2	Daniel Andrechuk.3
I' m the manager of a few buildings
4 in Washington Heights.	All of them that had been5 erected in 1926 .	So as you know, that' s not very6 new.	They need a lot of work, a lot of    repairs.7 So what I would like to say  that,8 as many people who were testifying before me,  they9 told you about increases that we' re facing of10 taxes, water, sewage, repairs, insurance and  et11 cetera.12 As you know, the Price Index  of13 Operating Costs measured an increase in  operating14 costs of 5 . 9 this year, double the rate of increase15 from the last year, which was only 2 . 8 percent,16 while the Price Index of Operating Costs, was  more17 realistically -- realistic compared to last  year.18 The 5 . 9 percent understates costs19 for several reasons, including the increase  of20 maintenance needs to an old and aging  housing21 stock, which are not included in the Prince  Index22 of Operating Costs market, basket goods  and23 services that stays constant from year to  year.24 Therefore, I' m asking for rent25 increase of 7 percent for a one- year lease and  114 
2 percent for two- year lease.3 In addition to that, I' m asking4 you that the Rent Guidelines Board to continue  last5 year' s practice by establishing a minimum rent6 adjustment.	But this time I' m asking your for $ 707 for a one- year lease increase and $ 110 for two8 year' s lease increase.9 It is a simple matter of  equity10 that the minimum rent adjustment be available  for11 at least two consecutive years so that the  entire12 stabilized stock would be uniformly affected.13I' m asking you for your14considerationandyour wisdom to pass this15increases.16Thank you.17CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.18Any questions?19Harvey.20MR.

KULESZA:	That' s me.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes?	No?( Discussion off the record.) CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Edward Maloney. MR. MALONEY:	Good afternoon.My name is Edward Maloney.	I' m
17 co- chair of the Tenant Association of 215 East 80 th18 Street.	And I' m a retired person living on a  fixed19 income.20 I' m a stabilized tenant in a21 condo- converted building, one of over a dozen large22 rental properties converted by my landlord who  has23 a lot more rental buildings awaiting  conversion.24 My landlord has opted out of affordable housing  and25 is converting and selling apartments.17 
2 It is a proven fact that  rent3 regulation is the most successful and these  days,4 almost the only form of housing preservation  for5 the middle and working classes of  the City.	But6 this system is rewarding greed over  stability.7 My landlord, like many others,8 repairs some violations and spruces up  their9 building for condo sales and gets an 18 percent  MCI10 rent increase, rubber stamped by the DHCR,  above11 and beyond this board' s annual allowance.12 Condo neighbors pay for the  MCI13 once.	Tenants have the rent increase forever.14 At the meeting of the Tenants  and15 Neighbors Association, 41 of the 42  buildings16 represented had large MCI rent increases  recently.17 Please stop rewarding greed over18 stability.19 In the past, when this Rent20 Guidelines Board and the DHCR allowed three- year21 renewals, the vast majority of tenants had  their22 renewals fall on an even year one time and an   odd23 year the next renewal or  vice versa.	So their24 increases varied evenly between odd and  even25 cycles.2 
2 Most tenants opt for the maximum3 rental term to save themselves and their  landlords4 the extra bother of renewing every year.	And5 usually they are rewarded for this by a  small6 saving as a cumulative multi- year increases are a7 little less than the cumulative annual  increases.8 However, now that only two- year9 renewals are permitted, almost the  entire10 stabilized tenantship is -- is divided between  even11 years or those who renew in the  odd years.	This12 wouldn' t matter of the Rent Guidelines Board13 practiced even- handed increases.	But for some14 reason, that' s not happened lately.15 Looking over the past dozen years,16 the odd year renewals have never had an  increase17 under 5 - and- a- half percent.	And only one of these,18 with two increases of 6 percent and two over  719 percent.	On the other hand, even year  renewals20 have had no less than two increases of 4   percent,21 one of 4 - and- a- half percent and one each in the22 6 , 7 , and 8 percent range.23 For some capricious or unlucky24 reason, this board has put people in the odd  years,25 of which this is one, at a disadvantage of  several2 
2 percent.	There does not seem to be a logic  or3 fairness to penalizing one half of the  tenantship.4 I wanted to point out that the historical  Rent5 Guidelines decisions have produced this imbalance.6 So this should be a year for  extra7 consideration rather than a year of  greater8 penalization for tenants.	It behooves this Rent9 Guidelines Board to be even handed and  balanced10 and even as you' re commutative decisions have made11 a historical impact.12 So please remember, this should  be13 a year on the lesser side, if only to balance   the14 board' s past decisions.15 And I want to say if there  are16 small struggling owners, which every year we  see17 come here, let them open their books, show  hardship18 and adjust accordingly.	But please stop giving19 huge landlords mega profits and power.20 Would you have voted to  continue21 the tax breaks for the top  one percent?	It' s the22 same thing.	Please do the right thing.	No23 increase this year or very small balance to  balance24 -- or a very small increase to balance  past25 decisions.2

2	Guidelines Board.3
I am here today representing  my
4 constituents in the 10 th Congressional District,5 which includes parts of Manhattan and  Brooklyn.6 A great many of my  constituents7 reside in rent stabilized apartments and  rent8 regulation is a critical issue of concern for  these9 residents.10 On May 1 st, this board proposed11 increases for rent stabilized apartments of 3 . 212 percent to 6 . 25 percent for one- year leases and 513 percent to 9 . 5 percent for two- year leases.14 Voting to enact the proposed15 increases will negatively impact millions of  low16 and middle class New Yorkers and further  intensify17 the financial burden these residents face  during18 this period of economic recovery.19 I strongly encourage the RGB  to20 reconsider its preliminary vote and to enact  lower21 guidelines.22 As in the past, the board  has23 again favored increases for landlords who  argue24 that the high expenses of building operation  and25 maintenance justify the higher rates.	However, the4 
2 2013 , Income and Expense Study, which analyzes3 economic conditions for landlords, reveals a4 thriving market for property owners.5 Rental income has risen 4 . 46 percent and net operating income grew 5 . 6 percent7 making this the seventh consecutive year of  rising8 NOI.9 To be clear, I believe  property10 owners should profit from their investments.11 However, we cannot afford for them to  maximize12 their profits on the backs of low and middle  income13 families who rely on affordable  housing.14 While the RGB' s 2013 Price Index15 of Operating Costs has inched up by 5 . 9 percent16 this year, it is imperative to note that there  are17 many things landlords can do to keep low --  costs18 low as prices low.19 Data reveals that there are two20 main factors contributing to their increase in  PIOC21 or fuel costs and taxes.	Fuel costs can be22 eliminated through NYSERDA grants and other  public23 funds, while tax abatements and exemptions are  also24 available through the J- 51 program.	Landlords must25 also do their part to keep costs  low.2 
2 The board must consider the3 economic conditions and affordability for  tenants.4 The 2013 Income and Affordability Study  clearly5 shows tenants in rent stabilized apartments  are6 struggling financially.	On average, these7 residents are earning $ 15 , 000 less than their8 counterparts in the market rate apartments.	And9 over the past 12 months, their wages declined  by10 4 . 5 percent.11 On average, 35 percent of  tenant12 income is allocated to the cost of housing  and13 nearly one- third are paying more than 50 percent of14 their income in rent.15 Additionally, the RGB' s own 201316 study shows that rent stabilized housing  stock17 continues to decline much faster than it  expands.18 In 2012 , New York City lost 9 , 499 rent stabilized19 apartments, 61 . 3 percent of which were in20 Manhattan, while only 6 , 960 stabilized apartments21 were added.22 More than a third of these  units23 were added through the 421 A Tax Credit Program and24 have an average monthly rent of $ 3 , 106 .	In25 comparison, the average income for rent  stabilized2 
2 tenants is $ 37 , 000 .3 In fact, according to federal4 standards, in order for this rent to be  considered5 affordable, residents would have to make $ 124 , 240 a6 year.	Clearly, those units are seriously out  of7 reach for the target population.8 On behalf of my constituents  in9 the 10 th Congressional District and rent regulated10 tenants across the City, I urge the RGB to act   with11 restraint and pass the absolute minimum  rent12 increase possible.13 I will continue to fight  in14 Congress for funding for housing programs  which15 directly benefit tenants and I ask the RGB  to16 consider its unique position in establishing  rent17 adjustments for rent stabilized tenants and  help18 keep our stabilized housing stock affordable  for19 low and middle income New  Yorkers.20 Thank you.21 ( Applause.)22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.23 MR.

FIRESTEIN:	Hi.	My name is12 Al Firestein.	I own a property in Soho, 19  Mercer13 Street.	It' s my only building. I' ve testified for14 you guys before.15 My problem is that I have  three16 full floor loft tenants.	And loft lease increases17 for the last several years have been below  the18 increases from general rent stabilized apartments.19 I' ve had real estate tax increases20 for the last four years, going from $ 32 , 000 to 21	$ 37 , 000 , to $ 44 , 000 to $ 52 , 000 to $ 67 , 000 -- on22 average, that' s 8 . 75 percent per year.23 The total rent that I get from  the24 three tenants, residential tenants, who equal  half25 the floor space of the building, is less than  half22 
2 the real estate tax for the  last year.	And, of3 course, it' s going to keep going up.4 Now I heard someone just  recently5 say that smaller owners should open their  books.6 And that person is apparently unaware of the  fact7 that small owners have to open their books with  an8 RPI e- statement every year.	I know I have to.9 It' s time consuming but I do it.10 I got a -- approximately a  111 percent real estate tax decrease last year  after12 showing the comparables and the increases, which  is13 not really very much since it was about a   2014 percent increase over the previous year.15 So I would hope that you take  that16 into account when you set the  loft increases.	My17 three tenants pay between $ 1 , 000 and $ 1 , 400 per18 month.	The lot size is 25 by  100 .	They each have19 a full floor.	So they have a gross of 2 , 500 .	It' s20 actually a net of more like 1 , 800 square feet.21 One of them is an architect  who,22 not too long ago, bought an upstate  summer home.	I23 don' t have a summer home.24 Thank you.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.2

I' m immigrant so I cannot --15 I' m not very good speaker so I -- owner of  very16 little builder.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	What' s your18 name again?19 MR. KULESZA:	Leszak Kulesza.20 You even don' t -- didn' t pronounce21 correct my name.	It' s a problem, everybody.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Got it.23 MR. KULESZA:	So I' m owner24 six- family building.	The highest rent for 1 , 00025 square feet is $ 1 , 050 .	It' s preferential.	I don' t11 
2 want to charge more than this.	Those people have3 no money so -- but I want to -- ask for this in   the4 lowest rent, which is like $ 500 for five --  for5 1 , 000 square feet is very, very low.	And why those6 families with high rents have to pay up --  they7 have to pay up for families with  low rents.	This8 is injustice.9 And you, it' s your job to -- to10 let up somehow.	This is not the problem.	They11 have to pay.	They have family.	They have to12 support a family and -- and they have to pay up   for13 some other families.	And all that is my -- this  is14 my statement, very short.15 In general, big -- bigger rent16 prices means more money for housing.	More money17 means more housing and lower rents.	Lower rates18 means less money for housing, bigger shorter  and19 bigger rents.	This is not -- this is market  low.20 And no one is able to  change this.	No matter what.21 The regulation is very expensive.22 It' s a lot of waste, a lot of crimes and you  can23 trick board, politician, media.	Can trick24 everyone.	Can trick me.	Can trick tenants.	Can25 trick everyone.	But they cannot trick banks.2 
2 Trick banks -- and banks when it' s commercial3 credit, oh, no, no, no.	No, we don' t want to deal4 -- or interest rate is very high and that  interest5 rate have to pay tenants.	That' s how it works.6 And then housing market in your7 City is sick.	It' s infected by deadly disease,8 which is rent regulation.	Every year many9 buildings is abandoned around the City.	It' s true.10 Old building -- a lot of buildings in very  bad11 condition.	And this is casualties of  rent12 regulation.	And the only remedy for this is --  is13 free market.14 I am very little and I can  compete15 with everybody, with owner of thousand --  thousand16 units.	I have only six.	I can compete with them.17 No problem.	But give me this possibility.	The18 biggest problem is regulation.	Those City19 inspector is not City inspector.	That is extortion20 agent.	And they -- oh, I' m sorry.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You -- you have22 30 seconds left.	You can finish.23 MR. KULESZA:	They are extortion24 agent and they -- soon the people gonna shoot  them.25 I have a tenant -- I' m owner for  five years.	Dog2 
2 inspector is coming and going every week  because3 tenant has a dog.	Who gonna pay for this?

MUSSAFI:	My name is Abraham15 Mussafi.16 Good afternoon to the board17 members.18 I' m a small owner.	I' m a partner19 with my brother and we have two building in  the20 City.	And we are owner/ occupied too.21 I think the main problem is  really22 we have here is really the unit that they  have23 really under market value.	This is the main24 problem for all the landlords.	And this is a big25 problem.2 
2 And I can sympathize with  the3 tenant but the landlord is not the welfare of  the4 City or the State of  New York.	They should look5 for different agencies.	They should look for6 Section 8 to help them.	And the people lost their7 job, we feel bad for them.	And the president8 increase it from six months getting paid while  they9 don' t have a job to -- up to year- and- a- half and10 two years or whatever.11 Bottom line, the government should12 help the people that cannot pay, not the  landlord.13 The landlord have the right to earn and have  a14 profit as any other businesses.	It' s not Russia15 here.	If people want to go in the free  housing,16 they should move to Russia.17 And as far as opening books,  the18 landlord has an open books.	That' s a joke.	This19 is 2013 .	The government knows every single rent20 that owner collect from what date to what  date.21 The name of the people, Social Security  number,22 everything.	Twice a year we have to fill out  all23 this information.	All expenses is made by  checks24 or credit card.	Everything is out in the open.	We25 don' t have any cash business.	Even the tenant pay2 
 2 cash, it' s on the deposit slip.3 This person -- the City know  how4 much he pays so there' s no ifs or buts.	This is5 nonsense of opening the books.	I don' t know where6 those people live.	Maybe they live 50 years behind7 us.	The people not updated  here.8 And I think they should  be9 definitely increased.	They should be talking about10 market value and if they need help, they should  not11 be on the shoulder of  the landlord.	The landlord12 has a right, like any other business to make  money13 and only people -- the City increases the  taxes14 left and right.	We can' t say boo.15 The City don' t take no16 responsibility.	I have one building with  an17 elevator.	The City used to inspect it for  free.18 Now we have to hire another company to inspect  it,19 the company that service us.	And we have to pay20 for it.	And God forbid if we miss, for one  day or 21	whatever, a penalty, a $ 1 , 000 , $ 2 , 000 -- $ 5 , 000 .	I22 don' t know where they come with this kind of23 numbers.	What do they think we have a  printing24 machine?25 Where is the City?	How come the22 
2 City doesn' t help?	They really choking us and  they3 want us to help the tenants.	It' s impossible to do4 that.5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.6 MR.

ATHINEOS:	My name is Chris21 Athineos.	And I' m a small owner from Brooklyn.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Chris, can you23 move the mic.24 MR. ATHINEOS:	My family and I25 operate and own several properties in Brooklyn.	We2 
2 do most of the work  ourselves.3 This year the board study,  the4 PIOC, says that owners' cost have increased by 5 . 95 percent.	And I' m here to tell you that our costs6 have increased much more than that.7 The PIOC right from the start  is8 flawed because it doesn' t measure the frequency of9 a needed repair, resulting in much higher  actual10 expenses.11 I own several brownstones that  are12 over 150 years old.	And you don' t have to be an13 economist to understand that it costs us a lot  more14 to maintain our brownstone than it does to  maintain15 buildings that are built in the 1950 s.16 We have two inch galvanized pipes17 that have become half- an- inch because of the decay18 inside.	The cost of calling a plumber to change  a19 riser in the wall going from the basement all  the20 way up to the fifth floor, runs into the  thousands21 of dollars.22 When the plumber breaks the walls23 in each apartment on the way up, he' s required  to24 be lead- safe certified and take precautions in25 dealing with presumed lead paint.	Then we have to2 
2 call in the plasterers, the painters and the  tile3 guys to fix all the damage.	It' s nowhere in the4 PIOC.5 What about the backflow prevention6 devices the State and City now require to  be7 installed?	Does anyone know what these devices8 do?	They prevent the water from washing   machines9 and boilers from backflowing into the water  supply.10 I' ve installed two at a cost of over $ 10 , 000 .	It' s11 not anywhere in the PIOC.12 Do you know that the backflow13 prevention devices then decrease the amount  of14 water pressure in the building by up to 20  percent.15 And as a result, then an owner has to  install16 booster pumps to maintain the water pressure in  the17 building so that the flushometers don' t constantly18 run and there' s enough pressure to take a  shower.19 Again, it' s not anywhere in the PIOC.20 These pumps are using electricity21 which result in higher electric costs.	Nowhere in22 the PIOC.23 Lastly, there are annual24 inspections of the backflow prevention devices by  a25 licensed plumber; again, not in the  PIOC.2 
2 This year, this past year, I had  a3 tenant who owed over $ 12 , 000 back rent.	He4 received countless orders to show cause. Every  one5 which was subsequently denied, which delayed  the6 proceedings for months.	Ultimately, he skipped out7 before the marshal came and left the apartment  full8 of furniture and trash.	It would cost me over9 $ 3 , 000 to have a mover move out all of his things.10 Not anywhere in the PIOC.11 The PIOC may measure the cost  of12 legal fees from one year to the next but it  doesn' t13 account for the countless times my attorney had  to14 appear in court for the tenant' s baseless orders to15 show cause.16 The greatest injustice of this17 system and something I hope the board will  pay18 particular attention to, is that there are  many19 tenants who have rents below $ 1 , 000 .	And as a20 result, they' re not paying their fair share to21 cover the actual cost of maintaining  that22 apartment.23 Is it too much to ask that  each24 apartment actually cover the cost of  maintaining25 that apartment?	My low rent tenants have  the2 
2 ability to pay but their rents have just been  kept3 artificially low because of their long  term4 occupancy of the apartment and inadequate  rent5 increases compounded over the years.	By passing a6 low rent adjustment, it will start to address  this7 inequity.8 So I recommend that the board  pass9 Guideline increases of at least 7 percent or $ 7010 for one- year leases and 11 percent or $ 110 ,11 whichever is greater, for the two- year leases.12 Thank you.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,14 Chris.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Any questions?17 ( No response.)18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.19 MR.

HONEY:I' msorry.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 MS. HONEY:	I am Assembly Member9 Linda B. Rosenthal.	And I represent the 67 th10 District, which includes the upper west side  and11 parts of -- parts of Clinton, Hells Kitchen  in12 Manhattan.13 As Chair of the New York  State14 Assembly' s Mitchell Lama Housing Subcommittee and a15 long time advocate for tenants' rights  and16 affordable housing, I urge the Rent  Guidelines17 Board to forego imposing any rent increase  this18 year.19 The RGB is currently considering20 increasing rents for one year leases by up to 6 . 2521 percent and by up to 9 percent on two- year  leases.22 Last year the board hiked rents 2 percent  on23 one- year leases and 4 percent on two- year leases.24 The RGB also imposed its egregious25 poor tax on tenants paying less than $ 1 , 000 per7 
2 month in rent and who have occupied  their3 apartments for at least six years.	$ 20 for4 one- year leases and -- or $ 40 for two- year leases.5 The rates RGB is proposing serve,6 once again, as confirmation that the RGB is  more7 concerned with its -- the interests of  deep8 pocketed landlords than it is in preserving  the9 economic and cultural diversity of this  City.10 My district is home to  nearly11 44 , 000 rent stabilized tenants.	And this board' s12 decision is the primary factor in whether or not  my13 constituents, and nearly two million  tenants14 statewide, will be able to maintain their  homes.15 Many of these people are living on low fixed  income16 like Social Security, which increased a paltry 1 . 717 percent this year, a far cry from the 6 . 25 percent18 rent increases these tenants may soon be  facing.19 Who on this earth, other than  the20 already wealthy, receives a 6 . 25 percent increase21 in income each year?	Too many rent regulated22 tenants already devote more than 30 percent  of23 their income towards paying rent.	And this comes24 at a time when New York, like the rest of   the25 nation, is only just emerging from one of the  most2 
2 extended economic downturns of our  lifetime.3 Throughout this process, these4 representing landlords have argued that  rent5 increases are necessary to keep pace with  rising6 fuel costs and that landlords depend upon  the7 income generated from their buildings.	For those8 who argue that these increases are reasonable,  one9 need only look at the exorbitant rents paid  by10 chain stores, banks and drugs stores in  storefronts11 in apartment buildings throughout the  City.12 In addition, the RGB also included13 the cost of fuel in its  rent calculations.	Using14 calculus that considers the shifting fuel  prices15 and the number of rooms in each building,  7516 percent of the annual fuel costs per room is  passed17 along to the tenant.18 What' s more, smaller landlords,19 who serve as the public face of these  arguments,20 represent only a tiny faction of an industry  that21 is, in actuality, dominated by wealthy  landlords22 and faceless corporations who control the  vast23 majority of properties.24 Year after year, we' re seeing25 landlords' profits skyrocketing even as  their2 
2 tenants are twisting themselves scrambling to  pay3 their bills.	It is unacceptable to consider4 placing the burden of any increased costs onto  the5 already working class New Yorkers who are  already6 facing nearly half their salary to pay their  rent.7 Ensuring that housing remains8 affordable for average working class families  is9 also key to economic recovery.	A strong middle10 class has always been the engine that  drives11 robust, economic growth.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I' m going to13 ask -- I' m going to ask you to start to wrap  up.14 MS. HONEY:	Okay.	Sure.15 So, therefore, I am calling on  the16 RGB to do the only reasonable thing and enact  a17 rent freeze this year.18 Thank you.19 ( Applause.)20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.21 MS.

2 My name is Susanna Blankley.	I am3 the Director of Housing, organizing at  Community4 Action for Safe Apartments.5 We are a community- based tenants'6 rights project out of New Settlement apartments  in7 the southwest Bronx.	We work primarily in8 Community Board 4 .9 Community Board 4 is home to  the10 second highest concentration of rent  stabilized11 housing in the Bronx and the third highest in  the12 City, 83 percent of all residents in  Community13 Board 4 are rent stabilized.14 The largest concentration of rent15 stabilized housing in the City is in the  northwest16 Bronx.17 And I' m here today on behalf of18 our membership who, almost all of whom, are  rent19 stabilized tenants who work to protect and  maintain20 quality and affordable housing in their homes  and21 in their neighborhood through collective action.22 I' m here in protest to the board' s23 decision not to hold outer borough hearings  this24 year or evening hearings.	Many of our members are25 folks who could not come today because of  your2 
2 decision to hold a hearing whose registration  ends3 at 7 : 00 in downtown Manhattan.4 We wrote you a letter  where5 tenants and neighbors asking you to reconsider  your6 decision, providing a free space and  guaranteeing7 turnout.	You never responded to our letter or  our8 invitation.9 And my concern is that when you' re10 proposing such high rent increases, now is the  time11 to create the most space to hear from the  tenants12 who would be affected and you decided to create  the13 least space.14 When you didn' t respond to our15 letter, last week we hold -- we hold -- we held   our16 own hearing in the southwest Bronx on June 5 th.17 More than 200 tenants came.	More tenants testified18 at our hearing on June 5 th than are registered  here19 today to testify.20 That is testament to the fact  that21 your decision excludes the voices of many  people22 who are impacted by your decisions on June 20 th.23 ( Applause.)24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25 Any questions?2 
2 MS. EPSTEIN:	Yes, Susanna.	Can3 you tell us a little more of what happened on   June4 5 th?	Like what happened?	What kind of hearing it5 was?	What did the  people say?	Can you give  us6 some details since, unfortunately, some of  the7 members on the Guidelines Board weren' t there.	I' d8 love to be able to have them hear what  was9 happening.10 MS. BLANKLEY:	Sure.	And we thank11 you and Brian for attending.12 We were also joined by  Assembly13 Member Gibson to listen to tenants'  testimonies,14 public advocate Bill Di Blasio and City Council15 Member, Helen Foster.16 But tenants testified and were17 given two minutes.	They actually had less time18 than you give us here today  to testify.	And they19 talked about three main things.	One was that they20 couldn' t afford the rent increases.	As you heard21 today and from Greg' s testimony from UNHP, 4022 percent of Bronx renters already pay more than  half23 of their income in rent.24 In Community Board 5 , which has25 the highest concentration of rent stabilized2 
2 housing, more than half of all renters pay  more3 than half of their income in rent.	So while rent4 stabilization is the largest form of  affordable5 housing in the City, it' s not affordable to the6 people that need it the most.	And a decision to7 increase rents by close to 10 percent is  the8 difference of people staying in their homes or  not9 staying in their homes.10 People will not be able to stay  in11 their homes if you pass this increase.	So people12 testified about that.	They testified about the13 rent burdens that they already experience.	Their14 inability to pay things like school fees or  for15 basic needs like food and medicine and what a  1016 percent increase would do to their  families.17 They testified about how the18 landlords already don' t use the rents to do their19 jobs.	So most of the tenants that came  and20 testified are active members of their  tenants'21 association who have to collectively organize  to22 make landlords use the rent that they pay them  for23 basic services like heat and hot  water.24 And they testified that landlords25 -- that in addition to rent, tenants may a   myriad2 
2 of other fees.	It' s not just MCIs, it' s washing3 machine fees, it' s air conditioning fees.	It' s4 legal fees.	A lot of landlords we work with --  one5 of the biggest landlords in the Bronx,  Chestnut6 Holdings, charges tenants damage fees.	Charges7 them fees for painting their apartments even  though8 they haven' t moved out yet.9 So they are challenged by a  myriad10 of other fees that they have to pay in addition   to11 rent.	And they talked about how, despite  that,12 landlords aren' t being responsive to their repair13 needs and don' t need an additional increase.14 MR. EPSTEIN:	Susanna, what would15 the -- which I' ve termed, we call it the poor  tax.16 What kind of impact would it have on  Bronx17 residents whose rents are below $ 1 , 000 ?	What kind18 of impact would that -- if we proposed -- if   we19 pass an increase for those -- a higher increase  for20 those tenants?21 MS. BLANKLEY:	So I think those22 tenants are -- so, you know, some folks  have23 already testified that the importance of  rent24 stabilization is about community stability.	It' s25 about people being able to raise their kids  and2 
 2 grandkids in one community.	And so when you tax3 folks who pay a lower rent and who have lived  there4 for quite a long time, you' re -- you' re taxing the5 folks who, for the most part, have some of  the6 lowest incomes.7 And like I said before, that  means8 that they might not be able to stay in  their9 apartments.	So in one of the highest -- in one  of10 the neighborhood -- in the neighborhood with one  of11 the highest concentrations of rent stabilization,12 it' s also the neighborhood that is in the poorest13 Congressional District in the country.	And that' s14 who you' re talking about.	You can' t hear from them15 today because you didn' t create the space for them16 to come and talk to you.	But that' s who we' re17 talking about.18 MR. EPSTEIN:	And another question19 is, you said 83 percent of the area you organize in 20	--21 MS. BLANKLEY:	Yeah.22 MR. EPSTEIN:	-- are rent23 regulated units, rent stabilized units.	What' s the24 landlord population?	What type of landlords are25 owning this properties?	Like can you explain some21 
2 of the landlords you deal with?3 MS. BLANKLEY:	Sure.	I would4 love to work with small  landlords.5 MR. EPSTEIN:	Um- hum.6 MS. BLANKLEY:	I don' t know you.7 We do work with some very good non- profit8 landlords.	But for the most part, we' re talking9 about landlords who have investment firms,10 transnational, global investors.	We' re talking11 about predatory equity landlords.	Most of the12 buildings that we work in are larger than 40  units.13 I work in a lot of buildings that have over   20014 units.	And landlords who own 50 , 60 , 70 , 8015 buildings, just in the west Bronx.	I mentioned16 Chestnut Holdings, they own 70 buildings just  in17 the west Bronx.18 ( Audience participation.)19 MS. BLANKLEY:	We' re not talking20 -- so for the most part, there are landlords  who21 are very sophisticated and landlords who have a  lot22 of resources.	Landlords who are not the kind  of,23 at least from what I' ve heard, not the kind of24 testimonies we' ve heard today.25 And landlords who are actively2 
2 trying to get tenants out.	Right.	So landlords3 who are aggressively using a myriad of tactics,  not4 just lack of repairs but taking them to court  for5 no reason, calling the police at  tenants'6 association meetings -- I' ll say Chestnut Holdings7 again.	Actually, staging protests against tenants8 for taking action for basic things like heat  and9 hot water.10 So folks feel really intimidated11 and harassed to move out.	And we know that we  have12 a turnover rate in a lot of these buildings  of13 about 20 percent because their tactics  are14 successful.15 MR. EPSTEIN:	And can you just16 tell us the type of population of the  tenants17 you' re dealing with?	Are they recent immigrants?18 Is English their first language?	Some details19 about them.20 MS. BLANKLEY:	Yeah, I think,21 over half of the residents in Community Board 4   are22 foreign born.	So 95 percent are African  American23 or Hispanic.	We have a growing West  African24 population.	So almost all of our membership  are25 low income, working class folks who are  immigrants2 
2 but also African Americans and Hispanics.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Brian.4 MR. CHEIGH:	Susanna, some of5 what you' re describing has been happening for years6 in Brooklyn and Queens --7 MS. BLANKLEY:	Uh- huh.8 MR. CHEIGH:	-- and definitely9 core Manhattan.	Is this a some new phenomenon  in10 the Bronx where there' s a lot more pressures on  the11 tenant population for increasing rents, aggressive12 tactics by building owners?13 MR. BLANKLEY:	So I' ve been at14 CASA for three years.	And I know we talk about  a15 kind of new stage of predatory landlords  that16 happened around the housing boom, but I think --  I17 think the pressure is increasing for  sure.18 I mean, I think what we see in  the19 South Bronx is people moving up from  Washington20 Heights who were priced out.	And so people are21 getting priced out of Manhattan and -- and  moving22 into the South Bronx.	Because while the -- the23 rents in the Bronx are the lowest citywide, it' s24 always the most unaffordable borough because  of25 what people make.2 
2 And so while folks are moving  in3 who might be able to pay more, I think,  landlords4 are getting ready for who might be able to come  in5 five or ten years.6 So, I think, we see a  increased7 pressure.	We see a -- certainly, an  increased8 presence of large, multi- national corporations9 taking over large swaths of buildings.	So where10 CASA used to organize against small  local11 landlords, we' re now organizing against landlords12 whose offices are in other countries, for  example.13 Yeah.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Rosalina Larso.17 ( Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	No, I was19 calling the next.20 MS. LARSO:	Hi.	I' m a small21 property owner in Queens, New York.	And I lived in22 my 85 - year old, six- family building for over 5023 years.	And my tenants are mostly working  class24 families.	And I do not charge them very  high25 rents.2 
2 My biggest problem is the age  of3 the building.	Each year I find myself  spending4 more time and more money on repairs and  maintenance5 than the previous year.6 The City- owned tree in front of my7 building is also aging and each year its trunk  and8 roots get bigger and bigger.	I replaced the9 expensive sidewalk several years ago because  of10 cracks and uplifting of the cement flags caused  by11 the large roots, which create a trip  hazard.12 Again, the sidewalk is cracked.13 And the growing roots -- by the  growing roots.	And14 the City- owned metal curb next to the tree is15 cracked and sticking upwards.	An accident and City16 lawsuit is waiting to happen.17 Now I called the city  several18 time.	I reported the problem and I also called  my19 Councilman, Jimmy van Duren -- Buren.	And, who in20 turn, reported it to the City.	But so far no21 response.	And this is almost a year  ago.22 Anyway, the Price Index of23 Operating Costs does not include sidewalk repair  in24 their calculation.	Last summer I got an25 exterminator for bed bugs.	I was shocked.	It was2 
2 $ 500 per bedroom for initial service and one follow3 up.	For a small owner with a limited number   of4 bedrooms, it can really be tough.	Small owners5 don' t have enough bedrooms to negotiate better6 service prices like the large apartment  owners.7 I haven' t heard of any cost8 controls or cost containments on owner  services9 such as plumbers, electricians, exterminators,10 contracts, nor on materials or supplies.	And, of11 course not.	This is a free market society.	But12 not for the small owner.	He faces unpredictable13 cost increases year after year and must swallow  the14 costs that are not included in the  PIOC.15 Therefore, I urge the members  of16 the Guideline Board to let us have increases  more17 in line with our actual costs and a larger  increase18 for buildings that heat with  oil.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I' m going to20 ask you to start to wrap  up.21 MS. LARSO:	Yeah, this is it.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.23 Oh, no.	I' m sorry.24 MS. LARSO:	That' s it.25 Thank you.2

2 $ 500 per bedroom.	You know, but I know that in  big3 buildings they negotiate because they have  more4 bedrooms.5 MR. EPSTEIN:	Thank you.6 MS.

ENRIQUES- CARRE:	Good16 afternoon to the members of the  board.17 My name is Luis Enriques.	I' m a18 staff attorney at the SRO Law project.	Our office19 assists tenants in the west side of Manhattan  that20 live in SRO buildings through attorneys  and21 organizers.22 And I' m here today to talk to you,23 specifically, on the issue of the proviso that  is24 being contemplated by the board in the Hotel  Order.25 As the board has contemplated in2 
2 the past, it has issued a Rent Guidelines  increase3 but then say -- a proviso that says that if   the4 building is not rented at that 85 percent level  to5 rent stabilized tenants, then the -- the  owner6 cannot take the increase.7 Now in terms of the intent  of8 behind this proviso -- I understand the intent  of9 this board to be -- that the board wants to   benefit10 those landlords, those SRO landlords, that  are11 actually renting out to tenants, most of its  units12 and not benefit those landlords that  are13 warehousing most of those units.14 Now this intent can only come  to15 fruition if the proviso operates as a simple  tool16 that the landlord can read and determine  whether17 the landlord, in fact, meets it  or not.	And if the18 landlord does not meet it, then the landlord  does19 not take the increase and vice  versa.20 This intent is frustrated, on  the21 other hand, if the landlord sees that an  increase22 has been approved.	Takes the increase.	And then23 the tenant is left with filing  overcharge24 complaints with the DHCR.	And then the tenant25 enters the agency and the judiciary machinery  and2 
2 that can take years to get resolved, all the  while3 the tenant is paying the overcharge  increase.4 As an example, throughout my  three5 years at the Law Project, I have been working on   a6 series of overcharges in this building in  midtown,7 based on the 2008 Rent Guidelines Board  increase8 that was a 4 . 5 percent increase and it included the9 proviso that said that 85 percent of the units  must10 be rented out to rent stabilized  tenants.11 Tenants filed the DHCR complaint12 in 2010 .	We prevailed with the DHCR.	We prevailed13 -- the proceedings are now on Article 78 in  Supreme14 Court.15 In the best case scenario that  the16 Supreme Court upholds the overcharge, the  tenants17 will get the relief that they deserve five  years18 after the Rent Guidelines Board approved  the19 proviso back in 2008 , six years after the Rent20 Guidelines Board approved the proviso or  seven21 years, depending on how much it  takes.22 So this really is justice delayed.23 So how do you address that?	Well, you' d believe24 that the proviso should be zero.	You approve --25 the rent increase should be zero.	You approve as2 
2 zero without a proviso.3 If you are actually contemplating4 a proviso, then I do believe that -- and  I5 understand that the Rent Guidelines Board may  not6 have anything to do with what -- what happens  at7 the agency level or with what happens in  court.8 But I do believe that the Rent Guidelines Board  has9 something to do with the way it drafts  this10 proviso.	And, especially, the way it drafts  its11 explanatory statement.12 Now I believe that the  explanatory13 statement that was in place in 2008 was the  same14 that was drafted for the first time, I believe,  in15 2005 .	And I believe that that  explanatory16 statement is very clear.	It contains examples.	It17 explains how the calculation of the proviso has  to18 work.19 But I believe it can do more  in20 terms of explaining the intent behind the  proviso.21 That intent being that this is supposed to  benefit22 only SRO landlords that are renting most of  their23 units.24 One argument that I have  seen25 landlords advance in the agency and in court,  is2 
2 that when you look at the proviso, when you look  at3 the 85 percent, you need to determine whether  854 percent of the units are subject to  rent5 regulation, regardless of whether these units  are6 actually rented out to tenants or  not.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I' m going to8 have to ask you to wrap  up.9 MR. ENRIQUES- CARRE:	Thank you.10 And this is an argument I  believe11 the board can see that would entirely frustrate  the12 intent of the proviso.	And to be sure this13 argument has not advanced in the DHCR and in the   --14 but it is still open  ended.15 And, again, in the best  case16 scenario, in these cases I' m describing, the17 tenants have been paying the overcharge for  five18 years, for six years, before they can even get  a19 ruling in their favor.20 So I think this board has  to21 actually see what is happening in this  DHCR22 proceeding as part of their investigation.	See23 what is happening in court cases where the  language24 of the proviso is at issue because the board  does25 have the power to explore whether its intent  is2 
 2 actually coming to reality or  not.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Well, let me4 ask you this, if you think that proviso  language5 should be simplified, why don' t you send us a6 draft?7 MR. ENRIQUES- CARRE:	Excuse me?8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	If you believe9 that the proviso language should be simplified,  why10 don' t you send us a draft.11 MR. ENRIQUES- CARRE:	I believe12 so.	And I didn' t have an opportunity to write  a13 written testimony, which I will  --14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.15 MR. ENRIQUES- CARRE:	-- and I16 will also include some suggestions as to the intent 17	--18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I would welcome19 seeing it.20 MR. ENRIQUES- CARRE:	-- because21 as I was working these cases, I wanted to see   that22 clear expression of intent in the  explanatory23 statement.	And I did not see it.	And I believe it24 could be drafted in a much clearer  way.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Send it to us18 
2 and we' ll take a look at it.3 MR. ENRIQUES- CARRE:	Thank you.4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.5 ( Applause.)6 MS. CRUZ:	I have one question.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz.8 Luis.	Question.9 MS. CRUZ:	In your rent overcharge10 proceeding, I think you forgot to mention  three11 very important aspects of the remedy that  your12 client is going to get; treble damages,  interest13 plus attorney' s fees.14 Yes, it' s true, it might take a15 while for that to be adjudicated but if you have   a16 proven case of overcharge, the law provides  for17 treble damages, interest on the overcharge as  well18 as attorney' s fees.19 MR. ENRIQUES- CARRE:	That is20 true.	But like I said, justice delayed does  not21 always materialize into justice.22 The tenants have already been23 paying the overcharge rent for five years now  and24 counting.	It' s a matter of the courts to decide25 whether they determine that toward the DHCR,  will2 
2 in its day, be upheld or  not.3 But this board is not powerless  in4 this area.	It can do more in revising the  letter5 of the proviso and in revising the  explanatory6 statements so that it is clearer for a  landlord7 reading the proviso and reading the -- the --  how8 it should work, ideally, is that a landlord  should9 be able to determine easily whether the landlord  is10 entitled to the increase or not, without  the11 situation leading into the agency without  the12 situation leading into years long litigation.13 Thank you.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Michelle White.17 MS. WHITE:	Good afternoon.18 My name is Michelle White.	You19 have to excuse me.	I' m a little nervous.	This is20 my first public speaking.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	That' s okay.22 MS. WHITE:	Okay.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I' ll just ask24 you to move a little closer to the mic or move   the25 mic.2 
2 MS. WHITE:	Okay.	I live at 1383 Thomas S. Boylan Street, also previously known  as4 Happington Avenue in Brooklyn, New York.	And my5 landlord is 138 Happington Associates on  Fieldstone6 Road in the Bronx, New  York.7 I moved into the apartment in  June8 of 1988 with my boyfriend at that time and  the9 building was owned by the City.	A lease was10 offered in 1992 and we pay rent in both of   our11 names but we were told that only one name could   go12 on the lease because we weren' t married.13 The current -- the owner that14 bought the building in 1992 then sold the  building15 to the current owner in  1998 .	When the new owners16 took over the building, they started not  renewing17 the lease.	They stopped registering the apartment18 with DHCR.	They also -- I' m sorry --19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Take -- take20 your time.21 MS. WHITE:	They stopped22 registering their apartment with DHCR and  they23 stopped renewing the lease.24 When I spoke to other  tenants,25 they were like starting to do the same thing,  not2 
2 renewing their leases.	One of the tenants, they3 gave her rent of -- increases of $ 500 and said  that4 in three months time, she would begin to  pay5 $ 1 , 500 .	She was a elderly lady and she didn' t  read6 the fine print.	So when she went to court, she  was7 evicted because for six months she didn' t realize8 that she was supposed to pay $ 1 , 000 more.9 The landlord liked to harass the10 tenants and speaking for myself, the super,  he11 moved into apartment 11 A and he put the number 1 A12 on his door.	So my apartment is 1 A.	People ring13 the bell all the time for him and I asked him   to14 correct it and he just laughed and told me  that15 someone still stole the other number off the  door.16 They moved a tenant that was  a17 problem tenant in the apartment above me.	He plays18 loud music.	The super was living over me.	He19 started running water over on me when the  landlord20 fired him.	He poured cement down the pipes so  in21 the summer time -- in the winter there was no   heat22 because all the pipes were filled up with  cement.23 The landlord takes me to court  and24 says the rent is not being paid and the judge  asks25 me to write the landlord a personal check for  the2 
2 rent.	When I pay the personal check with the  rent,3 then the landlord cashed all the money orders  that4 they say they never received.	Receiving double5 rent and then they drop the  case.6 So now currently, they are saying7 that I' m -- they haven' t given a lease renewal8 since the year of 2004 and their scheduling to  take9 me to trial on July the 10 th, still saying that10 they don' t know me and that I' m not their tenant11 when I have all my receipts where they' ve been12 accepting rent from me all of the  years.13 That' s it.	I have like more to14 say but it' s just too much.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	How -- how many16 units are in your building?17 MS. WHITE:	It' s 41 units in the18 building.	And I think now there' s probably only19 seven that are left that are rent  stabilized20 because of the one tenant, like I said, they  kept21 taking her to court and she kept  taking off.	She22 worked EMS.	She had to keep taking off from  work23 she was going to lose  her job.	So she moved out.24 And then the other tenant that  I25 said, the elderly lady that they raised her rent  to2 
2 $ 500 for three months and then they wrote in  small3 print that she was supposed to pay $ 1 , 500 when4 January came and she didn' t realize that.	So she5 was evicted for not being able to pay the  extra6 because the judge told her, even though it was  a7 rent stabilized apartment, shed signed that  she8 would pay $ 1 , 000 .9 So I don' t know, they' re just10 constantly, like I said, taking me to court  over11 and over.	I' ve been going to court with them since12 the year 2005 and I' ve had like one of the  judges,13 you know, the cases keep getting dismissed.	One of14 the judges passed away.	One of my attorneys passed15 away and, you know, we' re still going to court and16 going to court.	Every time they stop one  thing,17 they just start something else.18 That' s all I have to say.19 MR. EPSTEIN:	I actually just want20 to thank you for coming here and testifying and  you21 talking about your struggle.22 Yours is a struggle of  thousands23 of tenants just like you.

I' m going to take19 those other seconds, if you don' t mind.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Go right ahead.21 MR. TOLLIVER:	All right.	My22 landlord -- my name is  Scott Tolliver.	I live at23 314 West 138 th Street.24 My landlord is in the process  of25 trying to get rid of me.	Evidently, I' ve lived too2 
2 long.	I thought living a long time was a   blessing3 but after hearing some of the testimony here,  we4 put people in very serious conditions by staying  in5 their houses too long.6 ( Laughter.)7 MR. TOLLIVER:	I never knew you8 were supposed to raise your kids, get them out  and9 die.	Nobody told me  this.10 I would like very seriously for11 you to look at our  family though.	Imagine, a12 family with an income of just $ 35 , 000 a year --13 throw a baby walking and a baby in  the oven.	Do14 you know how much medical conditions will  cost?15 Besides the increasing your rent,16 where is the money coming from?	How much of it can17 you justify saying, oh, we need this, we need  that.18 I was beginning to think that oh, it takes oh,   so19 much money to operate a building.	But it really20 depends on the size of your  building.21 How can you complain when you  got22 72 units and you say you not making any  money?23 Something is wrong with your management  skills.24 Evidently, everybody' s wasn' t meant to be a25 landlord.	Maybe you should try something  else.2 
2 ( Laughter.)3 MR. TOLLIVER:	Everybody gets up4 here and cry about what they don' t have.	You asked5 them for a increase from people that are poor  who6 really don' t have it.	You can' t have Brooks7 Brothers suit with some of the money that we  bring8 home to support our families.9 Medical conditions are off the10 roof.	It appears that you were paying $ 3 . 20 for11 now will cost you $ 5 . 60 .12 Transit is up.	Everything is up.13 Everybody' s drained.	When the economic level in14 this country is worse, somebody wants a  increase.15 Where' s it coming from?	Should we rob Peter to16 pay Paul?17 Is everybody that comes here is18 going to ask for more every year -- the same  thing?19 I need this.	I need that.	And why does everybody20 panic when they say, open your books?	Something in21 your books you don' t want to show?	Are you22 spending too much time in Las Vegas or  Atlantic23 City?	Are you putting too many dollars in  that24 little girl that' s coming down the pole and not25 enough into the house that you  own?2 
2 ( Laughter.)3 MR.

You9 can' t leave it all on the floor in Jersey.	You got10 to bring something back.	I don' t care how big your11 home is over in the --  New Jersey.	If you own12 property here in New York, you should do  something13 to maintain your property.	You shouldn' t just milk14 it and go about your business.15 You can' t come here every year and16 ask for more money and more money and then you   take17 it and throw it away.

PORCELLI:	I also am not used9 to speaking in public and I have to read  this.10 My husband has been on our  block11 for 40 years.	He watched the Bronx burn back12 during the ' 70 s oil shortage.13 We are in the fifth  Community14 Board district.	We built a new building.	We broke15 ground in 2007 .	Built in 2008 .	And got a TCO in16 January of 2009 .17 Our tenants come from rat- infested18 moldy- walled apartments.	We have a poured concrete19 sprinkler building, housing 99 percent minorities20 over 25 percent are Vets and over 80 percent  are21 Section 8 .22 Most of our tenants say, we' re the23 best landlord in New York City.	We worked way more24 than full time but the first penny we took out   of25 that building in salary for me was October 2012 .2 
2 That' s over five- and- a- half years and we did not3 take one penny from the building.	And anyone can4 look at my books.5 NYCHA had over $ 70 , 000 before we6 got a penny for the overlooked subsidy  payments.7 NYCHA had huge problems.	We needed the money.8 Properly submitted lease renewals did not  get9 processed on a timely basis.	And then we don' t get10 the increase.11 Recently, it took three months for12 NYCHA to inspect an apartment.	I called over 2013 times and I wrote three letters and finally  after14 three months and three apartments got inspected  the15 same day.	But I was five months without rent  on16 one -- one apartment.17 Exterminators for bed bugs.	They18 cost us close to $ 2 , 000 when somebody brings in bed19 bugs.	Our tenants like to pick up things on  the20 streets.	And it' s not that they cost has gone up,21 it' s the frequency.	It' s expensive.22 The most important item on  the23 agenda today, as I see it, is the low rent   minimum24 increase.	And, you know, for $ 1 , 000 a 2 percent25 increase is only $ 20 .	No one wants to have --  no2 
2 landlord wants his assets to decay before his  eyes.3 But if the rent increases are not enough to  cover4 the expenses, then the building  suffers.5 In our neighborhood, New York City6 has to come to the buildings to do  extermination7 and repairs.

A minimum rent increase is10 essential to prevent the housing stock of New  York11 City from decaying.12 Please give a decent minimum  rent13 increase for the future of New York City  housing.14 No one wants to live in a  slum.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.16 Appreciate you coming in.17 ( Applause.)18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Can I ask you,19 how big is your building?20 MS.

We couldn' t24 have built it without the 421 A and it took us  a25 year- and- a- half afterwards because there were some2

It' s stabilized so11 they go up and down.12 MR. EPSTEIN:	You said it' s13 Section 8 ; all right.14 MS. PORCELLI:	What?15 MR. EPSTEIN:	You said 80 percent16 is Section 8 ?17 MS.

You got 99 units.

You pretend that6 for you, times are so tough.	But then again, I7 guess only a couple of yachts can make ones life   a8 bit rough.	The nerve.	You' re like the trickle9 down of Wall Street' s inside job.	Like them10 seeking to us the poor  to rob.	I grant you as the11 street called Wall did so fall, but on us poor,   not12 you' all.	You landlords, the rent fields of  those13 master vampires.	The Wall Street vampire who seeks14 to fire, ceases to hire while their greed  climbs15 even higher and the situation grows ever more  dire.16 As you, rent fields too, seek and continue to  seek17 to see us in the  street.18 As we struggle, nevertheless,19 strong here in your mess, refusing and  battling20 your daunted quest to see  us homeless.

MC LAUGHLIN:	Kwesi Cameron.16 I' m sorry about that.17 MS. CAMERON:	Good afternoon.	My18 name is Kwesi Cameron.	And I' m a long- term tenant19 of two SRO buildings on West 95 th Street that are20 now being used by the Department of  Homeless21 Services, DHS.22 Previously the building had also23 been an illegal hotel for out- of- town tourists.24 When the illegal hotel operation was shut down  two25 years ago -- after two years, for the first time  in2 
2 over ten years, the building went through  an3 extensive renovation on its exterior as well as  the4 interior hallways; new floors, doors, paint,  an5 elevator installation, all in preparation  for6 approval by DHS.7 This fact was unknown by  the8 permanent residents until last August when we  were9 told at a meeting called by the building  management10 and DHS, the same day that the DHS clients  were11 moved in.12 There are 192 units in  my13 building.	Forty permanent tenants remain in the14 building.	The remaining, approximately, 152 units15 are occupied by clients of the Department  of16 Homeless Services.	There are two DHS clients per17 unit, adult families, we were told.	And the18 building' s management is paid $ 3 , 360 per unit, per19 month or $ 112 per day by DHS.20 This is roughly over $ 6 million21 per year.	Also, the DHS clients were supposed  to22 be housed under temporary contracts.	Many of the23 DHS clients have been in my building since  they24 moved in last August.25 As I mentioned previously, there' s2 
2 also another building down the street, run by  the3 same owner, with approximately 20 permanent4 tenants, less than my building.	And it' s also now5 run as a DHS shelter.6 This landlord also owns several7 buildings in New York City.	For these reasons, I8 don' t believe a rent increase should be granted.9 Thank you for your time.10 ( Applause.)11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.12 Allesandra Moll -- Moll.13 MS.

I came in from Long Island  City,21 Queens.22 And my question is, why  should23 people keep buying properties with no intention  of24 keeping the properties up?	This should not25 continue.	Housing stock in New York City  is2 

2	falling apart.3
I have been in litigation with  the
4 State for five -- over five years now,  getting5 nowhere.	They' ve closed my case again even though6 the work is not done.	And they have upped my  rent.7 So I am paying full rent even though everything  I8 have is in boxes.	I can' t have people over.9 I can' t travel because I never10 know when the case is going to be reopened, if  it' s11 going to be reopened.	I can' t have any pets12 because who would bring them into a place  where13 they might be sanding floors, making the  repairs14 that they' re supposed to make.15 I am not paying under $ 1 , 000 . I16 am paying over $ 1 , 000 .	There are seven apartments17 in the building.	There is one store.	The building18 is a very charming building.	It' s falling apart.19 Several of us are in litigation -- the tenant  above20 me, over 15 years.21 Clearly, there' s a problem.	And22 so a lot of people in this room are in the   middle23 somehow, whether they own properties or  whether24 they' re renters, the system is just not working.25 Should the landlords be getting4 
2 increases when they have a track record of  not3 keeping up their buildings?	And should they be4 allowed to keep buying?	People used to take a  good5 look at a building before  they bought.	They would6 assess the building and they knew if they had  the7 money to keep a building up or not and they   would8 not buy just for the sake of buying and  just9 sucking the rents out of the  building.10 Our super doesn' t live in the11 building.	He lives next door.	So even that rent12 is collected by the landlord.13 We have crack heads that clean  the14 hallways when they get cleaned.	So that' s not even15 an expense.	We don' t have the proper hot water.16 We have a lot of things that are just not   available17 to us.	And we live in a constant state of  having18 to look the other way  or fight.	And that is not19 home to go to after  work.20 And someone made a comment  before21 about an unemployment. Unemployment hasn' t gone up22 in a very long time, by  the way.	And it -- the23 maximum it pays in New York City is $ 405 a  week.24 So, you know, as the rents keep going up, I  don' t25 know how people are going to make  it.2 
2 I' m not asking for charity.	I' m3 asking for fairness here.	I should not be  paying4 the rent that I' m paying when I' ve been in5 litigation for over five years and I have  problems6 all the time.7 Our stairs are broken.	We' ve had8 rungs of the fire escape that  were missing.	I9 applaud landlords who do the  right thing.	But a10 lot of landlords are not doing the right  thing.11 Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 ( Applause.)14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Tatyana Segal.15 MS. SEGAL:	Good afternoon.16 Good afternoon, members of the17 Rent Guidelines Board.18 My name is Tatyana Segal.	I am a19 tenant in rent stabilized building, residing  in20 flood zone A in South Brooklyn, in the area  that21 was heavily impacted by the Hurricane Sandy  just22 awhile ago.23 The board should waive the24 proposed rent increases and find them excessive  and25 unprecedented.2 
2 First, considering the physical3 and economic hardship experienced by tenants in  --4 living in zone A, in the aftermath of  Hurricane5 Sandy, it' s truly unconscionable of the New York6 City Board to raise rent -- to raise rent  rates7 pursuant to the proposal.8 Second, I' ve examined past9 proposals for the prior -- for the past ten  years.10 And the current proposal to raise rent hikes up  to11 9 . 5 percent on two- year leases is truly12 unprecedented.	It hasn' t been done before.13 Moreover, the proposal' s reliance14 on the economic data is misguided because the  data15 is old.	The data was collected in 2011 prior  to16 Hurricane Sandy and thus it can' t be relied upon.17 Furthermore, there are procedural18 issues with the proposal.	I mean, with the way  the19 board is scheduling the meetings.	In the past20 there were two public meetings scheduled.	This21 year there' s only one public hearing for the22 tenants and the landlords to  speak.23 I would like to talk more  about24 the impact of Hurricane Sandy in the area where  I25 live.	As I said, as a tenant residing in zone   A,2 
2 which was heavily impacted by Hurricane Sandy,  I3 strongly believe that the it' s unfair to increase4 rent in this area which was heavily impacted  --5 damaged by Sandy in fall 2012 .6 In November of 2012 , hard- hit7 victims of Sandy, renters and  homeowners8 experienced major outages in electricity, gas,9 water and other utilities.	In areas like -- such10 as Brighton Beach, Sheepshead Bay, Manhattan  Beach,11 Coney Island, Gerritsen Beach, Seagate areas,  many12 residents had to relocate and pay the  location13 expenses in fall of 2012 .14 Many renters residing in New York15 City could not earn any income in the aftermath  of16 Sandy.	They had to rely on unemployment  benefits.17 They -- they were standing -- they were  getting18 from -- packages from American Red Cross.	They19 were getting diapers.	They were getting blankets20 from American Red Cross.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Segal, I' m22 going to ask you if you could wrap  up.23 MS. SEGAL:	Yes, sure.24 So in conclusion, I would like  to25 say that, I believe the rent hikes are  unfair.2 
2 They' re unprecedented.	Looking at the past history3 of -- of the ten- year history of the prior4 proposals, there was no -- there was no  precedent5 before to increase rent up to 9 . 5 percent.6 And I believe the board  should7 waive or, at least, lower the  rates.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.9 MS. SEGAL:	Thanks.10 ( Applause.)11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	The next speaker12 is New York City Controller, John  Liu.13 Welcome, sir.14 You don' t have to run.	We' ll be15 here all day.16 MR. LIU:	Well, thank you very17 much.18 Good afternoon.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Good afternoon.20 MR. LIU:	I know you' ve had a21 relatively long day; right?	Okay.22 Well, I won' t be too -- I won' t23 belabor the point too much.24 I just want to thank you  for25 giving me this opportunity to present some of  my2 
2 thoughts about this issue that affects us  every3 year.4 As the Rent Guidelines Board,5 which you are all, considers the " appropriate"6 range for this year' s rent hikes, I certainly urge7 the board instead to impose a one- year moratorium8 on rent increases for rent stabilized  apartments.9 We ask, is any rent  increase10 appropriate in the face of the tough economic  times11 our City' s rental tenants are still experiencing?12 New York City' s unemployment rate13 is stuck at 8 . 4 percent.	That is made worse14 because of the loss of rent regulated  apartments;15 62 , 266 of which have disappeared in the past ten16 years.	Almost 69 percent of the City' s 3 million17 plus households are renters.	And those renters are18 facing insurmountable odds.	Even middle income New19 Yorkers are in jeopardy.20 A 2012 report by my  office21 entitled, " Rents Through the Roof," showed the22 number of people paying what the U. S. Department of23 Housing and Urban Development considers a  severe24 burden, 30 percent of income, has  risen25 drastically.	Almost half of New Yorkers pay  that,2 
2 up from 41 percent in  2000 .	And 30 percent of New3 Yorkers spend more than 50 percent of their  income4 on rent, according to our  report.5 Meanwhile, the City' s median6 income house -- median household income, $ 50 , 886 ,7 has hardly risen at all since 2000 when it was   at8 $ 50 , 539 .	But the City' s median rent rose quite a9 bit to $ 1 , 004 from $ 853 back in 2001 -- I' m sorry,10 back in 2000 .11 All told, 38 percent of the City' s12 existing rental units are unaffordable to  middle13 income New Yorkers, up sharply from 23 percent  in14 2000 .	The statistics are even worse for New  York15 City' s senior citizens.16 Another report by my office17 called, " Senior Housing Becoming Crisis," found18 that more than half of households headed by  those19 ages 60 to 69 and fully two- thirds of those  headed20 by seniors over 70 , pay what the federal government21 considers unaffordable rents.22 We have a big problem  here.23 Almost 20 percent of our 60 plus population  lives24 below the poverty line, compared to a 9   percent25 nationally.	And evictions of seniors account for2 
2 15 percent of all evictions in New York  City.3 Adding insult to injury,4 sequestration has resulted in cuts to the  agencies5 that administer more than 150 , 000 Section 86 vouchers.	As many as 6 , 000 new vouchers that had7 been planned for this year, will not be  issued.8 And families already in the system, face cuts  in9 their subsidies.10 Affordable housing is one of  the11 key drivers of our City' s economic development.	In12 order to fuel the City' s economic recovery, we must13 not only increase our affordable housing stock,  but14 we' ve got to maintain our existing stock.15 More than a million New  Yorkers16 rely on rent regulated apartments to be able  to17 live in the City.	Many are public employees we18 depend upon to keep our City safe; our  fire19 fighters, our police officers and teachers.	We20 cannot continue to permit working families to  be21 priced out of our City.22 And, therefore, I -- once again,  I23 urge the board to institute a one- year moratorium24 on rent hikes, allowing more of our fellow  New25 Yorkers the chance to keep a roof over their  heads2 
2 and to earn their livelihoods right here in  the3 City that we all love.4 Thank you so much.5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.6 MR.

ALVAREZ:	Distinguished panel10 members, good afternoon.	Distinguished panel11 members of the Rent Guidelines Board, my name  is12 Leno P. M. Alvarez and I' m a long- time resident of13 the upper west side.14 I have an SRO tenancy going  back15 to the ' 80 s, a statutory tenancy and I am here to16 testify against a rent increase for SRO  tenants17 this year.18 I live in a smaller brownstone  on19 West 68 th Street.	Before the current landlord20 bought the building in 2002 , we were 100 percent21 rent stabilized and there were 13 units.	Eight out22 of the 13 were single- room occupancy so it was one23 out of eight.	The other five were regular24 apartments.25 Today there are only 11 units,  of2 
2 which 7 are market rate, meaning luxury housing  and3 4 still rent stabilized; two regular apartments  and4 two single- room occupancy units, of which is5 warehoused.6 My landlord cannot possibly need a7 rent increase when the revenue generated by  this8 small brownstone has gone up from  approximately9 $ 5 , 400 a month in 2002 to approximately $ 20 , 000 a10 month today.	That is an increase of close to  40011 percent every 30 days.12 As the last SRO tenant there,  my13 mother and I have been the victim of  rent14 overcharges, frivolous lawsuits, all sorts  of15 harassment, delays or outright denial of  repairs16 and maintenance, no super -- I mean there' s a  super17 but he was off site and service cutbacks of  all18 kinds.19 Please do not reward over the  top20 greed with more greed, especially in view of  the21 hard economic times we' re living in and of the  fact22 that my landlord gets a tax break for owning an   SRO23 building with only one SRO  tenant left.	So I used24 to be one out of eight.	Now there' s just me.	Last25 of the Mohicans.2 
2 Yet changes to the tenancy makeup3 of the building have boosted his top line to  4004 percent already of what it used  to be.

2 My name is Mariel Delacruz.3 I' ve lived in a rent stabilized4 apartment for the past 19 years in the  beautiful5 neighborhood of Washington Heights.	And I wouldn' t6 have it any other way.7 Now that I' ve grown up, have8 graduated from Fordham University, I have come  to9 the realization that I want to stay in  my10 neighborhood, my building, my block, my  apartment11 long term.	And I know, as we heard before,  people12 don' t like that.	But this is my home so I  wanted13 to make sure there for a long  time.14 So many of us, who attend  Jesuit15 institutions, find themselves doing work that  they16 love, assisting others.	And I have been blessed17 enough to find a job in the non- profit sector.	But18 the increases, especially those proposed this  year,19 worry me for me being able to stay in my   apartment20 for as long as I want to stay  there.21 As you all know, rent increases22 for tenants are not the only ways for owners  to23 make profits.	There has been significant turnover24 in just some of the apartments in my  building,25 allowing for owners to renovate and get high  rent2 
2 increases as a result of  that.3 So like I said, only a few out  of4 the many apartments but those are usually  renovated5 and made really pretty and really well, while  we6 suffer from not getting repairs after asking  for7 months and months and every for years to have  them8 done.9 So -- and even though most of  us10 tenants, the low and moderate income people  are11 struggling to make ends meet, owners on an  average12 are making major profits for each rent  stabilized13 unit that they own.	So what I' m saying is that14 tenants are really carrying the burden for  owners15 who are and will continue to make profits for  each16 unit.17 This is which -- I believe  there18 should be no increases this year because  tenants19 are being priced out of  their homes.	So a lot of20 the landlords or some of them, were shouting,  just21 move.	If some people don' t want to move, like me22 because it' s my neighborhood, it' s not just my23 apartment.	I live in the neighborhood and that' s24 who I am and that' s who I want to continue to  be.25 And others -- like me, as well, cannot afford  to2 
2 move anywhere else even if we wanted  to.3 So I ask when you' re making your4 decision, you think of recent college grads  like5 me, we did what we were supposed to do and  we' re6 still struggling to make ends meet.	Even though we7 do have full- time positions, which makes it harder8 for people to say that we' re not doing what we' re9 doing or we' re not working or whatever the rhetoric10 may be that I' ve heard a lot for people that  live11 in Washington Heights.12 I' m asking you to consider some of13 my neighbors and family members, who my mom is  also14 disabled and, you know, the owners would like  the15 luxury of having rent increases every year or  every16 two years, our wages don' t have that privilege.17 And it would be nice if people -- if we did   and18 when our rents went up.19 And so I would ask you to  consider20 those people.	Consider me.	And please think of us21 instead of just thinking of those people who have  a22 lot more money and choose to be in this form   of23 business.

Robert Atterbury.MR. ATTERBURY:	Hi.	Thank youHi.	Thank you all for  having me. My name' s Robert Atterbury.	I' m
7 here testifying on behalf of State Senator  Brad8 Hoylman.	He wishes he could be here  himself.9 Unfortunately, he is currently on a train back  from10 Albany.11 I want to first thank you all  for12 your great work today.	I' ve been here -- I was13 here earlier and you have been here  all day.	And14 we all appreciate that, the effort and energy  you15 take take to hear from  everyone.16 State Senator Brad Hoylman17 represents much of the west side and parts of  the18 east -- east side and the central part  of19 Manhattan.20 We -- the district covers,  Stuy21 Town, Peter Cooper Village, London Tower --  London22 Terrace Gardens, Westbeth and Phipps Plaza  and23 which are just some of the notable and iconic  rent24 regulated buildings in our district.25 Given the continuing toll the7 
2 recent economic recession has taken on average  New3 Yorkers and the steady rent increases, the RGB  has4 annually approved, and the Senator is dismayed  that5 the RGB is considering rent increases this  year,6 pretty much at all.7 The statistics show that the8 median income of rent controlled households  was9 only $ 29 , 000 in 2010 .	And the median income in10 rent stabilized units was only $ 37 , 000 .	Moreover,11 the housing costs constitute percentages of  these12 tenant incomes.13 The own -- your own Income  and14 Affordabilty Study found that one- third of renter15 households in the City paid 50 percent or more  in16 gross rent which is, by definition,  unaffordable.17 And it' s one of the highest percentages in the18 history of the study as  well.19 The RGB has historically justified20 annual rent increases by setting the	of Operating21 Costs.	This year' s Price Index Costs found that22 well -- that the increase -- the index did  increase23 slightly.	However, this index only measures24 changes of the cost of items that  landlords25 typically buy and doesn' t actually contain2 
2 information about the rent collected.3 A more meaningful way of  measuring4 this would be the net operating income, which  you5 note is a surrogate measure  for profit.	This past6 year the NOI increased, I believe, by 5 . 6 percent.7 It' s the seventh consecutive year that this8 percentage measure of ratio of income to profit  has9 increased.10 The discrepancy just goes to the11 grade in which the system is skewed against  tenants12 and shows a fundamental anti- tenant bias.	Tenants13 have been forced to support a constant demand  for14 increased profit margins, including through the15 great recession when many other industries  saw16 their profit margins shrink.17 Year after year, your own18 statistics do not support the landlords  primary19 argument that increased rents are necessary to  meet20 increased operating costs.	And honest assessment21 of the real numbers show that, not only  can22 landlords afford and will still profit from  the23 rents remaining constant, but that most  rent24 regulated tenants cannot afford any rent  increases.25 Any improved rent increases would2 
2 only increase landlord profits and further  chip3 away at New York City' s housing affordable stock.4 We are still in a  housing5 emergency and we encourage you to freeze rents  this6 year.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 MR. ATTERBURY:	Thank you.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	If you would --10 if you have written testimony that you' d like to11 submit, we' ll take it over there.12 MR. ATTERBURY: Yeah.	I submitted13 ten copies earlier for everybody.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Oh, okay.15 Anthony Conti.16 Who will be followed by  Betsy17 Aidum.18 Who will be followed by  Marina19 Miloradovich.20 MR. CONTI:	Hi.	How are you?21 I' m a small property owner in22 Queens, near Brooklyn, Bushwick.	So I' m just here23 to complain about the people that are paying  very24 low rents, like below $ 1 , 000 .25 You know, the kind of people  you2 
2 have to do work to their apartments, like  one3 specific apartment, I had to spend like $ 750 for4 bed bugs that the tenant -- and she' s  continually5 calling HPD.	And HPD had to keep coming.	And then6 I had to caulk the  whole apartment.	I had to spend7 money -- and, you know, meanwhile this person' s8 paying $ 700 something dollars rent and I' m wasting9 money on her.	And she' s constantly complaining and10 calling.11 I mean, something has to be  done12 about people like this.	You cannot keep holding13 landlords responsible for all these bills.	I think14 half the tenants, they don' t have any idea what  the15 cost of construction actually is when you have  to16 hire somebody and he has to come there and he   has17 to do work and he has to sheet work work  or18 plumbing or, you know, which is a common  problem19 that us small property owners  have.20 I mean, my building' s only a21 six- family building.	And, you know, having to  buy22 and having to go through evictions with  drug23 dealers, dealing with the police.	I mean, there' s24 just so much that you could deal  with.25 I think that owners should  be2 
2 somewhat compensated.	And I think that3 occasionally you get these people who feel  like4 they' re the owners of the building and you got to5 deal with them.	And, you know, you don' t want to6 drag them to court because you know it' s going to7 be a long drawn out  situation.8 But I think that the rents  that9 are below $ 1 , 000 , I think they should get a10 considerable increase. I think that those people  --11 I mean, what do you do when you have five   people,12 like me, that live in an apartment that are  paying13 $ 800 a month. I mean, I imagine their water  bill14 alone is in excess of $ 100 , $ 150 a month, just15 those people.16 So if they' re paying $ 800 , minus17 what it costs for water, what it costs for  damage,18 what it costs occasionally when, you know,  they19 keep making complaints and the City comes  along20 and, you know, like one specific tenant who' s burnt21 their coffee pot -- burnt the counter and the  HPD22 guy says, okay, now you got to change the  whole23 kitchen.24 Well, wait a minute.	I didn' t do25 that.	They did it.	Why you holding me responsible2 
2 now to change the whole kitchen and  everything?3 That was tremendous cost, tremendous money --  a4 tremendous loss.5 I think for us, small  property6 owners, I think that we shouldn' t be exposed to,7 you know, we shouldn' t have to suffer those kind  of8 people.	I think the people that are paying  less9 than $ 1 , 000 , and I' m sure there' s many owners out10 there have people like that, I think their  increase11 should be considerable.12 I think -- you know, whenever  I13 have costs -- you know, I just recently had to do   a14 shower for my tenant.	I said, look, it costs15 $ 4 , 000 .	You' re only paying $ 1 , 200 rent.	Do you16 know how long it' s going to take for me to  make17 that money back?	And, you know, I mean,  some18 people they appreciate it.	Some people don' t they19 appreciate it.	But I think it' s too much of a20 burden.21 I think, Mr. Liu, what he  said22 about the rents that they should be a  moratorium.23 Yeah, maybe they should for people that pay  over24 $ 2 , 500 in rent.	Let them put a moratorium on  those25 rents, the people in the City that are paying  these2 

2	tremendous rents.3
But the people in the  outer
4 boroughs that, you know, we' re trying to pay our5 mortgage and trying to pay all these bills  and6 expenses.	The City' s now another partner.	I mean,7 how do we suffer all of  these problems?	I think8 people, they don' t realize what it' s like to be a9 landlord, what' s it' s like to go there and have to10 clean up after these people, the kind of  problems11 they cause.12 I think, you know, these  are13 things that they should consider, you know.	I14 mean, you know --15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Conti,16 please -- please start to wrap  up.17 MR. CONTI:	All right.	I think18 there' s an alternative for people that -- that want19 to save money, that they complain that the  rents20 are high.	Specifically, my tenants, they said,21 look, you know we' re not going to pay the increase,22 $ 100 .	Their rent was going from $ 1 , 250 to $ 1 , 350 .23 They moved close there in Bushwick.	They rent --24 they bought an apartment for $ 35 , 000 --25 condominium.	It costs them less than the  rent.4

9	long day and I thank you for not  yawning.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Could you move11 -- I' m sorry.	Could you move the mic.12 MS. BROWN- MILLER:	Closer.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yeah.	That' s14 perfect.15 MS. BROWN- MILLER:	Yeah.16 My name is Susan Brown- Miller.17 And I live at Jane Street in Manhattan, like on   top18 of the meat packing district, to give you a   good19 idea.20 I am 78 years old.	I' m the author21 of five books, some of which are still in  print.22 I' m an adjunct professor at Pace University.23 My income stream today is  Social24 Security, my adjunct salary and the  occasional25 royalty check and what I take out every year  from10 
 2 my rollover IRA, which as you know is taxable  and3 finite.4 All I want to do at my age is   to5 stay productive and to stay in the rent  stabilized6 apartment I' ve lived in for 35 years.7 I know my home is below  market8 rate but I think that' s because of the crazy9 spiraling real estate market, fueled more than  ever10 before by international investors.	When I moved in11 to my apartment, my rent was $ 750 .	It is now 12	$ 2 , 569 .13 When my rent exceeded my  monthly14 Social Security benefits, I went to SCRIE and  was15 told that my adjustable income with the teaching  I16 was doing put me $ 500 over their max.	That' s a17 curious choice given to a person, to quit  being18 productive and to quit teaching in order to  keep,19 you know, to get a low  rent.20 So I went another route.	Guess21 what?	I went to Craig' s List and took in  a22 roommate.	Actually, that was around the time  of23 9 / 11 , I know when I started taking in roommates or24 as it' s called -- I keep forgetting what it' s25 called, an unrelated occupant.	Yes, an unrelated13 
2 occupant.	And I' ve had about four of them over the3 years.	I have one now.4 And I' m very careful that the5 income of the unrelated occupant doesn' t -- and my6 income, doesn' t go over the so- called luxury7 decontrol limit. And I' m also very careful that the8 unrelated occupant pays the correct proportional9 share of the rent.	Actually, the person I have  now10 is paying less than the proportionate share of  the11 rent because with my rent so high, it' s very  hard12 to get a stable person who really wants to  live13 with somebody like me and doesn' t have his or  her14 own place, can' t afford it yet or whatever.15 So it' s a, you know, it' s a small16 group that I find on Craigs List but so far,   you17 know, I have found them -- some graduate  students,18 a young -- now a young woman who' s a  global19 representative of a hat company, you know,  global20 fashion designer, representative of a hat  company.21 I don' t know.22 But it' s taken a lot of adjustment23 for me.	I have a beautiful apartment.	It' s two24 bedrooms.	So I -- the second bedroom was what  I25 was using as my office for  my writing.	But now it2 
2 belongs to the unrelated occupant.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I am going to4 have to ask you to start to wrap  up.5 MS. BROWN- MILLER:	Yeah.	I am6 now caught, I' ve learned, in the two- year cycle of7 the high raises.	And I don' t know how this8 happened to me.	Because you seemed to seesaw back9 and forth every year and I get the high  raise.10 That' s why my rent has suddenly gone up so much  in11 recent years.12 I feel I represent an  aging13 population of single women, whose husbands  died,14 whose partners left, who go on and on or are   still,15 you know, in pretty good health --  still16 productive, still working and I get the  feeling,17 listening to mostly these small property  owners,18 that I should just move.19 Where should I move to?	I have20 been a City person all  my life.	Where should I21 move to?	I should move to another state.	Is that22 what you think I  should do?	Is that what they --23 they were heckling a lot over there during  the24 course of this long day.	And they were mostly25 saying, why don' t you move?	Why don' t you move?2 
2 Where do you expect me  to move?	How am I going to3 live out my final years?	I don' t know what my4 final years will be?5 I feel they' re coming close6 because I' ve had friends who' ve died.	I don' t know7 if I' ll get the Alzheimers.	I' ll get the stroke.8 I' ll be hit by a city bike.	But if I only knew  how9 many years I had left, I could relax a little,   you10 know.	But I can' t.	Instead, I can' t sleep at11 night because I don' t know what' s going to happen12 to me and I don' t know what kind of rent raise  you13 have in mind for me.14 Thank you very much.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.17 MS.

We are now down to  2013 percent.	We were 30 percent of a non- evict co- op.14 We were all rent stabilized tenants until  the15 building went co- op in the mid ' 80 s when there were16 no more good deals for buying a co- op, we  thought.17 MS.

MAC PHERSON:	I' m short.18 Okay.19 Hi.	My name is Bianca Mac Pherson.20 I' m here testifying on behalf of Assemblyman21 Gottfried.22 My name is Richard N.  Gottfried.23 I represent the 75 th Assembly District in24 Manhattan, which includes the neighborhoods of25 Chelsea, Hells Kitchen, Clinton, midtown, part  of2 
2 the upper west side and Murray  Hill.3 I regret that due to a  legislative4 session in Albany, I am unable to testify today  in5 person.6 These proposed increases for --7 are unjustified and will make life unduly  harder8 for rent paying New Yorkers.	I strongly oppose9 this year' s proposals and urge that the board10 reject them.11 In past years, the RGB  justified12 high permanent increases in rent by citing  unusual13 temporary price surges reflected in the	of14 Operating Costs.	The truth is that current rents15 are already well above landlord costs.16 Last year, the board approved a  217 percent or a $ 20 , whichever was greater, increase18 for one- year leases and 4 percent or $ 40 , whichever19 was greater, increases for two- year leases.	While20 those increases were lower than in year' s passed,21 no increase was justified last year and  tenants22 continue to struggle as a  result.23 Because previous increases were24 much larger than were warranted and the economy  in25 New York City is still recovering from  the2 
2 nationwide recession, the board should be  enacting3 a rent freeze this year or, at least, scaling  back4 at its proposed increases and bringing them down  to5 last year' s levels.6 While I oppose any increase,  I7 believe that the board should bar landlords who  do8 not maintain their buildings and those  who9 illegally remove rent stabilized apartments from10 the housing market from collecting increases.11 Landlords who have documented12 cases, such as illegal hotels, in which  they13 illegally remove rent stabilized apartments from14 the housing market, should not be allowed  to15 collect rent -- full rent increases.	Likewise,16 landlords who have extensive violations on  their17 buildings for lack of basic maintenance  or18 services, shouldn' t be able to collect full rent19 increases.20 And, again, while I oppose  any21 increase, I believe that the RGB should end  its22 recent practice of instituting a minimum  rent23 increase.24 Many of the most vulnerable25 families in New York City have been  unfairly2 
2 impacted by the minimum rent increase enacted  in3 previous years.	More than half of the households4 of -- sorry.	More than half of the  households5 affected by these orders already pay greater  than6 30 percent of their income towards rent.	And I7 strongly oppose any attempt to impose a  minimum8 rent increase in 2013 .9 Now the testimony goes on,10 however, I will end here because I know it' s been  a11 long day.12 Thank you for having me.13 And I have submitted the  original14 and I have extra copies to hand out to anyone   who15 is interested in having one.16 Thank you again.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.18 ( Applause.)19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Helen Rosenthal.20 ( No response.)21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Marlene Perry.22 ( No response.)23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is Marlene in24 the room?25 ( No response.)2

10 about the provisos with regards to  SROs.11 My colleague, Luis Enriques12 testified earlier how hard it is  to enforce.	And I13 do want to clarify, we -- we' re not opposed to14 provisos per se, we just want to make clear  how15 difficult they are to enforce.16 Obviously, as we' ve heard from a17 lot of the SRO testimony today, we think that  a18 rent freeze, a zero percent rent increase would  be19 warranted this year.20 Should you decide to pass an21 increase, we absolutely -- and I can' t be  more22 categorical, absolutely think there should be  some23 type of proviso.	The point of my colleague' s24 testimony earlier was, basically, to say that  they25 are very hard to enforce.10 
2 Tenants cannot request the rent3 rolls for the entire building.	They have to go by4 what they think is the -- the level of occupancy  in5 the building.	It' s hard to prove that and it' s6 very lengthy, as my colleague Luis  explained.7 Filing these complaints with DHCR8 is an extremely time consuming and a long  process9 during which the tenant, most often, has  to10 continue paying the rent since otherwise, you  know,11 basically, risks being sued by the landlord  in12 Housing Court for nonpayment with their name  then13 appearing on the tenant screening reports, i. e.,14 the tenant black list and so on and so  forth.15 So I just want to make  that16 clarification.	We do seek a rent increase for  SRO17 tenants this year.	But should there be an18 increase, we absolutely think that there should  be19 a proviso accompanying it so that at least  those20 landlords that are warehousing units that are,  you21 know, renting them out as hotels, making money  by,22 you know, exploiting the -- the homeless  shelter23 system and, you know, college dorms and all  of24 these other uses that they' re finding, don' t reap25 the benefit of this.	And so that those tenants, at2 
2 least, are protected.3 Thank you.4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,5 Daniel.6 ( Applause.)7 MR. CHEIGH:	Mr. Chairman.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yeah, Brian.9 MR. CHEIGH:	I have a quick10 question.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Daniel, I think12 there' s a question for you.13 MR. CHEIGH:	You know, for the14 SRO increases that the board considers, there' s15 different categories of buildings that we  make16 determinations on.17 Are there specific categories of18 buildings for the provisos -- are more effective  or19 less effective than others; there' s SRO hotels.20 There' s rooming houses.21 MR. PARCERISAS:	Right.	I -- I22 think it' s -- it' s, obviously, it' s easier to23 identify in the small buildings and we had  some24 tenants testify today who live, for instance,  in25 brownstones.	You know, it' s, obviously, easier to2 
2 -- to find out how many units are occupied by   rent3 stabilized tenants if your building has 10 or  114 units than if it has 200 .5 But in terms of the  enforcement,6 it' s no different.	The process is, basically, the7 same.8 In terms of the categories that9 you' re referring to, you know, Class A hotels10 versus rooming houses versus SROs, you know,  they11 -- they' re essentially all the same thing in the12 sense that, you know, they' re really one animal as13 much as legally speaking they might fall  into14 separate categories.15 These are, basically, small living16 spaces with shared bathroom facilities and often  no17 cooking facilities.	And that' s -- that' s really18 what they are, regardless of the different  legal19 categories they might fall under.20 Thank you.21 ( Applause.)22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.23 Is it Levera Sutton?24 MS. SUTTON:	Hello.25 My name is Levera Sutton.	I' ve2 
2 lived in an 11 - unit brownstone, small building, for3 14 years.4 I' ve had five landlords and the5 last three landlords have harassed or bought  out6 all of the other tenants.	I' m the only tenant left7 in my building.8 I' ve had numerous, useless court9 dates and have stood before seven judges,  several10 inspectors and attorneys.	If my landlord wanted11 more income, he' d rent my -- if my present  landlord12 wanted more income, he would rent out the ten  other13 units.14 But for the past three years,  for15 whatever reason, when he bought the building,  he16 chose not to.	And he does own several other  pieces17 of property.18 I was also laid off my job  last19 year after 13 years of hard work and the -- in   the20 11 th year, we were no longer allowed any pay  raises21 nor bonuses and then when they laid me off, I   was22 not allowed a severance package.23 So I' ve been living off of24 unemployment, thank God.	And that has been25 federally decreased in April to -- from $ 405 to2 

2	$ 361 .3
So anyway, my neighbor --  my
4 neighbor owns three small rent stabilized  buildings5 on my block and yet she doesn' t seek to  increase6 the rents.	Everybody works together in her7 buildings.	If there is an MCI that' s needed, she8 shows everyone the -- the invoice and they all  work9 together to come up with it.10 Because the bottom line is, if11 they don' t, they know that they are going to be12 faced with rent increases.	And everybody works13 together.	And she says, look, I make enough  money.14 I do what I want.	I' m not -- it' s just for the15 sake, and that' s something I' ve always wanted to16 do, to be a landlord but not for the sake of   greed.17 And I have a friends that own properties and  some18 are greedy and some just want to be able to   help19 other people and not, you know, raise rents and  --20 and -- for the sake of having more  money.21 Anyway, I' m sorry --22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	That' s okay.23 MS. SUTTON:	I' m a little24 nervous.25 And, also, I know this may be  a4 
2 bit hard on some who want more money, but I' d  like3 to ask, not just for my sake being in an SRO,   but,4 also, for everyone' s sake, just to have a rent5 freeze.6 The economy' s bad.	Businesses7 have shut down.	The employees suffer more than the8 employer because he can get rid of me without  a9 severance or anything.	But he' s got a building10 that he can sell or a business he can  continue11 with.12 And -- just two years, I ride  the13 bus on 125 th -- more businesses close.	By the time14 I ride back up, another business  has opened.	By15 the time back ride down, that business has  closed.16 It' s a rough time.	It won' t always be this way.17 You know, bad times come and go, as well as   good18 times.	We will be better.19 And in all fairness, you know,  I20 don' t -- my landlord - the two first landlords  that21 I had, we all worked together in  the building.	We22 did have a full building at  one time.	You need23 this done, I never asked  for anything.	I don' t24 want anything.	I pay my rent on time.	I like25 being -- I pay my bills  on time.	I like -- if I2 
2 have to work ten jobs, I like to pay my bills   on3 time.	I don' t like to ask anybody for anything --4 and to be independent.5 So that' s all I have to say.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.7 Can I ask you, what -- since  you8 are the sole remaining tenant in the  building,9 what' s the condition of your building?10 MS. SUTTON:	Because of the -- the11 -- each landlord, they gerryrigged the  electricity12 because nobody wants to pay to have any  substantial13 repairs, it' s falling apart.	So that when each new14 owner comes in -- and I' ve even warned the  second15 one, I said, look, you' re a good guy.	You' re16 young.	You' re trying to build your equity.	He' s17 got a family -- a  young family.	I said, don' t buy18 it.	Make a U- turn.19 And he -- he' s a good guy.	He20 filled the place up with people from drug  rehab.21 And so on top of bad, now he' s got bad tenants  who22 are turning tricks in the hallway  for crack.	And23 -- so now he' s got that problem.24 So then someone else buys the25 building.	The cracks in the ceiling and the  --2 
2 it' s a beautiful building. And it' s not3 appreciated.	And it' s separating from the wall4 because no one takes care of the  repairs.5 Down -- one landlord, she hid  my6 mail.	And I found -- and for the first time I   went7 down in the basement.	I' ve been there 14 years, I8 went down in the basement.	And it' s loaded.9 Inspectors love the place.	And, unfortunately,10 they' ve had to come in -- it' s just a mess.	It' s a11 mess.	It' s a mess.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Brian.13 MR. CHEIGH:	You said that the14 previous landlord, the building owner, just had  it15 for a couple of years.	So it turned over three16 times.17 MS. SUTTON:	No.	It' s turned --18 it' s five -- I' ve had five landlords.	It' s been19 sold -- since I' ve been there --20 MR. CHEIGH:	Okay.21 MS. SUTTON:	-- excluding the22 first landlord, it' s been sold four times.23 MR. CHEIGH:	Um- hum.	And you24 don' t know how much that they sold it for; do  you?25 MS. SUTTON:	Oh, yeah.	It' s2 
2 public -- yeah, I know how to look up ACRI and   see3 the sale price.4 And then a lot of  them talk.	You5 know, it' s no big deal or they think we' re6 indigents and we' re so ignorant and they talk down7 to us and how they  treat us.	So I know the sale8 price.9 MR. CHEIGH:	And what was it most10 recently from previous sales?11 MS. SUTTON:	Well, my building is12 listed -- it went up $ 20 , 000 more -- the end of13 last year to $ 760 , 000 .	And then whereas before it14 was $ 740 , 000 .	The previous owner from him, she  --15 she bought the building for $ 336 , 000 .	And then --16 oh, the owner now, he bought it for, I believe,   it17 was $ 532 , 000 .	Then the landlord before him, she18 bought it for $ 336 , 000 .19 So it -- their prices go up  but20 they don' t take care of the building.	And I -- I21 take care of the building.	Someone was complaining22 the tenants they think they own -- well, there  was23 no one to take care of  the building.	So mice grew24 into rats, you know,	Roaches grew into centipedes.25 And -- and so I take my money  and2 
2 don' t ask for -- my money back, just to try and  --3 my neighbors come to me and ask me to, hey,   could4 you buy some bait.	Because I' m always at work.	I5 don' t see the rats coming in.	So I buy the rat6 poison and put down.7 I tell the landlord, oh,  yeah,8 well, I want more money.	You know, and I say  right9 and I continue to bait the  building.10 There' s cobwebs in the building.11 There' s no maintenance.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 MS.

Good17 afternoon.18 For ten years I have served  the19 New York City Housing Court as a volunteer  guardian20 ad litem and volunteer Small Claims  Court21 arbitrator.22 Oftentimes, I find seniors and  the23 disabled in apartments they can no longer  afford.24 As you know, SCRIE and DRIE are not  retroactive.25 Many seniors are living to their 90 s and beyond  and2 
2 do not have a medical condition for nursing  home3 placement.4 I find that the waiting list  for5 affordable senior housing is about three years  and6 I' m also finding more seniors who never married and7 do not have any children or a supportive  family8 network in this country to care for them in  their9 old age.10 In this great economic depression,11 we have a significant amount of unemployed  5012 plus- year- olds, too young and too poor for13 retirement, yet too old to qualify for new  work.14 Your rent increase displaces more15 seniors and families into the shelter system  and16 creates a far greater impact on our City' s  attempt17 at economic recovery.18 In many instances, it is  much19 cheaper to keep someone right where they  are.20 Thank you for the hotel  proviso.21 It allows me to continue  my22 important volunteer commitment to the New York  City23 Court system and our City' s vulnerable adults.24 I live in a  hotel.25 As hotel residents diminish in2

WEISS:	My name is Phillip20 Weiss.21 As -- as I heard today,  landlords22 or their agents come to this board and  complain23 about the high cost of maintaining buildings,  the24 increasing expenses, the low rents.	I -- I really25 have to ask the board, and perhaps the public  in2 
2 general and I also ask myself, how many  landlords3 have filed bankruptcy, you know, within the  past4 year or two in this City or have sold out   their5 holdings at a loss?6 Because from what I' m hearing7 today, it would suggest to me that the -- the   real8 estate industry is in a crisis just by -- just   by9 what I' ve heard today.	You know, the expenses are10 too high, income is too low.	It would seem to me11 that either the real estate industry needs  a12 bailout or there' s some other problems going on13 here, which is causing an entire segment of  this14 economy to suffer.15 And so I' m only going by what I16 heard today.	I mean, I' m not going by any studies.17 I' m not making any -- any kind of -- of  conclusions18 or nothing like that.	I' m going -- going strictly19 by what I heard.20 Now as for me, I live in  Manhattan21 and I live in a rent stabilized building on   the22 east side of Manhattan.	And I' m grateful that I23 have the apartment that I have.	I have no24 complaint about the landlord, none whatsoever.25 Okay.	And so I' m not coming here with any kind  of2 
2 agenda or anything of that sort.3 But what I am coming here to  this4 microphone with, you know, is, frankly,  confusion5 over what it is that the real estate industry  wants6 from the tenants.	Because -- because to me  the7 tenants also have -- they have  expenses too.	You8 know, the landlords have expenses.	The tenants9 have expenses.	I guess the question I have now,  is10 -- which set of expenses take  priority.11 Because -- and that' s something12 that, perhaps, you as the board, have to  decide.13 Which ones take priority?	One segment is saying,14 this has to take -- our expenses are  important.15 The other side is saying, no, we have expenses  too.16 Okay.17 And all I can say to you  ladies18 and gentlemen, is good luck in trying to  resolve19 this.20 ( Applause.)21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.22 Weiss.23 Michael Tomassi.24 MR. TOMASSI:	Hello, everyone.25 My name is Michael Tomassi.	I' m2 
2 just going to read this.3 And I live at 237 West 107 th4 Street in apartment 507 .	I' m a rent stabilized SRO5 tenant.6 My building has 87 units  and7 currently only four of our permanent tenants  occupy8 the building now.	And the rest is now occupied  by9 transient, homeless shelter clients.10 I have lived at this address  since11 1996 and I pay a monthly rate or $ 880  a month.	The12 reason for this letter is to -- is for the   purpose13 of documenting the history of my years at  this14 address.15 When I first moved in, it was  an16 SRO.	As time went by, it became an unlawful   hotel,17 centering on clientele from Europe.	For the past18 three years, it has been taken over by a  women' s19 shelter known as, Help USA.	They bring women in20 for a few weeks or months each and then move   them21 in and out and move more  in.22 Since Help USA took over  the23 building, there was no one there to represent  the24 four of us, who are the original  SRO tenants.	We25 have no services.	The -- they have taken out  the2 
2 stoves and sinks on each floor so we don' t  even3 have a stove or a sink to even cook or do   anything4 with.5 They do provide food for the  women6 but not for the preexisting, permanent SRO  tenants.7 So we' re left with no way of making any kind  of8 meal or even get a drink of  water.9 If there' s anything that needs to10 be repaired in my room, there' s no one there  onsite11 to remedy this problem.	We used to be able to  use12 the Laundromat in the basement but now we are  told13 we cannot use it, it is for Help USA clients   only.14 I had a leak in my radiator and  it15 was going down to all  the floors.	I' m on 5 .	They16 would not come in to fix the radiator so  they17 allowed all this damage to happen on all the  other18 floors.19 The bathrooms are so horrible,20 I' ve actually had a suit and one -- and they  came21 and inspected it and saw how disgraceful  the22 bathroom situation was.23 The clientele, the police are24 there every night.	You have to be checked with  a25 thing now to see if you have a gun  on you.	These2 
2 are the kind of living standards -- and  my3 landlord, actually, is the same one who a  previous4 occupant talked about who had two buildings on 95 th5 Street.	It' s the same landlord that' s doing that6 there.7 So I don' t see how he' s -- and he8 has a mansion in New Jersey.	So I don' t see how he9 can ask for a rent increase from  me.10 Thank you.11 That' s it.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 ( Applause.)14 MR. CHEIGH:	Can I ask a quick  --15 hello.

What do you get when you pay  your23 rent?	How big is your apartment and  --24 MR. TOMASSI:	It' s a regular SRO25 room.	It' s $ 880 a month.2

5 had a loft put in about ten years  ago.6 MR. CHEIGH:	Okay.7 MR. TOMASSI:	So I can actually8 sit and go up on the loft and  sleep.9 MR. CHEIGH:	And you have to10 share -- how many people do you have to share   the11 bathroom and kitchen with?12 MR. TOMASSI:	Well, there is no13 kitchen.	They took the kitchen out.	There used to14 be a kitchen on every  floor.15 When this program came, they took16 out the sink and stove that was on each  floor17 because they didn' t want the women starting any18 fires.19 So even though my lease calls  for20 cooking facilities, they' ve taken it out on every21 single floor.	And in the basement, they have  now22 equipped -- they have food that  comes in.	It' s23 catered.	But only for the -- the shelter  people.24 I' m not allowed to take any advantage of  that.25 So there' s no sink.	There' s no5 

2	stove.3
I' ve tried to get the landlord to
4 write me a letter saying there is now no  cooking5 facilities so I could actually get extra money  from6 the City in order -- but he won' t -- he just won' t7 do it.	And --8 MR. CHEIGH:	How -- how many9 units is this?10 MR. TOMASSI:	There' s 84 units in11 this building.12 MR. CHEIGH:	Eighty- four.13 MR. TOMASSI:	Eighty- seven, I' m14 sorry.	Eighty- seven units.	And there are only15 four of us left of  --16 MR. CHEIGH:	Okay.17 MR. TOMASSI:	-- of the SRO.	But18 we don' t get any services from them.19 MR. CHEIGH:	And when we -- when20 the board recommended a smaller increase with  the21 proviso, did your building owner try to take  that22 increase or --23 MR. TOMASSI:	The thing is, since24 this Help USA took over, there' s nobody there to25 represent -- I have no idea of what' s  happening.4 
2 I' m now kind of the SRO Law project.	They' re --3 they' re helping me.	So I find out through  that.4 There' s no one on the premises to5 help me with anything. Like I' ve been told, bring6 your own garbage down.	We don' t service you.	They7 just don' t do -- it' s as though we don' t exist8 there.9 And the Laundromat we used to  be10 able to use.	We' re not allowed to use that11 anymore.12 So it' s -- it' s ridiculous.13MR. CHEIGH:	But $ 900 -- almost14$ 900 for asmallroom, that' s what you' re paying?15MR.

I10 have lived in the same rent stabilized apartment  in11 Staten Island for 30 years.12 Since I retired four years ago,13 any rent increase is of much greater concern to  me14 than while I was working.	I do not qualify for15 SCRIE.	My income is my pension and  Social16 Security.17 After health insurance and taxes,18 my rent is 48 percent of  my income.	While I can19 manage, I realize that there are many New  Yorkers20 with less income and higher rents.21 While any rent increase is  of22 concern to me, I know that the same increase  would23 be felt even more keenly by those less  fortunate.24 Thank you.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.2

MALLIN:	Good afternoon.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Hello.10 MS. MALLIN:	My name is Vered11 Mallin and I reside in a rent stabilized  building12 located at 30 Park Avenue in New York  City.13 I wish to thank the  Rent14 Guidelines Board for holding this hearing on  the15 proposed rent increases for rent  stabilized16 apartments in the City.17 I understand that your board  is18 considering rent increases by as much as 9 . 519 percent on new two- year leases.	With all due20 respect, I find that unconscionable.	How can that21 be justified, especially when one considers  the22 current historic lows in interest rates and  the23 decades long low rate in inflation, which  is24 currently 1 . 9 percent?25 Furthermore, when one also factors2 
2 in real estate taxes in the City, fuel costs  and3 labor costs, the three key indices of interest  to4 landlords and their bottom line, there' s no5 justification for the exorbitant rent hikes  that6 the board is considering.7 In fact, New York City' s real8 estate taxes have been stable.	Second, fuel prices9 have also been steadfast.	In fact, today British10 Petroleum chief -- Chief Executive Officer,  Bob11 Dudley, was quoted in today' s Wall Street Journal,12 saying, that the growth in U. S. output has been  a13 major factor in keeping oil prices from  rising.14 Lastly, when we consider the labor15 costs, again, there' s no justification for the16 proposed sharp rise in the rental costs,  especially17 for units classified as rent stabilized,  the18 operative word is stabilized, nothing drastic.19 I wish to note that according  to20 the 2010 - 2014 Labor Contract between the Realty21 Advisory Board and the Service Employees22 International Union, Local 32 BJ, the union received23 this year, the last year of the contract, a 57   cent24 increase in standard wages of $ 23 an hour.	That25 translates into a labor cost increase of 2 . 52 
2 percent, nowhere near what the board is  considering3 in rental hikes.4 Furthermore, when one factors in5 the reality that the proposed rent  increases,6 they' re not flat increases in rent for the duration7 of a specific lease and then we  start fresh.	No,8 those increases are then carried over.	They' re9 compounded over all the future years that  a10 particular rent stabilized tenant is able to  hold11 on to his or her apartment. Well, then the  burden12 on tenant is that much  greater.13 In addition, the plight of  tenants14 is also made worse with the never ending so- called15 capital improvements charged to tenants, many  of16 which appear totally unnecessary, over and  above17 what the rent increases are.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I' m going to19 ask you to start to  close.20 MS. MALLIN:	Right.21 In short, is this board  only22 hearing voices of the powerful big business,  big23 landlords, big money?	What about the little24 people, the average middle class and poor that  are25 being forced out of New York City and swept away  to2 

2	the suburbs?3
We want our voices heard.	We ask
4 that at the very least, you reconsider the  proposed5 increases in rents to reflect today' s low interest6 rates, stable and nominal increases in  landlord7 expenses, as well as the plight of hard- pressed8 middle and low- income tenants still wracked by a9 local economy weakened from the 2007  economic10 meltdown.11 In the alternative, a  moratorium12 on any rent hike for at least one year would  be13 most appropriate action by this  board.14 I thank you.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	If you' d like17 to submit your testimony --18 MS.

MALLIN:	Oh, sure.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Gregory24 Bronner.25 MR. BRONNER:	Good evening.4 
2 My name is Gregory Bronner.	I3 live at 136 th Street in Central Harlem.4 I own two rent stabilized5 cooperative units in Brooklyn Heights.6 Over the past four years, the7 maintenance costs on my co- ops have gone up by  408 percent.	And I will be submitting the most  recent9 letter from the co- op board, in which they10 increased maintenance costs by 16 . 4 percent.11 My tenants have been in  occupancy12 for 42 years and 38 years.	They now pay less than13 the maintenance cost of operating their  apartments.14 Worse yet, I am unemployed.	I15 have been unemployed for a year- and- a- half and16 subsidizing my tenants eats up most of  my17 unemployment check.18 Furthermore, I still have to  work19 pretty hard.	As you can see, I do all the  work20 myself.	I live in a three- family building in21 Harlem and I also maintain that.	And quite22 honestly, I' m not even making minimum wage.	And23 minimum wage went up this year.24 Now the issue that I have is  that25 your board has historically raised rents by  less2 
2 than inflation.	Each year you look at the PIOC  and3 you raise it by a bit less assuming that some   of4 the tenants move.	Well, in my case, they haven' t.5 Worse yet, the PIOC is  calibrated6 for the average building.	The building in which my7 units are, unfortunately, costs more than  average8 to run because it' s smaller.	And that means that9 over time, my units are literally crumbling,  you10 know.	And I can' t afford to fix them.11 Now there' s the statement from12 some of the tenant advocates that some of  the13 landlords are doing very well.	Well, I' m not.14 I' ll be perfectly honest.	I lose $ 10 , 000 a year on15 this and it' s eating through my savings.16 And the argument that just because17 some landlords are doing well, that other  landlords18 shouldn' t get paid, is like saying that the Staten19 Island Yankees shouldn' t get paid because A Rod and20 Jeter had a bad year.	You know, same color uniform21 but it' s not the same team.	No offense, but I  need22 the money.23 And, finally, the tenant rents24 that my tenants are paying are very, very  modest.25 They are actually less half on a per square  foot2 
2 basis of the rents that I' m getting in Central3 Harlem.	And I' m not even trying to hit the top  of4 the market, which means that my -- one of  my5 tenants is on SCRIE, so he doesn' t even care.	And6 the other tenant has, actually, offered to buy  the7 apartment from me but it' s so cheap in terms of  --8 the rent is actually cheaper than the  maintenance9 so he' s like, why bother.10 So essentially, if your board does11 not give me a sufficiently large increase,  well,12 I' ll have no choice.	I mean, I' m not really doing13 very much work on those apartments.	I' m not trying14 to make those apartments better.	But my rent -- my15 market rate tenants think I' m awesome.	I,16 actually, signed up for free vegetables,  free17 Internet access and I supply grocery carts to  the18 market rate tenants.19 Now if you want to kick out  all20 the good landlords like me, you know, then keep  on21 squeezing us to death.	But if you want good  people22 to be landlords, then you have to give us  enough23 money that we can actually run  the business.	I' m24 not even asking to make a profit, I' m just  asking25 to break even here.2 
2 Thank you very much.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.4 Good to see you again.5 ( Applause.)6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Harvey.7 MR. EPSTEIN:	Just so I' m clear,8 how many units do you  own?9 MR. BRONNER:	I own two rent10 stabilized units and I own a three- family building11 in Harlem that I live  in.12 MR. EPSTEIN:	A three- family unit13 building in Harlem that' s unregulated.14 MR. BRONNER:	Yes, it' s15 unregulated.16 MR. EPSTEIN:	That you bought17 into a co- op.18 MR. BRONNER:	Yes.19 MR. EPSTEIN:	And then there are20 existing rent stabilized units that you -- you  knew21 they were rent stabilized when you bought  those22 units?	Is that --23 MR. BRONNER:	At the time the --24 I -- the rents were about $ 300 more than  the25 maintenance, which allowed me to roughly break  even2 
2 on my mortgage over -- over the last couple  of3 years that' s actually gotten to be worse than flat.4 MR. EPSTEIN:	And how long have5 you owned those two units?6 MR. BRONNER:	I' ve owned them for7 almost five years now.8 MR. EPSTEIN:	And do you think9 you should be treated differently as a small  owner10 of two units than someone who owns hundreds  of11 units of rent stabilized housing?12 MR. BRONNER:	The statute as I13 read it, says that you' re obligated to keep all14 landlords operating margins.	It doesn' t15 discriminate and it doesn' t say, on average -- the16 average landlord.	It says landlords.17 MR. EPSTEIN:	Well, my question18 was, you' re asking --19 MR. BRONNER:	I' m asking for20 enough money to run my business and maintain  my21 apartments.22 MR. EPSTEIN:	Right.	So --23 MR. BRONNER:	So I don' t --24 MR. EPSTEIN:	-- if someone else25 has enough money to run their business and  is2 
2 making a decent profit, should they get the  same3 increase that you should get?4 MR. BRONNER:	You guys should5 give everybody enough increase so that none of  the6 apartments wind up in dust, the way that they  are7 in Harlem.8 MR. EPSTEIN:	So if a landlord' s9 already making profits, okay, that no one else  gets10 an increase if they' re doing well.11 MR. BRONNER:	No.	The argument12 is that if the landlord -- if no landlord --   if13 some landlords are not making profits, then  you14 need to give everybody enough so that  those15 landlords will.16 MR. EPSTEIN:	So if 90 percent of17 the landlords are doing really well and only  1018 percent struggling, we should give everyone  an19 increase for those 10 percent?20 MR.

2 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Chairman --3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Oh, Ms. Cruz.4 MS. CRUZ:	-- this is just a5 comment that, I think, the speaker very  correctly6 said that the law does  not discriminate.	And that7 goes not just for owners but also for  tenants.8 We' re not here to set a different guideline for9 those tenants that are making sufficient money  to10 pay the rent without any  difficulty.11 And consistently one of our board12 members is asking owners if there should be a   carve13 out for small owners. And I think that that' s --  I14 just want to put on the record, I don' t think it' s15 a -- it' s an appropriate question to be  giving,16 especially since it' s in the law that we cannot17 discriminate.18 Thank you.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.20 Thank you, Greg.21 Council Member Gale Brewer.22 ( Applause.)23 MS. BREWER:	Thank you very much.24 I am Gale -- I am Gale Brewer  and25 I represent the 6 th Council District on the west2 

2	side.3
And I am -- I thank the  Chairman
4 and the board members for giving me the  opportunity5 to testify on the proposed rent  increases.6 I think it' s no surprise to you7 that I feel strongly that these rent  increases8 should be zero.9 And I want to say that for  the10 following reasons:11 I know that these increases are12 coming at a very difficult time.	You know better13 than I and I' m going to submit testimony.	I won' t14 read this whole thing.15 But that the salaries are not16 keeping up with the rents.	And it' s documented17 over and over again, even though the City' s18 unemployment rate dropped from 9 . 9 percent in19 January 2013 -- I mean, unemployment to 7 . 7 percent20 in May of this year.21 And I think housing affordability,22 if you talk to any resident who is challenged  by23 it, is their number one crisis.	And I would say24 it' s a crisis for the City because without25 affordable housing, we will not have the  workforce4 

2	that we need.3
And for rent regulated apartments,
4 this is a particularly challenging time.	The5 median rent contract escalated by 31 percent  over6 the last six years, while renter income  increased7 only 12 percent.8 And the same is true for9 unregulated apartments, questions about which I  get10 all the time.	The median rent contract increased11 by 26 percent, while rent increased by only  1212 percent.13 I just want to talk a minute  about14 how many units we' ve lost over the last few years.15 According to the Rent Guidelines Board data,  the16 greatest loss was within my district on the  upper17 west side with 12 , 231 rent stabilized units and18 10 , 000 -- over 10 , 000 of them are within the 8019 percent AMI and that' s just since 2008 .	I have20 lost more rent regulated units than any  other21 district in the City of New  York.22 And I think we hear about this  and23 then we don' t realize the impact.	Homelessness is24 a challenge.	We know that there are 50 , 00025 homeless, not all of whom have been in  rent4 
2 regulated situations or in rentals, but many  of3 whom are there because they could not pay the  rent.4 And, I think, what the  Rent5 Guidelines Board has to do is to think about  the6 City as a whole.	I know that there are  challenges7 that you have to meet in terms of people' s --  the8 insurance and the cost of owning  a building.	I own9 a building.	I own a brownstone.	I know exactly10 how much it costs and I don' t think it has gone  up.11 My costs as much as you are indicating that  you12 would like to up the one and two- year leases.13 Community Service Society does14 wonderful surveys.	And I think you' ll see that15 their surveys show how little the salaries  are16 keeping up with rent increases.17 I' m also concerned about the poor18 tax, which I know was upheld by the court but   as19 adds another challenge to renters.20 I just want to give you  one21 example, a predatory problem, some predatory  issues22 that are hitting my constituents and others.	We23 have a tenant named Linda Cooper.	She lives on24 84 th Street.	Seven rent regulated left.	Brand new25 owner.	Somebody from out of town.	Comes in, kicks2 
2 out all the market tenants overnight.	And then is3 -- starts literally bogus rent arrears,  claiming4 late payment of rent, not true.	Heat and hot water5 issues.6 And the following agencies have to7 be at the building on a constant  basis:8 NYPD, FDNY, DOB, HPD, DEP, all9 because of the issues of this new owner,  tenants10 being asked, whether they' re 80 years old or11 families with three kids, to take money and  leave.12 They' re all leaders in our community.13 This is the kind of  harassment14 that comes about from owners who are looking to  try15 to capitalize on buildings that should be  rent16 regulated, have market tenants and shouldn' t17 experience the kind of discussion that I' m trying18 to talk about today.19 And the reason I mentioned  this,20 in these kinds of buildings where you have  market21 and you have rent regulated, there should be  able,22 particularly, not to have a rent  increase.23 I just want to conclude by  talking24 about the SROs and the residential hotels  because25 otherwise Anne Cunningham will kill me.	And the2 
2 fact of the matter is, they, in particular,  should3 make sure that there' s no -- obviously, there was  a4 proviso that you have over the years making  sure5 that they do not have a rent  increase.6 I want to thank you very much  for7 your time.8 I will submit much longer9 testimony.	But I feel very strongly that this  is10 not a year to approve the kind of rent  increases11 that you have done in your preliminary  discussions.12 Thank you very much.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,14 Council Member.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Are there any17 questions?18 Harvey.19 MR. EPSTEIN:	Council Member20 Brewer, I have a  quick question.	You mentioned21 predatory equity landlords in your district.	And22 I' m wondering whether you think we should treat23 buildings that have -- no longer have majority  rent24 regulated tenants, differently than other25 buildings?	Whether you think we should look  for2 
2 lower increases because they have so many  market3 rate units in their building?4 MS. BREWER:	I' ve been talking5 about this for 12 years.	Obviously, with the6 single- room occupancy and the residential, there' s7 a proviso having to do with whether there is  a8 certain number of hotel rent regulated versus --  at9 one point, tourism or other kinds of leasing  in10 terms of the other units.	So that exists.	I hope11 it continues.12 The answer to your question  is13 yes.	I feel strongly.	I have buildings that  have14 rent regulated tenants and market tenants.	I have15 buildings that have rent regulated tenants  and16 co- op and condos.17 I have buildings that have all18 three.	And I feel strongly that where that kind  of19 income is coming in, there' s no need to give  the20 higher -- or any increase to the rent  regulated21 tenants, be the rent controlled, which is  under22 your purview or rent stabilized.23 Thank you.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25 MS.

MILLS:	Good afternoon.7I really don' t know where to8begin.But like the board, there' s a dilemma and I9have adilemma.10 I' m in an SRO unit at the11 Riverside Studios and I' ve been living there since12 1979 .	When I arrived here in New York out  of13 military, I wanted to be an artist and this was   the14 place to be to be an artist in New York   City.15 When I walked into the room that  I16 was showed, I said, oh, this is home sweet  home.17 This is where I' ll be.18 In 2009 I went to pay my rent  and19 the landlord said, no, I will not take your  rent.20 So for three years or more, I have not paid rent   --21 according to them.	But I' ve wanted to pay rent.22 The landlord now -- I should  say23 the new owners, at this point, they are trying  to24 buy me out of a place that I' ve lived for 30  years.25 When I look at the prospect of living on   the10 
2 streets, it -- it is very horrifying for me  to3 think of that.4 I would like for the board  to5 consider if a land -- if an owner wants to buy   out6 tenants, why would you want to give them  an7 increase of -- of rent  or increase?	When you think8 about the fact that this particular  three9 buildings, they are like 340 units there.	The one10 that I live in is  seven floors.	There are light11 eight apartments to the north and eight  apartments12 to the south.13 And on my floor, I' m the only one14 on this north wing.	And there' s a pianist on the15 other wing.	And there' s seven people living in16 this one big building that they refuse to rent  for17 the last year or so.18 I' ve seen neighbors go and they19 don' t rent back to the public.	This is a place20 that should be filled with people -- New  Yorkers.21 And it' s just -- it' s just heartbreaking to see22 people on the street.23 And I hope that the board  would24 make a radical, a real radical decision today,  to25 help New Yorkers in light of the economic  plight2

2 MS. GOODMAN:	Thank you.3 I' m here as a speaker for Assembly4 Member Daniel O' Donnell, who' s in Albany.5 And he says, good morning, but6 that' s because I was supposed to get here in  the7 morning.8 ( Laughter.)9 MS. GOODMAN:	Good evening.10 Assembly Member O' Donnell11 represents the 69 th district, representing12 residents of Manhattan Valley, Morningside  Heights,13 the upper west side and southern  Harlem.14 Thank you for the opportunity  to15 discuss rent adjustments for renewal leases  for16 rent stabilized apartments.17 The proposed rent increases of18 between 3 . 25 percent and 6 . 25 percent for one- year19 lease renewals and between 5 and 9 . 5 percent for20 two- year lease renewals, if passed, will be an21 economic burden to thousands of families  and22 individuals and individual renters who reside in  my23 district and throughout the City at  large.24 The main purpose of rent25 regulation is to protect tenants during  an2 
2 emergency housing shortage from rent increases  that3 would constitute a hardship.	The function of the4 Rent Guidelines Board when authorizing rent5 increases every year is to strike a balance  between6 maintaining affordable housing for tenants and7 allowing landlords to maintain services and make  a8 reasonable profit.9 For too long, however, the City10 has failed to grasp who are renters are and  what11 incomes they have.	The result is that more12 families are finding it increasingly difficult  to13 afford their rents.	Once forced out of their14 apartments, there are fewer and fewer  affordable15 housing options for low and middle income  New16 Yorkers.17 In my community office, the  crisis18 comes to life on a  regular basis.	We are -- we see19 many forced to choose between paying the rent  and20 paying for other necessities, such as basic  dental21 care.	We see those who are chronically late  with22 paying their rent because they have no savings  and23 rely on the arrival of their Social Security  check24 before paying the rent.25 We see those living on2 
2 unemployment insurance needing to partition their3 one- bedroom apartments to make space for roommates4 in order to pay the  rent.5 We help our constituents complete6 applications for SCRIE and DRIE, only to  realize7 that even with the subsidy they will have to  pay8 over 50 percent of their income to  rent.9 We see many families with children10 unable to find any housing anywhere after living  in11 a City shelter for 11 or 12  months.12 We see a constant flow of  people13 looking for rental assistance to  avoid14 homelessness, most of whom are working full  time15 but cannot afford their rents.	The reality is, it16 does not have to be  this way.	The rent burden17 doesn' t have to be so large a portion of incomes  in18 order for landlords to realize reasonable  profits.19 We know what affordable housing20 means to people and to communities.	Affordable21 housing helps to build more stable  communities,22 relieves stress within families and enables  people23 to eat healthier, become better educated and  save24 for life' s inevitable emergencies.25 I am adamantly opposed to  yet2 
2 another rent increase which will further  burden3 thousands of New Yorkers who are already  struggling4 to make ends meet.5 Thank you.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.7 MS. GOODMAN:	And --8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	We have a9 question for you.10 MS. GOODMAN:	Sure.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Either as you12 or as the Assemblyman.13 You mentioned SCRIE.14 MS.

GOODMAN:	But -- but not very13 often.	Not very often.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Not very often.15 MS. GOODMAN:	I mean, most people16 who come into my office are not the  typical17 constituent because they know about us.	And that18 makes them unique, I think -- or not unique, but   a19 small portion of the people who should be coming  in20 and they' re desperately in need of SCRIE and DRIE,21 the City --22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Don' t come in.23 MS. GOODMAN:	-- has to make more24 of an effort to publicize  that program.	I can only25 wonder why they don' t.2 
2 I have my own theory about  that3 and it' s -- it' s pretty obvious.4 I -- off the record, I' m a rent5 stabilized tenant.	I don' t have -- after working6 for 35 years, I have no savings because I' m  paying7 more than 50 percent of my income to rent  myself.8 So, you know, the service I9 provide to my community in my job is not going   --10 I' m not going to be able to maintain my  own11 apartment to be -- so, you know, if you want   people12 like me in the City providing services to --  to13 elected officials, you' re going to have to think14 about what you' re doing to our rents.15 That' s off the record though.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.17 MS. GOODMAN:	Because I' m not18 testifying for myself.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	That' s okay.20 MS. GOODMAN:	Thank you.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You can wear22 two hats when you' re here.23 MS.

ZANE:	Good afternoon.9 I' ve been a resident of 315 West10 94 th Street, the Monroe Hotel, also known as the11 Candy Hotel since 1996 .	It' s an SRO.12 I freelanced in the arts,  which13 have been hit hard by the economic turn down  or14 downturn.15 Some of my neighbors work in16 restaurants and menial labor, only making  minimum17 wage.	Many have young children who are  struggling18 to pay rent, buy groceries and take care of  our19 health.	Most of us have no  insurance.20 We cannot afford a rent  increase21 at this time.22 Our landlord has warehoused rooms23 for years.	Our building has 201 units and over  the24 past three years alone, at least 130 , but probably25 more rooms, have been vacant.2 
2 There are less than 40  permanent3 rent stabilized tenants left in  the building.	The4 landlords have allowed the building to remain  805 percent vacant for years when Guidelines say  a6 building should be at least 85 percent full  before7 a rent increase.8 If you add up what landlords  would9 make off a rent increase, it comes to about $ 500  a10 month.	Honestly, if they rented just one of  the11 130 plus vacant rooms out for that rate to  a12 permanent tenant, they would have their $ 500 just13 by renting one 8 by 10 room at a   fair price.	By14 the way, bathrooms are in the hall and  shared.15 These rooms aren' t prime real16 estate.	Honestly, it' s that absurd.	Shame on them17 for complaining about expenses when they' ve been18 creating their own losses for  years.19 My landlords bought the building20 around 2001 and they knew when they bought  the21 building that it had rent stabilized tenants  but22 they had plans to harass and empty the building  out23 over the years.	You know, offering money to people24 to move out -- very little money, which adds to   the25 homeless problem, because they knew that they  could2 
2 get contracts with the City for $ 3 , 000 a month per3 head for homeless tenants.4 So, you know, during --  several5 years ago we had to deal with homeless shelters  in6 our building, as well as illegal  tourist hotels.	I7 had drunken frat boys running up and down in  the8 hallway harassing me.9 When it was a homeless  shelter,10 there were fights and dangerous people there  every11 night.	The police were there every single day  and12 night and that' s not an exaggeration.	Every single13 day the police were there.	I had someone get14 stabbed outside my door.15 You know, these rooms should be16 for low income permanent residents and, you  know,17 the landlords don' t have to buy these buildings if18 they don' t want to deal with low income residents.19 And, I think, there should be  a20 zero percent increase on SRO  tenants.21 Thank you for your time.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.23 ( Applause.)24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Sandra Borri.25 MS. BORRI:	Good evening.2 
2 I just wanted to bring my  brief3 testimony as a -- a rent stabilized  tenant.4 I moved to the West Village  205 years ago.	I was coming from Italy after  college6 and I' ve greatly benefited from the possibility of7 occupying a rent stabilized apartment.8 I have been able to work as  a9 freelance interpreter for the court system --  the10 New York system for the immigration services  for11 the D. A.	All entities that do not hire full  time.12 I' ve been able to be a civil servant.13 Thanks to an affordable rent,14 should things change, I don' t know if I would  be15 able to give my contribution as a civil  servant.16 Also, location has been key  as17 I' ve been able to intervene as fast as possible,18 living in the -- geographically -- a  favorable19 area.20 On another note, I also think  that21 the West Village has been a very welcoming  and22 embracing environment for me being a foreigner.	I23 see it' s losing its character.	It' s less and less24 diverse because of the situation, the  economic25 situation, and because of the tenants that  have2 
2 been moving out due to rent  increases.3 So I wish that we could all  belong4 -- keep on belonging to that community and  carrying5 out our service and I think it would be  possible6 only if the rent increase is  reasonable.7 Thank you.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.9 ( Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Marina11 Miloradovich.12 Forgive me if I  mispronounced.13 MS.

MILORADOVICH:	Is it okay22 like this?23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Matt' ll take24 it.	He' ll help you.25 MS. MILORADOVICH:	Last year I2 
 2 spoke in front of the board as an SRO tenant   trying3 to defend a zero rent increase for all  SRO4 buildings.	And I was trying to make a point  mainly5 with the economy.6 And this year, my main point  is7 the status of SRO buildings.	We' re three tenants8 in our building.	And we are three SRO  tenants. 9 And we' ve been served with two holdover cases since 10	2009 .11 And during one of those  holdover12 cases, two former SRO units were built into  one13 unit, which can be rented at a, I guess, at   a14 market rent if the owner wishes  to.15 And so I' m really here just to say16 that I hope this year, again, we will have a   zero17 percent rent increase because I think it' s more18 important to defend existing laws that govern  those19 buildings, especially for people who buy  buildings20 who bought the buildings not too many years  ago.21 As these kinds of buildings are not really meant  to22 be extremely profitable nor are they meant --  nor23 are they meant for -- to be used as -- to   develop,24 basically.	They' re not meant for that.25 And so as long it' s sufficient for11 
2 landlords and they can rent out other units,  I3 think that it' s more important for them to just4 respect the laws governing those buildings than  to5 increase the rent.6 That' s it.7 Thank you.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.9 Where -- where is the  building?10 Where do you live?11 MS.

And I agree with  you.4 So I' m Sheryl Retrey and I' m,5 actually, here to echo what Councilwoman  Jessica6 Lappin said much earlier.7 The fact that don' t judge the8 upper east side by the fact that everyone  thinks9 it' s such a very well endowed area with people10 making tons of money because we' re such a mixed  use11 area.12 My apartment is rent stabilized.13 My building is very unusual.	I' m also the14 president of a magnificent street park plaza,  Dag15 Hammerskjold Plaza on East 47 th Street, between 1 st16 and 2 nd Avenue.17 We provide most of the public  art18 there.	We have cleaned up that place and we made  a19 commitment to Mayor Giuliani 20 year ago that  we20 would forever maintain it; myself, my  board.21 I have an aging board, most  of22 them are in rent stabilized apartments.	We23 literally, if you come there, you' ll be very24 shocked -- besides the Katherine Hepburn  garden25 named in her honor, no one every gave us a   cent2 
2 except what we raise ourselves and through  City3 funds, of course, through our dear counsel  people.4 But the fact really remains that5 they could never survive if you really go  ahead6 with this rent hike on rent stabilized  apartments.7 And that includes myself.	I' ve been in my building8 since 1960 when it was built, with  my family.	My9 daughter was also born into this building on  the10 corner.11 We face -- what we have  created12 and, actually, the new landlord of seven years,  has13 capitalized on the fact that we are  this14 magnificent space.	We are also the gateway to  the15 U. N.	We are public assembly, free speech,  protests16 all the time.	Everything goes on.17 Trump is on the corner on  First18 Avenue and now Zeckendorf is coming to the  other19 side.	We are flanked by incredibly expensive20 building -- apartments.21 But, nevertheless, in my building,22 it' s a very strange situation.	As people either23 pass away or leave, because they have been  very24 harassed by the landlord, we' re like a frat house25 because they do repair these apartments and  then2 
2 they will rent them to about five, six,  seven,3 eight guys -- people, young people, who, of  course,4 it doesn' t matter if you sleep on the floor.	They5 look good every morning going to a  work.6 It' s a mad house and frat house7 most of the time.	Then they rent rooms as  hotels.8 And I -- is  that legal?	They even contract with a9 maid service.	It' s a wonderful, very mixed10 eclectic, you know, event.	Except we don' t want to11 lose our apartments, so we' re still there.	And12 your proposed rent hikes will make it  impossible13 for us to remain.14 And you need us.	We' re15 maintaining a City street that the City cannot  do.16 Everything that goes at once, as an example, we  do17 -- from hiring the DOE fund to raising the  funds.18 We' re the complaint department, the engineers, the19plumbers.It' s adaunting experiencewith a lot of20-- well, youcomeand see what we have achieved.21So I' m just here tooffer my22objectiontothisproposed rent hike.23Thank you.24CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:Thank you.25( Applause.)

CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Abbyssina( No response.)A VOICE:	She' s not here. CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.Michael Gillett. ( No response.)CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is there anyone
10 in the room who wishes to speak who has  not11 registered at the desk?12 Okay.13 MR. GILLETT:	Good evening, board14 members.15 Thank you for this forum.16 I wanted to raise a few  issues17 today and I' m grateful for the opportunity to do18 so.19 I am a rent stabilized tenant  from20 Sunset Park Brooklyn.	I' ve lived in my building21 since late 2006 and since that time my rent  has22 increased over $ 500 .23 I would also say that I' m an24 employee of one of the agencies of the City of   New25 York.	I' m a hard working nine to five person.	And10 
2 I' m just, unfortunately, not making an3 extraordinary amount of money.	Although rent4 increases have -- have steadily come during  the5 time that I' ve been here, my wage has remained6 stagnant.	And that is a plight facing many  New7 Yorkers.	And, unfortunately, it' s not helping the8 rent situation.9 Many of us who live in  rent10 stabilized buildings are not people who have  been11 forever.	A lot of us are young  professionals12 trying to eke out a living, a modest living  at13 that, in the City.	And pricing -- getting priced14 out by large rent increases is going to hurt  the15 diversity of this community and New York as  a16 whole.17 Since the time that I' ve been in18 my building, our landlord has used major  capital19 increases as a vehicle to raise the rents in  my20 building, which I believe has been a vehicle  to21 reach the high rent threshold to remove them  from22 -- from rent protection.23 I' ve had to be the only person to24 stand against MCIs because others were so  daunted25 and unnerved by the prospect of filing  challenges.2 
 2 In fact, one neighbor of  mine3 downstairs moved his family out of the  building.4 The landlord wasted no time to gut renovate  that5 building and gut renovate that apartment and  move6 people in at market rate.7 There are other opportunities and8 other ways for landlords to recoup money as  opposed9 to the rent increases that you' re proposing.10 At this point, I would like  to11 also say that, owners are enjoying 35 percent  net12 operating income increases.	In fact, in Brooklyn,13 the net operating income of -- of tenants has been 14	over $ 330 .15 I would just like to implore  you16 to consider a zero percent rent increase  for17 tenants at this period.	And I' d also like to have18 more than one hearing outside of Manhattan  for19 those of us in Brooklyn who find it hard to   get20 here and those of us who work during the  day.21 And I, basically, would like to22 mention that there are other methods for rents  to23 -- I' m sorry, for landlords to recoup money.	Major24 capital increases are permanent increases and he  is25 currently earning much more than the amount  of15 

2	money expended.3
The rent increase that I' m paying
4 right now for the improvements to the outside of  my5 building are negligible.	He has unscrupulously6 pursued increases for electricity improvements that7 have already been paid for by individual  apartment8 improvements.	So I' m paying double, which I9 believe is unscrupulous and I' ve also been the10 subject of harassment, in terms of getting my  rent11 mailed back and, also, other threats and things  of12 that nature.13 So it' s obvious that my landlord14 would like me to leave, although I could not  afford15 my apartment at market rate.	And I' d like to16 implore you to consider a zero percent increase  at17 this time.18 Thank you.19 ( Applause.)20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Michael.21 Question for you.22 How -- how big is your  building?23 MR. GILLETT:	It' s an eight unit24 apartment at Sunset Park Brooklyn.	And my landlord25 owns many buildings in Park Slope, which is  an4 
2 affluent area and he' s earning market rate for most3 of them.4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.5 MR. GILLETT:	Thank you, sir.6 MR. CHEIGH:	Excuse me, are there7 -- are there any -- right  here.8 Are there -- so there are  market9 rate units in the apartment now but were there  not10 before?11 MR. GILLETT:	Yes.	As I said,12 one of the -- one of the residents in my   building13 was so unnerved by the MCI process that he  moved14 his apartment -- he moved his  family out.	That15 unit was completely gut renovated and now  earns16 market rate for the landlord.17 And there' s also an existing18 market rate apartment in the apartment.	So out of19 the eight, two of them are receiving market rate  or20 higher than market rate.	I' m one of the few rent21 stabilized tenants.	I' m also one of the few who22 are paying the actual rent because a number  of23 people are covered by disability rent  increase24 increase exemption.25 But as one of the few people  that2 
2 work nine to five everyday, I' m affected by the  MCI3 increases that the landlord' s using to increase the4 rents.5 MR. CHEIGH:	Thank you very much.6 MR. GILLETT:	Thank you.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 ( Applause.)9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Abyssinia10 Vanterpool.	Is she back yet?11 You' re back.	Okay.12 And she' ll be followed by Ken13 Gale.14 MS. VANTERPOOL:	Hi.	My name is15 Abyssinia Vanterpool.16 I' m a rent stabilized tenant at17 311 West 127 th Street in Harlem.18 My building was completed in  201119 and contains 156 units of affordable housing  that20 were developed thanks to numerous federal,  state21 and city subsidies.22 I' d like to thank you today -- I' d23 like to take the time to talk about a small   subset24 of recently developed rent stabilized housing  stock25 and ask that you consider a zero percent  rent2 
2 increase this year.3 Before my building existed, it  was4 an empty lot on 311 West 127 th Street and the  lot5 was sold for $ 11 to a profitable real  estate6 development company with the goal of  providing7 affordable housing.8 The construction on my building9 was financed with a patchwork of  subsidies,10 including $ 3 . 6 million in low income housing tax11 credits, $ 5 . 37 million in interest free loans12 provided by HPD, HDC and DHCR' s tax credit13 assistance program.14 The terms on these zero  interest15 loans is 40 years.	And the principal is not  due16 until 2049 .	These subsidies affect over 82  percent17 of the total construction costs.18 In addition, my building benefits19 from a 25 year, 42 A property tax exemption, which20 means it will be exempt from any increase  in21 property taxes for 21 years.	After that, the22 building will further benefit from a phase in  of23 the property taxes over an additional four  years.24 Despite the fact that these25 subsidies are intended to provide affordable2 
2 housing, the asking rate for rents today are $ 1 , 9003 for a studio, $ 2 , 038 for a one- bedroom apartment,4 $ 2 , 455 for a two- bedroom apartment and up.	There' s5 three bedrooms also.6 My family' s current rent burden7 represents nearly 39 percent of our take- home8 salary.	We have -- we' ve come to terms with the9 idea that we' ll have to move out if we ever want  to10 have children.	And even if we did decide to  stay11 in a one bedroom and have children, we would  have12 no savings.13 One glimmer of hope is that we  are14 rent stabilized tenants and this becomes15 meaningless if this board approves rent  increases16 like the ones proposed in the preliminary  vote.17 High property taxes were one  of18 the concerns the landlord' s representative raised19 in justifying the high rent increases that  this20 board has proposed.	Yet I ask you not to  lose21 sight of the enormous subsidies that are also  given22 to developers of new rent stabilized  housing.23 In the case of my building,  in24 exchange for free land, $ 11 land, $ 53 . 7 million in25 interest free loans, $ 3 . 6 million in tax credit2 
2 equity and reduced property taxes for a quarter  of3 a century and New Yorkers will only receive  1564 units of housing that is barely affordable  to5 people who work.6 I understand that this is not  --7 that it' s not the purview of this board to8 determine how subsidies are spent or what  the9 public should receive in exchange.	But what this10 board should consider is a small subset of  newly11 built rent stabilized housing has lower  operating12 costs, is more energy efficient and pays  lower13 taxes than older building.	Its residents often14 also pay very high rents.15 For these reasons, I urge  you16 reevaluate the range of rent increases proposed  in17 your preliminary vote and to approve a zero  percent18 rent increase this year.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you very20 much.21 ( Applause.)22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You can give23 your testimony, if you' d like to include it, you24 can hand that in.25 Mr. Ken Gale.2 
2 And after Mr. Gale, we' re going to3 take a 15 minute recess because our stenographer  is4 punchy.	He needs to stretch.5 Mr. Gale.6 MR. GALE:	Take a deep breath.	I7 want to emphasize that we' re not living in a8 vacuum.	Decisions made here affect many other9 areas.10 I' m Ken Gale and I produce and11 host a environmental radio show on  WBAI FM.	And in12 2008 , was part of an environmental coalition that13 brought commercial net metering to the State of  New14 York.	I was creating solar energy  jobs.15 That resulted in the creation  of16 thousands of jobs in New York City alone  and17 cleaner and healthier air as well.	But the jobs18 created were working class jobs.	And it' s very19 difficult for someone like that to be able  to20 afford to live in New York  City.21 That' s a shame for them and their22 families and for the rest of us.	Because we need23 those people and the jobs they do.	And if they24 can' t live here, they do, indeed, go elsewhere.25 And when only the wealthy can live here, you end  up2 
2 with people who don' t work here and don' t spend3 their money here.4 Loss of jobs and places for5 working families to live, affects the  entire6 economy of the City.7 Students are in the same8 situation.	The constant rent increases benefit a9 few at the expense of many.	There' s a domino10 effect and it' s just not fair.11 And for those of you who think  the12 outer boroughs are a solution, let me remind you  of13 what happens to the subways when there' s a  severe14 nor' easter or hurricane.	They' re shut down.15 People who are forced out  of16 Manhattan, cannot get to work and the economy  of17 the City suffers a severe  blow.18 Climate chaos is creating more19 winter and summer storms and they' re more severe20 and keeping working class people from affording  to21 live here hurts our ability to recover from  those22 storms.	It has hurt our ability to recover  from23 Sandy, for example.24 More and more places to live  are25 held by fewer and fewer corporations.	City2 
2 landlords have an incredible number of loop  holes3 that enable them to kick people out of  their4 apartments.	They kick people out regardless of5 age, family status or ability to pay.	Those6 loopholes must be eliminated and these  rubber7 stamped rent increases must end for the future  of8 the City and everyone in it -- well,  nearly9 everyone.10 Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.12 ( Applause.)13 Okay.	We will take a 15 - minute14 break.1516		( Brief recess, 6 : 22 p. m., 6 : 47 17	p. m.)1819 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I think we can20 get started again.21 Our next speaker, Barbara Begg.22 MS. BEGG:	Hello.	I am 71 years23 old.	I just retired about six  months ago.	And if24 it weren' t for my rent stabilized apartment, I25 wouldn' t have been able to live in the City  all19 
2 these years earning 58 cents or whatever it is  to3 every man' s dollar.4 But -- and now that I' m on a  fixed5 income, I' m quite concerned about any rent6 increases.7 And one thing I noticed is that  my8 landlord seems to give the same amount of  heat,9 regardless of the temperature outside.	If it' s 1510 degrees out or 60 degrees out, it' s the same  amount11 of heat and he was giving us heat into -- late   into12 the spring when we did not  need heat.	So I think13 maybe if landlords could manage their  buildings14 better, they wouldn' t feel the need to raise the15 rents so much.16 That' s all.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	There are some18 people that would trade that heat for  you.19 MS. BEGG:	Pardon?20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	There were some21 that would trade that heat.22 MS. BEGG:	Yes.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	They' d love to24 have it.25 MS. BEGG:	Yeah.	But you don' t2 
2 want it to be 80  degrees.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.4 MR. CHEIGH:	I' m sorry I have a5 -- excuse me, ma' am.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Begg.7 Ms. Begg, there' s a question.8 MR. CHEIGH:	Are you eligible for9 SCRIE?10 MS. BEGG:	I don' t think I am yet.11 I may be at  some point.	I' m not sure what the12 eligibility requirements are.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	They' re not14 that complex.15 MS. BEGG:	But I' m going to look16 into that.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Begg, Sam18 will explain it to you.	See him.	He' ll tell you19 the requirements for SCRIE and if you qualify, he' s20 got the forms.21 Kenneth Schaeffer.22 MR. SCHAEFFER:	Good afternoon.23 My name is Kenny Schaeffer.

Until New York City gets back  home
4 rule over our rent and eviction laws, taken away  in5 1971 by Governor Nelson Rockefeller' s infamous6 Urstadt Law, the Rent Guidelines Board, as  a7 community service society, recently noted earlier8 this year, is just about the only City agency  that9 can directly address the ever- worsening10 affordability and homeless crisis afflicting some  311 million New Yorkers living in rent  stabilized12 apartments.13 But the Rent Guidelines Board has14 been asleep at the wheel, ratcheting up rents  in15 good times and bad, exacerbating the crisis  rather16 than ameliorating.17 Can the public members raise your18 hands?	Keep them up.	You took an oath of  officer;19 didn' t you?	You swore to uphold the law,  including20 specifically the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 ;21 didn' t you?22 Have you even read it?	Are you23 familiar with the findings and declaration  of24 emergency, which declares the problem to be a  grave25 emergency and sets forth the imperative  for4 
2 governmental preventive action to protect against3 serious threats to public health, safety  and4 general welfare, including unjust, unreasonable and5 oppressive rents?6 If you' re not familiar with the7 law, let me remind, which was mostly  recently8 renewed in 2011 , let me remind you what it  says:9 The Council hereby finds that a serious  public10 emergency continues to exist in the housing of  a11 considerable number of persons within the City  of12 New York and will continue  to exist.	That such13 emergency necessitated the intervention of  federal,14 state and local government in order to  prevent15 speculative, unwarranted and abnormal increases  in16 rents.	That unless residential rents and  evictions17 continue to be regulated and control,  disruptive18 practices and abnormal conditions will produce19 serious threats to the public health, safety  and20 general welfare.21 And I know you like to say you' re22 not a welfare agency, but  you are.	The law that23 created you is responding to a threat to  public24 health, safety and general welfare.	That to25 prevent such perils to health, safety and  welfare,2 
2 preventive action by the council continues to  be3 imperative, that such action is necessary in  order4 to prevent and forestall profiteering, speculation5 and other disruptive practices tending to  produce6 threats to public health and safety.	And that such7 conditions constitute a grave emergency.8 What was then a threat has  become9 a reality with homeless, poverty and rent  burdens10 at record levels.	But instead of protecting the11 public, the rent increases you' re considering or12 any increases at all, will make this  grave13 emergency even worse.14 What are you thinking?	By your15 own 2013 studies, landlords are now making a   profit16 of 38 cents on every rent dollar, well over half  of17 all stabilized tenants are paying more than  the18 federal hardship level of 30 percent in  rent,19 affecting both poor and middle income  households20 alike.21 To quote your own study, " a22 majority of rent stabilized tenants are not able  to23 afford their apartments."	In my testimony I  cite24 the study but I' m sure you' re familiar with it.25 Preventive action continues to be2 
2 imperative.	Wake up.	If you can' t do your job,3 please step down before you do any more  harm.4 Thank you.5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.6 Schaeffer.7 ( Applause.)8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: Harvey.9 Question.10 MR. EPSTEIN:	Kenny, I want to11 ask you about your neighborhood and kind of  what12 you see as a rent  stabilized tenant.	And what do13 you think we should be doing about buildings  that14 are becoming rapidly de- regulated where they' re,15 you know, 100 units and there' s 20 rent stabilized16 tenants left or a 20 - unit building where there' s17 one or two?18 What do you think the19 responsibility of the Rent Guidelines Board is  in20 looking at those units in those buildings  and21 determining Rent Guidelines increases?22 MR. SCHAEFFER:	Well, I' ve lived23 on the upper west side my  whole life.	I started24 out on 74 th and Columbus.	Now I' m on 98 th and25 Broadway.	And as everyone knows, the  neighborhood2 
2 has changed tremendously.3 Of the buildings that are still4 there, my own building was converted to  condo.5 There' s very few rent regulated tenants left.	Most6 of them are elderly, many of them on fixed  income.7 Some of them are a little bit above SCRIE  levels.8 It' s hardships.	And these landlords are making9 huge, huge profits.10 I know the Rent Guidelines  Board11 is in a mindset that your job is to  protect12 landlords from real or imaginary increasing  costs,13 regardless of the fact that their profits  are14 through the roof.	That' s not what the law says.	I15 urge you, again, please before you vote, go  back16 and read the findings in the declaration  of17 emergency in the Rent Stabilization Law.18 But to answer your question,19 Harvey, I think that the Rent Guidelines  Board20 needs to realize that your job is to  protect21 tenants.	That landlords in this buildings,22 particularly, are making profits, literally,23 through the roof and that you should be  freezing24 rents in those buildings where landlords --  just25 you do often in hotels where the landlords  are2 
2 making profits, extraordinary profits, 38 cents  on3 the dollar.4 I met someone on the subway  this5 morning who' s from South Carolina, he develops6 housing.	He says, I don' t make 38 cents on the7 dollar.	You know, I think your job is to  protect8 the tenants.9 MR. EPSTEIN:	Thanks.10 Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Steve.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thirty- eight13 cents on the dollar.	Okay.	Have you worked14 through the math because you -- you read our  report15 but did you actually work through the math to  see16 what that translates to into real  dollars?17 MR. SCHAEFFER:	Uh --18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m going to say19 no.20 MR. SCHAEFFER:	-- I' ve done it21 in other years.	I did it somewhat this  year.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.23 MR. SCHAEFFER:	What -- what24 specifically?25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Somewhat this2 

2	year.	Okay.3
Let' s say we have $ 1 , 208 per unit,
4 which is the average or mean that landlords  collect5 -- all income.	That' s rent, that' s everything else6 per unit.7 MR. SCHAEFFER:	Per unit?8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Per unit.9 We take 62 cents on the dollar  as10 expenses.	That leaves you 38 cents per unit.	All11 right.	That' s $ 459 a unit a month.	Annualize12 that.	That' s $ 5 , 500 a year.13 MR. SCHAEFFER:	Per unit.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	As an NOI.15 Right.16 A third of the building stock  of17 New York City is between 6 and  12 units.	Okay.	So18 let' s take a mid point.	That' s 10 .	That' s $ 55 , 00019 in NOI.	All right.20 That' s before debt service.	But21 let' s just assume that there' s no debt on this22 building for some strange reason.	That' s $ 55 , 00023 that landlord makes a year.	From that --24 MR. SCHAEFFER:	They have one25 building.4 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- from that they3 have to pay capital expenses to maintain  the4 property because the NOI doesn' t capture that type5 of a periodic expense.6 MR. SCHAEFFER:	But major capital7 improvements do.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So -- I' m sorry.9 What?10 MR. SCHAEFFER:	MCIs do.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	This is all12 income, sir.	All right.	In the report it captures13 all that.	So this typical owner, ten- unit14 building, it' s $ 55 , 000 a year, maximally before15 they have any capital expenses.	All right.16 So it' s nice that -- that you17 spout out 38 cents on the dollar as if it' s  some18 talisman or proxy for wealth but when you look  at19 the real numbers, it' s far from it.20 And these are working class people21 too who own these properties. We' ve had many of22 them testify here.	All right.23 So it' s nice that you want to24 point out some one aspect of our report but  without25 taking it to its logical conclusion, I have to  take2 
2 it with a grain of  salt.3 MR. SCHAEFFER:	Well --4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I appreciate your5 coming down and testifying.6 MR. SCHAEFFER:	-- as I said, I' m7 vice chair of the Metropolitan Council and I' ve8 been coming to the Rent Guidelines  --9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That' s fine.	I10 just wanted to know, sir, if you' ve gone through11 the math.12 MR. SCHAEFFER:	-- Board -- I13 have gone through the math and I know, as of a   few14 years ago, a majority of units, I think it was   7015 percent, are owned by large  landlords.16 So to raise everyone in the City' s17 rents because of a few small landlords is  not18 appropriate.	And the other thing, and I know it' s19 been talked about some, is that any landlord that' s20 not making a fair profit can open their books  and21 get a hardship increase and they all say, oh,  my22 God --23 ( Applause)24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, we' ve been25 through that argument.2 
2 MR. SCHAEFFER:	-- wait, wait.3 Let me finish -- let me finish my  thought.4 They say, oh, my God, a  hardship5 increase, how can I  do that?	They have no problem6 filling out the MCI increases.	They have no7 problem filling out all the other  forms.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	My question didn' t9 invite your further rantings.10 MR. SCHAEFFER:	When it comes to11 opening their books and getting a  hardship12 increase, that' s on the books to protect the small13 landlord who isn' t making a profit.	Don' t raise a14 million families' rents because of a few  landlords15 who don' t open their books and come here and say16 they' re not making a profit.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You know, that18 type of rhetoric is -- it doesn' t hold water.19 ( Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Harvey.21 MR. EPSTEIN:	Yeah, Ken, I just22 want to follow up on the point because I think  it' s23 a really important point that we need to be   focused24 on.25 We' re talking about a million2 
2 apartments.	So I wanted to go back to your  point3 about that most landlords are large property  owners4 and I want you to kind of deal with this myth   that5 all -- that the million units of people who  have6 ten units or smaller, Ken, what' s your experience7 as Met Council, as well as in your  professional8 life?9 MR. SCHAEFFER:	Well, you know,10 most of the landlords we deal with are  large11 landlords.	Some of the small landlords own  a12 number of buildings.	It' s very rare to have13 someone who owns only a small number of  buildings.14 And those people tend to work with their  tenants.15 There' s more of a human relationship.16 I work in Queens.	I' m a legal aid17 housing lawyer in Queens.	I used to be in18 Manhattan.	There' s a tremendous difference.19 Queens people, for the most part, the  small20 landlords are pretty friendly and they don' t --21 they won' t evict the tenants.	But the bigger22 landlords do.23 In Queens we' ve got Lefrak City.24 We' ve got the huge developments and it' s just a25 business just to kick people out.	The poor tax, if2 
2 you put that in, it' s going to kick -- it' s going3 to send people straight to the shelters and  those4 people are just trying to maximize their  profits.5 MR. EPSTEIN:	And the second6 question is, I want to go back to your point of   387 cents for the -- on  the dollar.	I think your point8 is that for a landlord that -- the margin of   profit9 has been growing over -- over the last few  years.10 MR. SCHAEFFER:	Five percent11 increase just since the previous year.12 MR. EPSTEIN:	So based on what13 you' re seeing and what you' re saying is, that the14 landlords across the board are doing better.	And15 since we' re dealing with an across- the- board16 increase, we should take that into account; is  that17 what you' re saying?18 MR. SCHAEFFER	Not just take it19 into account, that should be the main  thing.20 Landlords are doing well as  an industry.	Tenants21 are doing horribly.	Your own study says, the22 majority of rent stabilized tenants can' t afford23 your rent.	Wake up.24 MR. EPSTEIN:	Thank you.25 MR. SCHAEFFER:	Thank you.2

PORTO:	Hello.17 Okay.	So, basically, I hear these18 tenants.	I hear their complaints.	They have good19 complaints.20 I' m a -- I' m a small property21 landlord and, you know, I have a few  rent22 stabilized tenants.	But, you know, some are in23 four- bedroom apartment paying, you know, $ 800 a24 month.	Heat goes up.	The cost of oil goes up.25 You know, I understand if you,  you2 
2 know, have a lot of tenants and that there  should3 be some sort of a balance between a small  property4 owner and a huge property owner -- 38 cents on   a5 dollar sounds like a lot of money if you have   a6 1 , 000 units.	But if you have ten units, it' s not a7 lot of money.8 So, I guess, there' s got to be9 some sort of balance.	This across the board thing10 doesn' t always work.	So I think that what we' re11 looking for over here is a little balance  maybe.12 Right.	That' s all I gotta say.13 ( Applause.)14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.15 Kelley Boyd.16 MS. BOYD:	Good evening.17 My name is Kelley Boyd and I' m a18 technologist working in the City' s Start Up19 Movement.20 I' ve lived in Washington Heights21 for over six years and have become very active  in22 the community.23 As an entrepreneur advocate, I24 believe the biggest problem facing our culture  is25 the unbelievable rents in the City.	We could start2 
2 more businesses and bring more fiscal diversity  to3 the City with better rent  oversight.4 But I believe in a free  market.5 Many landlords have gotten the benefits they  signed6 up for, whether they' ve delivered the value to the7 City that it has bargained for or not.  Full8 disclosure, most of my knowledge and experience  in9 this area springs from my having filed a  rent10 overcharge complaint at HCR.	At this time, that11 claim is still in process.12 Through the experience, I' ve13 learned a lot about what' s happening in my  building14 and in many buildings in  my area.	People are15 fleeing the exorbitant rents and moving  to16 Washington Heights thinking they' re getting a great17 deal, when in reality they' re paying market rates18 and over for apartments that should be  rent19 stabilized.20 The new tenants are unaware that21 the apartments have been illegally de- regulated22 because of the scheming, very well- schooled23 landlords.	Our area is being hit especially  hard24 because we' re a largely residential neighborhood25 that has not seen the turnover of other  areas,2 
2 which means there are lots of apartments  that3 should be in the $ 900 to $ 1 , 200 range but are being4 rented at $ 2 , 000 , $ 2 , 300 and more.5 The landlords know how to work  and6 beat the system, that is supposed to keep  them7 honest, by inflating improvements, by  claiming8 false improvements and just filing false  documents9 with the HCR.10 Even if they' re not lying,11 cheating and stealing, landlords are in an  enviable12 position.	As of now, it was just  reported13 yesterday that Manhattan rents have soared 3 . 514 percent in the last year with median rent at $ 3 , 20015 for a one- bedroom unit.16 Landlords do not need an  increase17 this year at all.	In fact, they are just $ 13 shy18 of an all- time high.19 I do not begrudge anyone  success.20 But I estimate my landlord has collected well  over21 $ 1 million in illegal overcharge in the last five22 years and that' s just in five apartments in my23 building that I know about.24 Add to that, he inherited the25 buildings.	He has no mortgage on them.	In fact,2 
2 he holds them in a trust in Texas to better   manage3 his tax liability so he' s not paying you anything4 at all if he can  help it.	Figure that he owns5 three buildings with another 11 under  management6 and you can extrapolate that that' s a pretty big7 number at year' s end in someone' s account.8 He certainly does not need your9 help increasing rents and making money off  those10 buildings.11 Recommendations.12 Look, I understand and from  the13 guy right before -- I understand that you  guys14 serve a wide variety of constituents and in  doing15 so you must make determinations that are fair  to16 large and small landlords alike, all the  while17 keeping true to the statutes and the spirit  of18 fairness that tenants rely on you  for.19 It used to be impossible  to20 reliably get enough information from everyone  and21 their unique situation.	But in real terms today,22 it' s so much easier.	As a technologist, there are23 ways to better manage the burden of how to  treat24 landlords and tenants fairly in this  process.25 Small landlords who are absolutely2 
2 getting squeezed with increases and outstanding3 building repairs and improvements, should have4 mechanisms in place.5 The RGB should embrace innovation6 and craft a process that allows for some kind  of7 means test for buildings when rent increases are  in8 review.	In my opinion, there should be no  more9 rent increases at all until you have a system  in10 place to do that.11 ( Applause.)12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 Stephen Kamza.14 MR. KAMZA:	Yes.	Thank you.15 Good evening.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Good evening.17 MR. KAMZA:	Oh, sorry.18 Good evening.19 I think that you' ll find it out of20 character for me to say that I actually like  most21 of -- almost all of  my tenants.	I consider myself22 a newer, more modern landlord, one that strives  to23 have a relationship with mutual respect  and24 understanding and a willingness to get  things25 resolved quickly and happily for both  sides.2 
2 Our new, younger tenants that come3 into our building understand that there are  costs4 involved in running their building.	Most come to5 New York City from out of state, with their  parents6 in many cases, and actually have told me they' ve7 heard it' s very difficult to be a landlord in  New8 York City.9 I' m not going to say that we' re10 living in the garden of Eden, but we always  remain11 civil and we try to solve any problems that  might12 arise.	And most of the time we  succeed.13 Small landlords, however, have14 been -- have become a safety net for many   tenants.15 Here are some of the things that we do for   our16 tenants.17 Our building has several tenants18 that can only afford to stay there if in  their19 apartments, if we offer them preferential  rents.20 In fact, we' re giving 13 or 50 percent of our  2821 total apartments, preferential rents.22 We are giving a SCRIE tenant,  who23 has a preferential rent, an additional $ 10024 discount because their Social Security can' t cover25 the amount of money that they could just eat  with.2 
2 I mean it -- they get Social Security, it' s3 actually their rent.	And this is a greatly4 discounted rent.5 We' re giving -- we' ve paid for the6 funeral of a tenant whose family lived abroad  and7 wasn' t able to pay.	She was with us since we  took8 over the building 1996 and paid -- paid her  month9 each month, telling me that if she was 40  years10 younger, she' d jump my bones.	She was feisty11 90 - year old plus woman and always smiled and12 offered us food and tea.	She really just wanted13 some company.	She lived through Philter and14 deserved some respect.15 Early on we installed a  program16 that allows tenants to pay their monthly rent  in17 two payments; one at the beginning of the month  and18 one on the 20 th of the month.	This syncs in the19 way in which they' re paid on a bi- monthly basis.20 I could go on and I' m not trying21 to impress you and I' m not trying to say we' re22 martyrs.	I' m tell you that this, in order for you23 to hear how many small building owners treat  their24 tenants.25 Rent stabilization has created a2 
2 system by which new tenants subsidize older  tenants3 and landlords subsidize tenants that are  struggling4 with multiple issues.	The system is inherently5 unfair to both tenants and landlords,  while6 providing a system that is rampant with  chicanery7 and unfair to landlords in many  areas.8 I' m not going to have to finish9 the rest of this.	But I' ll go on and I' ll just10 give you a few examples, you  know.11 We have incredible expenses.12 Being that these are older buildings, these  are13 small walk- up buildings.	There are two of them.14 There' s 14 .	They' re all rent stabilized.	We' ve15 never de- stabilized any apartments, you know, taken16 any action on any of the  apartments.17 We' ve got good tenants but they18 don' t like any extra charges.	A perfect example is19 when we put new smoke alarms, which we  were20 mandated to do, it cost us $ 45 a unit to put  the21 smoke alarms.	We -- we didn' t even send out bills.22 We just told tenants that there' s a $ 25 fee.	Two23 tenants paid immediately.	The rest haven' t.	And24 the rest don' t want to.	And what they say to  me,25 very honestly, is the old smoke alarm worked  fine.2 
2 Why would you change it?	Why are you billing us3 more?4 I can go into the  technical5 reasons but I' m not out to ruin a relationship  for6 $ 25 .	I' m not out to ruin a relationship when  a7 tenant breaks a window because there at a party  and8 somebody broke the window.	I' ll pick up the $ 200 .9 When Sandy came and we lost  a10 whole slew of windows, we fixed those, of  course,11 right away.	But I don' t know where these expenses12 all come, you know, off the  bottom line.	And it' s13 just like --14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Kamza, I' m15 going to have to ask you to start to wrap   up.16 MR. KAMZA:	Okay.	I' ll wrap up.17 So many of our apartments in the $ 600 to $ 70018 monthly rent, giving us a 4 or 2 percent   increase19 on the, you know, really just doesn' t begin cover20 our expenses if we want to run a safe,  secure,21 properly heated building, which we do want to  run.22 Small landlords need to be  treated23 differently than large landlords.	We desperately24 need a minimum increase for the low paying  tenants25 in our buildings.	As a small landlord who  treats2 
2 his tenants with properly and professionally  and3 leans over backwards to avoid conflict, we need  you4 to give us some relief.5 I appreciate you giving me  the6 time.	And I can answer any  questions.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And we8 appreciate you coming in.9 ( Applause.)10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for13 your testimony.14 MR. KAMZA:	Thank you.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	What would you16 say would be your minimum rent increase for  these17 low rent tenants?18 MR. KAMZA:	Well, very honestly,19 there' s a core of tenants that never leave our20 building.	They' ve been there since probably the21 ' 50 s, I believe.	And their rents are, I  think,22 $ 613 for an apartment, up to $ 720 .	And that' s not23 including -- that' s include -- these people don' t24 get -- the ones that I' m talking about don' t have25 SCRIE.	So that' s the actual rent they' re paying.2 
2 You know, I would think that if  an3 apartment' s under $ 800 or $ 900 a month, I' d like to4 get on a two- year lease, $ 50 or something like5 that.6 I mean, the painting costs us7 $ 650 , $ 700 and we do that every three years.	So a8 good part of any increase is immediately wiped  out9 by the painting.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Um- hum.11 MR. KAMZA:	Does that answer your12 question?13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.

EPSTEIN:	I have two quick22 questions for you because I totally hear  what23 you' re saying and the tenants in the ' 50 s -- are24 they rent stabilized or rent controlled,  those25 tenants who' ve been there since the ' 50 s?2 
2 MR. KAMZA:	We don' t -- all of our3 rent controlled tenants passed away over the  last4 five years.5 MR. EPSTEIN:	I -- because I  just6 -- because you said the ' 50 s.7 MR. KAMZA:	So it' s all rent --8 it' s all rent stabilized.9 MR. EPSTEIN:	Okay.	Because if10 someone' s in the ' 50 s, they could be rent11 controlled if they' d been there since the ' 50 s.12 MR. KAMZA:	Yeah.	No, they' re --13 they' re -- these are rent --14 MR. EPSTEIN:	They' re all since15 the ' 70 s.16 MR. KAMZA:	-- everybody' s rent17 stabilized.18 MR. EPSTEIN:	Right, right.19 And so you said that the  people,20 some people have low rents; right?	Are you21 concerned about the people who have low rents  in22 small landlord' s buildings like yours or are you23 talking about the property owners who have  hundreds24 or thousands of units who also might have  low25 rents?	Are you talking about you, together, or  do2 
2 you distinguish between you and a large  owner?3 MR. KAMZA:	No.	I' m in4 Greenpoint, basically.	That' s -- and I' ve been in5 Washington Heights.	Most of everybody I know  is6 small.	They have buildings that are 10 s, 14 s, 6 s.7 It depends on the configuration.8 MR. EPSTEIN:	Right.9 MR. KAMZA:	They' re the actual10 same size building but it depends how the  architect11 configured them back in 1900 or 1910 .12 MR. EPSTEIN:	But we' re talking13 about increases that could affect a million  units14 across the City.	So if it' s a large property owner15 who may own small buildings but they have  thousands16 of units in their portfolio, are you  suggesting17 that we treat them the same as we' re treating  you?18 MR. KAMZA:	No.19 MR. EPSTEIN:	How do you think we20 should distinguish it?21 MR. KAMZA:	I think you should --22 you know, that' s -- that' s a Solomon- like question.23 But I think that -- I think there should be a   size24 of building or some, you know, some kind of  a25 determination like that.2 
2 MR. EPSTEIN:	Yeah.3 MR. KAMZA:	You know, in other4 words, if it' s a building under 20 units, I' m just5 throwing out a number, 20 , 24 units, I think  there6 should be two -- a segregation of somebody,  you7 know, if you have a 300 - apartment building, it' s8 different than if you have a 20 - apartment or a 109 or a 12 or whatever  its.10 MR.

My commute20 is about an hour- and- a- half each day in both21 directions.22 And the reason I showed up  here23 tonight is because most people in my peer  group,24 many are in their young 20 s, some are older,  some25 in their 30 s.	We spend our times working at  our13 
2 product, trying to live the American dream,  being3 New Yorkers -- young 20 s, you know -- whatever --4 or commuting.5 In the case of many of us, we' re6 not a represented voice at these hearings. And  one7 thing I just kind of want to bring your  attention8 to is, I can' t afford to live close to work  right9 now.	I' m, you know, trying -- like I' m taking  a10 risk.	I' m trying to, you know, have more increased11 equity, less salary, living the American dream,  you12 know, building our economy but I have to commute  an13 hour- and- a- half a day to do so because rent is, if14 you' ll excuse the phrase, too damn high in the15 City.16 That' s a complaint that every17 tenant has ultimately but the connection I want  you18 to realize is that when -- when you have, you   know,19 in the most extreme cases, like four- bedroom rent20 controlled apartments owned by one person.	I can' t21 live in that.	I have to live in Brooklyn  and22 commute a lot longer.23 And, ultimately, I can' t take the24 administration seriously and Michael Bloomberg' s25 claims to be, you know, doing what it can to   foster2 
2 the growth of the tech sector in the community  when3 I' m spending it on the subway instead of,  actually,4 at my start up.5 And more generally, that time of6 commuting, that' s time that I' m not spending like7 going to the movies.	It' s time I' m not spending8 checking out all the great culture New York has  to9 offer.	It' s time I' m not spending dating and10 spending money on restaurants and drinks  and11 whatnot.	It' s dead time lost.	It' s dead money12 lost.	It' s dead productivity lost.

But instead of enjoying my14 retirement, as I thought I would be doing, I   am15 forced to look for work and find odd jobs here   and16 there to supplement my income to make ends  meet.17 Why?	Because I pay 62 . 3 percent18 of my income in rent and have very little  money19 left over for other life necessities.20 So I' m here tonight, first of all,21 to voice my outrage at the Rent Guidelines Board' s22 attempt to disenfranchise me by deciding to  limit23 my right to participate in the process  of24 determining whether or not landlords should  get25 another rent increase.9 
2 This was because they had only  one3 hearing here in Manhattan, which is  inconvenient4 for me and hundreds of other people in the  Bronx,5 Brooklyn, Staten Island and in  Queens.6 I am also here to protest in  the7 strongest terms possible, its proposal to award  to8 another indecent and outrageous rent increase  to9 undeserving landlords.	And to propose that the10 Rent Guidelines Board implements a rent freeze  for11 at least the next two  years.12 There should be no rent  increase13 for undeserving landlords until they take  concrete14 action to fulfill their obligations set forth  in15 the warranty of habitability statutes.	There16 should be no rent increase until the  landlords17 reinvest more into making the building safe  and18 habitable.19 Freeze the rent where it is for  at20 least the next two years.	That is the very least21 that the RGB can do.	And that is the just  thing22 for you to do.23 Another rent increase would have24 the most devastating consequences for those of  us25 who can least afford it.	Families are already2 
2 being displaced at an alarming rate and  communities3 are being destroyed.	The RGB should, for once, do4 the right thing.	For the the first time since  its5 inception, the board must do what is just and  deny6 these undeserving landlords another increase.7 You must stop being a  facilitator8 of the landlords, grab for greater and  greater9 profits at the expense of tenants, families  and10 communities that are being disrupted and11 disadvantaged with families bouncing from  shelter12 to shelter, parents facing the loss of their  jobs13 due to poor attendance and children unable  to14 attend school regularly.15 Do not reward them for  violating16 the warranty of habitability.	Do not reward them17 for doing less than required to provide clean,  safe18 and habitable apartments.19 Freeze the rent.	No rent20 increase.	Freeze the rent.

TORRES:	Good evening.25 Thank you.2 
2 Good evening.3 My name is Grace Torres.	And I' ve4 lived in the Bronx for 39 years and in my   current5 apartment for 35 years.6 I am the president of my tenant' s7 association and a CASA leader. CASA is  an8 organization for safe, clean, affordable9 apartments.10 My landlord is Steven Finkelstein,11 better known to housing advocates as the MCI  king12 of the Bronx.13 I am here today to give a voice  to14 so many tenants that are being terrorized by  greed15 stricken landlords that are unscrupulous and  will16 do anything to force tenants out of  their homes.	I17 say homes because these are  our homes.	They --18 these are not just apartments.19 In 2008 we were punished by  the20 RGB with a $ 45 increase for living longer than  six21 years in our apartments.	Since then, we have been22 charged multiple MCIs that have raised our rents  by23 more than $ 340 plus the RGB' s yearly increases.24 Landlords that are collecting MCIs25 should not get City rent increases.	This is not2 
2 about landlords' taxes, water, sewer rate or  energy3 rates going up.	This is greed, pure greed.4 These large real estate companies5 are getting tax abatements, rent subsidies  and6 other state and federal funds to offset their  cost.7 And they are still passing these increases on  to8 tenants by using the loop holes in the State  laws.9 What these landlords are doing is10 legalized racketeering that would have made  Al11 Capone proud and Bernie Madoff look like a  saint.12 ( Applause.)13 MS. TORRES:	What is happening in14 New York City is no mistake.	This is to do away15 with the remaining stock of rent stabilized  housing16 left in New York City.17 New York City rents are  higher18 than other cities and the RGB has always cited  to19 raise rents.	And this year that it has  suspended20 outer borough hearings is just another reason  why21 we should get rid of the RGB and reinstate  the22 Urstadt Law to New York City, the City that  pays23 the majority of State taxes compared to any  other24 New York State county.25 This board is out of touch  with2 
2 the needs of New York City tenants.	Enough is3 enough.	We want a rent freeze  now.4 ( Applause.)5 MS. TORRES:	Not next year.	Now.6 Enough is enough.7 When is my subsidy that I  receive8 for my apartment going to need another subsidy  on9 top of that one.	Because the -- the greed of  these10 landlords is never sustainable.	It' s never11 sustainable.12 And for the small landlords, yes,13 I feel for them.	But like the gentleman said,14 there are hardship laws for them.	What about us?15 Where are our hardship laws?	They don' t exist.16 ( Applause.)17 MS. TORRES:	We ask you to defend18 our rights, which you were voted onto  this19 Guidelines Board to do.20 Thank you very much.21 ( Applause.)22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.23 Harvey.24 MR. EPSTEIN:	Thank you very much25 for your testimony.2 
2 I want to ask you about the  June3 5 th, people' s Rent Guidelines hearing.	I want to4 -- tell me what your experience was having  a5 hearing in the Bronx at New Settlement  Apartments,6 what did that mean to you and other CASA  members?7 MS. TORRES:	Well, since the Rent8 Guidelines Board decided to disenfranchise, we9 decided to have our own hearing, at which  the10 turnout was immense.	We had over 200 people  and11 tenants that didn' t know how to testify, had never12 testified, got empowered by seeing us testify  at13 that hearing.	And most of the tenants were  in14 tears.	A lot of them don' t know their rights.15 They' re immigrants.	They cannot speak English.16 When they get these letters from17 their landlord owners, they' re at wits end.	A lot18 of them are losing their apartments because they' re19 being dragged into the City Housing Courts,  stating20 that they owe money when, in actuality, they don' t.21 They' re being blackmailed and terrorized.	They' re22 being sent to Social Services to get a one- shot23 deal, whether they qualify or not.24 So it' s like hand over fist,25 either you give me my money or I' ll run you out  of2 
2 town.	And that' s what these communities are3 facing.4 I, myself, have a learning5 disabled child.	And I am being punished.	I have a6 one- bedroom apartment.	He needs his own room but7 even with a Section 8 voucher, I can' t afford  it.8 Landlords don' t want it.	And I understand some of9 their reasoning.	But the fact remains that my  son10 needs to be part of  a community.	My son does not11 do well with change.	And I' ve provided a home, a12 roof over his head for 35  years.13 And this is not going to  end14 because some greed stricken landlord wants  to15 continue to abuse the system.	We' re not gonna be16 thrown under the bus.	Enough is enough.17 Thank you.18 ( Applause.)19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.20 Ms. Torres, another question.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I applaud your22 work and I applaud your voice and I applaud  what23 CASA did up on college -- College Avenue in  the24 Bronx to get that -- that building out  from25 underneath that landlord into some competent  hands.2 
2 I think what you' re doing is great3 for your community.	I think what you' re doing is4 great as -- as an example for what can  be done.	I5 just want to applaud you for  that.6 MS. TORRES:	Thank you.7 Thank you very much.8 ( Applause.)9 MS. TORRES:	I mean, I understand10 the plight and I had a very good landlord   before11 this landlord came in.	And, basically, this12 landlord has tentacles.	He is also the one  that13 brought the ten Mill Bank buildings in the  Bronx14 and was touted as a savior.	Those current15 buildings now are being hit with MCIs, even  though16 he promised not to do  MCIs.17 He didn' t want to accept any18 federal subsidies so that he can displace  those19 tenants also.	So this is who we' re speaking about.20 There' s a larger picture in the21 equation and it' s not just small landlords.	And22 I' m tired of the real estate industry touting small23 landlords and using them as an example so  they24 could get away with more increases.25 Thank you.2

CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.( Applause.)CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	BeverlyMS. CREIGHTON:	Hi.	I' m Beverly
7 Creighton from the Bronx.8 I live at 1240 Woodycrest  Avenue,9 the worst building in the Bronx.	The worst10 landlord in the Bronx.11 This landlord is a crook.	He does12 no repairs and he hires perverts, so- called13 maintenance men to do the job.	Right now it' s two14 -- excuse me, right next door to me, the -- and   the15 plasterer.	I need my apartment to  be repaired.	I16 have a leak in my bathroom for  two months.	He has17 not sent the plumber.	And you know why, he is  a18 pervert.19 They come to the building to  have20 sex with the tenants in the building and do  not21 have a TA because he does not want them in   the22 building.	And I have never, since 2007 , gotten my23 leases on time.	He has harassed me for six  years.24 And he is a nasty  bastard.25 When he come to the building  for7 
2 two reasons, to collect rent in cash and to  throw3 you out of the building.	Exactly my point.4 And the super, is -- he is  no5 better than the landlord.	I asked him for my6 lease.	I have asked him for my lease three  months7 -- three months out.8 His select tenants, the ones  who9 came into him get theirs first.	Why do I have to10 have to wait for my lease and I  pay rent.	I' ve11 been there since 1972 .12 My mom passed in 2007 and this  --13 he is greedy.	He needs to not get no  increase.14 He' s undeserving.	He deserves zip with a kick  in15 the you know where.	And he' s just nasty.16 And when he comes, he -- he  hides17 his face from the tenants.	And last week, my18 neighbor next door, because she' s been to court and19 took him on.	He threw her out of the  building.20 And I have heard from my  friends21 downstairs that he is threatened me.	If I call 31122 he will evict me.	He has said that to her.	And to23 me -- to tell me if I call 311 .24 And you think he deserves an25 increase?	I think not.2 
2 Thank you.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.4 Sheila Garcia.5 MS. GARCIA:	Good evening.6 I' m Sheila Garcia.	I' m an7 organizer with CASA.	I am here on behalf of  all8 the tenants who couldn' t make it.	All the9 buildings that I organize, I am here on behalf  of10 all the 200 people who attended that hearing  to11 show the RGB that we needed a rent  freeze.12 I am here representing Raul  Perez,13 who has a homebound wife and can' t leave his14 apartment, who is on a fixed  income.15 I am here representing Eloca16 Sanchez, here because she has to work two jobs  to17 support two children who she never  sees.18 I am here representing so  many19 tenants who we work with who can' t afford their20 rents because of these increases.	This increase21 will mean people going back into  shelters.22 Eloca came to me and called  me23 because she couldn' t attend our hearing because she24 was working, just to tell me, please, make  sure25 that you know that I am there in spirit because   I2 
2 am working two jobs to be able to pay the   rent.3 And, yes, it is a  preferential4 rent because the landlord knows no one who lives  in5 that building with those conditions, with  those6 security risks, will be paying any more.	It is a7 preferential rent because they can' t pay any more.8 And we are asking for a  rent9 freeze because if he decides that he' s going to10 charge her market rate rent, she will be back  in11 the shelter system for another two years,  floating12 around.	We can' t have this happen.	We cannot13 destroy any more families and communities.14 We had our hearing there with  5015 tenants testifying and community members showing16 that there -- there is a possibility that you  guys17 would have more than 29 people testifying one  day18 if it was better advertised, if it was at a   time19 and location when people had access  to.20 If there was -- I understand  that21 you put it on the Community Boards but there are   --22 there are literacy issues.	You could, you know,23 there could be a bigger effort for tenants to  be24 able to do this, to come to these  things.25 I am here also to tell you  that2 
2 the outer boroughs are really important.	And the3 fact that no one, other than the  tenant4 representatives showed up to hear these  testimonies5 is -- is just awful.	Tenants felt empowered but6 they wished that you were all there to see  them.7 They wished that their videos would have  been8 played today.9 I am here just to tell you  that10 these tenants, this means the $ 40 or $ 50 that11 landlords are asking of an increase, will  mean12 whether people can stay in their  apartments,13 whether they can buy food, whether they can buy  a14 coat in the winter for their children,  whether15 people are getting their prescriptions filled.16 This is a big deal.17 It is not -- these are not  people18 who are, you know, somewhere outside of where  you19 can' t see them.	They come to me every day.	They20 come to all of us.	They' re here and they care and21 they wish they were here.	But they can' t be22 because they' re working.23 I -- I hope that you will  consider24 the testimony from tenants who are speaking  on25 behalf of me.	I came to this country and I  lived2 
2 in an apartment and in a building that I   thought3 that was normal.	And now I can actually say that  I4 can help tenants not live in the conditions that  I5 lived in.6 And I hope that you will  consider7 the awful conditions that people have to deal  with8 every day and not give them an  increase.9 Thank you.10 ( Applause.)11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Harvey.12 Ms. Garcia, there' s a question for13 you.14 MR. EPSTEIN:	Thank you so much15 for all that you do.16 And I want to -- I appreciate  your17 testimony and appreciate what you did.18 We' ve heard a lot of statements19 from small property owners today saying, you  know,20 we' re struggling. Six, eight units, ten21 unit- landlords, were saying they' re not -- they' re22 not making it.23 So what do you -- how do  you24 respond to those when you' re asking for a rent25 freeze?	How do you respond to those  property2 
2 owners and say, we want a  rent freeze?	Do you3 distinguish between big landlords and small?	What4 do you -- what do we do as a Guidelines Board   to5 kind of deal with this problem with tenants who  are6 struggling and it seems legitimate some  small7 property owners are struggling as  well?8 MS. GARCIA:	I think that it' s9 true.	Everyone is struggling, right, with  the10 economy and the way that the things are  going.11 But landlords who have huge12 buildings, are not struggling the same as  landlord13 who don' t -- who own one or two buildings;  right.14 We understand that.15 But we also think people should16 live in decent housing.	And when I go into  an17 apartment and I see a leak that looks like  a18 waterfall, I don' t think that' s acceptable.	And I19 don' t think that landlord, regardless of large,20 small, deserves an increase.	I think that there21 should be a rent freeze and that there should  be22 acknowledgement to all of the violations that  are23 actually existing in all of these  buildings.24 MR. EPSTEIN:	Thank you.25 MS. GARCIA:	Thank you.2

CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.( Applause.)CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:		Hannah Ceja. MS. CEJA:	Hi.	My name is HannaAnd I' m working for CASA, the
8 organization that brought about the people' s Rent9 Guidelines Board hearing.10 And at this hearing we had  this11 petition which the 200 people that came to --  we12 passed it around and they signed.	And I' m just13 here to read it on behalf of  them.14 In the absence of an outer  borough15 hearing or a hearing with late evening hours  to16 accommodate working New Yorkers, tenants of  New17 York City organized a public hearing on June 5 th.18 All of the members of the  Rent19 Guidelines Board were invited, yet only a few  chose20 to attend to hear tenants' testimonies in  response21 to the proposed increases.22 We, the undersigned, are rent23 stabilized tenants of New York City.	We were here24 on June 5 th to testify.	Where were you?	How can25 you decide on an increase without hearing  our8 
2 voices?	We will not be able to testify on  June3 13 th because the location and timing of the only4 hearing you established are prohibitive.5 We, the undersigned, do not6 support the range of increases in rents  determined7 at the preliminary vote.	Those preliminary8 increases are completely unacceptable.	We oppose9 this increase because we are already  significantly10 burdened by our rent.11 In the Bronx, 40 percent of  the12 renters already pay more than half of their  income13 in rent.	Increases of this nature will cripple  our14 ability to live.	Our landlords get increases in15 monthly payments through their many other  ways,16 MCIs, IAIs, washing machines and AC fees,  et17 cetera.	All of these charges are things that  we18 have to pay on top of our rent in order to   provide19 funding to the landlord to run the  building.20 Our landlords are not doing their21 jobs.	They are not responsive to our  concerns.22 Many of us have to organize to get basic  repairs23 and respect.24 We believe the Rent Guidelines25 Board is out of touch with most of New York  City' s2 
2 rent stabilized tenants.	The lack of outer borough3 and evening hearings and the unacceptably  high4 proposed increases are evidence of  this.5 I' d also like to add that we' re6 currently doing surveys of specific apartments.7 One of these is the Chestnut Holdings  apartments8 and I' ve actually personally gone to see people9 whose -- who have rat droppings on their rugs  and10 whose -- their ceilings and their bathrooms,  even11 though they' ve been plastered over before, their12 bubbling and the same with the floor, even  though13 the tiles have been replaced.14 Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.16 ( Applause.)17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Question.18 ( No response.)19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is there anyone20 else in the room right now who wishes to speak  who21 did not register?22 Okay.

2 MR. GADINSKY:	My name is Charles3 Gadinsky.	I am a small property  owner.4 I want to thank you for letting  me5 speak this evening.6 I' m here to talk to you about my7 20 - unit building in Flushing, Queens.	I have8 tenants paying -- I have a tenant paying me $ 851 . 369 for a four- bedroom apartment and another paying me10 $ 748 . 35 for a three- bedroom apartment.11 Because these tenants live in12 their apartments for 30 plus years, I am  constantly13 having to make repairs to these apartments and  the14 rents they pay do not allow me to do what needs   to15 be done to these apartments.16 The rents these tenants pay are17 probably 50 percent below market.	I have very nice18 relationships with my tenants.	One of my tenants19 in apartment 4 B, who can barely walk up to  the20 fourth floor, I actually offered her a one- bedroom21 apartment on the first floor, renovated, for  the22 same rent she' s paying now so I can free up  the23 three- bedroom apartment to get more of a24 substantial rent.	And her response to me was,  is25 that she' d love to move downstairs but she takes  in2 
2 boarders in the other two  rooms.3 The four bedroom apartment has4 three families living in it.	The parents had the5 lease.	It was passed on to  their son.	They moved6 out of the country.	They came back to the country.7 So now they live in  the apartment.	Their son and8 daughter- in- law and daughter and son- in- law live in9 the apartment.	So they, basically, have three10 families paying a rent of $ 851 . 36 .11 We definitely need a low  rent12 subsidy.	It is so important and so crucial for  us13 to be able for us to provide the services that   our14 tenants definitely need.	This hearing is not about15 landlords who do not provide services.	There are16 City agencies out there to go to for  that.17 The majority of housing in  New18 York City is provided by small landlords,  as19 myself, who provide all services and  have20 violation- free buildings.21 I have low income tenants who  get22 their increases get picked up by SCRIE and DRIE  and23 other agencies.	I have never lost a tenant to  a24 rent increase.25 In the Rent Guidelines Board2 
2 annual survey of 2012 , the increases were deemed --3 the increase in costs were deemed to be 2 . 84 percent.	And we received a 2 percent increase  for5 a one- year lease and a 4 percent increase for  a6 two- year lease.7 In 2013 , you deemed it to be 5 . 98 percent, more than double 2012 ' s.	Being that it is9 double our -- being that it has doubled, I   would10 expect that the increases for the coming year  on11 the rents would double to 4 percent for a  one- year12 lease and 8 percent for a two- year lease.13 I feel very bad for the  people14 here that are sitting in the room who  have15 landlords who do not provide them services.	But16 most of us do provide services to our tenants,  good17 services.	And we need these minimal rent  increases18 in order to keep our buildings  running.19 And, again, according to the20 board, the cost to run our buildings has doubled  in21 the past year and I think, at least, we should   get22 double the increases for the coming  year.23 Thank you very much.24 ( Applause.)25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.2
