PILAR DOWNING:	Hi! Good13 afternoon.14 I'm from Downing Reality.15 MS. HOLDER:	I'm sorry. Where16 are you from?17 MS. PILAR DOWNING:	Downing18 Reality.19 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.20 MS. PILAR DOWNING:	Although I21 represent small property owners, I am speaking   on22 behalf of the many hundreds of thousands of rent -23 stabilized tenants who are suffering year  after24 year devastating results of the decisions of   this25 Board.9 
2 The guidelines of 4.5 and  7.53 percent , as approved last year, when applied  to4 apartments over the market value,  are5 devastating.6 Tenants, mostly young single,7 young professionals,  often young families,  are8 forced to relocate when a 4.5 percent or a  7.59 percent increase is put on the renewal   leases10 when these leases rent for over  $1500.11 But often they are compelled  to12 go out to faraway places from their jobs  where13 they feel they will find , and eventually they  do14 find ,  more  affordable housing.15 On the other hand, tenants in16 the very same buildings renting exactly the   same17 space but who have been in occupancy for  many,18 many years are suffering very little by your   4.519 and 7.5 percent increases.20 These tenants, unlike the other21 group of high rent -paying tenants, are usually22 middl e - aged people with well - established23 professions and who can well afford an   increase24 in their rents.25 It is time for the Board to  look2 
2 in depth into this situat ion. We are asking for  a3 serious consideration of an increase,  a4 substantial increase, on renewal leases for5 apartments below $1000, and even a  higher6 increase for apartments which we have in  our7 sector of tenants below $500, while we  can8 consider a lower increase for apartments  between9 $1000 and $1500, and no increase at all , perhaps10 a little increase of one or two percent , or no11 increase for apartments above  $1500.12 Thank you for your attention.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 Mary Osborne.17 MS. MARY OSBORNE:	Good18 morning, all.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good morning.20 MS. MARY OSBORNE:	Good21 morning, all , Chairman Marvin Markus and Members22 of the Rent Guidelines Board.23 My name is Mary Osborne and  I24 live in Upper Harlem on 120th Street in a  SRO.25 For more than four years now I have stood  before2 
1	1532 this public forum in solidarity with other  SRO3 tenants requesting that this Board vote for  zero4 increases for SROs and hotel  tenants.5 I am a low- income, regulated6 tenant protected under the hotel stabilizat ion7 provisions and a Social Security  disability8 recipient.9 I have been a victim of10 harassment by the hands of my landlord.  My11 landlord has engaged in a pattern of  behavior12 designed to force me to give up and vacate  my13 dwelling of eleven years.14 For three years now my  landlord15 has tried to convert and renovate my SRO  building16 by demolishing and working on the room  above17 mine. This work goes on all day and  sometimes18 after five p.m. On Easter Sunday of this  year19 work commenced past 9:15 in the evening,  making20 it very difficult for me to enjoy Easter  dinner.21 A couple of years ago my22 landlord applied for a Cert ificate of No23 Harassment that , if granted, would have enabled24 her to change the reconfiguration of my  building;25 in other words, change the SROs into  apartments,2 
2 perhaps making them unaffordable.  She was  denied3 this Certificate, yet she continues to do   illegal4 work.5 During this past severe winter  I6 suffered because of deprivation of heat and  hot7 water. I kept a log of all of the times I  called8 HPD and made a complaint using the City' s 3 119 hotline. Every time an inspector came out to   my10 building they were greeted by the super  who11 conveniently put the heat back on making it   seem12 that I had made this up.13 I have tried to put up with  the14 landlord and the superintendent that she  has15 hired and the intolerable abuses that I have   had16 to live with. Sometimes these tact ics and abuses17 become extremely difficult to ignore  without18 becoming emotional or tormented. The landlord has19 continued to interfere with my comfort , peace  and20 quiet that every tenant should enjoy in  their21 home.22 Now, I want to say one  thing,23 Chairman, before. I'm not disrespecting all   of24 the Members of the Board.25 June the 3rd I came into  the2 
2 building. Everything was quiet . I laid down in  my3 bed at 6:15. There was no work going on. When   I4 got into bed , a explosion came in to work on the5 ceiling like a TV drop. Three times, boom,  boom,6 boom. My heart raced. I had to call 911.  They7 admitted me in City Harlem, Harlem City  Hospital ,8 for chest pains.9 I stayed in the hospital  two10 days. While I was gone, they went in my  room.11 They split the ceiling. They tore the  ceiling .12 Two days later I got a  certified13 letter saying go to the post office stating  that14 I was a threat to the tenants in the  building15 because I left gas on and wat er running. And  I16 want it to stop.17 I want the Board to know  that18 you vot e zero increase because I'm not going  to19 let nobody force me out.20 Two times in my life,  one21 landlord on 12lst Street , another one on  120th,22 two t imes being forced out because a landlord23 wants the building and they want to harass  me24 out.25 Please, Board ,  I'm not yelling,2 
2 but I'm just torment ed by this landlady abuses3 and her superintendent watching twenty- four4 hours.5 If I go to court , he - - bang, he6 put on a power drill - boom. Scared  me.7 If I go to the community8 bathroom, he knocks on the  radiator.9 Nobody lives in the building  but10 me. I'm the only tenant besides the owner and   the11 superintendent.	I'm the only tenant.12 And this is not right , sir.  I'm13 not going to be - - I'm fifty- eight years old. If14 I was dying in that building, I want this  Board15 to know that I have been tormented by  a16 superintendent and I'm the only tenant. And   they17 are making all these claims stating that I'm  a18 threat to a building where there' s tenants there,19 just to force me out.20 If I die in that building,  I21 want this Board to know that I stood here  today22 in front of the Rent Guidelines Board to  note23 that I have been harassed into the point that   I'm24 tormented. And this is not  right.25 Twelve o'clock I'm laying in  my2 
2 bed. Boom, boom! My heart take off. My heart   is3 going to be strong. I'm not going to let   nobody4 force me out of my home.5	So, sir, thank you for allowing6 me to go beyond my testimony. And God bless   all7 of you. And God bless SRO tenants, our West   Side8 Law Project.9 (Audience part icipation.)10 MS.

2 COUNCILMEMBER MELINDA KATZ:	Mr.3 Chairman, I have handed in testimony. With   your4 permission I'd rather not read my test imony but5 just talk about from the heart what I  believe.6 I'm not only here as a7 representative of Forest Hills, Rego Park,  Kew8 Gardens, but as you probably know,  everyone' s9 parents at one time probably lived in  my10 district.11 But I am also here as the  Chair12 of the Land Use Committ ee. And it is our job as13 the Land Use Committee to place housing all   over14 the City of New York and rezone it. And in  that15 the Mayor and the Council have both been  very16 concerned  obviously  with  affordable  housing .17 So I would like to just put  into18 context some of my  thoughts.19 The Mayor has put about  $320 billion into affordable housing in the last   few21 years. Every single rezoning we do takes   into22 account how much affordable housing there will   be23 in that area. And as such, there seems to be  a24 real understanding by the Administration  and by25 the Council of the need for people to  live2 
2	someplace at affordable  places.3	At this point it seems to  me4 that what the City is going through in  keeping5 sales tax on clothing for the folks that  actually6 need sales tax to come up the most , the fact  that7 we have Section 8 vouchers now that are not  being8 handed out because HUD is redefining  and9 recalculat ing the formula , and they have10 basically  stopped giving out the vouchers  right11 now because we don' t know what the formula  is12 going to stand for, the fact that peopl e are  not13 building now because they don' t have faith in  the14 Section 8 housing, and just all of the cuts  that15 this City is making to the agencies,  to16 education, to the senior programs, to programs   of17 social welfare that we need all over the City,   I18 just don' t think that is now the best t ime for us19 to be raising the rents for the folks that  need20 it the most.21 And I really just wanted to  put22 that into a little bit of  context.23 Homelessness  is this City has24 gone up immensely. And the fact of the matt er  is25 that even the Social Security checks that  have4 
1	1602 gone up, and they go up I believe it 's a certain3 percentage every year, but it averages out   to4 about $48 a year, there is no way that the  people5 that live in my district can actually keep  up6 with those prices.7 It would be my suggest ion that8 this year especially we really have a  zero9 percent increase.10 We don' t know where the budget11 is going. The Mayor wants to give back a  $40012 rebate to Class 1 homes. The City Council has  a13 rebate program of their own to try to  counteract14 the Mayor' s rebate program. And in the end we15 really should be spending the money for   services.16 But ultimately everyone  agrees17 that there is going to be a $3 billion  deficit18 next year.19 So it seems to me that with  the20 budget so much in flux and our economy going   we21 have no idea where, and the fact of the matter   is22 that the seniors' Social Security never seems   to23 go up enough, because I got to tell you in  my24 office, every single time we do it in Albany  -25 and I was an Assemblymember before I was  a2 
2 Councilmember	- every single time we raised  the3 SCRIE it seems like Social Security just goes  up4 that much so that the people cannot actually  make5 it. And it seems to be the tradition of  what6 happens every year.7 So as a Councilmember from  an8 area I believe that has the most rent  regulated9 tenants in the entire Borough of Queens, I  would10 ask that the Board really does a zero  percent11 increase this year.12 Thank you very much13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 Sharon Barnes.16 MS. SHARON BARNES:	Hello!17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hi!18 MS. SHARON BARNES:	Many19 people, especially tenants, think of landlords   as20 rich and often mean.21 The owners of small  stabilized22 buildings  that  I know, including myself ,  are23 struggling with rising costs and rents that  just24 don' t cover the cost. And we also make a real25 effort to maintain our buildings and  our2 
2	businesses.3	Alt hough the recent runup in4 real estate values has created paper profits  in5 some cases, my specific situation is  different.6 With increased assessments and rates our  real7 estate tax has gone up twenty- five percent. Given8 the harsh wint er, our oil bills almost doubled.9 El ectricity has gone up signif icantly. So has10 water and sewer.11 Insurance has almost doubled12 with the sidewalk and terrorism  provisions.13 Plus all the City regulations  on14 lead paint , sidewalks, now Fire Department15 inspections, all of these things cost  additional16 money. The Fire Department  inspection alone  costs17 $675 when the HPD inspection used to cost   $110.18 So even though my tenants'  rents19 are being subsidized by me and my husband , one  of20 them, for example, has been running the hot  wat er21 into the tub full out , twenty- four hours a day22 since mid -November. And our lawyer, our expensive23 lawyer, tells us there' s nothing we can do about24 this even though it is causing the tenants  above25 not to have enough hot water, not to have   enough4 
2 water pressure.3 I work about twelve hours a  day4 doing repairs, sorting garbage and recycles  and5 responding to tenants' requests. My husband and  I6 do not take vacat ions because we' re afraid of7 being away for fear we might be needed at  the8 building.9 The house is simply not10 producing enough income to cover all the   costs,11 much less professional  management.  So we do as12 much as we can.13 All of our tenants are  people14 with good jobs, yet we subsidize  them.15 The rent increases we  are16 requesting are to help cover the costs of  our17 buildings. They are not excessive in our  view.18 They help to preserve the housing. And we   think19 that they are fair.20 We respectfully request that  you21 grant the requested  increases.22 Thank you.23 (Audience participat ion.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 Any questions?2

GORDON SILVA:Good10afternoon.11Thank you in advance for hearing12my plea. I'manSRO tenant  at 240 West  73rd ,13 formerly known as The Commander Hotel , but now14 The Tempo.15 Back in 1997, the Tenants16 Association was forced to file with DHCR for lack17 of services, a threat ening superintendent and a18 list of repairs that were needed by over a   dozen19 tenants.20 Since then, the owner has  had21 the building empty for the purpose of  converting22 the apartments over to full market. Then this23 happened , a one- and - a-half year remodeling in24 which there were months of consistent  jack-25 hammering, so much that I became sound   sensitive.13 
2 One day I was forced to call  the3 EPA because I could not see or breathe in  my4 hallway. I broke out in rashes and now have  to5 have air cleaners in my apartment .6 When the remodeling ended  for7 the new apartments, they were rented  immediately8 with new tenants who were told many things  that9 were false. They were told either by the  broker10 or represent atives of the building there would be11 a restaurant in the building, the lobby would  be12 finished in a short amount of time. These  never13 transpired.14 Established tenants could  not15 even get to work out in the new gym or to use  the16 laundry room. We were told  by management	that17 it 's for new tenants.18 Now a year later the new  tenants19 had to move cause leases were not renewed.  The20 empty apartments are now furnished and you  can21 rent them on yourstay.com and  hotels.com.22 Today the building is up  for23 condominium conversion at the Attorney General' s24 Office.25 Again, going back to 1997 when  I2 
2 was threatened by a superintendent , I was  then3 again threat ened one more time by a doorman. He4 threatened me physically without provocation.   He5 has also done mean and criminal things to me   as6 writing	" faggot " on a butcher block table.  His7 last quote was " I have to get more tenants out of8 the building. "9 This employee forced me  to10 report him to the precinct , forced me to hire  an11 attorney, forced me to file with DHCR , and now  I12 have to keep records of events for the  agencies13 involved.14 I wish I was getting paid  for15 this. I might be able to afford to  move.16 Unfortunately,	I can't.17 With this kind of  illegal18 activity and treatment of tenants old and new,   I19 ask you in honesty does this business practice20 warrant  an increase?21 I am conf ident you will do the22 just and right thing.23 Thank you very much for your24 t ime .25 (Audience participat ion.)2

TINA BERTE:	I own a small 9 building on 35 Charles Street . And with all the10 increases that we got in taxes, which are in  my11 building which I own have five tenants, and  it's12 $10,118 for real estate  taxes.13 To keep the building it costs me 14	$9,281.28. Water taxes are $1106.10,  and15 professional	fees $3500, insurance is $2963 .16 And this goes without17 miscellaneous  fees, plumbing  and an electrician18 you have to call at all times. And cleaning   the19 building costs about $2000 a  year.20 All of this my expenses  usually21 come - - my expenses for the year was like  $32 , 00022 and my rents of  $35,000.23 I mean that 's no kind of24 investment. And I'm trying to do my  best.25 But with those kind of  taxes15 
2 that we' re getting hit with and insurance and3 anything they want to do, they are going to   ruin4 the City of New York for little  business.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank6 you.7 (Audience participation.)8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We are going9 to take  - -  the stenographer needs a break. We  are10 going to take five minutes.

We  live16 in 74 West 131, one of the buildings,  building17 203 . Okay? We have no heat , no hot wat er,18 sometime no gas and no  lights.19 Finally, they took over now the20 building  and new landlord who will be  - -  the21 rent , for everything. Right now I ask you say  no22 to any landlord don' t care about building  they23 should take care of.24 If you not take care of  your25 building, you are not supposed to increase  the9

I will be14 very, very brief because I'm expecting in a   few15 days, hoping that with several children I  can16 continue to afford to live in New York  and17 represent that which I love and  cherish.18 Clearly we have had a  housing19 crisis in New York City for more than  five20 decades now with a vacancy rate under  four21 percent.22 Many seniors living on  fixed23 incomes that I certainly represent have  had24 enormous diff iculties over the last five to ten25 years responding to your Board' s I think poor13 
  2 decisionmaking  in terms of rent increases.3 It is very, very diff icult for4 those living on fixed incomes and  working5 families to survive in New York. And I urge  you6 in the strongest possible terms to not go with  a7 3 to 7 percent rent increase. I can't say  that8 strongly enough. I would say it in more words  if9 I weren' t so close to having this baby.10 But I must stop there and  simply11 make that strong plea.12 Thank you very, very much.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 We are going to take a five-15 minute break.16 Just to get a sense,  Dawn17 Sullivan will be next , then Barry Rudofsky, then18 Michael McKee.19 (At 12:55 o'clock p.m. there was20 a recess in the proceedings. ) 2122	*	*	*2 32425

DAWN SULLIVAN:	H ,  I11	My name is Dawn Sullivan. I'm12 Chair of the East Side Tenants Coalition,  which13 represents thousands of tenants on the East  Side14 of Manhattan.15 We are very concerned with the16 affordable housing crisis that exists  throughout17 the City and how your preliminary range  increases18 will affect tenants.19 Like many housing advocates,20 I've been coming here for thirty or more  years21 and sometimes I've been tempted to make a  tape22 recording that I could just play each time  I23 come. We make the same points over and  over24 again, yet the Board in general keeps  ignoring25 them.12 
2 You are relatively new,  but3 sadly your vot es to date have been very landlord4 friendly.5 Your own studies show that6 owners are making a prof it while tenants' incomes7 have indeed gone down . The large owner8 organizations  continue to hide behind small9 owners, even hand- picking owners who do have a10 legitimat e low rent .11	Now, when an owner tells of12 their low rents and claims they have not seen  an13 increase in years, that means only one thing  for14 us - the building must have violations  that15 prohibits them from collecting increases .16 In fact , we don' t begrudge any17 hard -working owner who properly maintains their18 building	from filing for a hardship increase if ,19 in fact , they are not making 8.5 percent that20 they're allowed.21 So, please, don' t think we are22 all anti - landlords' making  a profit .23 I just wish you could enact  a24 hardship provision for tenants. God knows  we25 could certainly use one . Tenants are paying12 
2 higher and higher percentages of their  incomes3 for rent and there is no relief in sight .4 New members should become5 conscious of how MCis, Major  Capital6 Improvements, impact on tenants and drive  up7 their rents. The joke for us is the  word8 ''improvement , " because most MCis  should be9 considered maintenance, not an improvement .10 My own building has  recently11 become one of the typical MCI horrors I've   been12 counseling tenants about for years with  the13 owners asking for an increase of $63 per room  -14 yes, per room. And for a two- bedroom apartment15 that would be more than $250 more a mont h.16 Using your own core rent of  an17 East Side apartment below East 96th Street , the18 core rent would be $1262. The MCI now takes  that19 up to $1514. Now add in your 7.5 percent and  rent20 becomes $1627, a total increase of $365,  more21 than enough to drive most tenants from  their22 homes, while also pushing the unit towards  the23 magic decontrol rent of $2000 upon  vacancy .24 The Board assumes that  owners25 actually purchase  items normally used to maintain2 
2 buildings. Yet if you could sit in my chair  when3 I'm doing telephone counseling, you would find  a4 lack of service and poor maintenance	are among5 the top complaints we hear . Owners should have to6 prove they maintain their buildings before  they7 can collect guideline increases.8 In closing, please change the9 hearings so that we have a day and an  evening10 hearing on different dates so you're not  too11 tired to understand what we are  saying.12 Thank you very much.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Barry15 Rudofsky.16 MR. BARRY RUDOFSKY:	Good17 afternoon.18 My name is Barry Rudofsky. I  am19 the Vice Chairman of CHIP, Community  Housing20 Improvement Program, and am a property owner  and21 manager w i t h apartment houses primarily in Queens22 and Brooklyn .23 In reviewing the 2004  Price24 Index of Operating Costs, I was struck by  the25 PIOC projection for 2005, which  predicts2 
2 increased expenses of 3 .6 percent.3 One of the categories of4 expenses that makes up this projection  is labor5 costs, which are predicted to rise 3.5  percent.6 This number is woefully understated  when7 factoring in the additional increased costs  of8 retaining an employee.9	For example, in one of our10 Queens properties,  the cost of providing health11 insurance rose 15.8 percent from 2003 to  2004.12 Worker' s Compensation insurance during the same13 period rose 8 percent.14 More troubling, in the May  17,15 2004 edition of Crains New York Business,   it16 reports that the New York Compensation Board   is17 proposing double- digit increases in Worker' s Comp18 that may rise as high as 20  percent.19 In all , my total costs of20 salaries, health insurance and Worker' s Comp are21 up almost 5.8 percent , almost 160 percent of the22 Board' s prediction,  with apparently more23 increases on the way.24 In the category of contractor' s25 services, the predict ion is an increase of 4.210 
2 percent. Last month, however, I received a   letter3 from my pest control contractor that  began,4 quote, due to the rising cost of  labor,5 insurance, chemicals and supplies, regretfully  we6 are forced to increase our  charges.7 In some buildings the rates8 doubled ; in most buildings the cost was up around9 30 percent. Now, admittedly, pest control is  a10 relatively small part of our annual expenses,  but11 it represents a trend of continued  upward12 pressure on the cost of expenses that have  been13 relatively flat for years.14 My second observation is  that15 the 2004 PIOC Report justifies the 3 .6 percent16 predicted  gain in expenses by offsetting17 increases with the unsustainable  predict ion that18 fuel costs will actually decrease by 8.1 percent  .19 It would seem disingenuous  to20 predict a decline when my cost of #2 oil  is21 actually 22 percent higher in June of 2004  than22 it was in June of 2003. Even a warmer winter   than23 last year will not save us from increased  fuel24 costs for our buildings.25 I believe that all  indicators2 
2 point to a convergence of facts that will  leave3 us with the highest increases in expenses  in4 years. In the past few years, the increases  in5 the  " Big Three"  - that is, taxes, insurance  and6 fuel - have been somewhat mitigated by  flat7 pricing  in other expense categories.8	We are now headed for the  so-9 called Perfect Storm in that the costs of  taxes,10 insurance and fuel will continue to rise at  the11 same time as the costs in other categories  will12 rise.13 Given that the Rent Guidelines14 Board' s own prediction of a 3 .6 percent	increase15 in expenses is based upon a difficult to  justify16 prediction of an 8.1 percent decline in  fuel17 costs and ignores inflationary pressures  in  other18 expense categories, I would respectfully  request19 that this Board consider increases above  the20 range that have been  proposed.21 Thank you.22 (Audience part icipation. )2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 Mr. McKee.25 (Audience participation.)24 
2 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	Good3 afternoon.4	My name is Michael McKee.  I'm5 Associat e Director of New York State Tenants  and6 Neighbors Coalition, the statewide  tenants7 organization that advocates and lobbies  for8 tenants' rights .9 There are two pieces of10 literature that I turned in at the desk  upstairs .11 They are both on "Tenants &12 Neighbors"  letterhead. One is labeled "There  is13 no economic justif ication for any rent increase14 this year ." This is a very familiar set of15 numbers that I have taken from your  reports.16 Every number on this document is from  staff17 reports that were presented this spring to  the18 Rent Guidelines Board.19 Whether you look at the20 condition of landlords, who are  doing21 extraordinarily  well under rent stabilization,22 with net operating incomes that have increased  by23 18 percent in thirteen years, or whether you look24 at the condition of tenants, who are not doing   so25 well, where wages have actually declined in   real5 
2economic terms,every number points to the  need3for a zero rentincrease.4There is a housing  affordability5 crisis in this City that is the greatest we  have6 had since The Great Depression. And a  large7 reason for that housing affordability crisis   is8 this Board granting unnecessary  and overly9 generous rent increases to landlords. And  it 's10 time that it stopped.11 (Audience participation. )12 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	I want to13 talk about two other things.14 One is the special guideline  and15 the other question of guidelines for  different16 categories of buildings which Mr. Zelnik  has17 raised.18 I appreciate Mr. Zelnik' s19 attempt and interest and intellectual interest   in20 addressing these issues, which are  complicated.21 The ideal system would be a building - by- building22 system where you would look at the needs of  each23 building, very labor intensive, very  costly.24 But if the rent guidelines25 system has any virtue at all in it and it doesn' t5 
2 have many, that virtue really is its  simplicity.3 And I would urge you not to adopt  bulkanized4 guidelines varied by borough or category  of5 housing.6	Finally, there is another piece7 of literature that I've submitted. This is  a8 document that I presented to the Rent  Guidelines9 Board four years ago and that I presented to   you10 two years ago. It 's called "The Problem with the11 Special  Guideline	- A History. "  I would strongly12 urge you to read it.13 I really have the feeling  that14 most Board Members don' t understand what they' re15 vot ing on with the special guideline. And I think16 that 's why the pro- landlord members of the Rent17 Guidelines Board have been able to skew  this18 formula in such a way to make it  meaningless.19 And it may not be the  most20 important issue. It 's certainly not as important21 as the guidelines themselves. But I would  urge22 you to read this document about the  special23 guideline. And I would welcome the  opportunity24 between now and Thursday to discuss that with   any25 Member of the Board who would like to know   about7 
2 it.3 Thank you very much.4 (Audience participation.)5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 Ms. Holder.7 MS. HOLDER:	Excuse me. Thank8 you, Mr. McKee, for testifying  today.9 There has been a lot of10 discussion today by some of the  owner11 representatives who test ified or owner12 constituency about a longevity increase,  although13 they placed it in people who come in later  versus14 people who come in earlier into tenancies.   There15 all these different names for  them.16 Well , could you talk to us about17 a longevity  increase, and  - -18 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	Yes. What19 we call the senior citizen increase or  senior20 citizen surcharge.21 I think it would be  incredibly22 destruct ive. I would hope that the Board would23 reject it.24 I would point out to you that  a25 lot of these ideas, like the poor tax, get  raised8 
2year after yearafter year. And even though  they3get voted down,eventually they get five  votes.4This was the experience we  had5 with the poor tax which got instituted into  the6 rent stabilization, into the rent guidelines,  for7 seven years under Mayor Koch and then seven  years8 under Mayor Giuliani.9 And whatever else you  think10 about that , I think it was a very destructive11 policy . I think you can't just  lightly  say, well ,12 the longevity tax isn't going to  pass.13 Studies show that even  in14 unregulated markets long- term tenants get a15 discount. Even in unregulated markets. This is  -16 - you know, there' s no argument about this.17 Of course, long- term tenants pay18 less than more recent arrivals. That is,  you19 know, a function of the market in an  unregulated20 rental market and it 's certainly the function of21 our rent regulation system, although I think,   you22 know, the real problem is that landlords  are23 allowed to jack rents up too much on  vacancy.24 The problem is not that25 landlords aren't allowed to raise rents on long -5 
2 term tenants. The problem is they are allowed ,3 you know, to jack up rents when apartments  turn4 over .5 So I would strongly urge you  to6 reject a longevity - a senior citizen  tax.7 MR. PAGAN:	Mr. Chair?8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. Mr.9	Pagan.10 MR. PAGAN:	Mr. McKee, before I11 asked one of the owners to talk about if  they12 have seen issues such as tenants paying for  their13 own heat and hot water.14 Have you seen that and what  is15 the future of that?16 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	I think17 that there are more examples of  that.18 Yet up until recently it 's been19 very rare in New York City. It 's more common in20 Westchester where the Westchester Rent  Guidelines21 Board in most years adopts a lower  guideline22 where the landlord does not pay for heat or  hot23 water because if it 's factored into the24 guidelines and the tenant actually pays it , then25 obviously those tenants should not have to  pay10 
2 for heat and hot wat er in the form of a rent3 increase.4 I understand Con Edison has  had5 a demonstration program to convert to  all6 electric. And some landlords have used  that7 opportunity to install individual meters  in8 apartments  so that - - in fact , I think  you're9 going to hear today from some tenants from 4510 First Avenue who live in an all electric  building11 and they pay their own heat and hot water.  The12 landlord doesn' t pay it.13 So certainly I think it would  be14 a wise move for the Rent Guidelines Board in  New15 York City, if you do adopt a guideline, which   I16 hope you will adopt zero, but if you do adopt   a17 number that is higher than that , I would reduce18 it for buildings where the landlord does not  pay19 heat or hot water.20 MR. PAGAN:	The prior owner21 who  - -  owner rep who answered  it indicated that22 that wasn' t allowed by DHCR. Do you have an23 idea24 MR. MICHAEL McKEE :	That it was25 a what?2 
1	1942	MR . PAGAN:	It wasn' t allowed.3	MR . MICHAEL McKEE:	I don' t4 know. The Westchester Rent Guidelines Board  has5 done it repeat edly.6	MR . PAGAN:	Yes. I'm sorry. I  -78	MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	And no one9	has even ever sued or - -  and certainly  DHCR10 MR. PAGAN:	It ' s not only the11 building you mention, but also we have 340   85th12 Street which has the same problem.13 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	I think14 there are more buildings being converted  where15 the tenant pays the individual heat and  hot16 water.17 MS . HOLDER:	There are18 throughout the City  absolutely.19 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	Yes.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Yes. Go21 ahead .22 MS. HOLDER:	Mr. Mc Kee, you've23 had years and years of experience with the  New24 York City Rent Guidelines Board as well as  rent25 guidelines boards  in other counties.10 
2 If you had to make3 recommendat ions to us on how we can improve this4 process within the conf ines of the law that has5 been given to us, as mandated , what would those6 be as this Board looks forward in trying  to7 improve this process?
8  9	legislation? 101112
MR. MICHAEL McKEE:I mean - -MS. HOLDER :	Yes. MR. MICHAEL McKEE:
Absent- - what
13 procedures you could adopt?14 MS. HOLDER:	Yes.15 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:
Well , I've
16 discussed with the Chairman the proposal  to,17 instead of having this day- long marathon hearing,18 which everyone hates, and which I think  has19 limited usefulness, to have nightt ime hearings in20 different neighborhoods  in different boroughs.21 I think you would have  - - and ,22 you know, people come here and sit for six   hours23 waiting for their number to be called and  then24 get discouraged and leave, or they come  here25 after work and never get  called.13 
2 And it 's very frustrating. We3 have a great difficulty now getting people  to4 come to these meetings because  it is such - -   you5 know, people remember how unpleasant  an6 experience it is.7 I think you would get a better8 picture of what 's really going on out there in9 the market if you went to  different10 neighborhoods.	I remember a few years ago  the11 Rent Guidelines Board held this hearing at  the12 Schomberg Center in Harlem. You had a  very13 different kind of cross- section of the14 population,  certainly in terms of tenant leaders15 testifying at that hearing than you normally  have16 here.17 (Audience participation .)18 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	So I would19 propose that next year you not have a day- long20 hearing, you have at least three public  hearings21 in the evening in at least three  different22 neighborhoods  in three different boroughs.2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Go24 ahead.25 MS . HOLDER:	And perhaps given24 
2legislation - -3MR.MICHAEL McKEE:You are not4even taking a lunchbreak .5	MS. HOLDER :	Perhaps even given6 legislat ion, what would you then recommend as an7 advocacy - -8	MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	Well , we've9 proposed legislation that would change  this10 process  and the  - - we would  change the11 qualif ications for public members of the Board ,12 to add , in addition to housing  experience ,  public13 service or non- profit organizations.14 We would mandate the15 discont inuance of the Price Index methodology.	In16 fact , our bill would bar the use of a Price Index17 methodology, which we believe, no matter how  much18 you refine it and finetune it and hone it , it is19 one- sided because it looks at only one side of20 the prof it equation, meaning it looks at21 landlords' operating  costs.22 And we would mandate that  every23 landlord of rent stabilized apartments, as  they24 do in the suburbs, which is done  administratively25 by the way, it 's not in the law, that every9 
1	1982 landlord of rent stabilized apartments file  an3 annual  Income  and Expenditure Report	- -4 (Audience participat ion.)5	MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	- - directly6 with the Board.7 And I think that would be a  much8 more meaningful	and fair and balanced9 methodology.10 I think the Price Index11 methodology  skews this entire process .12 By the way, I refuse to say  PIOC13 because every time someone up there says PIOC,   no14 one in the audience knows what you're  talking15 about .16 (Audience participat ion. )17 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	So - - and18 we would also move the guidelines year  from19 October 1st to January 1st and the setting of   the20 guidelines from July 1st to October 1st to  give21 the Board more time because you would have  to22 collect and analyze and produce aggregate data  of23 income and expenditure, and that would take  more24 t ime than a July 1st schedule would permit.25 In the suburbs, some suburban6 
1	1992 count ies you have a much smaller universe.3 Westchest er is the largest . But New York City,4 you are talking about , you know, 25,000 maybe5 20, 000 schedules that the Board , the staff ,  would6 have to process.7 Unfortunately, this bill that8 was pending in the City Council has now  been9 mooted by the action of the Legislature and  the10 Governor last year in ending the last vestige  of11 home rule power that the City had , the Mayor and12 the City Council , and basically tightening the13 Erstadt Law. And there is no seeming chance  that14 this legislation is going to move in Albany  at15 least until there are some changes in  the16 election hopefully this November,  in which case17 we might find the State Senate might be  more18 responsive to a number of things that they  are19 now stonewalling.20 But those would be our21 proposals.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 Thank you, Mr. Mc Kee.24 MR. MICHAEL Mc KEE:	Thank you.25 (Audience participation .)2 
1	2002 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Rose Wolf ,3 followed by Councilmember Brewer, followed  by4 Regina Shanley, followed by Lisangel  Giulleme.5 Rose Wolf.6 MR. ROSE WOLF:	Good afternoon.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	If you could8	get closer to it.9	MR. ROSE WOLF:	Pardon?10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Get close to11	it.12 MR. ROSE WOLF:	Now?13 THE REPORTER:	More.14 MR. ROSE WOLF:	More?15 THE REPORTER:	Right close to16 it .17 MR. ROSE WOLF:	Okay.18 Members of the Rent  Guidelines19 Board:20 My name is Rose Wolf. I'm  a21 small property owner. It would not  - - if I   would22 not be managing the property, the return would   be23 - - totally disappear due to the double - digit24 increase in the real estate tax, insurance,   fuel25 and general maint enance.12 
2 The income of the real  estate3 tax on landlords is the greatest revenue  producer4 for the City. They are going to kill the  goose5 that laid the golden egg at the rate they  are6 going.7 I just would like to tell  you8 about a case in court that recently happened   to9 us.10 The landlord/tenant court11 discourages the landlord to take act ion. A  case12 in point that happened to us recently. The  tenant13 did not answer the five-day notice,  the14 dispossess from the warrant. However, at  the15 expiration of the warrant the tenant scheduled   a16 date in court claiming he did not understand   the17 increase and needed a Mandarin  Chinese18 interpret er.19 In Queens the Mandarin Chinese20 translator only works on Wednesdays  and21 Thursdays. So we could not get the interpreter   on22 Wednesday after spending the whole day in  court .23 We came back on Thursday,  but24 the tenant was late and again, after waiting  a25 whole day, we had to postpone it to the   following2 
2	week.3	The Law Secretary, the judge' s4 Law Secretary, the tenant appeared in front  of5 the judge' s Law Secretary and the tenant claimed6 he had no money and he wished to move out  but7 needed more time, which was  granted.8 The landlord was out of  rent9 from October through February in the amount  of10 $12 , 616 , plus $885 in court and legal fees,  and11 the apartment was left in  shambles.12 I also heard some tenants are13 claiming that the tenants cannot afford the  rent.14 They can go to have their rent subsidized by  the15 Senior - -16 A VOICE:	No, you can't.17 MR. ROSE WOLF:	- - Citizen Rent18 Exemption.19 (Audience participation.)20 MR . ROSE WOLF:	- or Section 8 .21 And I don't believe that the tenants should be  a22 social service department .23 Thank you.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 (Audience participation.)4 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Councilmember3 Brewer.4 COUNCILMEMBER GALE BREWER:5 Good afternoon.6 My name is Gale Brewer.  Thank7 you, Mr. Markus and all Members,  particularly8 Adriene Holder, who was a real hero to all of   us.9 I am Gale Brewer and I represent10 the West Side of Manhattan and the northern  part11 of Clinton. And I think that our district has   the12 second largest stock of rent regulated  apartments13 in the City of New York.14 I'm very proud to represent  this15 district.16 I know that you've heard  from17 tenants and owners here today. But I'm  here18 particularly	to echo the sentiments of  the19 tenants.20 During the last three years  in21 office I have watched , you know, some economic22 downturn become a very challenging  situation  in23 terms of those who want to work in the City  of24 New York. Jobs are hard to come  by.25 The economy, despite Wall3 
1	2042 Street , continues to shrink. Last year 55,0003 jobs were lost and the unemployment rate is  still4 over eight percent.5	I assume we have a very  large6 number of people who are homeless and I think  you7 know that without my telling  you.8 And it is a difficult  time9 because of the recess, but also because of  many10 factors.11	I know that one of them is in12 our district , and that 's the Mitchell - Lama13 situation. In our neighborhood we have  twenty-14 two Mitchell - Lama' s. And I will tell you that I15 have personally been part of five  conversions.16 We've done everything we can to make sure  that17 the individuals living in those apartments do  not18 get evicted and that they are able to cont inue  to19 rent the apartments.20 But there are many different21 ways of doing that. Very few are rent  stabilized,22 some go under the program that  Brenadiere23 pioneered  called the Landlord Assistance	Program,24 and some have enhanced Section  8.25 But then there' s a whole group12 
2 of vacant apartments that end up on the  market.3 What I'm telling you is that  as4 these Mitchell - Lama' s become privatized,5 hopefully the Mayor' s bill will pass in Albany6 and all of the apartments will be  stabilized.7 But in every case this  is8 another group of residents who make  our9 neighborhoods whole and who are the backbone   of10 our neighborhoods. And it's another example  of11 where we need to keep any increase  - -  I prefer  no12 increase  in the Rent Guidelines Board  - - but  any13 increase to be as low as  possible.14 It 's a very frustrating15 experience to see these apartments  become16 privat ized buildings.17 But steep rent increases  would18 make  these  former Mitchell - Lama apartments19 unaffordable  for many of the tenants.20 I just also want to quickly21 mention residential hotels and single  room22 occupancy buildings.  I know you've heard from23 Anne Cunningham and others here today. This is   a24 group of tenants who live in our  community.25 There' s no question that behind the fancy facade2 
2 of the Lucerne Hotel or On the Avenue or  many3 other buildings are a group of  residential4 tenants.5 And I feel strongly that  they6 should get zero increase. The individuals  coming7 and going from those buildings who are  not8 permanent , who  are transient , definitely  provide9 a serious revenue enhancement for the  owners.10 So I just want to talk about  the11 fact that the Rent Guidelines Board, which has  a12 wonderful website and a very good staff , I  think13 should take into account that the recession  is14 upon us. Yes, we've had a very large increase  of15 property tax, but we've also had buildings   over16 and over where there is a mixed high- income,  even17 though it 's stabilized, off the market. And these18 buildings continue to do  well.19 So I urge you not to raise  any20 rents as we prepare to go into this  rent21 guideline season.22 And I want to echo23 A VOICE:	Time.24 COUNCILMEMBER  GALE BREWER:25 Michael McKee' s words.2 
2	Thank you very much.3 (Audience participation.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The following5 four people: Regina Shanley, followed by  Lisangel6 Giulleme, followed by Claire Dockery, followed  by7 Alistair Economakis.8 Regina.9	MS. REGINA SHANLEY:	Good10	afternoon.11	My name is Regina Shanley. I12 live in a rent stabilized apartment in  the13 Sunnyside Woodside area of Queens. I'm also  on14 disability.15 Recently I received a  small16 check as a gift. When I called the person  who17 sent it to thank them,  I mentioned	I bought Tide18 with it. She was disappointed because she  wanted19 me to buy something personal or a treat  for20 myself.21 The person doesn' t live in New22 York and doesn' t rent an apartment and it was23 diff icult to explain that in New York after24 paying your rent buying laundry detergent  could25 be considered a nice personal thing for  yourself.12 
2 I never mentioned that with  the3 rest of the check I bought toilet  paper.4	Housing is essent ial. It is5 important  - -  it is as important  as education and6 health care .7 The U.S. Department of Housing8 and Urban Development defines affordable  housing9 as costing thirty percent of a household' s10 income. In New York City this is pretty much  a11 joke as people routinely pay fifty percent  or12 more of their income for rent .13 The joke isn't funny, however,14 for people on fixed incomes, senior citizens  on15 Social Security or people on disability who  can16 pay eighty percent or more of their income  for17 rent as I do.18 I feel betrayed  by my  local ,19 State and Federal government.  Politicians,20 bleeding heart liberals,  compassionate21 conservatives and all those in between, pay  lip22 service to wanting to help people  with23 disabilities but do nothing.24 The government 's annual cost of25 living adjustment doesn' t cover actual increases5 
1	2092 in the cost of living, particularly rent .3 This politically- appoint ed Rent4 Guidelines Board  is composed of  - -  seemingly a5 majority believe that the dwindling income  of6 tenants should have no bearing on the  increases7 in rent.8	It feels as if the government  is9 saying you worked at a low- income job and got10 old, or you got sick, the hell with  you.11	This Board, if it has a heart12 and conscience , can help not only seniors or13 people with disabilities, but also  struggling14 families and low- income workers.15 Please vote for a rent  freeze.16 Thank you.17 (Audience participat ion.)18 MS.

I have lived in3 rent stabilized apartments since the program  was4 introduced in 1964 to protect New York  City5 residents from rapidly escalating  rents.6 There is no need for an  increase7 in rents this year . Owners refuse to open their8 books so that their claims of increased  expenses9 can be verified , and they refuse to do so year10 after year.11 The exorbitant rents charged  by12 owners make it difficult for people,  especially13 those just moving here and the elderly, to  live14 in New York. In the complex in which I live  a15 family of four - parents  and two children  -   live16 in a very nice four-bedroom  - - one -bedroom17 apartment , nice but not for four peopl e. They've18 been looking for a larger apartment for  months.19 I look into the building next20 door and I see six young people living in a  two-21 bedroom apartment . And it often seems like that22there are alot more than six people living23there.24Where do we expect teachers,25nurses, allthose people who serve New York  City
2 to live if unnecessary rent increases  continue?3 Do you want those who take care of you and  your4 children to commute hours before they get  to5 work?6 I am a single old person whose7 income is better than that of half of  the8 families over sixty- five, yet I pay thirty9 percent of my income for rent , and that does not10 include ut ilities. My rent has increased fifty11 percent since I moved into my current apartment ,12 but my income and prices in general have  not.13 We all read about how the14 homeless population is increasing and I see  more15 and more people sleeping on the steps of  churches16 and in the subways as I am sure you all do.  And17 there was someone sleeping out under the  monument18 today as I walked over here .19 But enough of the hardships20 increases cause renters. If increases  are21 necessary, why will owners not open their  books?22 The Price Index does not reflect the expenses  of23 owners. I do not recall hearing about many  owners24 going bankrupt. Information provided by the  Rent25 Guidelines Board indicates that owners are  making2 
2	healthy prof its as they do year after year.3	Please, be fair to renters.  No4	rent increases this year.5	Thank you.6	(Audience participation.)7 MS. KAUFMAN:	Thank you.8 Alistair Economakis.9 Alistair Economakis.10 MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:	My11 name is Alistair Economakis and I am  representing12 property owners.13 Your decision today is very14 important as I believe that with the increases   in15 expenses, such as oil , insurance, taxes, and  the16 additional red tape that we' re facing, such as17 the new lead paint laws, the small owners -  and18 I'm not talking about the big owners, I'm  really19 talking about the small owners - are going to  be20 facing the abandonment that we had  in the	'70s21 and	'80s. And I'm not joking here.22 (Audience participation.)23 MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:	And24 this abandonment would not be beneficial  to the25 City as the property taxes won' t be paid and it10 
2 will not be benef icial to the tenants either3 because their buildings will be abandoned  and4 there will be no maintenance.5 The second point I would like  to6 make, and I want to make sure that this is  clear,7 is that a guidelines increase does not mean  that8 all the rents are going to go up by  that9 increase. For example, if you vote on a  seven10 percent increase, it doesn' t mean that all the11 rents in the City are going to go up by  seven12 percent. The landlord is allowed to give  a13 preferential  rent to tenants which he quite  often14 does. So that the high rents may not get  an15 increase at all. And, in fact , what we've seen is16 that some high rents are actually getting  a17 decrease. So you are only talking about  an18 increase on the low rents to try to stabilize  the19 market.20 Finally, one other point I  would21 like to make is that any economist will tell  you22 that putting restrictions on a free market  always23 has problems. And here in New York City we have   a24 perfect example. Most cities in the U.S. , let25 alone most cities in the world, don't  have2 
2 regulations and they don 't have half the housing3 problems that we face here in New York  City.4 So if you are truly looking  out5 for the interest of New York City, you must  vote6 for a significant high increase of at least  ten7 percent or - -8 (Audience participation.)9	MR . ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS :	- - we10 really will be seeing - -11 (Audience participation. )12 MR. ALISTAIR  ECONOMAKIS:	- - or13 we really will be seeing the abandonment of  the14 '70s and	'80s again .15 (Audience participation .)16 MR . ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS :	And17 the final point I would like to make  is18 MS . KAUFMAN:	Please be quiet.19 (Audience participation.)10 
20 MR. ALISTAIR
•ECONOMAKIS:	I
21 would like to request that the Board  Members22 disclose if they live in rent  stabilized23 apartments how much rent they pay. This is  only24 fair because  I don ' t believe that that 's out25 there . And even though I understand the fact that10 
1	2152	they are allowed to be on the Board and live in  a3 non- rent stabilized apartment , I think that they4 should indicate if they do and what rents they  do5	pay .6	Thank you very much for your7	time .8	(Audience participation. )9	MS. KAUFMAN:	Thank you.10	(Audience part icipation. )11	MS. HOLDER :	I have a question.12 (Audience participation .)13 MS. KAUFMAN:	You have a14 quest ion. Ms. Holder.15 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you for your16 testimony.17 You said you are a small18 property owner. How many units do you own?19 MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:20 Personally  - - we have partners  involved  so it 's21 difficult  to - -2 2	(Audience participat ion .)2 3	MR. ALISTAIR  ECONOMAKIS:	- - to24 determine exactly how many units we own  because25 we have partnerships	- -24 
2 (Audience participation.)3 MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:4 and we talk to partners.5	So - -6	MS. HOLDER:	How many partners  -78	MR. ALISTAIR  ECONOMAKIS:	It ' s  9 difficult  to say how many  - - it 's difficult to10 say how many  apartments one owns because  - - we11 can't afford to own a property ourselves. We  own12 properties with other individuals, family  members13 or outside members too.14 MS. HOLDER:	Well , how many15 buildings do you own in  partnership?16 MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:	I17 don' t have that number in my head. I would say - 1819 (Audience participation.)20 MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:21 Personally,  if I can - -  if I'm going to give  you22 a range, I'd say between three and  five.23 MS. HOLDER:	How many units?24 (Audience part icipation. )25 MS. HOLDER:	How many units in19 
2 each building?3 (Audience participation .)4	MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:	How5 many units? Probably an average of twenty  to6 thirty units per building .7	MS . HOLDER :	Okay.8 And where are your buildings9 located? What part of New York  City?10MR . ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS :	The11LowerEastSide.12(Audience participation .)13MS. HOLDER :	They' re all in the14LowerEastSide?15(Audience participation .)16MS. HOLDER:	They' re all in the17LowerEastSide?18MR . ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:	I19can't hearbecause some people are  screaming.20The ones that we own are in  that21area, and ,yes, that 's correct.22I still don 't underst and your23point , but- -24Yes?25MS . ADAMS:	Would  you  say again
2 why it is that you don' t pass increases on to3 your higher paying  tenants?4 MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:5 Excuse me.  Could you - -6	MS. ADAMS:	In your testimony7 you mentioned that , in terms of those who are  the8 high end of the rent scale,9	MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:	Yes.10 MS. ADAMS:	- - that it 's11 possible you did not pass the increases on   to12 them.13 MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:14 Absolutely.15 MS. ADAMS:	Can you tell me why?16 MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:	Yes,17 because the market	- - if we had an apartment  that18 was renting say at $1800, for example, and   the19 tenants vacated that apartment and we tried  to20 rent it - - this is specifically a case - -   we21 could not get $1800 and we rolled the rent  back22 to $1600, because that 's what the market would23 bear.24 So, again, the increase  isn't25 across the board. There are apartments that  will10 
2 not get the increase. And these are  rent3 stabilized apartments too.4 And what we do - -5	(Audience part icipat ion. )6	MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:	is7	we issue what 's called a preferent ial lease.8 MR. PAGAN:	Ms. Kaufman?9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.10	MR. PAGAN:	I just want to know11	from the number of units that you have how many12 are destabilized?13 MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:	How14 many are destabilized?15 MR. PAGAN:	Yes.16 Approximately  what percentage?17 MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:	If I18 had to guess off the top of my head , about  seven19percent orso.20A VOICE:	Oh, my God! Seventy21percent.22MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:	No.23Seven.24MR. PAGAN:	Seven percent.25And in the last year or so  how
2 many of those became destabilized in the  last3 year?4 (Audience participation. )5	MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:	In6	the last year?7 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Quiet .8 MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:	Out9 of that seven percent? I don' t know. Maybe in the10 last year, four or so.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.12 MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMAKIS:	This13 is partly a guesstimate. I don' t have the exact14 numbers here.15 MR. PAGAN:	Thank you.16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 Gloria Friedman.19 A VOICE:	Brothers and sisters,20 it 's very difficult for the stenographer.21 Georgia O'Neill , and then we' ll22 get Gloria Friedman.23 Georgia O'Neill , are you  here?24 Go ahead.25 MS. GEORGIA O'NEILL:	Hello! My12 
2 name is Georgia O'Neill. And I was evicted  from3 my one- bedroom apartment because the rent was  so4 high that I could not pay it . I'm now homeless.  I5 live at George Daly House Shelter on East  4th6 Street. I'm there now for like six mont hs.7 Please do not increase the  rent8 for the rent stabilized apartments. Myself  and9 others need it very badly.10 Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 Catherine Economakis.13 MS. GLORIA FRIEDMAN:	My name14 is Gloria Friedman.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oh, okay.16 Gloria Friedman.17 MS. GLORIA FRIEDMAN :	I've18 lived in New York for eighty- eight years. I'll be19 eighty- nine next mont h.20 (Audience participation.)21 MS. GLORIA FRIEDMAN:	And I22 don' t want to be applauded for that. But working23 with the Retiree Association of District  Council24 #37 and helping the people there with  housing25 problems is what I am dedicated  to.2 
1	2222 The problems are enormous. Many3 of you ask when you have SCRIE, why don't  you4 file for SCRIE. They wait for years before  they5 finally get SCRIE. By the t ime they get SCRIE,6 their rent is already $800 a month.7 The pensions that you think  are8 enormous of City workers are not. They are  small9 pensions because many of the people who  are10 ret irees worked a long time ago and their11 salaries were very low and their pensions  are12 low.13 They live in terrible housing14 most of them. When they ask to get a paint  job,15 they take advantage of old people. They  don't16 give them the services that they need and yet  the17 rents keep going up.18 So they are suffering and19 struggling.20 We know of cases where  landlords21 actually killed the tenants. They got people  to22 kill the tenants to get their apartments.  These23 are documented things .24 So the people who are retirees25 live in fear, have enormous  - -  their rents have2 
1	2232 gone up to $600, $700 and $800 a month. They  are3 suffering  terribly .4 And this Board , which is5 appoint ed by Mayor Bloomberg, a billionaire, we6 hope that you will look into your  conscience,7 your hearts, and your minds, and do not  raise8 rents. In fact , we should have had a rollback of9	rents .10	(Audience participat ion .)11	MS. GLORIA FRIEDMAN :	Roll back12 rents.13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. GLORIA FRIEDMAN :	So we are15 depending on you to do your job, do it well , and16 fight to keep the City of New York human,  livable17 and happy .18 Bye- bye .19 (Audience participat ion .)20 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	I 'm going to21 read the next four speakers: Catherine  Economakis22 -  are you here?  -  Faith Steinberg,  followed by23 John Gallagher, followed by Stacy  Sarver.24 MS . CATHERINE ECONOMAKIS:	My25 name is Catherine Economak is . I'm a property12 
2 manager.3 (Audience participation.)4 MS. CATHERINE ECONOMAKIS:5 Economakis .6 It seems that the theme of7 tenants' sentiments seem to be what the landlord ,8 the Board, the City has done to them.  I9 respectfully remind the Board that  rent10 stabilization is not a need - based system .  Instead11 it is an artificial manner of regulation  which12 wreaks havoc with a free market  economy,13 (Audience part icipation.)14 MS.  CATHERINE ECONOMAKIS:15 art ificially inflat ing free market rents in order16 to support the thousands upon thousands  well17 below market rents perpetuated by  rent18 stabilization, an artificial  system which  fosters19 this misleading victim mentality  and creates  an20 overly burdensome situation for landlords.21 In a system that is  inherently22 unfair where the tenant has the right to cure   an23 illegal sublet after the landlord  spends24 thousands of dollars to prove that the  tenant25 does not reside in the apartment , only to have2 
2 the courts allow the tenant to move back into  the3 very apartment which they were abusing their  rent4 stabilized rights.5 In a system where after the6 landlord spends thousands of dollars and  is7 finally successful in evicting a non- paying8 tenant , the courts force the landlord to place9 that non- paying tenant back in the apartment.10 In an unfair system such as11 this, where the landlord is forced to offer  a12 renewal no matter if the tenant pays their  rent ,13 is in arrears or is in violation of their  lease,14 I do not think it is too much to ask that  the15 Board not allow the cost of living increases  to16 dictat e rents and the increases on these17 renewals.18 We reside in a free market19 economy, and at a time when stabilized  tenants20 are already artificially insulated from  the21 market increases and cost of living  increases22 that affect all others.23 We simply ask that rent24 stabilized tenants share the burden of  this25 massive  increase in operating costs in the  form2 
2	of a significant increase in the rent  guidelines.3	Thank you.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5	(Audience part icipation. )6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 Faith Steinberg. Is that you?8 MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	Yes.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Great.10 MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	Dear11 Members:12 I was listening to some of  the13 specious arguments that one of the  landlord14 members gave for the high percentage rates  in15 rentals for the upcoming period. One of  the16 arguments is that costs have gone up -  insurance,17 oil. But these items are business expenses  and18 are tax deductible. So not only do the  slumlords19 get a tax break, they want to break the backs   of20 the tenants with your help , of   course.21 The other more insidious22 argument is that these slumlords will  abandon23 their buildings. Landlords know that if they  are24 losing money, they can file for hardship.  They25 say it is complicated , but it shouldn' t be an6 
2 easy process.3 The real reason is that  they4 won' t open their books and they won' t open their5 books because they cheat. In my working  days6 (Audience part icipation.)7 MS.  FAITH STEINBERG:	- - I was8 in the arts. But like so many I had to  supplement9 my income. I worked at part - time and temp jobs in10 the business world, usually in accounting, and  I11 was witness to the cheating with my own  eyes.12 But don' t take my word for it.13 Read the daily newspapers.14 Because of my sporadic  work15 history, my Social Security income is low, so   low16 that I don't have to pay taxes  now.17 On the other hand , my  landlord ,18 who bought six dilapidated brownstones on  the19 Upper West Side during the	'50s and renovated20 them in the cheapest way possible, is today  a21 millionaire.22 He moved from our area and  now23 lives in Westchester. Why I, a senior  citizen24 whose income is just above the poverty level   so25 that I am not eligible for many benefits,  should8 
2 have to further fill his coffers boggles my  mind.3 And I am a citizen who gives back to society  by4 doing volunteer work, like tutoring  disabled5 children, among other  things.6 Housing is one of the basic7 necessities  of  life. For the  landlords - -8 (Audience participation.)9	MS.  FAITH STEINBERG:	- - to buy10 up non- luxury housing expecting to earn a11 livelihood is parasitic.	It is unconscionable12 that rents should be raised again,  particularly13 after the draconian percentages you voted in  last14 year.15 Are landlords being held16 accountable for these raises? Are they  improving17 the tenants' condit ions or are they just18 pocketing the money? Have you ever checked  that?19 It is obvious that the majority20 of you do not have a clue as to how  the21 disenfranchised  live. The working poor are being22 squeezed from all directions.23 They are not eligible  for24 checking accounts and have to buy expensive  money25 orders. They are charged more in many of  the10 
1	2292 grocery stores.3 The minimum wage is $5.15 an4 hour and raising rent s as high as possible,5	maximizing prof its is uncivilized.6 Which reminds me  - -7 (Audience participation.)8	MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	- - of an9 interviewer  asking Gandhi ,  "What  do you think of10 Western  civilization? "11	He said: " I think it would be  a12 good idea. "13 Why don't you prove Gandhi  wrong14 and vote in a civilized manner. Vote  zero15 percent.16 Remember, housing is a basic17 necessity of life.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	Also - -20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to21 wrap up.22 (Audience participat ion. )23 MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	Also your24 position on lead is abominable. All I need to   ask25 is if your children  or grandchildren  - -12 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have no3	posit ion on lead.4	MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	- - were -56	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma' am, we7	have no position on lead.8 MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	Well ,9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So10 MS. FAITH STEINBERG:11 involved , would you be quibbling over costs?12 I had a sister who was lead13 poisoned as a child and it is terrible thing   to14 witness, the delet erious effect on a human  being.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We agree with16 that. But we have no position on  lead.17 MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	Thank you.18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.20 John Gallagher.21 Right now we have pink  sheets,22 which is tenants. If there is any owner who   wants23 to testify, you have to sign up upstairs.  There' s24 no more yellow sheets.25 Go ahead , sir.10 
2 MR. JOHN GALLAGHER:	Hi! My3 name is John Gallagher.4 A few asides.5 First , I know we're talking a6 lot about insurance here . But , you know, my7 health insurance has doubled in the last year   or8 two.9 Electricity is included in  my10 rent. All right? I realize that I have  an11 advantage because it is included in my rent.  I'm12 very well aware of that. When I leave my house   in13 the morning, everything in my apartment is  turned14 off because I respect the fact that I have  that15 privilege.16 I've changed my mind about17 something since I've come here today because   for18 people like me rent stabilization probably is   a19 privilege.	It allows me to do the work that  I20 want to do. All right?21 I was very lucky. I just22 finished an engagement at The Kennedy  Center.23 That 's pretty good. At that job I took home $41224 a week. All right? Because I live in  rent25 stabilized housing and I contribute to  my6 
12322communityand I work hard, it allows me to  do3somethinglike that. For me  it ' s a privilege and4I respectthat.5For people on fixed incomes,  for6 people that have trouble earning a living,  for7 people with small children and disabilities,  I've8 changed my mind at this meeting and it is  a9 right. It is a right for people because we  are10 not alligators. We' re human beings.11	Now the market	-  I also work as12 a real estate broker. And the argument , the13 argument that if we got rid of  rent14 stabilization, all the rents would go down,  is15 pretty ludicrous. In the year 2001 there was   an16 enormous amount of housing built in this  City.17 Then 9/11 happened. What happened as a result  of18 that is market value rents, say in Murray Hill ,19 went down from $2900 for a seven hundred  square20 foot one-bedroom to $2200 for a seven  hundred21 square foot one- bedroom.22 Those prices have now gone  back23 practically  to where they were.24 Now, I know people say that  if25 you got rid of rent stabilization, that  everybody12 
2 would only pay $2000. Now maybe that 's true  for3 the first year. But the market would  squeeze4 everybody out until only people that could   afford5 to pay $2900/$3000 a month were left here.  That 's6 economic reality.7 Now that 's what the market8 wants.9 I want to tell you about my  own10 story if I can very quickly. My building  was11 bought in 1996 by a woman who thought she   could12 force us all out. She paid $500,000 for  the13 building. She sold that building on October  3 0th14 of last year for $1.6 million to a new person   who15 is convinced that he can get rid of us  too.16 He' s hired a very expensive law17 firm that specializes in eliminating  tenants.18 He' s claimed it as his primary residency. He  has19 offered everyone to sign six-month leases where20 nobody has been in a lease for twenty years.   So21 now the fight begins again.22 Now she cried for ten years  how23 abused she was. She made a $1.5 million  prof it.24 When she bought that building, her mortgage   was25 about $2000 a month. The rent roll was   $9000.2 
2 So that 's the other side of the3 story.4 People need to be protected  in5 their neighborhoods . People that worked their6 whole lives to raise kids need to be allowed  to7 stay there.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience participat ion. )10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Sarver,11 right?12 MS . STACEY SARVER:	Yes .13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Stacey14 Sarver, followed by Bill Foley, followed by  Terry15 Poe, followed by Father Michael  Tyson.16 MS . STACEY SARVER:	Good17 afternoon.18 My name is Stacey Sarver and  I19 am an attorney at the West Side SRO Law  Project.20 My purpose in coming before you today is to  draw21 attention to the pattern of abusive  behavior22 perpetrated by many landlords of SROs . This23 behavior often escalates when the tenant is  a24 Spanish- speaking , undocumented  immigrant , as many25 of my clients are .10 
2	There is one building in3 particular on the Upper West Side that I will   use4 to illustrat e the ongoing terror that invades5 many of my clients' lives. This  landlord6 routinely threatens, harasses and  intimidates7 many Spanish- speaking tenants. He threatens  to8 call immigration in an attempt to scare  some9 clients out of the building, and in many cases   he10 has succeeded in forcing tenants to move  from11 their rooms into the windowless basement that   is12 overcrowded  with mostly Mexican families.13 Recently, the elevator to  the14 building was turned off. The landlord  claimed15 that the elevator was not working and would  be16 out of service for many  months.17 However, some of my  clients18 learned that the landlord reportedly turned  off19 the elevator in the hopes that , quote, the20 Mexican women would get  tired of	alking up the21 stairs with their children and get  out.22 When my off ice brought a Housing23 Part action in housing court against the   landlord24 to restore the elevator service, the  elevator25 miraculously	started working again.3 
2	Unfortunately,	this landlord has3 successfully harassed a few of my clients to  the4 point where they decided to move out . Once the5 rooms are empty, the landlord is not re- renting6 them to new tenants .7 As his attempt to empty  the8 building continues , the remaining tenants9 continue to bear the brunt of his harassment .10 This landlord and many others like him  already11 wield power over SRO tenants who are  often12 marginalized	in society .13 The Rent Guidelines Board  should14 not give the landlords more power by  increasing15 the rents. A rent increase will not prevent  the16 landlords from trying to empty the  buildings17 through harassment  of tenants.18 For many of my clients who  are19 barely surviving in this harsh economy, even  a20 slight rent increase could push them  into21 homelessness. An increase, therefore, will  only22 serve to aid the landlords in their efforts  to23 empty buildings .24 Why give more power to  landlords25 who do not deserve it?3 
2 On behalf of my clients  I3 implore you to give a zero percent increase   this4 year.5 Thank you.6 (Audience participation.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.8 MR. ZELNIK:	I just have one9 question. I wanted to clarify just one  comment10 you made.11	MS. STACEY SARVER:	Sure.12 MR. ZELNIK:	Did you say that13 there are people living in the cellar of  this14 building at this point?15 MS. STACEY SARVER:	That' s16 correct.17 MR. ZELNIK:	Has the Department18 of Buildings been notified because that 's a total19 violation?20 MS. STACEY SARVER:	Right. I21 understand that.22 We also have to consider  the23 fact that if they are notified and that  the24 peopl e are forced to vacat e, then they would be25 homeless. So I'm not sure at this point  if12 
2 they've been notified about  that.3 But they've been scared  enough4 to leave their rooms to move into it  under5 threats.6	MR. ZELNIK:	Well , there' s also7	a health and safety issue .8	MS. STACEY SARVER :	Right . No.9 I understand that. We are trying to have  some10 contact with those tenants. I've heard  it11 secondhand.12 MR. ZELNIK:	I'd verify that ,13 but  I think  that the Department	- -14 MS. STACEY SARVER:	Yes.15 MR. ZELNIK:	- - of Buildings16 MS. STACEY SARVER:	Right. No,17	I	- -18 MR. ZELNIK:	- - should do19 something about that .20 MS . STACEY SARVER:21 understand that as well .22 Yes, thank you.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Bill Foley.24 MR. BILL FOLEY:	Good25 afternoon.18 
2 I'm Bill Foley from The  Hudson3 Hotel located in Manhattan at Nint h Avenue and4 extending one block from 57th Street to  58th5 Street. It's a boutique hotel with about  8366 tourist rooms and we have about 101  stabilized7 tenants in the place. We occupy about  eleven8 percent of the rooms.9	The bar is a playground	for New10 York night life. And the hotel has been the   site11 of parties for the  top political	figures and12 Hollywood celebrities.  It 's fashionable to be13 seen at The Hudson.14 If you have one of those  sheets15 there in front of you, you will see the effects16 of vacancy decontrol that we have in  hotels.17 You' d see an eye- opening loss of stabilized18 rentals and revenue gains that are far beyond  the19 norms of the rent  guidelines.20 In the top section you would see21 that since 1992 in The Hudson we've lost   9422 rooms. That' s forty- eight percent of the rooms23 disappearing  in just twelve years. Since last24 year, six more rooms are eligible for rental   at25 the tourist rates.10 
2 Now the second section, if  we3 were to substitute a tourist rate of $100 a  day4 for the six vacancies that occurred during  the5 last year, it yields an increase of twenty- four6 percent for the block of rooms that  were7 stabilized just a year ago. It 's a built - in8 annual increase without direction of  Rent9 Guidelines.10 Now, at the bottom, if you had11 the sheet , you would see that for the remaining12 101 stabilized rooms, you would see that  there13 was a revenue decrease of about $3 , 000 because of14 a decrease in the stabilized rooms. But if  you15 add back the six vacancies at the $100 a  day16 tourist rate , that brings it back to a net17 increase of about  $11,000. That ' s a twenty- four18 percent increase for a block of rooms that  were19 stabilized a year ago.20 So because of that , that 's way21 above the norms of Rent Guidelines. And so we   ask22 for a zero percent  increase.23 Thank you for listening.24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Foley, I2 
2 ask this every year, as I understand it , in The3 Hudson case in particularly,	the proviso kicks in4 and, therefore, the tenants that are in  these5 stabilized units have not been paying  rent6 increases; is that correct?7 MR. BILL FOLEY:	Yes. Happily.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank9	you.10 Terry Poe.11 (Audience part icipation.)12 MR. TERRY POE:	Hello! I'm Terry13 Poe. I'm a tenant organizer for the West Side   SRO14 Law Project.15 I don' t really have a prepared16 text for you today. I'm just going to talk  until17 you drag me off kicking and  screaming.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Two hundred19 and forty- six left , Terry.20 MR. TERRY POE:	Pardon me?21 Yes.22 What I wanted to do is  talk23 briefly about a couple of things that have been   -24 - that I've heard brewing about among  Board25 Members. And one is what has just been  alluded10 
1	2422 to, the fact that a lot of people sympathize   with3 the plight of SRO tenants, but , in fact , given4 the proviso that disallows increases for  those5 who are not renting seventy- five percent of  their6 rooms to permanent  tenants, everybody is7 prot ected.8 And I want to just say  that9 that 's not  true and that , in fact , the majority10 of SRO tenants now live in Harlem I would  guess,11 and that in Harlem most of the SROs are more   or12 less fully occupied rooming  houses.13 And the landlords of  those14 buildings are, in fact , eligibl e to take rent15 increases. Do they deserve them? Well , you  know,16 consider this for yourself.17 There' s a building on 126th18 Street , a new owner bought it early last  fall.19 His first act within the first week of buying   it20 was to bang on all of the tenant doors late  at21 night demanding a $50 a month rent  increase.22 The tenants were pretty  tough23 and they refused.24 The next week the landlord  came25 around with two thugs the tenants call them,   and2 
2 again demanding rent increases and said that  if3 he had to come back, people would get hurt  and4 the building might be burned  down.5 A week or so later the  landlord6 and his thug friends came back and broke into   the7 room of a few tenants, stole some money from   them8 and ripped the doors off the rooms and left   those9 tenants to live in rooms that had no  doors.10 The police arrested him, and  I11 know this will please Mr. Lubell if he were   here,12 we did report it to the police, the  police13 arrested him and we had two witnesses will ing to14 testify against him and the case was  dropped.15 The Law Project then filed a  HP16 against the landlord. The landlord default ed  on17 that HP and was then found in contempt of  court18 and still refused to  comply.19 This man is eligible for an rent20 increase. Should he get one? I don' t think  so.21 The other issue is that this  is22 not an atypical situation in Harlem. The   severity23 of the harassment may be atypical , but by and24 large the vast majority of SROs in Harlem  fit25 this particular picture. They are occupied  by2 
2 low- income tenants. The landlords do not take3 care of them and do not deserve rent  increases.4	And ,  finally, regardless  of the5 ethical issues involved, the tenants could  not6 afford to pay increases in either  case.7	Now, I've also heard it  said8 that the Rent Guidelines Board has no  authority,9 no obligat ion to consider questions of10 affordability.  I would suggest that you haven' t11 read the first paragraph of the  Rent12 Stabilization Law if you think that ' s true   where13 it refers clearly to the obligation of the  Board14 to protect tenants from rent gouging in times  of15 housing crisis.16 I interpret rent gouging to  mean17 landlords in a monopolistic  or oligarchic market18 taking unfair advantage of tenants  who19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to20 wrap it up, Terry.21 MR . TERRY POE:	- - don' t have22 the same competitive advantages as they  do.2 3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Thank you.24MR. TERRY POE:Thank you very25much.
2 (Audience participation. )3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Father Michael4	Tyson.5	FATHER MICHAEL TYSON:	Good6	afternoon, everyone.7	I'm here - - my name is  Father8 Michael Tyson. I belong to the Holy Name   Parish9 up on 96th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. And   they10 jokingly refer to me as Mike Tyson. I hope  I11 could knock out the punch that would result in   a12 zero percent rent increase.13 (Laughter and applause. )14 FATHER MICHAEL TYSON:	But I15 can - -  I'm obviously not a landlord. And  so  I16 want to speak on behalf of people who come to   us17 every single day for the bare needs to live   on.18 And we run a thrift  shop , for19 example, and an estimated one thousand  people20 visit this thrift shop every week. And what we   do21 there is we have a nominal fee for  clothing22 articles, furniture, the necessities of life .  And23 we do charge something only to give the person   a24 feeling of dignity that they actually  bought25 something. But we serve about a thousand people   a8 
2	week in that way.3	We serve about two hundred4 people a month, rather two hundred people a  week5 with our food pantry and our sandwich  program6 that we run in conjunction with the United  Church7 of Christ on 93rd Street and  Broadway.8	We have people sleeping on  our9 steps every night. If they can get away with it ,10 they'll stay in the church after we lock it  so11 they can have a better place to sleep, and  we12 have many homeless in the  area.13 We have the Volunteers of14 America who run a family shelter for  homeless15 families on 104th Street and  Broadway.16 And all of these things  are17 happening. The only good thing I think that  is18 happening with all these problems is that it 's19 making the churches come together to do things   in20 common .21 For example, St Ignatius is  an22 Episcopal Church on West End Avenue and  87th23 Street , they run	they have a meal every day24 for peopl e Monday to Friday for people who are25 hungry.9 
2 Then the B'na Jeshurun  Synagogue3 between Broadway and West End Avenue on   89th4 Street has a homeless  shelter.5	The Volunt eers of America, as I6 said, have a building which is about twenty- two7 stories high which houses homeless  families.8 And I was also stationed in  the9 Bronx in Holy Cross Parish. The thing that   amazed10 me about the shelter they run is that  every11 male  -  it 's only males they house  - they house12 fifteen males who have jobs but they can't  afford13 the rents.14 So it doesn' t seem to me that a15 rent increase will help  them.16 We also  - - my sister, who' s also17 a religious sister, workers with Pots and   Pans.18 Pots is part of the solution. They serve  two19 thousand meals every week to peopl e who are20 hungry and homeless. They also have Pans, part   of21 the solution, which offer a shelter to about   five22 males,  showers for anyone who really needs  them,23 and they have an advocacy program where   lawyers24 go to court with people who are being  evicted.25 I am very familiar with the  case6 
2 that was testif ied about before, about the SRO,3 where the elevator was turned off. I had  peopl e4 who came to us. I probably referred them to   the5 SRO West Side Project.6 So I humbly hope that on  behalf7 of these people there would not be a  rent8 increase.9 Thank you.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,11 Father.12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next four14 people are Fred Brue, Cynthia Doty,  Joseph15 Marcona and Susan  Clair.16 Mr. Brue.17 MR. FRED BRUE:	Yes, sir.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.19 A VOICE:	Could you explain what20 method you are using to call  people?21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We alternate22 between yellow and pink. So there aren' t too many23 yellows so if the yellow people show up , they  get24 lucky. And then by number.25 A VOICE:	What do the colors2 
2	mean?3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The owners4 are yellow, pink is  tenants.5 Go ahead.6 The numbers are here. They  are7 in order numbers.8 Go ahead , Mr. Brue.9	MR. FRED BRUE:	Yes.10 A VOICE:	What number are you up11 to?12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	In what13 color?14 A VOICE:	Rent ers.15 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	44 is next .16 A VOICE:	Thank you.17 A VOICE:	Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead , Mr.19 Brue.20 MR. FRED BRUE:	Thank you. I21 appreciate your allowing me to speak to  you.22 As a representative of  the23 owners of one building  in Greenwich Village,24 which we have recently inherited , which for many25 years has been under rent  control/rent10 
2 stabilization in accordance with  the3 requirements, we have still in our midst in  the4 tenants two who are still under rent control ,5 which is an amount that perhaps comes to $10  a6 day for them to maintain a residence in  that7 location.8 I have for many years worked9 with the Knights of Columbus dealing with  the10 necessities of people in our neighborhood.  I 1  m11 aware of the fact that there are a lot of  people12 who need assistance and they should receive  it13 from whatever  agencies  can supply it , Federal ,14 State and the City, as well as groups like  The15 Knights of Columbus who go out and collect  from16 the various food stores that would  otherwise17 throw away good food and distribute it once  or18 twice a week to those families in the area  that19 need that attention. And there are many  such20 areas .21 But to abbreviate whatever  time22 I have with regard to those things would be,  I23 think the important thing in this day and  age24 where I have this building that I 1  ve  inherited25 and spent no money on whatsoever, two tenants  who2 
2 are under rent control , six who are under rent3 stabilization, I ask this body is there  any4 investigation going on regularly to determine  the5 financial condition of these people because  they6 deserve to have everything that anybody else  has,7 but they should not take advantage of the  fact8 that they have income or other assets and  they9 are not paying an appropriate rent for where  they10 are taking up space .11 If we' re supposed to assist the12 City of New York by taking on the burden, some  of13 the burden, of those who are not able to carry   on14 under the economies of today, that 's fine. It15 hasn' t been stated publicly, but if that 's what16 I'm required to do, then I would abide by  that.17 I'm a retired attorney, former Director of  the18 Queens County Bar Association for fifteen or19 twenty years. And I respect all of the laws and   I20 attempt to adhere to  them.21 But when something like  this22 comes to me as a gift , it cost me nothing, but23 I've got tenants who are paying $2000 a month   in24 one apartment , which is maintained beautifully,25 which we have done and spent a lot of money to   do2 
2 since two years ago when my sister died and  we3 inherited this thing, now, although we are  taking4 care of all of the premises, we still have   these5 rent controlled apartments. And I don' t know if6 that' s fair to the City, whether those people7 belong there.8 I don' t know how you can figure9 that out , but  I need the help.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11	MR. FRED BRUE:	Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:13 Unfortunately, we' re not the right place. We' re14 not the right place. That 's operation of law.15 MR. FRED BRUE:	Can you tell me16 which the right place is?17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	There is no18 right place.19 MR . FRED BRUE:	That' s what I20 thought.21 (Audience part icipation.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Cynthia Doty.23 Could we fix that mike so that24 it doesn' t fall?25 That 's it. Thank you.12 
2	MS. CYNTHIA DOTY:	Hi! My name3 is Cynthia Doty. I'm Director of a  community4 advocacy group, a Democrat ic district  leader on5 the Upper West Side, and I'm also a tenant .6	To listen to the testimony  that7 we've heard today from the landlords, from  the8 owners, it 's a typical game of taking a few9 statistics out of context without looking at   the10 total picture.11 It 's interesting that RSA has12 very carefully choreographed to have only a   few13 small owners here to test ify, and we've had maybe14 just a couple of dozen here, and we seem to   have15 run out of owners to  testify.16 I think that says something17 about the picture that they are trying  to18 present. We've heard a lot of pain and  suffering19 going on. And to hear that you would think  that20 the bankruptcy courts in this City would  be21 filled with property  owners.  You would  - -22 (Audience participation.)23 MS. CYNTHIA DOTY:	- - think24 that the real estate industry is the  worst25 business in town, when the true picture is  that7 
2 the real estate industry, the real  estate3 owning property in this City is the  most4 successful business venture  anyone can undertake.5 People have taken money out  of6 the stock market to buy  property.7 (Audience participation.)8	MS. CYNTHIA DOTY:	The property9 owners are expanding. Development is going on10 right and left. Luxury housing is going on  all11 over the City.  It's clearly  - -  there are12 financial incentives to owning property.13 People from all over want  to14 come to New York City. They want  to - -   rich15 people want to come and live here. They' re  buying16 property. And the landlords know that. Even   the17 small buildings,  the brownstones,  are selling to18 market  rates of  - - small brownstones  are quite19 high.20 So the picture that they  are21 painting  is very skewed.22 They are also neglecting to  talk2 3 .	about  the total  income  that  they are making from24 these apartments. They won' t open their books.25 They are not required to open their  books.24 
2	(Audience participation. )3	MS. CYNTHIA DOTY:	So they only4 paint the picture about how their expenses   are5 going up. Operating expenses are going up.  But6 incomes have gone up as well.7 Landlords are also able to  make8 other money from their buildings. And most of   the9 landlords are, in fact , like my landlord. He  owns10 forty buildings. He' s a multi -millionaire. He11 rents the basement of his apartment to RCN   Cable.12 The market rates that have been decontroll ed  in13 the apartment building are going for $8000  and14 $9000 a month. He rents the roof to  cellphone15 antennas. There are professional	suites. There' s16 commercial rent that peopl e get that is17 increasing the total income of property  owners.18 So to side with them over  the19 tenants at this stage of the game seems  morally20 incorrect  for this Board.21 I would also suggest that the22 Board needs to look in context with what  the23 tenants are having to pay. There clearly  are24 expenses in health care and wages aren't  going25 up. There was a rally last week of  15,0004 
2 homecare attendants asking for salary  increases.3 We have teachers without4 increases .5 And yet the landlords  would6 persuade you to increase their income. And  I7 think that is not the duty of this  Board.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience participation. )10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Joseph11 Marcona.12 Mr. Marcona. Coming.13 MR. JOSEPH MARCONA:	I came to14 shed some light on the problems of the owners.  It15 seems that the signs I see - -  I looked to  Mr.16 Bloomberg to solve the problem . The problem is17 not his. If he needs money, he  taxes.18 If these people are concerned19 about the rate, that the rents go up, then  they20 should be demonstrat ing against Mr. Bloomberg to21 keep those taxes down.22 The point is that what he hasn' t23 got control over is the maintenance,  the24 application forms, the requirements.  That costs25 money. And if these people are going to live   in2 
2 any kind of benef it in an apartment , then they3 have to know that those costs have to be  paid.4 If we were to give the tenant5 the apartment for free, who would fix it?  You6 have to know that that money has to come in.  We7 have a lead paint problem coming up now  and8 there' s money that has to be laid out. If that9 money has to be laid out , where does it come10 from?11 You people have to know that  you12 have to prepare the landlord for the  expenses13 that are going to be coming up and the  expenses14 that come up automatically. The tenants are  not15 aware of it.16 The person mentioning that  the17 landlords should open their books, that 's okay18 with me. But I would like to see what the  tenants19 have in the bank also. So the tenants should  open20 up their books against what the landlords  do21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. JOSEPH MARCONA:	- - to see23 what money they are  paying.24 But actually it 's cheap here. In25 California and in some of the other areas,  they2 
2	pay quite a lot more.3	In any event , I want to make4 sure that the Panel would consider some of  the5 expenses that landlords get aside from, you   know,6 what the tenants consider  unfair.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 (Audience part icipat ion.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next10 speakers in order are: Adele Bender, Daniel  Andre11 Czuk, Mary McCune, Michael  Sepe.12 MS. SUSAN CLAIR:	My name was13 called.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What was your 1516 What?17 MS. SUSAN CLAIR:	Susan Clair.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.19 What happened? You're  right.20 Sorry.21 I did something. I know what22 happened. What was your number? Because I  think23 you're actually out of  order.24 MS. SUSAN CLAIR:	145.25 A VOICE:	My number is 69.16 
1	2592	CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Wait , wait ,3 wait. I screwed it up. Go ahead. Go ahead,  Ms.4 Clair.5	Adele, let her go first. Adele ,6 let her go first. Go ahead.7 I did call your name.8	MS. SUSAN CLAIR:	I have copies9 of basically what I'm going to say to you. I   have10 to say it from the paper because I'm nervous.   I11 never had to do this  before.12 A VOICE:	We can't hear you.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You want to14 hold the mike?15 MS. SUSAN CLAIR:	I can't.16 My name is Susan Clair. I  was17 born in New York City and grew up here,  was18 educated in its public schools and I do love   New19 York.20 I live at 220 West 26th Street ,21 New York, New York 10001. I have lived  there22 since December 2001.23 I was very fortunate to be24 accepted as a tenant in an  affordable apartment	-25 -  I kissed the street when I came here  - -  which9 
1	2602 is accessible and very convenient. I moved   from3 Forest Hills where my building was not  accessible4 to me as a disabled person of limited  mobility.5	In Forest Hills I had no heat6 many days in the winter and there are many   heat7 complaints on record. In the ten years I lived8 there my apartment was never painted.  In9 addit ion, it was not even paint ed when I moved10 in.11 The landlord tried to  intimidate12 the tenants. In fact , the landlord has never13 returned my apartment  security deposit.14 I was very grateful to receive15 my new apartment. There is always someone   there16 to open the front door and enable me to gain   safe17 entry into the building. This means a lot to  me.18 Unfortunately,	I am discovering19 that due to the very high rent increases  your20 Board seems to approve, what I thought would   be21 an affordable apartment  is rapidly becoming  more22 and more unaffordable and , frankly, it really23 frightens me.24 I live by myself and have no  one25 to depend on. My income is fixed. In fact , my6 
1	2612 income has drastically decreased since I moved   in3 to this 421A apartment with not much hope for   an4 increase that would equal your proposed  rent5 increases.6 My income does not afford  me7 anything but the bare essentials. And I  really8 mean that. Let' s not kid ourselves.9 My apartment is very  convenient10 for the many medical visits my multiple  sclerosis11 requires. I didn't ask for this disease. It  was12 gifted to me by God.13 It also makes it possible for  me14 to attend the therapeutic classes which the  New15 York Multiple Sclerosis Society generously16 provides  in Manhattan.  These classes make my17 disease more bearable. And if you know  anybody18 with multiple  sclerosis, you know what I mean.19 It 's a very unpredictable disease.20 Please when you make your final21 decision for this year's rent guidelines,22 remember that there are many disabled people   like23 myself who love New York City and wish to be   able24 to cont inue living here .25 I want to just interject2 
1	2622 something else that 's not in here.3 I have many disabilities.  Many4 people may not consider this. I am Jewish, I am   a5 female, I'm a lesbian and many  people6 discriminate against these things. But I'm   lucky7 enough to be living in New York City which  has8 accept ed immigrants from all over the world  for9 years. I was born in Jackson Heights.  That 's10 where they start out.11 And I just want to thank  you12 very, very, very much for your consideration, and13 think of all of the people. Nobody wants to  be14 homeless. And this crisis has been brought on   by15 Mr. Ossam ben Ladin. He has caused trouble to   our16 City.17 And that 's why the government18 has to charge the increases that they  are19 charging. That 's why you pay the traffic tickets20 that you do. Economics is very  understandable.21 I'm a middle child. I understand both sides  of22 the story.23 But please do not let more24 citizens become homeless. I don' t like to  see25 people living on the  street.2 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You live in3	the twenty percent unit in a  80/20?4	MS. SUSAN CLAIR:	Yes, sir. I5 live at 421A, which is even a higher income  than6 the twenty.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	A 421A8 building that was built with certificates?  Is9 that what  - -  I was just trying to figure out  what10 kind of building it is.11 MS . SUSAN CLAIR:	My apartment12 was built in July of 2001. I moved in  in13 December.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is everybody15 in the building in a lower income in terms of  the16 or is it 80/20, twenty  percent?17 MS. SUSAN CLAIR:	It 's 80/20.18 And as I realize, the twenty percent live in   the19 apartments that the other people would not  want20 to pay the money to rent. I live facing an  office21 building.  I never open my blinds, never.22 I spent the last few days with23 my girlfriend who lives in a condominium  in24 Bayside, a gated community, that her daddy  bought25 her. She lives on a trust  fund.8 
2 I don' t. I don' t. But she has to3 answer to what her daddy tells her. I don' t.4 But also she's safe for her  life5 because daddy is going to have that trust  fund6 pay for her rent. My daddy just dropped dead   and7 left me  11  bopkus. 11        You know what I mean,	11  bopkus. 118	My relatives are filthy rich. My9 relatives have the money. I don' t have. And I'm  a10 proud person. I couldn' t ask them for a dime.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right.12 Thank you.13 MS. SUSAN CLAIR:	Thank you for14 your time.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No problem.16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	All right .18 Adele.19 MS. ADELE BENDER:	Another20 reason why SCRIE has to be extended to  the21 disabled.22 My name is Adele Bender. I'm  the23 Queens Borough Coordinator for JPAC, Joint Public24 Affairs Committ ee for Older Adults, and a  member25 of the Citywide Tenants Coalition and the   Queens12 
2 League of the Unit ed Tenants and Met Council.3 Tenants also have  expenses.4 They're called  health,  food , prescription  drugs.5 You know about those  problems.6 I have something from The  Wall7 Street Journal. Certainly I won' t read the  whole8 thing. It 's just snippets. And while the figures9 were taken all over the country, I think  it10 applies very well in New York .11 Older Americans who borrow on12 credit cards are taking on more debt ,  suggesting13 that growing numbers of seniors are struggling   to14 pay monthly bills, according to a new study by   a15 New York public policy  group.16 We are finding that people  are17 turning in droves to credit cards as a way  of18 plugging the hole between their income and   their19 basic costs, which means they get into a   really20 bad financial morass between the fact that  they21 are having trouble paying the rent , having  to22 find the necessity of using a credit card   for23 food and medical bills, and then when they  use24 the credit card , of course, they have to pay  more25 interest . And it 's really a very, very vicious2 
2 cycle.3 I just want to tell you  one4 small story. In my building there is a  nice5 little family, a man and woman. She works part -6 time. He drives a cab. They have two  teenagers.7 He said: gee, now that I got my increase as  a8 cabdriver, I can pay my rent on time. He   says,9 but when I pay an increase, I'm back to Square   A10 again.11 So that 's one story of I guess12 supposed middle  income people.13 The other thing that I did  want14 to bring up is that , you know, I know that15 landlords have their expenses, but they can get   a16 - -  you know, they can get  tax relief.17 The other thing I also wanted  to18 ment ion was the fact that for those people that19 were lucky enough to save during their  working20 years and save some money in the bank, in a   sense21 we are subsidizing the real estate  industry22 because we are getting nothing, pretty  much23 nothing as far as interest rates go, which  makes24 it much more affordable to refinance and  to25 either purchase new property or to  refinance2 
2 property.3 So in a way we are  subsidizing4 those property owners that are complaining  about5 the fact that they are subsidizing  tenants.6 Okay?7 (Audience participation. )8	MS. ADELE BENDER:	So as I say,9 tenants are not asking you not to give us  an10 increase. It is a matter of survival. And  for11 those tenants that could be priced out of  their12 apartments, it is the breakup of a community.  And13 a cohesive community is the fiber and the  fabric14 of a country and of America and of this City.   It15 is really important that the communities are   held16 together, that we know each other and where  we17 can help each other.18 Thank you.19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 Daniel Andre Czuk.22 MR. DANIEL ANDRE CZUK:	My name23 is Daniel Andre Czuk. I own small  property.24 And I would like to address  to25 this panel and who make decision of our   future9 
2 and I would like to say to you to have the  wisdom3 like Solomon.4	And we are asking increase. I 'm5 not asking for outrageous increase, but  these6 expenses that we have had lately and in front  of7 us - - we've just seen how oil price is going up8 and up, insurance , and water promise or announce9 a fifteen percent  increase of cost , sewer.  And10 maintenance also is increasing from day to  day.11 You can't find labor inexpensive.  Whatever12 repairs, it costs a lot of money .13 And you can't do much if  you14 have tenants who is on rent control and pay  $155.15 And if you try to increase the rent , they give16 you such a hard time to you that you give up  and17 stay whatever they pay.18 And I'm asking this Panel  to19 increase  - that 's my  opinion, my proposal  for is20 for a one - year lease renewal  7.5 percent , for a21 two-year  lease  renewal 11 percent	- -22 (Audience participation .)23 MR. DANIEL ANDRE CZUK:	and24 all the rents which are below $700 an  increase,25 my proposal is $30 supplement for one year  and5 
2 $50 supplement for a two-year  increase.3 Thank you.4 (Audience participation. )5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 Go ahead.7 MS. MARY McCUNE:	Okay.8 My name is Mary McCune and I  am9 a staff attorney at the Bronx AIDS Services   Legal10 Advocacy Program. I represent peopl e living  with11 AIDS and people who are HIV+ in civil   proceedings12 who live in the Bronx.13 This is the third year in a  row14 I've come to testify on behalf of my clients.   I'm15 sad to say that none of their concerns  have16 changed. They still live in substandard  housing17 where the walls and ceilings literally fall   down18 around them. They are trapped in their  violation-19 ridden apartments because there simply is  no20 decent affordable apartment to which they  can21 move.22 I often go to my clients'  homes23 because they are too ill to come to the   office.24 The conditions I see frankly are appall ing.25 Several of my clients  have6 
2 problems with mildew covering their  walls,3 resulting in asthma attacks or other respiratory4 problems. One tenant told me how mice jumped   out5 of her child' s dresser when she opened the6 drawer. Another client 's cat was killed by a rat7 in her apartment. One client 's refrigerator broke8 and the landlord failed to fix it for  months.9 Aside from the usual problems of spoiling   food,10 this client had medications that needed to  be11 refrigerated. He had to keep it at a neighbor 's12 house and hope that the neighbor would be home  to13 let him in when it was time to take  his14 medication. My client 's health deteriorated and15 he was hospitalized  as a result.16 I know that when people  hear17 these stories, they think that they are  the18 exception and not the rule, but this has not  been19 my experience in ten years in working in  the20 Bronx.21 My clients come to me  for22 different reasons, to do a will or for help  with23 a family court case , for example. Yet there  is24 something almost all of them have in common.  They25 all have housing problems.2 
2 So I am asking that we try3 something different this year. Landlords  have4 come to expect rent increases every year and   now5 view them as an entitlement , something they6 should get automat ically, whether or not they7 provide the services they are paid for. Send   a8 message this year and vot e no rent increase.9	(Audience participation.)10 MS. MARY McCUNE:	I often hear11 landlords say that it is not their  responsibility12 to subsidize low- income tenants. That may be13 true. But it is also true that it is not  the14 tenants' responsibility  to subsidize landlords15 who do not provide even the most basic   services16 to their tenants.17 So I urge you to vot e for zero18 rent increases for rent stabilized tenants   this19 year.20 I also want ed to make just a few21 quick comments.22 There has been a lot of  talk23 about the lead paint law. These are one- time24 expenses, the lead abatement expenses that   they25 are going to face. Rent increases are  permanent.10 
2 They pile up year after year after year.3 The reason landlords now have4 this lead abatement law to face is because  they5 haven' t been doing the lead paint abatement  that6 they needed to do in years past. This is  a7 subject near and dear to my heart since  I8 currently have about twelve to fourteen  lead9 paint violations  in my own rent stabilized10 apartment.11 So it 's a one - time cost. They' ll12 recover it . Some of these costs that they  talk13 about that are so excessive are one- t ime costs.14 Some years they have low costs, some years  they15 have high costs. But just because rent   increases16 do not keep up with all of their costs does  not17 mean they are not making a profit .18 So thank you.19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.21 MS. ADAMS:	If I can do it in22 two parts.23 It's in two parts.24 One, how many clients are you25 working with and how many of them are in   rent2 
2 stabilized apartments?3 And, secondly, in addition to4 the Rent Guidelines Board, which we can do  very5 little about providing  housing, what other  City6 agencies have you talked to since we saw you   last7 year?8 MS. MARY McCUNE:	Well , we see9 collect ively, our office sees about 500 clients a10 year. And I would say probably about  ninety11 percent of them are rent stabilized. There are   a12 number of people living in unregulated  housing,13 small family housing, you know, two to three-14 family houses, some in public housing as well.15 We go - - we help assist   clients16 in looking for housing. We have a case  management17 department . That 's something they do.18 So we really make  applications19 everywhere  for public housing, for Sect ion 8. And20 our clients are fortunate, because they are  HIV+21 sometimes they are made a priority. We have  a22 number of people that are homeless as well   living23 in shelters because  they've lost their apartments24 and there' s no place for them to move to. They25 simply can't find  something.2 
2 So we've gone  - - obviously we do3 HP actions. We go to DHCR. We call the  Department4	of Buildings.  We go to all	anyone that ' s, the5 80/20 projects, Mitchell - Lama, we have tenants6 living in those facilities as  well.7 So we investigate any and  all8 options. It 's not something that we don't work at9 very hard all the t ime. But we still have  tenants10 waiting for six months in a shelter trying  to11 find something.12 And as you know, with the13 Section 8 situation	and my clients are very14 fortunate also because many of them are  entitled15 to enhanced rent from Social Services so  they16 actually get a much higher shelter allowance   than17 other people in the City. But they still  can't18 find anything.19 MS. ADAMS:	The reason I ask is20 that I notice the Mayor appointed a  special21 Commission on AIDS this year. And I was  wondering22 if they have been able to give you  any23 assistance.24 MS . MARY McCUNE:	You know,25 what  the Mayor  - - usually what  the Mayor does is5 
2 they refer out to non- prof its and we are one of3 the places they refer peopl e to.4	So I wish there were some  great5 resource out there. And we've compiled  - -   there6 are a lot of AIDS places that do - - there' s - -  I7 can show you scatter site housing as well. A lot8 of our clients are being placed in scatter  sites.9 But they have various restrictions and aren' t10 suitable for all of our  clients.11 So it's not that people aren' t12 trying. It 's just that funding is very scarce  and13 we rely heavily on the private housing stock   to14 house our clients because there simply  isn't15 enough non- profit housing availabl e.16 And I don' t know if people17 really understand the numbers of people  that18 the number of HIV people in the Bronx exceeds   the19 HIV population in many states. I mean we   are20 talking about a lot of peopl e. This is not a21 small percentage of people that we are  dealing22 with. And there just isn't enough affordabl e23 housing.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 Michael Sepe.5 
2	MR. MICHAEL SEPE:	If the3 tenants have rights, the landlords, they  have4 rights too . The Mayor and the Councilmen, they5 just want  - - they need the money.  They don' t care6 where the money come from .7	Now, I used to own a  building8 that I lost because of rent control when  Mayor9 Lindsay was Mayor. Now I got six apartments  but10 it ' s a small.11	Now, when I bought this for me,12 I spent all my money towards - - me and my wife13 put everything up, new stove,  whatever.14 Everybody  - -  these people, they15 never move out of the building in almost  twenty16 years. They stay long, below - - one year ago17 below  the scheduled t ime , no problem.18 Now, next door to me across  the19 street , whatever, who collect double my rent  for20 their apartments. And I'm still collect ing the21 minimum rent.22 Now the way they say, the  tax23 increase, that 's not just the Mayor. For I blame24 more the Councilmen to approve the eighteen 25	percent.12 
2 Now I just got a ticket not  to3 have the sidewalk clean. $100. When it 's no4 it 's just  - - how you say? - - like somebody coming5 with a gun and say give me a hundred  dollars.6	Now, I fix the boiler point.  It7 cost me more than $500. And you all complicat e  to8 that.9 So I lot of add to  everything10 else.11 So how do you expect the12 landlord to fix anything if he' s no income? When13 the City needs the money, it 's very easy for14 them, just to raise the tax or what ever. I don' t15 see where is the justice here on five percent   or16 ten percent or twenty percent.  So maybe they need17 more than ten percent. So it might be they   need18 less than ten percent , five percent.19 I make a hundred dollars,  you20 give me five percent  increase. The other one21 making  $500, you're giving him five percent22 increase. That 's a lot of difference.23 And I don' t see no justice24 whatsoever. For years I don' t see no just ice.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where is your7 
2	building?3	MR. MICHAEL SEPE:	578 33rd4	Street , Brooklyn.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	33rd Street?6 MR. MICHAEL SEPE :	Yes.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Fifth Avenue8	and Third , between Fifth and Sixth?9	MR. MICHAEL SEPE:	Between10 Fifth and Sixth .11 Now another problem we have  with12 the sanitat ion people . On the corner is building13 he use for commercial. On the morning between  six14 he' s got about six, seven, eight vans load and15 unload . They always add trash on the street. And16 we have to pay for it because the  Sanitation,17 they don' t give a damn. They give all of us $10018 fine. Otherwise, was it clean or was it  dirty.19 All the other families,  two-20 family or three- family, nobody got fined. They21 never clean because they don't get no fine . Why22 everybody  think the landlord  - - the way  it is23 today everything is the tenant , not all of them24 because we've got a lot of good tenants. Also  we25 got good landlords. We got lousy landlords   also10 
2 too. I know that.3 But why isn't everybody  the4 same? How are you to keep your sidewalk clean5 when the next door don't?6	CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Okay. Thank7 you.8 (Audience participation .)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Victoria Ball.10	Go ahead.11	MS. VICTORIA BALL:	Good12 afternoon, Board Members, landlords and  tenants .13 My name is Victoria Ball.  I'm14 disabled and I am the mother of five  children.15 I live at 1040 Gerard Avenue .16 It 's a scatter site . It 's supposed to be a nice17 neighborhood in a nice area, but it is not . I18 just moved in on March 2004 and a neighbor  that19 is mentally disabled took my daughter and  he20 abducted her from eight o'clock in the morning  to21 one o'clock in the afternoon.22 We told the police this but  the23 police didn' t do anything about it , like always.24 At nighttime we have to stay  in25 the apartment because after eight p.m . the drug12 
2 dealers deal with drugs inside the building.  We3 are forced to stay inside our apartment  because4 of the drug deal ing scheme downstairs .5 They have a laundromat6 downstairs for us but we cannot use it  because7 the people in the laundromat are smoking pot .8	On this day, the front of  the9 window, the window of the building is cracked  and10 it has been three weeks since the landlord hasn' t11 fixed it. And I pay my rent and I have my  rent12 receipts.13 We've been harassed from  the14 drug lords in the building to move out and  they15 won' t hurt us . Again, there is no security and16 the landlord knows about this problem but  he17 doesn' t want to be involved .18 Our children have been living  in19 fear. The police have been told about us and  they20 have seen everything but they don' t do nothing21 about it.22 I beg you pl ease as the mother23 of five children, and I beg you for all  the24 children in this world , in New York City, be safe25 and don' t raise the rents, please .9 
2 Think about , if it 's not safe,3 you know, the landlord should not raise rents  if4 the place is not safe. And please think about   the5 children,  you know. The children  - - you  know,6 right now my children are very scared where  we' re7 at . We live in a scatter site. The scatter  site8 is supposed to be safe for people that  are9 disabled and that are from the program. But   this10 scatter site is very, very unsafe. It 's full of11 drug dealers. The super, forget about  him.12 Everybody gets in and  out.13 And please, please beg  the14 landlords to consider the rates in the  rents.15 Thank you.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 Charlie Reyes.18 MR. CHARLIE REYES:	I'm Charlie19 Reyes.20 This is my wife, Victoria  Ball.21 First of all , I'd like to say22 I'm a ret ired vet eran of twenty years of military23 service between active service and  National24 Guard.25 I am also a citizen of New  York2 
2 City. I've been born and raised here for  over3 thirty years.4 I understand that , you know,5 this situation with the rent increases is  not6 really going to help anybody . People are trying7 to justify all types of  things.8 I wish that some of the9 landlords would be willing to stay a couple  of10 nights in the environment that a lot of us  live11 in, actually live inside the building that  we12 live in and actually see the type of things  that13 go on themselves.14 Because, you know, I mean  - - I15 would even like to see maybe an off icial from the16 Board go unannounced to some of these places  and17 actually see for yourself the horrif ic situation18 that a lot of people live  in.19 I mean a lot of the elderly  that20 are here have sacrificed and have contributed  to21 our society for many years, a lot of the  veterans22 from World War II and from different eras,  in23Vietnamand many eras. Yet  - -  they paid  the price24for ourliberty and for our freedom, and yet  they25are nottreated with regards for their  freedom.
2	And the elderly people that  have3 also contribut ed as teachers, as lawyers, in many4 professional	areas, that have contributed  within5 our society here in New York City, yet we don' t6 consider them.7 Sometimes maybe the landlords8 are looking more towards the economical and   they9 are looking at people as numbers and they are  not10 looking at people as humanistic. They are  not11 looking at people as reality, that they are  human12 beings.13 Are we supposed to take out  of14 the bread of the food of our children so  that15 then we can pay an increase in  rent?16 Are we supposed to tell  our17 child , well , you can't have bread  or you  can't18 have certain things to eat because of the   fact19 that we have to pay more  rent?20 You know, these things  - -21 (Audience participat ion.)22 MR. CHARLIE REYES:	Excuse me.23 But I'm speaking right now. Excuse me, sir.   You24 had your t ime. I have mine.25 Okay.3 
2 Now, a lot of us are on  fixed3 income where we can't afford  to do  - - we  cannot4 afford to pay an increase in rent. I get  only5 $700 from Social Security Disability. And I   can't6 afford to pay more than what we are paying  right7 now.8 I have two children at home9 that , young people that are mentally disabled  and10 I can't afford to take out of their needs to  pay11 an increased rent.12 So I beg that you, the Council ,13 vot e for zero increase this year.14 (Audience participation. )15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next four16 speakers are John Rapaport , then Jeremy Eagl e,17 then Anne  Fried ,  then Lucy Ladesma.18 Mr. Rapaport.19 MR. JOHN RAPAPORT:	I'm John20 Rapaport.	I'm an owner of a brownstone on  the21 West Side of Manhattan.22 I'm not afraid of running  the23 risk of repeat ing what other people may have24 said. But it seems to me that in addition  to25 rising costs in managing buildings, we have   the2 
2 addit ional tax increase to pay for 9/11 and we3 have concurrent increases in insurance that  have4 to do with 9/11.5 And when they were first6 announced, I fully expected the citizens of   the7 City to help share that burden. I hope  you8 consider this when you're making your decision in9 terms of rent increases.10 Thank you very much.11 MS. KAUFMAN:	Thank you.12 Jeremy Eagle.13 MR. JEREMY EAGLE:	Hello!14 It's rather ironic that I'm15 standing here. I graduat ed on that stage over two16 decades ago. I think I got the wrong  degree17 though. It was in art and not engineering  or18 architecture.19 When I went to school here,  I20 lived in this neighborhood  and the rents were21 very affordable even for a student. Fortunately   I22 was, as every student who attends this school ,  on23 a full tuition scholarship.24 I could not afford to live  in25 this neighborhood now. I left the City for a   few2 
2 years after  I graduated.  When  I returned ,  it was3 already too expensive for me to live in the  City.4 As an artist , I've been a5 freelancer earning income without any benef its,6 without any built - in increases in my salary or in7 my wage. And I've been forced further and   further8 away from neighborhoods  that again ironically9 have often become valuable centers of our  City10 because artists are known to be either living  or11 active in that community.12 We all know what happened  in13 SoHo, Tribeca, Chelsea, Williamsburg .14 But in my case I now live in  a15 stabilized apartment in the northern tip  of16 Manhattan.  And  if - -  I'm sorry, I lost my trend17 of thought. But when I first moved in  about18 fourteen years ago, the landlord was very  happy19 and pleased to accept my rent. I was  probably20 paying the highest rent in the  building.21 Now that I've been there  for22 that long, he's eager to get rid of me  even23 though I paid my rent regularly on time for  those24 fourteen years.25 In all of that time the2 
2 conditions in the building have been deplorable.3 The building has been neglected. It 's just a4 sixty something year old art  deco building.	It 's5 very beautiful , but there are conditions that are6 deteriorating and it's a struggle to get  the7 landlord to make the  repairs.8 He also inherited the  building9 that I'm in along with five other  apartment10 buildings. And I know that his income is  very11 stable. There are no mortgages on the  buildings.12 I think it 's a very typical13 situation, if not perhaps more typical that  a14 landlord like he would probably own even  more15 buildings.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you17 wrap up, Mr. Eagle. Please wrap  up.18 MR. JEREMY EAGLE:	Okay.19 Well, I feel like I'm  being20 forced as other people in my building have been21 forced to move out of the City when the rents  get22 too high. We're contribut ing in many ways to  the23 City and we are being forced out by  greedy24 landlords.25 Do not increase the  rents.2 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3 (Audience participation.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Anne Fried.5	MS . ANNE FRIED:	Good afternoon6 and thank you for giving me the opportunity  to7 speak to you.8 I am a part owner of a ninety-9 year old apartment building on the Upper  West10 Side. Now, ninety- year old buildings have very11 special problems. Things have to be replaced .12 Electrical circuits have to be replaced.  Plumbing13 has to be replaced.14 We recently, we simply  upgraded15 our elevator system and it took two years for  the16 MCI to rule on our application. And once we  got17 it two years after we had applied for it , the18 payments are spread over eighty- four mont hs.19 However, because the rents  are20 so low it takes more than eighty- four mont hs to21 get the increase . So it takes more like ten22 years. Instead of seven years, it takes  ten23 years.24 And then the retroactive25 increases take another three years to  be6 
2	recouped.3	On top of that , you also - -  once4 you upgrade some systems, new rules and5 regulations apply to you. If you upgrade6 elevators, you have to do a hard wired alarm.   You7 have to put a dedicat ed telephone line into  the8 elevator. You have to have a central  call9 station. This costs money. This adds on  another10 $10, 000 to your operating cost.11 This was something that  we12 cannot absorb. It's impossible when the insurance13 rates are going sky high. I just got notif ied  by14 my insurance company that my increases will be   at15 least fifteen percent more this coming here  and16 they have more than doubled over the past two  or17 three years.18 I respectfully request that  you19 give us the increase that we are more  than20 entitled to.21 Thank you.22 (Audience participation.)2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 Lucy Ledesma.25 And she will be followed  by24 
2 Lizabeth  Mackinlay	- that 's the lady with  the3 pictures,  right? -4 MS. LIZABETH MACKINLAY:	Yes.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.6 And then Natividad Hernandez  and7 Mariano Munoz .8 Lucy.9 MS. LUCY LEDESMA:	Okay.10 Good afternoon, Members of  the11 Rent Guidelines Board.12 My name is Lucy Ledesma and  I13 live in the Henry Hudson Hotel , an SRO on the14 Upper West Side.15 I have lived there for  twenty-16 three years. Being a low- income, disabled woman  I17 depend on this housing and I do not think that   my18 wealthy landlord needs another increase of   any19 kind. Enough is enough.20 What we need is for the rents  to21 be rolled back for the past ten years once  and22 for all.23 Please, Rent  Guidelines  Board ,24 don' t disappoint us this year. Do the right25 thing, please.6 
2 My landlord is the notorious  Ian3 Schrager who is making lots of money with  the4 tourists while I'm inconvenienced with the   noise5 from his night club downstairs. I have  to6 tolerate the noise of the people partying  all7 night until five in the morning every  night.8 Why does my landlord  need9 another increase when he is making so much  prof it10 with the tourists?11 He doesn' t care about us having12 peace and quiet in our homes. He cares only   about13 getting away with what is good for his  pockets.14 For us it 's only harassment and15 more harassment.16 I beg you to make the right17 thing this year by voting zero for SROs  and18 hotels. We, the tenants, vot e and pay taxes. We19 are not like our landlords and their lawyers   who20 are wealthy and greedy .21 I thank you for letting me  talk22 before you today.23 Thank you.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 (Audience participation. )2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Mc Kinley3 has provided us with some  pictures.4 Go ahead , Ms. McKinley.5	MS. LIZABETH MACKINLAY:	As they6 say, a picture is worth a thousand  words.7 What I'm here today for  is8 really two- fold.9	One, let me introduce myself.10 And , first , I would  like to thank you for  the11 opportunity. This is my first time to have  the12 opportunity to speak before the Rent  Guidelines13 Board.14 I have been a happy New  Yorker15 since I moved here from the midwest in January  of16 1967. I have been paying taxes happily and  with17 pleasure for the pleasure of living in this  great18 City.19 I am of Dutch ancestry and  the20 Wyckoff House is New York' s number one landmark.21 I am a twelfth generation Wyckoff descendent.   So22 when I came to New York, until my uncle made   the23 genealogical discovery connecting us to  the24 Wyckoffs,	I wondered why it was that I felt in  a25 way that I had come home . Well , I had . And I want10 
1	293 2 to continue staying here. It is to me still  the3 greatest city in the  world.4 But today I'm here to share  a5 situation which occurs and is continuing where   I6 have been living since September 13 , 1996. I7 reside at an SRO. The name of it is The  Dexter8 House and it is located at 345 West 86th   Street. 9 That 's the Upper West Side. I reside in Room 10	1604.11 Four years ago the bottom12 dropped out from under my life. I was forced   to13 give up my beautifully appoint ed home of  eighteen14 years. And having no place else to go because   my15 situation, my financial situation, had  been16 drast ically reduced, I was forced to move  into17 this SRO because at that time I lost  everything.18 I had to declare a business  bankruptcy.19 And  the SRO, The Dexter House ,20 was the only place that I could afford to  move21 to.22 Now, in the almost eight  years23 that I have been living there, the situat ion  in24 the building has been pretty much status  quo25 except in this last year the building has  been11 
2 more and more converting empty rooms to  hotel3 rooms which I understand from the SRO Law  Project4 is illegal.5 A VOICE:	Right.6 MS. LIZABETH MACKINLAY:	All of7 the work that has been done in these  converted8 rooms has been done without proper work  permit.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You are going10 to have to start wrapping  up.11 MS. LIZABETH MACKINLAY:	On my12 floor the pictures that I took will show you  the13 incredible dichotomy which now exists in  my14building.The 16th floor had repairs done  and15then theywere not completed. There are holes  in16the wall.The rug was removed from the floor.  We17	didn't have proper flooring in the hallways.  The18hallwaysare simply plywood  flooring. None of19this hasbeen done.20The bathrooms, if we are  lucky,21 are cleaned once a month.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You are going23 to have to wrap up.24 MS. LIZABETH MACKINLAY:	And25 then they are doing everything  cosmetically21 
2	downstairs to the front of the building in   the3 ground floor. But none of these repairs that  I4 took photographs of have been completed and  the5 situation has been going on for over a year.6 Many complaints have been  made7 to the management	downstairs. And now the8 building  complication is that another company  has9 come over to lease the building  for twenty  years.10 They do not deserve a  rent11 increase when we' re living like rats.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 A VOICE:	That 's right.14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Nat ividad16 Hernandez,17 MS. NATIVIDAD HERNANDEZ:	Good18 afternoon.19 My name is Natividad  Hernandez.20 I'm a member of Centro Hispano, coordinator   of21 United Tenants Coalition. I come from   Jamaica22 Queens.23 This is a neighborhood of  very24 low- income and also a lot of poor people who  live25 in those buildings.3 
2 We would like to ask today  to3 not increase the rent because we cannot afford   on4 the rent stabilized with this new  increase.5	And also just as a comment ,6 landlords ta e advantage of tenants because   they7 face MCI increases, three or four MCis  per8 buildings.  So this is another increase the9 tenants have to pay and we cannot afford  it.10 So, please, when you make your11	final decision, think of all of these families12 with kids, senior citizens and disabled  people13 that are going to be on the  street.14 Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 (Audience participation.)17 MS. HOLDER:	Question.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Excuse me,19 Miss. Question.20 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you for your21 testimony.22 Can you tell me a little  bit23 about your neighborhood?24 MS. NATIVIDAD HERNANDEZ:	My25 neighborhood?12 
2 MS. HOLDER:	Yes. Where did you3 say you are from?4	MS. NATIVIDAD HERNANDEZ:	Oh!5 Okay. It's a poor neighborhood  and low- income6 families who live in the neighborhood.  It's7 Jamaica Queens.8 MS. HOLDER:	Oh! Jamaica Queens.9 And when you said the MCis  in10	the building, how much are the  MCis?11	MS. NATIVIDAD HERNANDEZ:	Well ,12 right now we are having ten buildings  together13 with the tenant association, which one of these  -14 - most of these buildings have three or four  MCis15 per building. One of them	one MCI was16 requested for $2 million. So people increased   I17 think $63 per room. So it' s not fair.18Landlords always take  advantage19of thetenantsbecause of this.20MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.21CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22(Audience participation.)23CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mariano24Munoz.25Go ahead.

MARIANO MUNOZ:	Hello!6 Testimony for the Rent Guidelines Board  Publ ic7 Hearing from Met Council on Housing, June 15 ,  8	2004.9	The most important job that  the10 Rent Guidelines Board can do is preserve  what11 remains of New York' s affordable apartments.12 Housing one million households with a  median13 income of $30,000 a year at a median rent of   $70014 a mont h, the rent stabilized stock continues  to15 do an amazing job of providing decent , affordabl e16 housing to New York City tenants .17 Rent  stabilized apartments18 supply the City' s low, moderate and middle-19 income people with more affordabl e housing than20 that supplied by Section 8, public housing  and21 other programs combined.22 This is not to say that there  is23 not a housing affordability crisis in the  City.24 Rent stabilized tenants are getting squeezed .  In25 rent stabilized housing, thousands of  poor10 
2 tenants pay more than thirty percent of  income3 for rent and non- payment  eviction filings in4 housing court cont inue to stay very high  showing5 that tenants are falling behind in  rent.6 RGB staff reports show  that7 tenants have declining incomes and are  suffering,8 along with other New Yorkers, with cont inued high9 unemployment	and job losses.10 Almost half of the  rent11 stabilized tenant households in New York pay  over12 thirty percent of their income for rent.  These13 tenants are also the lower income tenants in  the14 group and they are on the edge of losing   their15 apartments through inability to make  rent16 payments.17 Even if paying a high  rent18 burden is a temporary situation, the  City' s19 record - high homel essness numbers and the high20 eviction numbers prove that the condition  very21 often leads to loss of the family home.  Most22 families who lose a rent stabilized apartment  are23 not able to re- enter the same housing market.24 Asking rents for rent  stabilized25 apartments in most neighborhoods  is significantly
