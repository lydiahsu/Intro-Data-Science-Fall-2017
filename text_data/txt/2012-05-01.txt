2 Stabilization Law of 1969 (§ 26 - 501 of the N. Y. C.3 Administrative Code) and in the  Legislative4 Findings contained in the Emergency  Tenant5	Protection Act of 1974 ( L. 1974 c. 576 , § 4 [§ 2 ])6 The Rent Guidelines Board is  also7 authorized to promulgate rent guidelines for  loft8 units under Section 286 subdivision 7 of  the9 Multiple Dwelling Law.10 The purpose of the loft guidelines11 is to implement the public policy set forth in  the12 Legislative Findings of Article 7 - C of the Multiple13 Dwelling Law ( Section 280 ).14 Dated May 12 th, 2012 , Jonathan15 Kimmel, Chair.16 Oh, I' ll take a breath.17 Okay. I will now open the  meeting18 for proposals.	I believe tenant' s -- I believe19 tenant' s proposal is, goes first this year.20 Ms. Holder.21 MS. HOLDER:	Yes.22 So --23 MR. CHEIGH:	Chairman Kimmel, I' d24 like to make a motion for apartment increases  for25 one- year and two- year rents, at zero percent for6 
2 one- year increases and zero percent for two- year3 increases.4 And the reason why I' m putting5 forth this motion is based on the data that we   have6 secured from the Rent Guidelines Board staff  and7 the presentations that we' ve heard over the last --8 over the past month regarding the state of  the9 housing situation amongst the renters in the  New10 York City, rent stabilized renters in New  York11 City.12 We feel that the data has  shown13 that the rent burdens are the highest that  have14 ever been recorded by the Housing Vacancy  Survey15 amongst rent stabilized tenants.	The rent burdens16 for the majority holds -- the majority of  tenants17 are above 50 percent of their -- what the  HUD18 guidelines consider affordability.	I' m sorry, 3319 percent of tenants are paying over 50 percent  of20 their income towards rent.21 In addition, we see that there' s a22 lot -- there' s increases in eviction proceedings.23 There' s incomes that are decreasing amongst the24 rent stabilized population.	There' s a general25 recession that has really impacted the  tenant2 
2 community in New York City.	And within those3 considerations, we really are asking the board  to4 consider the hardship that has befallen the --  the5 renters in considering the rate increases  this6 year.7 On the other side, we do  have8 building owners who do have legitimate  expenses9 that are necessary for maintaining --  maintaining10 an upkeep up the buildings every year.	And we get11 the data, we get the information that are  provided12 by the PIOC and the income and expense  reports.13 But based on those reports, we14 feel that there are several things that  indicate15 that there should be additional considerations  on16 the tenants side, namely the performance of  the17 bottomline for the building owners.18 Namely, net operating incomes have19 been increasing for consecutive years during  the20 recession.	The PIOC has shown that in 2009  the21 PIOC estimated an expense increase of 3 . 6 percent.22 It was actually, 0 . 1 percent - a difference of 3 . 523 percent. And in 2010 , the PIOC projected an24 increase of 5 . 5 percent. It was actually 0 . 925 percent.2 
2 I' m not saying that the Rent3 Guidelines Board at those times adopted such  high4 increases, but it does impact how we have to --   how5 we have to consider the data points with --  the6 data points we have now regarding the  building7 owners' expenses.8 In addition, we also ask the  Rent9 Guidelines Board staff to reassess the cost  per10 structure between natural gas heated building  and11 oil heated buildings.	Oil heated buildings, I12 believe, we' ve asked the staff for the breakdown of13 oil versus natural gas heated buildings but  there14 was a substantial increase, there was an  increase15 in natural gas heated buildings, which is why  the16 staff adjusted the PIOC increases accordingly.17 And natural gas heated buildings18 have an income expense projection increase of 0 . 619 percent, much lower than the 2 . 8 percent that the20 general PIOC had.21 And we' ve also had substantial22 testimony from the DEP, DOB and Pla NYC, proposing23 that the conversions to number -- from No. 6 to   No.24 2 , No. 6 to No. 4 and No. -- and a heavy fuel   to25 natural gas, are happening at a rate where  building2 
2 owners are taking a method of current  and3 short- term future cost savings from converting4 fuels.5 The buildings owners have a6 legitimate plan that conversion does -- do  have7 costs, but a lot of private owners are doing so   at8 their own -- at their own incentive because of  the9 cost structure.	They see a payback for  converting10 fuels.	They see a cost savings from doing  so.11 They achieve efficiencies in buildings that  they12 didn' t realize were possible.	And I felt that the13 hearings with the DEP, DOB and Pla NYC stated that14 case very effectively.15 Building owners do have legitimate16 expenses to maintain and upkeep their buildings  and17 to provide quality service to the tenants. But  this18 year we have the benefit of the Housing  Vacancy19 Survey showing what has been the state of  the20 renters' economic condition over the -- over  the21 recession - from 2008 to  2011 .	And it is a  very22 dire situation that statistics show increased  rent23 burdens, substantial -- substantial burdens in24 trying to retain -- retain their incomes within  the25 recession.2 
2 And one of the most striking  data3 points that I saw in this year' s reports was  that4 with the increases that we' ve been making, building5 -- building owners are collecting less and less  of6 those actual increases.7 And I -- I' ve stated that this8 seems to reflect that even though we' re making9 increases, these increases are substantially for10 units that are close to, at or above market  rate11 and, therefore, the only tenants who are able  to12 hang on in the apartments are those who can --   who13 have a -- who have a level rent that they   can14 afford and their -- and as a result of  the15 recession, they have not been forced to move  out,16 evicted or turned over as the result of  their17 economic conditions.18 So within the -- within all  these19 data points that we have been hearing from the  Rent20 Guidelines Board staff from presentations this21 year, I really hope the public board members  will22 consider the data sets that are in front of us,   the23 economic condition of the rent stabilized kind  of24 population.25 And, therefore, that' s why I' m2 
2 proposing zero percent increase for one- year and3 two- year leases.4 MS. HOLDER:	I second --5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	That was my6 next question.7 MS. HOLDER:	I second that motion.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	That was my9 next question.10 ( Applause.)11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.12 MS. HOLDER:	Yes, thank you,13 Chair.14 I second the motion of  my15 colleague, Brian Cheigh.16 It remains an honor to serve  on17 the board and to represent the New York City  tenant18 community.19 I' d like to thank everyone in20 advance, my colleagues on this board for their  time21 and thoughtful analysis of this data and,  in22 particular, the data this year has been  really23 enlightening.24 And, of course, it goes  without25 saying that I am especially grateful to the  staff2 
2 of the Rent Guidelines Board that expertly  and3 meticulously pulls together all of the  requested4 data that this board makes of them, as well as  our5 anticipated annual reports that we all rely  upon6 and serve as the basis of the decisions that  have7 an impact on well over two million rent  regulated8 tenants here in New York City.9 Of course all of this -- of  course10 all of this means that we, at the RGB, the   Rent11 Guidelines Board, have a significant impact on  what12 happens to New Yorkers.	And as we all know,13 according to our own data, the economic impact  of14 these guidelines on the City' s housing stock is15 enormous.16 Given current rent levels, any one17 percent increase in average rents raises  aggregate18 rent rolls by about $ 120 million per year.	And19 this is our own data. So an average annual  increase20 of 5 . 7 percent in rent rolls for each of the last21 three years since the last Housing and  Vacancy22 Survey was conducted for the stabilized  apartment23 inventory as a whole, including the  estimated24 impact of the statutory vacancy allowance,  amounts25 to approximately 2 . 25 billion in cumulative added2 
2 rent, which is an average of about $ 2 , 200 in total3 added rent per year, per rent stabilized  households4 over that time period.5 The Rent Guidelines Board6 guidelines' increases account for most of  this7 growth.	We have a significant impact on  the8 affordability issue for rent stabilized units  here9 in New York City.10 The cost of renting a  stabilized11 apartment has risen to a median of 35 . 2 percent of12 income up from 31 . 7 percent found in the 2008 HVS.13 And this, as my colleague has pointed out, there' s14 only a point -- this goes to median for all   rent15 stabilized, it doesn' t even go to what it is  that16 we see with even the lower income of  stabilized17 tenants. And this dramatic and unwarranted  increase18 is larger than any previous three- year period.19 So these are the highest rent20 burdens ever recorded for stabilized units in  New21 York City.	In three years, during the worst22 economic recession that this City has seen  since23 the Great Depression, this is what has happened  and24 it' s largely to be accounted for because of the25 work of the Rent Guidelines  Board.2 
2 So I support that we should have  a3 freeze this year.	The other statistics are4 encouraging.	We' ve seen a dramatic decrease in5 distressed property from 11 . 8 percent to 7 . 46 percent this year.	And we see that the  increases7 in income growth outpaces the increase in  expenses8 resulting in yet another increase in net  operating9 income for owners.10 Again, this is about what we' re11 doing as a Rent Guidelines Board, what we' re12 mandated to do to look at all of these data   points13 and to come up with something that is  responsible14 and that really is responding and responsive to  the15 needs of all New Yorkers, all New Yorkers, not  just16 owners.17 So I support a rent freeze  this18 year.19 One of my colleagues on the  board,20 earlier during the hearing period said that  what21 we' re really looking at is an income problem but22 that is one of the factors to be factored in, is   an23 income problem.	This is an income problem for24 tenants to afford their rent. And I would like  for25 this board an understanding that in looking a  the2 
2 data so carefully and analyzing it so  thoughtfully,3 to support our motion for a freeze for one  and4 two- year lease renewals.5 Thank you.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.7 ( Applause.)8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Holder, may9 I -- Mr. Cheigh, may I clarify, are you also --   are10 you also proposing a zero sublet allowance and  for11 lofts also?12 MR.

12 Chair and thank you to the members of the board  for13 your hard work and to the citizens attending  this14 meeting tonight.15 The tenant advocates call for a16 zero increase just this one time.	But this17 deceptively simple one- shot deal would simply18 further complicate a difficult situation.19 The findings of the City Council,20 in enacting the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969  and21 the State Legislative adopting the Emergency  Tenant22 Protection Act of 1974 , clearly established that23 fair and generally affordable rents are a  primary24 objective of these laws.	However, there' s been25 compelling testimony from tenant advocates during12 
2 the meeting so far this year, and we expect more  to3 follow, that housing affordability is a  critical4 concern for some and we agree with  that.5 However, right now thousands of6 affordable units are being built in the City with  a7 mix of public and private financing and  funding.8 Various re- zoning initiatives alone will produce9 thousands of affordable homes.	And over the past10 years, and I' m positive this year will not be  an11 exception, the board has heard testimony  from12 Borough Presidents, State Legislators and City13 Council Members regarding their efforts to  produce14 more affordable housing in concert with  Mayor15 Bloomberg' s sweeping affordable housing production16 initiatives.17 These are all good things.	More18 affordable housing is needed.	More affordable19 housing is needed just to replace the conversion  of20 rent stabilized apartments to ownership apartments.21 And the pace of the conversion will increase  as22 owners are forced to subsidize rising real  estate23 taxes and unfunded public policy  mandates.24 More affordable housing is needed25 just to replace the rent stabilized units lost  to2 
2 deregulation and the pace of deregulation  will3 increase as owners struggle to meet  rising4 insurance costs.5 More affordable housing is needed6 to shift the growing burden of preserving  below7 market rent stabilized rents against the reality  of8 rapidly escalating fuel oil with oil now well  over9 $ 100 a barrel again.	Water and sewer rates,10 electricity, administrative and maintenance costs11 will all shift more affordable housing as  owners12 struggle to meet the growing burden -  preserving13 this stock against the reality of  rapidly14 escalating costs.15 And the costs of operating16 affordable rent stabilized housing keep going  up17 year after year.	The board' s data this year alone18 shows that operating costs increased again and  even19 though mortgage rates are historically low,  the20 number of distressed properties still is21 problematic.	Clearly, low interest rates and prior22 rent increases have not been sufficient to  lessen23 that burden.24 And indications are that operating25 expenses are continuing to escalate higher.	It' s a2 
2 dire situation and tenants need to share  the3 burden.	The vast majority of landlords, and  again,4 I' ve said this before, the large majority of5 landlords own small buildings.	About 40 percent of6 the regulated rental housing stock is in  buildings7 of less than eleven units and they struggle to  keep8 their property from deteriorating.9 These are the gatekeepers of  the10 existing affordable housing stock and these11 gatekeepers are the private citizens that the  City12 has forced to shoulder a public cost with high  real13 estate taxes, water and sewer charges and dozens  of14 administrative fees in a constant stream  of15 unfunded public policy mandates without16 commensurate rent increases.17 So how do you make it work so it' s18 equitable?	Although four out of five tenants  can19 afford to share the burden, about one in  five20 tenants are chronically at risk of falling  behind21 in rent.	This is of concern to the board but  we22 are powerless to address it.	No one on this board23 denies there are tenants one paycheck away  from24 hardship, that there are tenants in desperate  need25 of assistance to really make ends meet, that  there2 
2 are tenants who simply cannot afford their  current3 rent, let alone any increase.4 Tenants and landlords needs more5 programs like the SCRIE to provide assistance  to6 our elderly tenants at risk who are falling  behind7 in their rent.8 We need more programs like SCRIE9 to finally recognize and provide better  rent10 increase relief to our non- senior citizen disabled11 tenants on fixed incomes.	The legislators need to12 expand SCRIE program eligibility by  increasing13 income thresholds to produce a larger percentage  of14 our at- risk families.15 And there' s really little16 difference between the SCRIE qualifying $ 29 , 000 a17 year income and a bit higher income, except when  a18 household needs the relief from SCRIE to make  ends19 meet and they miss the eligibility cutoff by  a20 couple of dollars. It' s not fair and for the  past21 eight years I' ve said our legislators have the22 ability to fix this.	I' ve said, why not expand the23 SCRIE programs to recognize a broader tenant  base24 to provide relief to more tenants from  rent25 increases.2 
2 Our legislators provide subsidy3 programs and pass zoning initiatives to create  new4 neighborhoods with affordable housing, why not  help5 those at- risk households who have spent many years6 in their old neighborhoods where their friends  and7 roots are?	Maybe the elected officials can also8 work towards expanding SCRIE and create  workable9 rent increase exemption programs for all  eligible10 tenants in place.11 We need programs to provide rent12 increase relief.	To preserve the rent stabilized13 housing stock, we need long- term government14 programs and not a one- shot deal passed here at  the15 owner' s expense.16 And the elected officials won' t do17 anything to help those tenants at risk if it' s  zero18 or a low increase is passed because then  our19 elected officials are off the hook for yet  another20 year.	The elected official shift their21 responsibility to the landlords and the  elected22 officials don' t hear the bigger message.	Stop the23 battle between the landlord and tenant by  helping24 the tenant meet the rent.25 Tenants and landlords together2 
2 need long- term programs not a one- shot deal.	The3 message to the elected officials  is clear.	Create4 the necessary rent increase exemption subsidies  to5 allow our tenants to stay in place in their  homes.6 If elected officials won' t use their power to fix7 the problems, then they must be  replaced.8 This board can help bring the9 message to the elected officials that owners  and10 tenants need their help, that owners and  tenants11 need long- term assistance, not a one- shot deal.	By12 this board approving increases at the upper end  of13 the preliminary range, we can bring the message  to14 the elected officials that owners and tenants  need15 their help, that owners and tenants need long- term16 assistance, not a one- shot deal.17 Additionally, the message to the18 elected officials that unfunded public  policy19 mandates put upon the landlords are not fair  and20 need to be addressed.	With your help, we can  tell21 the elected officials to think issues  through22 completely and shift the responsibility off  the23 landlords.24 As such, the owner members move25 for a five percent increase for a one  percent2 
2 renewal -- for a one- year renewal lease and a  nine3 percent increase for a two- year renewal lease as a4 message to the elected officials to do their  job5 and not shift responsibility onto the  largest6 provider of affordable housing.7 Additionally, a ten percent8 vacancy allowance, loft rates, similar, five9 percent for a one- year, nine percent for a10 two- year.11 And special guideline, for units12 subject to the Rent Stabilization Law on  September13 30 th, 2012 , which become vacant after September14 30 th, 2012 , the special guidelines shall be the15 greater of the 100 percent of the maximum- based16 rents or the fair market rent as previously  defined17 in Rent Order No. 43 .18 Thank you, Mr. Chair.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.20 Schleider.21 Is there a second?22 MS. CRUZ:	I second.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Steve, just to24 confirm, you said a ten percent vacancy  allowance.25 Did you mean a sublet  allowance?2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes, I' m sorry,3 the sublet allowance.4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And I' d also like6 to amend that.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Go right ahead.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	We' d also like an9 additional one percent increase for buildings  that10 heat exclusively with oil. And where the  most11 recent vacancy lease was executed six or more  years12 prior to the date of the current renewal  lease13 under this order, a minimum of the  guideline14 percentage increase or a corresponding  dollar15 increase for a one or two- year renewal, whichever16 is greater, modeled on the adjustment  promulgated17 in Order 40 and 41 .18 MS. HOLDER:	Can that be repeated?19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	More slowly.20 MS. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.21 We' d like a minimum increase for22 one- year at the -- whatever the percentage increase23 or a corresponding dollar increase calculated  the24 way it was calculated in Orders 40 and 41 .25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	So you' re not2 
2 -- you' re not setting a set number?3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, we don' t4 have a percentage increase.	But if we had a  five5 percent increase on a one year, it would be  five6 percent or $ 50 , whichever is greater.	On a7 two- year lease, it would be nine percent or $ 90 ,8 whichever is greater.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	Is there10 a second to all that?11 MS. CRUZ:	I second.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	Just --13 just to repeat, Steve, correct me if I  miss14 anything here, one- year lease, five percent for15 apartments.	Two- year lease, nine percent.	Ten16 percent sublet allowance.17 For lofts, five year, one- year18 lease, two- year lease, nine percent.	Special19 guideline, the greater of 100 percent of  the20 maximum based rent or the fair market  rent.21MR. SCHLEIDER:	Correct.22CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	In addition,23onepercent for those -- an additional one  percent24forthose buildings heated exclusively with oil.25MR. SCHLEIDER:	Correct.
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And for those3 tenancies, what did you say, six years or  more?4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Six years, yes, --5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Six years --6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- prior to the7 date of the current lease renewal under this  order.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	A minimum dollar9 value, hypothetically, in this case, for the  five10 percent and nine percent, minimum of $ 50 for a11 one- year lease and $ 90 for a two- year lease.12 Did I get that all  right?13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes, sir.14 MS. HOLDER:	Point of15 clarification.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes, Ms. Holder.17 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.	So that' s one18 percent increase for those buildings that  are19 heated with oil and for those units where there' s20 been six years. So is  it both?	Is it conditioned,21 the one percent increase conditioned on  both22 factors or --23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No.	They' re24 separate factors.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	No.	It' s2 
2 separate -- separate, I  believe.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.4 MS. HOLDER:	So is that two5 percent?	Is it one percent for  each?6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No, it' s not one7 percent for each.	For a building that' s heated8 exclusively with oil, it would be an additional  one9 percent increase on the renewal leases.10 Furthermore, as a separate point,11 for those occupants in possession of the  apartment12 who have been there for -- for six or more   years13 prior to the date of the current renewal  lease,14 there will be a minimum rent increase of the --   the15 one year, which is, in this case, five percent  or16 $ 50 , whichever is greater.	And then the -- the17 two- year lease, which was nine percent or $ 90 ,18 whichever is greater.19 If there is an additional one20 percent increase, then that would go in tandem  with21 that if the building is heated exclusively  with22 oil.23 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Are you clear25 with that?2 
2MS. HOLDER:	I' m not okay with it3butyeah.4CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	No, I said are5youclear.6MS. HOLDER:	Yeah.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	No, I didn' t8 ask you if it was  okay.9 MS. HOLDER:	Yeah, okay.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I know better11 than that.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.13 Okay with everything.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I think for15 clarification purposes, it' s easier to say that the16 dollar figure is up with the percent, with  the17 guidelines.	So it' s five percent or nine percent18 or $ 50 or $ 90 ; correct, Steve?19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Correct.	Or six20 percent or ten percent or seven percent or  --21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Right.	Whatever22 -- it' s tied in.	And the oil --23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	If we get those.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	-- is25 additional?7

CRUZ:	I have a proposal to8 make.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	A first.11 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Chairman, I propose12 that there be an increase of eight percent for  the13 residential --14 ( Audience participation.)15 MS. CRUZ:	-- Class A hotels for16 the lodging houses, for the rooming houses, for  the17 Class B hotels and for the SRO  units.18 ( Audience participation.)19 MS.

CRUZ:	I also propose a  2525 percent vacancy allowance for new tenants.3 
2 So in sum, eight percent  increase3 for the annual increases applicable to these  hotel4 units, and 25 percent for new  tenants.5 And I submit this, Chairman,  based6 on the fact that for the past eight years  there7 have been only five -- only three times an  increase8 applicable to these units.9 ( Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Ms.11 Cruz.12 Is there --13 MS.

2 We' d like to propose that there be3 a freeze on any types of increases for  hotels,4 lodging houses, rooming houses, Class B hotels  with5 single room occupancy buildings, also known  as6 SROs.7 We, again, can' t imagine why8 housing of last resort and housing that seems to  be9 actually doing quite well for the owners because  of10 the way in which they house this -- this  housing11 stock, should be entitled to any increases  this12 year.13 We continue to see robust  profits14 for the owners of these hotels and we continue  to15 see declining quality of life as well as income  and16 ability to secure income supports for the folks  who17 occupy this housing.	It really goes beyond us  and18 when we look at the number of tenants and the   folks19 who have testified before us, as well as  their20 advocates, to understand why it would be that  these21 owners would be entitled to any type of  an22 increase.23 They are more than covering the24 costs with the manner in which they house these  --25 these buildings and we have seen where the  owners2 
2 oftentimes, in addition, engage in  illegal3 practices in order to supplement their incomes  in4 these buildings.5 So we would make a motion for  an6 increase, Chair -- I mean for a freeze of any   type7 of increase for these class of hotels and  SROs.8 ( Applause.)9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.10 Is there a second?11 MR.
