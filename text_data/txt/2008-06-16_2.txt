2	P R O C E E D I N G S 34 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We ' re back .5 Roberta	Bernstein	- - hold on a second .6 Let me read	the	names .7 Roberta	Bernstein ;8 Regina	Shanley ;9 Jimmy Silber ; and 10 Marcell	Rosenblatt .11 Go ahead .12 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	Good 13 afternoon , Members	of the	Board and	Chairman 14 Markus .15 I ' m Roberta Bernstein , President of 16 the Small	Property	Owners	of New	York . Our 17 members are	middle - class or lower - middle	class	or 18 working class people who have	invested their life 19 savings in their	properties and often live	in the 20 buildings	they own	as I do .21 I said	no . When the	big	developers 22 came to me to try and purchase two of   my 23 buildings	and they	offered	me an amount	of money 24 I never thought	I ' d see	in my lifetime ,  I thought 25 a lot	about	it , I was tempted , but I ultimately 4 
2 decided that	owning	and	renting my buildings  was 3 more important to me than	leaving	a neighborhood 4 where	I have	lived	and	worked	for	more than 5 thirty - two years .6 Like other	small	property owners , I am 7 part of the	neighborhood and do more	for	safe ,8 affordable housing	than	any not - for - profit	or HPD 9 ever did	or ever	can do .10 In the	face of impossibly , incredibly ,11 astronomically rising fuel	costs , in the	face of 12 ever - increasing	government	pressure	with	regard 13 to a constant barrage of increasingly  aggressive 14 anti - owner regulation , in the	face of 15 ever - increasing	real estate taxes	and water 16 charges , I wonder if I  made that	right decision .17 I , like	other	owners , don ' t know where 18 the money	will come	from to pay for	the	crazily 19 increased	costs	of operating our	buildings .20 Everyone	must share	the	burden , including 21 tenants . No one	should	get	a free	ride . You ' ve 22 got to protect the	middle	class , and	that 23 includes	us .24 It is irresponsible	for	legislators to 25 ask for low	guidelines . They are	short - sighted ,2 
2 wear blinders and are  fiddling while	New	York 3 burns .4 Caving	into pressure	by tenant	groups ,5 their	hate mail , certain legislators	historically 6 have given us lower	guidelines	than	the	PIOC 7 numbers indicate	we should	have gotten .8 In fact , over	the	last ten	years we ' ve 9 gotten	about	half of the increase	just to keep 10 even we should have	gotten .11 And	the	PIOC numbers	themselves	don ' t12 take all	the	increases	fully into	account .13 The	small	buildings	in the	outer 14 boroughs	are	in desperate	need	of  guidelines that 15 make sense in relation	to rising	costs . For 16 apartments renting	under $ 650 , a minimum	increase 17 of $ 75 . 00 should	be given . For	those	renting 18 under	$ 1000 , a minimum	increase of $ 60 . 00 should 19 be given . And with	apartments	with over	three 20 bedrooms , an additional	increase	should	be given 21 of $ 20 . 00 a room . And this	would	only help	to pay 22 for real	estate	tax	and	fuel .23 You	might	consider a  fuel surcharge .24 You ' ve done	it before and	it still exists for 25 rent - controlled	units .2 
2 You	might	consider a  minimum rent .3 Last , you	might consider	separate 4 guidelines with	buildings	with	twenty or fewer 5 units , especially those	in the	outer	boroughs 6 that are	most in danger	of being	lost .7 In the	past the low	rent	adjustment 8 was called a  " poor	tax . " It ' s not . It ' s an 9 equalization	process .10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You need	to wrap 11 up .12 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	One sentence 13 and I ' m done . Thank	you .14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay .15 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	The disabled ,16 the seniors	and	low - income	renters are protected 17 by different	government	subsidies	and programs .18 Please	don ' t force	owners	to bear	a19 responsibility that	belongs to society at large .20 Thank you .21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .22 Any	questions ?23 ( Audience	participation . )24 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Yes .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mr . Schleider has a2 

2	question .34	testimony .5
MR . SCHLEIDER :	Thank you for your Your building	personally	or buildings 
6 are how many	units ?7 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	I own	four 8 buildings , Upper	East Side , just	below Harlem :9 Twelve	units , eleven units , ten units , twelve 10 units .11 MR . SCHLEIDER :	And	all	the units	are 12 registered ?13 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	I thought 14 about	whether I was	going	to lie	about this . I ' m15 free market . I speak here	as president of an 16 organization , but I do  want to tell	you	this .17 My tenants	don ' t know that	they ' re not 18 regulated . Why ? I give	them guideline increases 19 or no increases	because	I feel	for them .20 I ' ll tell	you	what my rents	are .21 $ 650 to $ 1400	depending	on the	size of 22 the apartments . Why	$ 650 ? I have	Milly Gilbert ,23 who ' s a little older than	me , is on a fixed 24 income . She ' s not quite	low enough to be  eligible 25 for SCRIE , and I give her	a break	and I ' ve given 6 
2 her a break	every year . We negotiate	$ 5 . 00 3 increases .4 MR . SCHLEIDER :	So that ' s what	you ' re 5 referring	to when you say	you ' re doing your	bit 6 for affordable housing ?7 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	I think all 8 small	owners	are . Why ? Because	- - understand ,9 not - for - profits	get	salaries . It ' s really 10 not - for - profit . We work	physically . We do either 11 bookkeeping , as I do . And	when	I was	younger and 12 able , I painted	apartments	myself . I never	got	a13 dollar	for that .14 So if you	want	to call the	$ 10 , 000	a15 year I get from	my four	buildings	profit , I16 consider	it cooley ' s labor	wages .17 And	a - -18 ( Audience	participation . )19 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	- - lot	of 20 small	owners	don ' t get	paid for their effort , and 21 no where	is it taken into	consideration , the 22 maintenance . You	know , it ' s part	of what	we do .23 So I think	we ' re a special	breed and 24 need special	consideration .25 We are	tenants . We saved	our money .2 
2 I ' m a former	school	teacher . I saved	my nickels 3 and dimes	and invested	in a dilapidated	old 4 rat - infested	building . I took	my plans , I walked 5 to the	bank	and	I sold	it . I mean	I did 6 everything . I was there	everyday . It was	gut 7 renovation . It was	my life	for	ten years .8 Am I a  smart business person ? If I9 were , I would have	sold . In fact , I lied	to my 10 husband . He wants me to sell . And	I told	him they 11 didn ' t offer	me enough	money .12 Help us .13 I don ' t need this	for me . I ' m talking 14 about	those	owners	who ' ve got	stabilized	units 15 who have	rents at $ 450 , $ 650 and	$ 750 , and	a16 three	percent guideline	does not	amount	to a lot 17 of money . They need	your help .18 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Thank you .19 MR . KIMMEL :	I have	a question .20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Go ahead . Sure .21 MR . KIMMEL :	I ' d just like	to say , you 22 know , I appreciate	your	coming .23 My question for you	is what	would	you 24 propose - - you know , given	that - -25 A VOICE :	Speak into	the	mike , please .2 

23	hear you .456
MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	It ' s hard	to MR . KIMMEL :	Okay .I ' ll try to speak	up . Okay ?We ' ve had	a lot of testimony  from 
 7 small	- - owners	of relatively	small	numbers 8 of rent stabilized	units , six , twelve , fifteen ,9 whatever .10 We ' ve had	very	few owners - -11 A VOICE :	We can ' t hear	you .12 MR . KIMMEL :	- - testify	that own , you 13 know , the	hundreds	or thousands of rent 14 stabilized units , which	- - my understanding	is 15 that the	vast majority	of the	rent stabilized 16 units	are	owned	by owners	of thousands of  rent 17 stabilized units .18 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	The numbers 19 are funny .20 Yes , in terms	of number	of apartments , 21	- -22 MR . KIMMEL :	Going	by numbers	of rent 23 stabilized apartments , the	vast majority	of the 24 one million	or so rent	stabilized	apartments are 25 owned	by a small	number	of individuals .22 
2 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	But more	than 3 sixty	percent of those	owners	are	small	owners .4 MR . KIMMEL :	Right .5 But	I - -6 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	And - -7 MR . KIMMEL :	I agree . I understand .8 Right .9 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	The numbers 10 are funny	that way .11 MR . KIMMEL :	I get - -12 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	So all	I ' m13 saying	is maybe	you	should	give us separate 14 guidelines . How	about that ?15 MR . KIMMEL :	Excuse	me ?16 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	Maybe	we need 17 separate	guidelines , especially the	owners	- -18 MR . KIMMEL :	Well , that ' s what	I want 19 to ask . Like	what - - assuming	that , you	know , - -20 I mean	I think the	reason	why	you ' re here partly 21 is because people are more	sympathetic to small 22 business	owners	than large	business	owners , even 23 though	large	business owners represent the	vast 24 majority	of the	units that	are	under	our 25 jurisdiction .2 
2 So what	would	you	recommend	that this 3 Board	- - if we were	going	to do something to  help 4 small	property owners , - -5 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	All right .6 MR . KIMMEL :	- - what	would	that	be ?7 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	Give us a8 separate	guideline . Give us a minimum rent	or a9 minimum rent	increase on the schedule  - and	I10 have copies	for	you	- on the  schedule that	I11 itemized , that I read .12 MR . KIMMEL :	Thank you .13 MS . HOLDER :	And	I have	a question .14 I do appreciate that	you	came here	to 15 testify today . And	you	were saying that	you	have 16 a tenant	that you actually	are	giving what	sounds 17 like a  concessionary or preferential	rent because 18 of her	being	on fixed income and	being 19 vulnerable .20 But	what are we supposed	to  do about 21 those	landlords	who	won ' t be as generous	or as 22 kind as you	are , and by placing a minimum  rent 23 actually	make these	apartments	unaffordable	for 24 that very	same type	of person ?25 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	Well , you 2 
2 know , it ' s a very tough	thing .3 Honestly , many , many	tenants who get 4 stabilization don ' t need it . I have	a friend who 5 runs a women ' s health clinic and	she	gets over	$ 26 million net	- - not	gross , net	a year	- - which is ,7 gross	is the	overall and then	you	have to deduct 8 - - $ 2 million .9 And	she	had an apartment	on Sutton 10 Place	that was stabilized . And	a couple	of years 11 ago when	they were	doing the deregulation of 12 $ 2000	a month or more , she	actually	came	to me 13 wanting to protect	her	stabilized	status .14 She ' s not	alone .15 I make	a silly suggestion .  If tenants 16 receive subsidy , maybe	they should open	their 17 books	as we do  every year	so that	they are 18 entitled	because	I think a lot	of tenants who get 19 stabilization earn	a lot more	than we small 20 owners	do .21 I cannot speak for the large owners .22 After	all , who does	have sympathy	for somebody 23 with a very	large building	who	is making	a lot	of 24 money . But I think	that	even they	may be in 25 trouble in this	economy . I really	do .2 
2 So what	do we do ?3 We can ' t penalize . You know , you hear 4 a lot	of testimony	about owners in the past	not 5 doing	what they	should	do . When I was a  teacher 6 in Harlem , I couldn ' t be good . I had	to be better 7 than good	because I was	on the	firing line .8 And	I feel	as  a owner that	I didn ' t9 change	that	opinion	that much . I ' m on the firing 10 line . But	I don ' t know	how	you	can paint	all 11 owners	with	one	brush because	there	are	a few 12 owners	who don ' t do a good	job .13 And	it ' s not easy	managing	a building .14 I did	manage	a building , a few	buildings , on the 15 Upper	East Side , 106 th Street	and	Third	Avenue .16 It was	tough	I got	to tell	you .17 In fact , Carolyn	Maloney	years	ago 18 when she	was	with City	Council , brought	my name 19 up as saving	these	buildings from	going	into the 20 HPD program .21 But	it sucked	my blood because	we had 22 drug addicts	hanging out in the vestibule ,23 kicking the	door	open , people	- - you	know , it was 24 constant	maintenance . We had to have	somebody 25 living	there	just to fix the  front door	everyday .2 
2 And	you	don ' t know , when	you rent	to 3 somebody , that they ' re going to bring somebody 4 else in who ' s doing	things	that are	illegal , and 5 they would subdivide apartments , deal drugs	from 6 the front	section and have	the	family live	in the 7 other	section , and	then	call HPD	for	violations .8 It was	crazy , crazy	stuff .9 I have	sympathy for	owners . It ' s easy 10 to manage	my buildings	because	I have - - it ' s a11 rainbow in terms	of , you know , ethnicity . But in 12 terms	of economic viability of my tenants ,  they 13 are all working	people . So I don ' t have	to deal 14 with people	that	have time	on their	hands . And 15 there ' s a difference , you	know .16 So I ' m saying	to you , yes , we worry 17 about	our	tenants who don ' t have	money . I worry 18 about	owners	who	are going	to  lose their 19 buildings . Believe	me , they are , because	they 20 can ' t afford	the	fuel .21 What do we do with those ? There	are 22 government subsidies . Perhaps	expand	them .23 Everybody	should	have food , should 24 have shelter . And I do believe	this . But	it 25 shouldn ' t come from	the	private sector . And	I do 2 
2 also believe	in the	ownership	of property . You 3 know , I ' m a graduate of Queens	College , and	you 4 know that	social	concerns	are	very high	on their 5 agenda . You	don ' t graduate	Queens	College and say 6 I ' m going	to  go  into the business	world	and	make 7 a killing . You go out saying I ' m going to do  good 8 for the general	public .9 And	yet	I ' ve come	to  believe in the 10 American	way . I think it ' s the	best	way . People 11 take ownership of their	life , not	to ask	for 12 handouts , to work , to buy	that	building	and	take 13 pride	in it and	run	it , and at least	be  able to 14 get a fair return  on their	money , their	life ' s15 blood	and	their	labor .16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .17 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	Thank	you .18 ( Audience	participation . )19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Regina Shanley .20 MS . REGINA	SHANLEY :	Good afternoon .21 My name	is Regina	Shanley .22 I ' m a rent	stabilized tenant in 23 Woodside , Sunnyside , Long	Island	City part	of 24 Queens .25 Currently	I pay more	than seventy 2 
2 percent of my income in rent . I ' m on disability .3 I do get	SCRIE .4 Most people I know pay  at least	fifty 5 percent of their	income . This	is for	both 6 families	and	individuals .  A family I know 7 celebrating	the	birth of their five - month old son 8 has not gained income with	expenses . If their 9 rent goes	up precipitously , nine	percent , they ' ll 10 strongly	consider leaving	New	York . They	don ' t11 want to . Their families	are here . They both	have 12 family	here . They like	Queens . They	like	their 13 apartment . But their rent	may	make them	leave .14 Another	friend	of mine is a  senior 15 citizen enjoying	her independence	and enjoys 16 eating	breakfast . She has	the	same thing	almost 17 everyday , cereal	or oatmeal with	milk , slivered 18 almonds and	a sliced banana . Sometimes though she 19 gave up putting	the	almonds on it . Recently	she 20 gave up the	sliced	bananas	because the cost	of 21 food had	gone up too high .22 We were	talking about the coming rent 23 increase . I asked her what	she	would	do . She 24 said : Well , I may have	to give	up either	the milk 25 or the	cereal . She	was	only being	half - way 2 

2	facetious .3
I doubt	any of the landlords who  have 
4 testified	are giving up meals	in order to keep 5 their	buildings . But tenants are	getting	very 6 close	to that .7 They certainly	need	- - the	landlords 8 certainly	needn ' t to give	up after they	get	the 9 current proposed	incomes , rent	increases .10 I ' m talking about	these	increases	as 11 if they are	a done	deal	because they	seem to be 12 ( unintelligible ) landlord - favoring farce .13 Tenants	are hurting . You	can help	by 14 voting	for the minimum	increase or even	better 15 for a rent freeze .16 Thank you .17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .18 ( Audience	participation . )19 MS . HOLDER :	I have	- - I ' m sorry . I20 have a question .21 I ' m sorry . I have	a question .22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Question ?23 MS . HOLDER :	Yes . Thanks .24 You	come and testify	before	us every 25 year and	I really appreciate your	coming .4 

234	barely .56	coming .7
Can	you	hear me ?MS . REGINA	SHANLEY :	Yes . Just MS . HOLDER :	And	I appreciate	your Just in terms	of your experience , and 
8 you ' ve laid	out	what ' s going on in the community ,9 what are	you	seeing	in  terms of the	available 10 vacant	apartments throughout the	City and what 11 they are	renting	for and who ' s moving in them ?12 MS . REGINA	SHANLEY :	I don ' t know . In 13 my complex there	are apartments available . They 14 are mostly renting	out	to people	from other 15 countries . So there ' s been	a big	turnover . The 16 people	come	and	stay for a year or   two and	then 17 leave .18 What they ' ve been	told - - what	we ' ve 19 been told	- and	we are	not	- we ' re told	does not 20 want to be quoted - is that he doesn ' t rent	to 21 Americans , to people born	here	anymore , because 22 they can ' t afford it .23 Somebody said	in their building	-24 there	are	like forty buildings	in  the complex I25 live in , and	I know	just told	me that there	are 8 
2 two one - bedroom	apartments	in their	building that 3 have been	vacant	because nobody wants to  pay the 4	rent . They ' re $ 1400	to $ 1600 .5 MS . HOLDER :	How	much ?6 MS . REGINA	SHANLEY :	$ 1400	to $ 1600 7 for one - bedroom	apartments .8 We ' re supposed to be a middle - class .9 Woodside / Sunnyside	is not	a rich	community .10 $ 1400 / $ 1600	is a lot for a one - bedroom .11 MS . HOLDER :	And	where	do you	see 12 people	who are leaving	or can ' t afford the	rents ,13 where	are	they going ?14 MS . REGINA	SHANLEY :	Well , the 15 physician	I know	moved	out	to Denver	because he 16 bought	a house for	less	than he was	- - the 17 mortgage	was	less than	he was	paying	in  rent for 18 a New	York apartment .19 I know	a family who	moved to Seattle 20 because it ' s less there .21 I mean	I don ' t know	where they ' re 22 going . Otherwise , personal	experience is just to 23 move out	of New	York because it ' s cheaper .24 MS . HOLDER :	Thank	you .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .5 
2 Jimmy Silber ;3 Followed by Marcell	Rosenblatt ;4 Followed by Shelley	Hartman ;5 Followed by Victor Bach .6 A VOICE :	What	number are you up to ?7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Tenant No . 18 .8 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	Hello !9 I ' m Jimmy	Silber , Vice President of 10 SPONY , the Small	Property	Owners	of New	York .11 And	as Roberta	has told	you , and I ' ve 12 told you	year after	year , we ' ve come	before	you 13 to tell you	about the plight of the	small owner 14 and how it is  a totally	different	business	for	a15 mom and pop	operator than	it is for	somebody who 16 has a large	building .17 And	we ' re always	told that	the	Board 18 has to consider	affordability	when it considers 19 helping small owners .20 Those are	the	two	sides	that seem	to 21 fight	against each	other .22 But	when you look	at the	numbers , in 23 the last	fifteen	years , since	1993 , this	Board 24 has issued a  one - year increase of an average of 25 3 . 07 percent	for	one - year .2 
2 If you	look at the numbers	since the 3 Bloomberg	Board	has	been in existence , since 4 2003 , since	2002	rather , the increase has been 5 3 . 3 percent .6 So the	Rent Guidelines Board has  over 7 the last	fifteen	years	created	affordable 8 housing . A three	percent increase	is not	favoring 9 landlords , is not excessive . It ' s way below	the 10 cost seen	for running buildings .11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	So you think	it ' s12 fair , right , Mr . Silber ?13 MR . SCHLEIDER :	No , he doesn ' t .14 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	I don ' t think	it ' s15 fair . I think it ' s - - you	know	when	you	have a16 year like	- -17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	I got	confused . I ' m18 sorry .19 Go ahead .20 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	When	you have	a21 year like	2003 when	the	Price	Index	was	16 . 922 percent and	the	one - year increase	was 4 . 523 percent , then you are not	compensating owners .24 When you have	a year	like this	year 25 when fuel	has soared and everybody is affected	-2 
2 you ' re affected	when you fill	up your cars	with 3 gasoline , we ' re affected not only	by paying	high 4 fuel prices , but	our garbage bags	are going	up ,5 our exterminating supplies , our cleaning 6 supplies , we get	surcharges now for	gasoline for 7 plumbers , for elevator	company	repairmen .8 Everybody	is affected by this .9 And	this is the year	that you ' ve got 10 to really	help .11 The	small	owner - -12 ( Audience	participation . )13 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	The	small owner is 14 the backbone	of housing	in this City . And the 15 small	owners	are	the ones	that	fall	through	the 16 cracks	when	we have	excessive	increases	in costs 17 like we have	this year .18 And	they ' re not properly	compensated .19 And	why	is that ?20 Because	they have	by - and - large	tenants 21 who have	been in place	for	ten	years , fifteen 22 years , twenty years	and	they do get	this	323 percent increase	a year	and those	rents	are	well 24 below	what it costs	to run	the	building .25 This is not good	public	policy	to show 2 
2 to a small owner	that if he can ' t make it , he 3 should	sell	his	building , because	the people that 4 replace the	small owner	are not careful ,5 home - owning	owners	of buildings . They ' re 6 speculators . And	everybody	loses .7 So we ask	you	for	a longevity 8 allowance . We feel	that	you - - we used to have	a9 low rent	adjustment . That	has	been discontinued .10 We ask	to compensate owners who have	tenants for 11 long periods	of time . And	that ' s mainly	the	small 12 owner .13 I just	want to point	out	that this 14 Board	made an error	in your proposed	guidelines 15 when you	gave the surcharge for sublet allowance .16 For some	reason	as a package , you	eliminated the 17 ten percent	sublet	allowance that	had been	issued 18 by previous	Boards	for	an  owner to collect .19 And	I just	want to make	the	point	of 20 why this	is irrational	to remove	this , because	by 21 statute in the State the tenant is permitted  to 22 collect ten	percent	for	subletting a  furnished 23 apartment . If the tenant  can collect	ten	percent ,24 shouldn ' t the owner	be allowed	to collect ten 25 percent also ?2 
2 This is not a charge	that gets	passed 3 on to the	tenants . It gets	passed	on to the 4 subtenant . It does	not	come directly	out	of the 5 tenant ' s - -6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You need	to wrap 7 up .8 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	It doesn ' t come 9 directly	out	of the	tenant ' s pocket .10 So I ask you , please , to review	that .11 I think it was  an error	and please correct	it on 12 your final vote .13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We ' ll review	it .14 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	Thank you .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We ' ll make the	same 16 subs .17 ( Audience	participation . )18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You have	a cheering 19 section you	brought	today	this	time .20 Any	questions ?21 MS . HOLDER :	I do .22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Go ahead .23 MS . HOLDER :	Thank	you	for	coming	in .24 It ' s good	to see	you again	this year .25 Can	you	tell me in terms	of your 2 
2 buildings	how many	buildings do you	own ?3 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	My family owns	one 4 building .5 MS . HOLDER :	How	many units in  that 6 building ?7 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	A hundred units .8 MS . HOLDER :	And	how many	of those 9 are rent	stabilized ?10 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	About 83 percent .11 MS . HOLDER :	I ' m sorry ?12 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	83 percent .13 MS . HOLDER :	83 percent .14 And	what ' s the	range	of  rents of all 15 of  your units , unregulated	and	regulated ? What ' s16 your lowest	rent ?17 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	Well , I have 18 rent - controlled	tenants	too .19 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .20 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	But	the	odd	thing 21 is I have	some rent	stabilized	tenants who	have 22 been there since	1975 and	they	are now paying 23 less than	rent - controlled	tenants , if you can 24 believe that	- -25 MS . HOLDER :	So what ' s the	- -2 

2345	leases	- - 6
MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	- - because	they - - MS . HOLDER :	Yeah , I actually	can	- - MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	- - take	two - year MS . HOLDER :	- - because	I know	how	the 
7 rent controlled	apartments , how those increases 8 are taken .9 So rent - controlled and rent	stabilized 10 being	regulated	units and	then	the unregulated 11 are market rent	units , what ' s the	range	of 12 apartments ' - - monthly	rent on the apartments ?13 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	In the whole 14 building ?15 MS . HOLDER :	Yes .16 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	From	- - the	lowest 17 I have	is $ 480 for	a rent	stabilized	studio , up 18 to about	$ 3000 for	a one - bedroom .19 MS . HOLDER :	And	where	is your 20 building	again ?21 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	It ' s in Greenwich 22 Village .23 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .24 And , well , some of your	tenants	that 25 you ' ve been	- - of course , I know	that you ' re very 7 
2 involved	with your	building and everything . Do 3 you see - - I mean like	who , what	kind of folks 4 live there ? Are	they students ? Are they	seniors ?5 Are they	professionals ? Who lives	in your 6 building ?7 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	I have	a complete 8 mix of people in my  building because	I have 9 rent - controlled	tenants	that have	been there 10 since	the	' 60 s . I have	a couple that	are	in a11 rent - controlled	penthouse . They ' re both	doctors .12 So that makes no sense	to me . They ' re a lovely 13 couple . I don ' t hold it against them . I give them 14 every	service they ' re entitled to . But it makes 15 no sense .16 I have	rent stabilized tenants	who 17 have been	there	since 1975 .18 You	know , I have	tenants	who have	been 19 in place	for	thirty - three	years .20 I run a beautiful	building . I give 21 great	service . I  live in the building .22 MS . HOLDER :	I know .23 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	I ' m on a24 first - name basis	with everyone who lives	in my 25 building .2 
2 MS . HOLDER :	Right .3 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	So people love	to 4 stay there .5 MS . HOLDER :	Right .6 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	As all	small 7 owners	that	I know	in our	organization , we take 8 pride	in creating a beautiful	environment for 9 people	who live	in our	own	buildings . You know ,10 we ' re a community together .11 MS . HOLDER :	And	what do you  define 12 as small	owner ? You	consider yourself a  small 13 owner ; correct ?14 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	I have	- - well ,15 you know , I ' m an unusual example	in the	whole 16 world	of New	York City .17 But	I own	- - my family owns	one 18 building .  My grandfather built it in 1930 . I19 manage	it . I don ' t have	any other	people	helping 20 me . I  live in the building . My grandfather	was 21 the superintendent	in the	building until	1950 22 because during the	Depression	the	building	was 23 half full	and he had to  take care	of all	of the 24 chores	in the building .25 All	my family	have apartments in  the 2 
2 building . My cousins all grew	up there .3 So I consider	myself	a small owner . I4 don ' t - - when you say are	you	an  owner like 5 Lefrack or Trump , no , I ' m not .6 MS . HOLDER :	No , no , no . But I ' m just 7 wondering	in terms	of whatever is your 8 definition . I ' m just asking you to explain	what 9 your definition	is .10 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	My - -11 MS . HOLDER :	So a small	owner means 12 the number of buildings	you have	or is it the 13 number	of units	you	have , is it that	you	live in 14 the building , is it that , you	know , you	take care 15 - - I mean	what ' s your definition	of a - -16 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	I - - the	common 17 thread	for SPONY	members is that	they own usually 18 one building , they	live	in their	building . That ' s19 the common thread .20 I think	if you	live	in the	building 21 that you	own	and	you take	care	of  running that 22 building , you ' re a small owner .23 If you	have fifty	buildings , you can ' t24 take care	of them yourself . You got	to have	a25 management staff .2 
2 If you	don ' t have	a management	company 3 that manages	your properties , then you ' re a small 4 owner . You ' re a mom	and	pop operator . You take 5 care of everything	yourself .6 MS . HOLDER :	So you	don ' t consider it 7 as being	a set number of buildings ?8 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	If - - are you 9 talking in terms	of guideline ? What	are	you 10 talking about ? A guideline	to help small	owners ?11 MS . HOLDER :	Yes .12 I just	- - you	know , it ' s just - - you 13 know all	the	terms	that	we use	and every	year we 14 do this . And	it ' s just	very difficult for me  just 15 to understand what	the	landscape	is as you	all 16 present it to us  through your	testimony	and	to 17 really	just	understand	what it is that we  are 18 talking about .19 Because , you know , I always	- - during 20 the course of me being	a housing	advocate in the 21 City I ' ve always	had a different	picture	in my 22 mind of what	a small landlord	is .23 And	so I ' m just trying to understand 24 how you all	define	it . That ' s all .25 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr . Chair ?2 

2345	an answer .67
I ' m sorry . Are	you finished ? CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Go ahead .I think	Mr . Silber shoke	his head	as Yes , Mr . Schleider .MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr . Silber , thank	you 
8 for testifying .9 Just one thing . On the sublet 10 agreement , I mean you ' re allowing	a tenant	to 11 sublet	as an accommodation .12 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	Correct .13 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Okay . Fine . I just 14 wanted	to get that	out	there .15 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	But	also there ' s16 - - when a tenant	approaches the owner and 17 requests	subletting , the owner is required	by law 18 to give the	tenant	two	different	questionnaires .19 So the	owner , you	know , has	to use	an 20 attorney	to help	him with	the	questionnaires ,21 reviewing	the questionnaires , giving	an answer	to 22 the tenant with	a specific	time frame , when	an 23 owner	is expected to give	an answer	to the 24 tenant .25 So it ' s not - - you know , it ' s8 
2 something	that costs the owner money . That ' s why 3 we think	there is an error	in removing the	sublet 4 surcharge .5 And	as I said , it is only a  surcharge .6 When the	subtenancy	is finished , the	surcharge 7 disappears .8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	I made the motion .9 I was	in error . And	I intend to try	to correct 10 that error .11 However , what	will be will	be .12 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr . Chair , I just 13 wanted	to point	out , you know , that	there are - -14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	It wasn ' t there . I15 understand .16 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Your building	has	a17 hundred units ; - -18 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	Yes .19 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- - is that	correct ?20 All	right .21 And	in  your experience with	SPONY ,22 other	members of SPONY , if they had , say	- - about 23 how many	of them	would	have a hundred units 24 altogether ? Just	a percent .25 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	I think	I ' m the 2 
2 only one	who	has	a building that	size in our 3 whole	organization .4 MR . SCHLEIDER :	So most	of your 5 membership is just	one	building ?6 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	Most	members have 7 very small buildings . You	know , I ' m unusual . But ,8 you know	- - myself , personally , I actually	own 9 sixteen of the units because my  family owns	the 10 entire	building	and	I have	seven	family	members 11 that were	left the	inheritance .12 So , personally , I own sixteen units .13 So you	can say I ' m forwards in that	category of 14 units	personally	owned .15 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right .16 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	But	the	problem we 17 have in our	building is the rents . As I  was 18 pointing	out	to Ms . Holder , the long - term 19 stabilized tenants	are	paying	less in my  building 20 than the	rent - controlled tenants . So that has to 21 say something about	this process	as far	as how	it 22 affects tenants	that are in place	for a long time 23 because rent	stabilization	was	created to be  less 24 onerous than	rent control .25 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Yes .2 
2 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	But	now	the	rents 3 of rent stabilized	tenants	are	lower .4 MR . SCHLEIDER :	So - -5 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	Last	year this	was 6 recognized , I think , very	clearly	by this Board .7 If I can just	quote , quote , owners 8 with low	and	long - term	rent stabilized tenants 9 along	with escalated operating	and maintenance 10 costs	face the reality	that these	rents	are 11 increasingly	unable	to meet the operating  costs 12 of these	units . That was a statement	by Marvin 13 Markus , the	Chairman of the Rent	Guidelines 14 Board , June	26 , 2007 .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	He ' s not	a very 16 reliable	source .17 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	I consider	him	as 18 an expert	on housing .19 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr . Silber , just	one 20 other	question .21 We ' ve heard testimony , there are 22 tenants in dire	straits , one pay	check or less 23 away from	eviction . And	according	to the	numbers 24 that the	Board has	been	working with , which 25 admittedly are about four	years old , it seems 2 
2 that about twenty percent	of the	tenants	are 3 really	in this troubled	spot . All	right ?4 What about	the	eighty percent of 5 tenants who	can	afford	rent increases ? What 6 should	the Board	do about	those ?7 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	Well , I think	your 8 goal is to compensate - - you know , there ' s a9 reality in running	a building . It ' s a business .10 And your	goal is to compensate	owners so that 11 they can	stay in business .12 If you	have a  supermarket and their 13 meat costs go up fifty	percent	a year but they 14 can only	increase the price to customers	by four 15 percent , they ' re not going	to stay in business .16 If you	have a diner	on the	corner	that 17 you always go to have breakfast at , and	they sell 18 hamburgers , and	the	cost of hamburgers has	gone 19 up eighty	percent , but	they ' re only	permitted by 20 government to charge five	percent	more on 21 hamburgers , they	are not going to stay  in 22 business .23 So it ' s the same	analogy . But it ' s24 impacted	most strongly	with the small owner 25 because the	small owner	has tenants	in place for 2 
2 long , long periods	of time . And that ' s where 3 you ' re affected	the	most .4 And	when you have	increases	like we ' ve 5 had from	taxes , where you	had	a 16 . 9 percent 6 increase , which	wiped us out ,  in December they 7 told us there ' s a 18 . 5 percent	tax increase	to 8 save the	City and we pay it , we have	to pay	it or 9 you lose	your building , but you don ' t get 10 compensated .11 And	this year	fuel has doubled	and 12 everybody	feels	it and	it ' s escalating down	now 13 to every	other business . Everybody on this	Board 14 feels	it . And if you don ' t compensate small 15 owners	properly	this year , it ' s just	impacting 16 the same	problems over	and	over again .17 And	that ' s - - the	small	owners	are	on 18 the fringe . They ' re the	ones that	make it day by 19 day . And	we can	least afford to lose	them because 20 they run	the	best housing	in the	City .21 ( Audience	participation . )22 MS . CRUZ :	Mr . Silber , how	many	units 23 does SPONY represent ?24 A VOICE :	Can ' t hear .25 MS . CRUZ :	How	many	units does	SPONY 2 
2 represent	roughly ?3 ( Audience	participation . )4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	If there	are 5 questions , it ' s unlimited .6 Go ahead .7 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	We have	owners	in 8 every	borough in the City	and	the	units	are	over 9 a thousand that	are	represented by SPONY	owners .10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you 11 MS . CRUZ :	Just one	more	question .12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay . Go ahead .13 MS . CRUZ :	Can	you pass	along the 14 legal	costs	to the	tenant	when	they	request	to 15 sublet ? Is that	part of the lease ?16 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	No .17 The	sublet	surcharge	- - you ' re talking 18 about	the	sublet	surcharge	for	an owner ?19 MS . CRUZ :	Right .20 You	testified	about	the	cost that	you 21 incur	when there	is a subletting	request .22 Can	you	pass along those	costs ?23 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	No . That ' s a24 guideline	that the	Rent	Guidelines Board	comes 25 out with	each year . The	ten percent	statutory 2 
2 - - the	ten	percent surcharge for  a tenant	is 3 statutory .4 MS . CRUZ :	Right .5 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	That ' s created	by 6 the New York	State	Legislature .7 MS . CRUZ :	Right .8 And	that the tenant	can	collect	that 9 from the	subtenant .10 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	Right .11 But	if this Board	passes	a zero 12 percent sublet allowance , what	you would	have 13 would	be a tenant making  ten percent	above	the 14 rent for	subletting	and	the owner	getting 15 nothing .16 MS . CRUZ :	Right .17 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	That ' s not	fair .18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	What	are	we going 19 to do ?20 MR . JIMMY	SILBER :	Correct	it .21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mr . Rosenblatt ,22 Marcell Rosenblatt .23 No , Roberta . You ' re done . You ' re done .24 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	Direct	a25 question	- -2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	No question 3 Let ' s go . You	can	send us a  note . Send 4 us a letter .5 Marcell	Rosenblatt , is that	you ?6 MS . MARCEL	ROSENBLATT :	Yes , sir .7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay .	Let ' s go .8 Thank	you .9 Go ahead .10 MS . MARCELL ROSENBLATT :	It ' s a very 11 simple , but	devastating	equation . This kind	of 12 rent hike	means	many of us will have	to leave our 13 apartments , which , in reality , means	leaving New 14 York . We will , therefore , have	to give up our 15 jobs which means	no income .16 So high	rent equals	loss	of home .17 Loss of home equals	leaving	one ' s job .18 Leaving	one ' s job	equals	no income .19 How	much clearer	do we have	to make 20 it ? Please , don ' t make	this a battle	between the 21 have and	the	have - nots .22 And	the	well - off	are	not	thinking 23 ahead . They	will	lose the	very	worker - bees	who 24 supply	their	needs : The	shoe repairman , the 25 secretary , the cleaning	lady , the	child ' s2 
2 teacher , the	tailor , the artist .3 The	working class ' s salaries are not 4 commensurate	with the proposed increase . With 5 this projected hike	you	will literally , not 6 figuratively , but literally be destroying many 7 people ' s lives .8 Consequently , you	will be erasing	the 9 very thing that	makes New	York	the greatest	city 10 in the	world , its diversity .11 There is the landlord ' s argument about 12 oil prices . While fuel	has	certainly	gone up ,13 this was	a warm	winter .14 And	where	do you	suggest	the elderly 15 go ? They	will be forced	to move out . Do	you 16 really	think	they can start  a brand	new	life ?17 Shouldn ' t this be , finally , the easiest	part of 18 their	lives , not	the hardest ?19 These are	very	scary	times	for	many 20 reasons and	for	many of  us . You know , the whole 21 world	always	watches New York . So if the 22 landlords	would	make a compassionate	gesture 23 where	greed	is not	the	bottomline , I  believe they 24 would	actually be changing	the	world , a gesture 25 that would resonate	far	beyond	this	City .2 
2Thank you .3CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .4( Audience	participation . )5CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Shelly Hartman .6( Audience	participation . )7CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Shelly Hartman , are 8you here ?9Coming .10Followed by Victor Bach ;11Followed by James	Peyton ;12Followed by Paul	Podheiser .13MR . SHELLY	HARTMAN :	Hi ! Thank	you 14 for the opportunity	to speak .15 My name	is Shelly	Hartman . I own two 16 buildings	with twenty - one	units in each	building .17 Of these forty - two units , nineteen	or 18 just under half	have an average rent	of $ 541 . 00 a19 month . This	means should you grant an increase	of 20 five percent	for	a one - year renewal	lease , that 21 increase	would amount to $ 27 . 00 per	unit	per 22 month	for	those	nineteen apartments .23 Last year , my fuel bill	alone went	up 24 an average of $ 50 . 00 per unit	per	month .25 Owners	are	also impacted	by the	credit 14 
2 crunch . Unlike home	mortgages , most	commercial 3 loans	have five - year terms . Over	the	next few 4 years	when owners have	to refinance	their 5 buildings , they	will be forced	to pay higher 6 interest	rates .7 In my case	with a two - building 8 mortgage	each one percent	increase will	amount	to 9 an  additional $ 40 per unit	per	month .10 Whatever increase	you give	the 11 landlords	will not	be enough to cover our costs .12 So I started thinking where	does that 13 extra	money	come	from because	owners	have to pay 14 the fuel	bill and they	have to pay the bank . Most 15 of us do not	have large	savings accounts	that we 16 can dip into	to cover these shortfalls and	there 17 is no free lunch . Someone	has	to pay	that money .18 Now , as I said	before , I ' m an owner 19 and I was	speaking	as an owner . But	I ' m also a20 market	rate	tenant	in New	York	City . I ' m one of 21 approximately 1 . 1 million	tenants	who rent	their 22 apartments but are	not	covered	by rent control	or 23 rent stabilization .  We actually outnumber rent 24 protected	tenants that	amount	to one	million .25 But	after	reflection , I  realized that 2 
2 there	are	only two	sources	of money	for	the 3 subsidy that	goes to rent	stabilized	tenants :4 Deferred	maintenance and market rate	tenants .5 Market	rate tenants	pay	for	these 6 costs	and	market	rate tenants	are	the source of 7 the money	that owners are	not	allowed to collect 8 from their own stabilized	tenants .9 Now , I see	owners	here and	I see rent 10 stabilized tenants	here . But you	know who I don ' t11 see ? I don ' t see	the people actually	paying	for 12 rent stabilization . I don ' t see any	market	rate 13 tenants here .14 But	I have	a feeling	they are going  to 15 start	showing up here and	they	are not going to 16 be happy .17 Thank you	very	much	for	your time .18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .19 ( Audience	participation . )20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mr . Bach .21 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	Thank	you .22 I ' m Victor	Bach , a housing	policy 23 analyst with	Community	Service	Society .24 I ' ve been	watching the Rent	Guidelines 25 Board	for	some time	and	I know	members of the 2 
2 Board	always	face a difficult	choice . Tenants and 3 owners	present their situations as disasters  and 4 you have	to strike	a balance in steering	a course 5 between two	projected catastrophes to decide on 6 what is a  fair rent	guideline .7 But	for	at least	the	past decade the 8 disaster	facing	tenants	is very different from 9 the one facing owners . For	tenants , particularly 10 low - income tenants , the	disaster	has	already 11 struck . It ' s been sustained for years and years 12 and the evidence	shows	itself	in extraordinary 13 rent burdens	and	increasingly	severe	housing 14 hardships	as incomes fail	to keep	pace with 15 rapidly rising rent .16 For	owners , my observation	is that	the 17 disaster	always	seems to be pending , prospective ,18 somewhere	out in the future . We hear	a lot	about 19 rising	costs , but we don ' t hear about rising rent 20 rolls . And we hear	that	rising	costs	may	produce 21 a wave	of owner	abandonment in the future , but	we 22 see no evidence	of that	in any	property	tax 23 arrears .24 We hear	that some	owners	may be forced 25 to sell . In this	market	I suspect	if you	do sell ,2 
2 it will be at a profit .3 Yes , the Board has a hard choice  as 4 usual , but I would	urge	the Board	to err	on the 5 side of the	real	disaster	faced by low - income 6 households for whom	rent stabilized	units are the 7 primary source of housing .8 This year ' s CSS Making the	Rent	Report 9 provides	the	data and the	evidence for what	I ' ve 10 been saying	in terms of extraordinary  rent 11 burdens and	increasingly severe hardships .12 Moreover , the	disaster for	low - income 13 tenants is spreading to a  widening income  range 14 of tenants . The	near poor , those	between	a15 hundred and	two	hundred	percent of poverty , are 16 rapidly approaching	the	disastrous position	of 17 the poor .18 I ' ve been	struck	by the	proposal I19 heard	about	an across - the - board increase	of 20 $ 60 a month . By our	calculation the	results	would 21 be regressive . A  poor household living in private 22 rental	housing in 2005	had	a median	rent	burden 23 of 62 percent of income . About 68 percent of   poor 24 tenants paid	at least half	of their	incomes	for 25 rent . Once rent	was	paid , they	were	left	with a2 
2 residual	income	of less	than $ 5 a day , $ 5 a day 3 per household member to pay for food , clothing ,4 transportation , uncovered	medical	costs , school 5 supplies	and	other	necessities .6 A $ 60 jump	increase , how	will it 7 affect	them ? It will bring	their	per	capita 8 residual	income	closer	to just	$ 4 a day .9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Could	you wrap	up ,10 Vic .11 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	If the	RGB chooses 12 to institute	the	across - the - board	increase , it 13 will , in effect , extract a larger 14 bit of household	income	for rent , a bit	that 15 literally	takes	food out of the mouths  and 16 clothing	off	the	backs	of low - income	tenants at a17 time when	their	living	costs are	rising	as well .18 So  I can only	see	this resulting in 19 greater hardship , deeper impoverishment	and 20 rising	members of families	seeking shelter 21 despite the	Mayor ' s best efforts	to prevent 22 homelessness .23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .24 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	Thank	you .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Questions .2 

2345	testimony .6
MS . ADAMS :	I have		a question . CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Betty .MS . ADAMS :	Thank	you for your One	of the	things	that is very 
7 troubling	to us as  we try	to arrive	at a decision 8 this year	is that ,  of those giving testimony ,9 we ' re hearing only	from	the smaller	owners , those 10 who own twenty units , fifty units , less	than a11 hundred units .12 And , of course , we know	that it ' s very 13 different	if you ' re looking at someone who	owns 14 fifteen or twenty units	as opposed to someone  who 15 owns hundreds or perhaps thousands .16 First off , they have	further to spread 17 it .18 Secondly , they	are able	to negotiate 19 much better	terms in terms	of electricity and on 20 and on .21 That ' s one	of the	things	that is very 22 troubling	to us because , as public members 23 particularly	of the	Board , we see	in an 24 oversimplified way	our	responsibility as being	to 25 ensure	that	housing	is at a cost	that people can 7 
2 afford , but	also	to ensure	that there is decent 3 housing available .4 We only	have to look	at different 5 parts	of the	City and we can see	what has already 6 been done .7 Our	mandate , or the	legislation	under 8 which	we operate , does	not	allow	us  to separate 9 the , quote , good	landlords	from the , quote , bad 10 landlords . It does	not	allow us to separate	out 11 the big landlords from	the	small	landlords .12 And	so  that is a part of  the  dilemma 13 that we are	struggling	with .14 I ' ve read	your	studies and	they ' re 15 very good	with regard to the income	of people .16 That too	just makes	our	job the more	difficult 17 because at a  time when	people ' s incomes	are 18 either	holding or declining , their rent , like 19 food , like transportation , like everything	else ,20 is going	up .21 So that	is our	dilemma .22 Do you	have anything	else that	you	can 23 offer	us that would	be helpful	in coming	to a24 reasoned	decision with	regard	to rents ?25 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	While	I ' ve been 2 
2 struck	just	sitting	here today listening	to the 3 evidence	of the	small property owners , which is 4 anecdotal , it ' s not	systematic	- - and I ' m sure 5 that they	are , their complaints have	some 6 validity	- - but	I was struck by the	fact	that 7 many of them	or most of them have	unregulated 8 units	now , units	that are	renting	at market	rate .9 Now , there	is nothing wrong , if you 10 have an unregulated	unit , in renting	it at a11 market	rent . It doesn ' t mean that	market	renters 12 are subsidizing	anyone . They are	simply	paying 13 the market rent .14 But	it  does allow , those	units	do 15 allow	owners , small	property owners ,  to have the 16 money	they need	to meet , at a time when	they need 17 to meet , rising	costs .18 And	I suspect	that those	market 19 tenants will	be able to bear increasing	rents 20 over time	that will	help cover those	costs .21 That ' s the	way	market economics	works .22 I see	nothing wrong	with it . If a small	property 23 owner	is fortunate	enough	to have	market	rent 24 units , those	are	a good	cushion against	rising 25 costs . That	burden	should	not	necessarily be 2 
2 passed	on to all	tenants .3 MS . ADAMS :	Thank	you .4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you 5 ( Audience	participation . )6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mr . Schleider has a7 question .8 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Thank you	for	your 9 testimony .10 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	Thank	you .11 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Thank you	for	your 12 interesting	reports .13 A couple of things .14 First , if you	say	the small	building 15 owners	come	here	and their	evidence	presented is 16 anecdotal , yet the	stats that	you	present are 17 somehow , I guess , implied	to be non - anecdotal or 18 carry	more weight - -19 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	I really	should 20 explain .21 When I - -22 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Please	do .23 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	- - use the term 24 " anecdotal , " that ' s a technical term .25 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Fine .2 
2 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	It means	a3 case - by - case	evidence rather than	a large 4 population .5 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Great .6 Yet	when - - yet you ' re eager to grasp 7 on to having	deregulated units across - the - board 8 contribute to landlords , both	large	and	small , to 9 their	bottomline .10 And , in fact , if you	would	take	a look 11 at our	latest Income and Expense	Report , you ' ll 12 see that	the	rate of not only	rent growth but 13 income	growth , which I  guess would capture	other 14 aspects of the landlord ' s ability	to generate 15 revenues , still	is growing	at a slower rate	than 16 expenses . All right ?17 So you ' re an economist or you have 18 some bent	towards economics .19 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	I would	think it 20 depends on - -21 MR . SCHLEIDER :	What happens as 22 expenses	outstrip the rate	of growth	of income ?23 And	please	keep in mind	that we do 24 have distressed	properties	in this City . It ' s25 between ten	and	eleven	percent	of  the housing 2 
2 stock , which	is mostly	the	smaller buildings are 3 in a technical state , not	anecdotal , technical 4 state	of distress .5 So I ' d like to hear	your	take on that .6 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	Well , I think for 7 the owner	I  would assume the question is not 8 whether the	net	return	is  decreasing . It will 9 obviously	decrease	when	rents	are	being	outpaced 10 by rising	costs .11 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Yes .12 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	The question	is 13 whether the	net	return	on investment	is  a good 14 one .15 Now	I think that	owners	are 16 entrepreneurs . They	make good	investments . They 17 make bad	investments . This	is a tough time	for 18 everybody .19 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right .20 According	to our	data here , the 21 estimated	growth	rate of expenses	over the	past 22 four years averaged	7 . 4 percent , over the past 23 five years or six years	it ' s about 6 . 9 percent .24 Your NOI growth over	the	same period 25 is . 4 percent and 1 . 5 percent .2 
2 It doesn ' t take anybody	with your 3 level	of education	to realize	that very	rapidly 4 we ' re going	to see	much	more of distressed 5 property	inventory	in this	City .6 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	I still	see	no sign 7 of it and	I see	a rather thriving	rental	market 8 out there .9 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Well , from	where	you 10 sit maybe , but - -11 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	From	what I see	of 12 the data	and	from what	I see happening around .13 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Okay .14 Then how would you  expect this	Board 15 to treat	the	upwards of eighty	percent of tenants 16 who can afford a  rent  increase given	the	average 17 rent in the	City ?18 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	I - -19 MR . SCHLEIDER :	There is no doubt ,20 and that	this Board	does not doubt that	there are 21 a percentage	of tenants	that can ' t afford an 22 increase . But how - -23 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	I certainly	would 24 argue	very strongly	against a flat $ 60 or a  flat 25 any dollar increase	across - the - board	because that 2 
2 has regressive effects	on the	lowest	income 3 tenants .4 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Yes .5 But	as we pointed	out and as you ' ve 6 made note	of , we ' re a one - size - fits - all , we ' re 7 boxed	into this . We can ' t get	around	that .8 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	Well , the rent 9 guidelines usually	are	a recommended	percentage 10 increase .  So at least those living in lower	rent 11 units , many	of whom	are	lower	income	tenants ,12 will correspondingly have	lower absolute	dollar 13 increases .14 MR . SCHLEIDER :	That ' s correct .15 The	percentage	on that doesn ' t cover 16 the landlord .17 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	Well , that depends 18 on the	landlord	and	how	many deregulated	units 19 they own .20 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right . I see 21 where	we ' re not	getting	anywhere .22 Okay . Thank you .23 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	Thank	you .24 MS . HOLDER :	I have	a question .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Sure .2 

23	questions .4
MS . HOLDER :	I have	a couple of The	testimony	that we ' ve received	last 
5 week and	received today	seems	to kind of muddle 6 the picture	of who	are	rent stabilized tenants .7 Could you	refresh	our memory as to  who 8 actually	lives in the units that	this Board 9 actually	has	a mandate	- -10 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	Unfortunately , I11 would	love to give	my impressions , but those 12 numbers are	back	at the	office . Okay ?13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You can	provide	it 14 for us .15 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	I can	provide them .16 I ' m sure	you	have them .17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We will	recirculate 18 them . The	staff	will recirculate	it .19 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .20 But	your evidence	showed	that a21 significant	amount	of these individuals	actually 22 have median	incomes	of $ 34 , 000	a year .23 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	Yeah . I think as of 24 2005 the	median	income	in rent	stabilized units 25 was between	$ 33 , 000	and	$ 35 , 000 a year .5 
2 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .3 And	then I think	you	also had 4 statistics that	showed	that sixty	percent of rent 5 stabilized tenants	have	household	incomes below 6 the New York	City median of $ 42 , 000	a year .7 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	Yes . If those are 8 the figures	that	we supplied , yes .9 MS . HOLDER :	Right .10 And	so  where do you	get	your figures ?11 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	From	the	2005 12 Housing and	Vacancy	Survey .13 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .14 And	so  what we are looking	at is we ' re 15 looking at folks	who easily , as your	testimony 16 today	has	shown	and	what testimony previously  has 17 shown , are individuals	who	cannot	reasonably be 18 expected	to bear	these	types of large increases .19 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	Yes . I agree .20 MS . HOLDER :	Because it seems	as if 21 the testimony that	we continue to hear ,  many of 22 it anecdotal , and no more	necessarily less	real 23 but not understanding what	the	magnitude	is , it 24 seems	to  paint a picture of tenants	who	actually 25 are very	well heeled or have high	incomes who are 2 
2 making	out on the fact	that they	have very	low 3 rents .4 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	Right .5 MS . HOLDER :	And	I ' m just	trying	to 6 make sure	that we understand as  a Board	who 7 actually	lives in these	units .8 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	Right .9 Well , I ' m sure	we can supply you  with 10 more of that	data or that	you	already have	it on 11 hand .12 MS . ADAMS :	We have	it .13 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	What	I do know	off 14 the bat is that , if you	look at low - income 15 tenants , in the	private	market	those	earning 16 below	$ 35 , 000 a year , that	rent stabilized 17 housing is their	major	source	of housing . It ' s18 about	42 percent	of low - income	New Yorkers	live 19 in rent stabilized	housing . And another	20 / 22 20 percent live	in unregulated rentals , about	20 21 percent in subsidized housing	and	the rest	are	- -22 a small portion	are	homeowners .23 But	the	rent stabilized	stock is their 24 primary source of housing .25 MS . HOLDER :	And	in terms	of those 2 
2 programs	such as Section 8 or even  Public 3 Housing , you	know , the	bricks	and	mortar	public 4 housing or even	project - based	Section 8  in this 5 City , how	easy is it  for someone	who	is low 6 income	to be able to  access these	types	of 7 programs	for	affordability ?8 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	Well , Section 89 vouchers	have a waiting	list of about 130 , 000 and 10 in the	past	the	average	waiting time	has	been 11 about	eight	years . I ' m not	sure what	it is 12 currently .13 And	public	housing has a  relatively 14 low rate	of  turnover and so does	the	rest of 15 subsidized housing . And	anyone	trying to move in 16 the current	market	is going to have	trouble 17 finding a stabilized unit , no less if they ' re 18 income	eligible	finding	a voucher	or a subsidized 19 unit . Very hard .20 MS . HOLDER :	Thank	you .21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .22 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr . Chair , just one 23 follow - up , please .24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Oh , my God !25 ( Laughter . )2 
2 MR . SCHLEIDER :	At $ 34 , 000	a year ,3 using , say , thirty	percent	of income	as rent ,4 that ' s roughly $ 850	a month . You	can	take my word 5 for it or you can do the calculations  yourself .6 The	median	Citywide	rent , $ 782	a7 month . So there	still is room	to come up to  this 8 thirty	percent of rent	level .9 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	That ' s the median 10 Citywide	rent for what	renters ?11 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Citywide .12 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	So it includes 13 households in public housing , - -14 MR . SCHLEIDER :	No . It ' s Citywide 15 rent stabilized .16 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	- - in subsidized 17 housing ?18 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Citywide rent 19 stabilized .20 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	It ' s for	all 21 tenants or just	those in the private	rental 22 market ?23 A VOICE :	Neither .24 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Rent stabilized 25 buildings .2 
2 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	So it ' s for	rent 3 stabilized .4 Very well .5 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Thank you .6 MR . VICTOR	BACH :	Thank	you .7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mr . Peyton , James 8 Peyton .9 Thank you , Mr . Bach .10 Mr . Peyton , are you	here ?11 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	Right	here .12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay . Hold on .13 Mr . Peyton ;14 Followed by Mr . Podheiser ;15 Frank Anelante ;16 Alina Perez ;17 Rose Wolf ; and 18 Juan Hugo	Antonash .19 Go ahead , Mr . Peyton .20 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	My name	is James 21 Peyton . I ' m a small	owner . When I say small , I ' m22 speaking	of eight units	and they ' re stabilized 23 apartments , studio	apartments .24 And	get	this . Out	of the	eight 25 apartments , the	highest	rent , $ 469 ; the	lowest 2 
2	rent , $ 300 .3 I am supporting the	people	there .4 And	one	thing	I have	carefully 5 monitored	since	sitting	here - -6 A VOICE :	Louder .7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You got	to move	the 8 mike .9 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	- - since sitting 10 here , each time	a person come	forth	and	talking 11 about	the	tenants , they	bring	it to the	landlord ,12 the landlord	thus and thus .13 The	landlord should	not	have to 14 support anyone , but	rather	- -15 ( Audience	participation . )16 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	- - at least	for 17 the voting .18 When I look - - listen to this ,  it 19 opens	up my mind	of the	shortsightedness , just 20 being	so shortsighted .21 Why	not	refer	it to the	City rather 22 than dumping	it on the	landlord ?23 Each time , the	landlord , the landlord .24 What ' s wrong	with let ' s get together	and	say to 25 the City	you	are	building	a ballpark	of  a certain 3 
2 amount	of billions	or millions of dollars . But 3 you cannot set up  affordable housing	for	us ?4 ( Audience	participation . )5 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	That	you have	to 6 come to the	landlord and expect the	landlord to 7 support you . I ' m supporting these	people . I am 8 seventy - one	years old .9 ( Audience	participation . )10 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	I am seventy - one 11 years	old , retired	from	the City , heavy	equipment 12 operator	of all	types . My God , in the snow	and 13 ice . Now	I should be able	to live	half way 14 decently	rather	than support tenants	that cannot 15 support themselves .16 ( Audience	participation . )17 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	This	is 18 ridiculous .19 ( Audience	participation . )20 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	It is honest to 21 God ridiculous .22 This should not have	to be .23 I can understand	the	tenants . One	of 24 them was	there since the building	was built . So 25 he ' s paying	$ 300	a month . My God , you just	hiked 2 
2 water	up fourteen percent .3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Where ' s your 4 building ?5 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	It ' s in Manhattan .6 MS . ADAMS :	When	was it built ?7 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	The	building ?8 MS . ADAMS :	Yes .9 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	Well , the building 10 is probably	eighty / ninety	years old .11 MS . ADAMS :	And	when did you purchase 12 it ?13 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	And	it ' s well 14 managed , well kept , and	I believe	well kept . I15 don ' t like junk .16 MS . ADAMS :	When	did	you	purchase	it ?17 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	Over	nine years 18 ago .19 MS . ADAMS :	Nine	years ago ?20 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	Yes .21 MS . ADAMS : And	how long	have these 22 tenants been	in the	building ?23 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	How	long have	- -24 MS . ADAMS :	The tenants	been in the 25 building .2 
2 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	They ' re paying ,3 but they ' re not	paying	anything .4 MS . ADAMS :	I ' m asking how	long	have 5 they been	in the	building ? Were they	there	when 6 you bought it ?7 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	They	were three 8 when I purchased	the building .9 MS . ADAMS :	I see .10 And	how	many units do  you have	total ?11 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	Eight units ,12 stabilized .13 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Are	you	saying	you 14 are actually	losing	money , you	are not making 15 any ?16 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	Sir , after	heavy 17 equipment	a lot	of years , my ears	are not the 18 best .19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	The question	is 20 whether or not you ' re losing money .21 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	Yes , of course , Of 22 course .23 MR . LANGUEDOC :	For	how	many years 24 have you	been losing money	on this building ?25 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	How	many years ?2 
2 Just about ever	since I bought	it because look	at 3 the rent .4 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Do you	have a5 mortgage	on the	property ?6 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	For	nine years 7 I ' ve owned the building , and here ' s a man ' s rent 8 only $ 300	per month .9 MR . LANGUEDOC :	So you	have no 10 mortgage	on the	building ?11 Do you	have a  mortgage on the 12 building ?13 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	Yes , I do .14 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Why	did	you buy this 15 building ?16 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	Because	I love	it 17 and the lady	gave me a  fair price	with it because 18 she happened	to like me .19 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Why	don ' t you	sell it 20 if you ' ve been losing money every	year for	the 21 past several	years ?22 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	Sir , listen .23 A VOICE :	He wants to live	there .24 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	I do want to  live 25 there .2 
 2 And , you know , the last	time I spoke 3 here there was a certain  person who	said	to me 4 here that ' s on the	Board why don ' t I sell it .5 I think	I - - come	on !6 MR . LANGUEDOC :	You	shouldn ' t have to 7 - - okay .8 How	much is the mortgage ?9 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	I forgive you	for 10 that .11 The	mortgage now	on it is , say , less 12	than $ 70 , 000 .13 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Okay . Thank you .14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay . Thank	you .15 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	I do not intend  to 16 sell it and	I do intend	to be there .17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We ' ll see you next 18 year .19 Thank you , Mr . Peyton .20 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	Let	me ask	you	a21 question , if I may .22 Do any	of you	all	- - do any	of you	all 23 have any	type of proposal	for	a person like	me 24 with a small	building that ' s supporting	the 25 tenants ? And	I have	an excellent	rapport	with 13 
2 them . I try	to keep	it because	they	themselves 3 realize , hey , I ' m not paying much . So what	can 4 you tell	me ? I would like	- -5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Well , the only 6 answer	we have is the - - what	we ' re mandated to 7 do , which	is to allow the	lease increase . We ' ll 8 see what	it is this	year . But	we don ' t have	any 9 other	tools	that	are available	to us .10 MR . JAMES	PEYTON :	You	know , even	if 11 you , let ' s say , upped the	rent	increase	to a12 double	digit , it would	be right , but	even that 13 would	not	bring	my rent	up  to  what it should be .14 This is ridiculous .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Well , I think the 16 best thing is for you  to talk	to your legislator 17 who has the	ability	to change	it .18 We don ' t .19 A VOICE :	That ' s what you should be 20 telling the	tenants , talk	to the	legislators .21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	They	do . They do 22 but they	want lower	rents .23 ( Audience	participation . )24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mr . Podheiser , how 25 are you doing ?2 
2 Good to see you .3 MR . PAUL PODHEISER :	My name is 4 Podheiser . And I ' m Chairman of Bridgewater 5 Tenants Council . And I also represent - -6 ( Audience	participation . )7 MR . PAUL PODHEISER :	2940	and	3000 8 Ocean	Parkway , two	buildings with	nine hundred 9 tenants .10 And	for	twenty	years	I ' ve been 11 bringing	a busload	of people at great expense  for 12 us to testify at these	public	hearings .13 I would	like to review with	you	how 14 the public hearings	are	conducted .15 First , the	landlord	and	tenant	members 16 propose and	explain	their	proposals	and	they will 17 be voted	down .18 Then Chairman	Markus	will make	his 19 proposal	without	any detailed	explanations . And 20 just like	a script	the	other public	members	will 21 blindly favor the motion , making	it a majority 22 decision , and once	again , a raw deal	for	the 23 tenants .24 ( Audience	participation . )25 MR . PAUL PODHEISER :	Chairman	Markus ,2 
2 you have	turned	these so - called public rent 3 hearings	into a  sham and shamefully	the	other 4 public	members allowing	you to do so .5 The	Rent Guidelines	Board has a  very 6 sad track	record	for granting	landlords	the 7 highest increases . Most	troublesome	to us have 8 been that	most of your	decisions	were based	only 9 on expenses	and	did	not	consider	increases	in 10 owner	equity .11 Council	Speaker Quinn has been	quoted 12 in Th e	Dail y	News as recognizing	this wrong . She 13 will move	her good	office	to have	the Rent 14 Guidelines Board	include and consider income and 15 expenses	in the	final decision .16 Renters	are relying	on the	Speaker	to 17 accomplish this	correction .18 If income , equity	and expenses	are 19 fairly	and actually	analyzed , the	Rent Guidelines 20 Board ' s decision	will probably show	no increase 21 for this	year .22 ( Audience	participation . )23 MR . PAUL PODHEISER :	Your	concern	for 24 landlords ' profits	- I expect	to get	booed .25 Your concern for	landlords ' profits 2 
2 are misplaced and overstated .  They are doing well 3 and making a  substantial profit .4 All	you	have to do  is check	the	DHCR 5 records and	they	will show	that there are only 6 two requests	for	hardship	increases	on file . Your 7 concern should be directed	to the	middle	class ,8 middle - class	renters .9 Rent for us are  currently over	fifty 10 percent of income affecting and reversing  our 11 quality of life .  It is very frustrating	to the 12 millions	of middle - class tenants	to have	the 13 Mayor ' s appointed public members , who should be 14 objective , continuously	grant	overstated	rent 15 increases .16 We come	to these	hearings because	we 17 feel that	if we do not	have a large	presence , the 18 increase	will be higher .19 In conclusion , you know , landlords	are 20 making	a high profit . Please be fair	and 21 concerned	that middle - income renters	are	having	a22 difficult	time making ends	meet due	to the	high 23 cost of living .24 Keep affordable housing	for	us . Keep 25 the middle class	in the	City . We need the cops ,2 
2 the firemen , the	police , the medical	assistants .3 And	I thank you for	the	time .4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .5 ( Audience	participation . )6 MS . HOLDER :	I have	a question .7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Go ahead . You have 8 a question .9 MS . HOLDER :	I have	a question .10 Thank you	for	coming	to testify	this 11 afternoon .12 I have	a question . What	kind of 13 increases	in your expenses	have you	experienced 14 as a tenant ?15 MR . PAUL PODHEISER :	The increases ,16 considering	that	we ' re losing	a high	percentage 17 of our	income for rent , means	a loss	of maybe I18 have to give	up my car , restaurants , gifts	to my 19 children , things	like that .20 And	I ' m not as bad off as some	of the 21 other	people	because their	income	is a lot	less 22 and they	have to give up more	than I do .23 You ' ll have to be as little	people 24 like myself	to understand	what	we ' re going 25 through . And	I repeat , and	I ' m getting old . If 2 
2 you notice - - let me add  to what	I ' m saying . If 3 you notice in the audience , most	of the	renters 4 are now frustrated	and	feel that	if they	come to 5 the hearing , it doesn ' t do them any	good .6 And	I feel	the	other	way . If we don ' t7 come and	give you our reasons	for	coming , and 8 perhaps you	think it isn ' t necessary	to hear and 9 to consider	the	rent increases	before you make 10 it .11 ( Unintelligible ) for	the	number	of 12 years	( unintelligible ) , you know	as well	as I do 13 statistics have	shown that	the	increases	have 14 been far	and	high above	what they	should	have 15 been .16 Thank you	very	much .17 MS . HOLDER :	Maybe	- - I understand 18 your initial	response .19 I ' m asking	you	have	you	experienced 20 any regular , reoccurring or monthly	expenses ,21 you , to your	household	that have	gone up .22 MR . PAUL PODHEISER :	Yes .23 Tremendously .24 MS . HOLDER :	Like what ?25 MR . PAUL PODHEISER :	Well , let	me put 2 
2 it this way .3 I used	to go out	and	buy	a pound of 4 fruit , a pound of tomatoes . I buy	one at a  time .5 I buy	two	at  a time . I look at the prices .  I6 can ' t afford	to pay	on a regular	basis $ 3 . 00 for 7 pizzas , $ 4 . 00 for a pound	of cherries . So if I8 buy anything	like that	today , I count what	I buy .9 And	if things	go along like	they are 10 now , probably going	to the	baker	he ' ll be selling 11 you a slice	of bread for $ . 15 or $ . 20 because you 12 wouldn ' t be able	to afford	the	other	necessities 13 of life .14 This is what ' s happening	today .15 ( Audience	participation . )16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay . Thank	you .17 Frank Anelante .18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We have	a system of 19 passes	for people who the	Board Members	have 20 requested . The next	scheduled	number , which	is 21 about	3 : 08 would	be No . 20 , Anne	Cunningham , on 22 the tenants	side .23 Alina Perez .24 Excuse	me . Mr . Anelante .25 Let	me just read	the	names .2 
2 Alina Perez ;3 Rose Wolf ;4 Juan Hugo	Antonish ;5 Geraldine	Littieri ; and 6 Anne Cunningham .7 Go ahead .8 MR . FRANK	ANELANTE :	I ' m been	a9 manager and	developer of affording housing	since 10 1980 and	am committed to its preservation .11 The	buildings	in my company ' s12 portfolio	are located in Washington	Heights ,13 Inwood , Harlem and	throughout	the	Bronx .14 Virtually	all were	built in the 1920 s , though all 15 were rehabilitated	at least once	then .16 I am both	an owner , and	I think	you 17 would	qualify me as a large owner ,  and also	a18 third - party	manager . And I ' m also	a large 19 third - party	manager . Some	of the	buildings	have 20 been in my company ' s portfolio	since	the	1930 s21 and forty	percent of the buildings I manage	are 22 owned	by not - for - profit	organizations .23 But	of the	buildings	I manage , ninety 24 percent , over ninety percent are	owned by LLCs 25 whose	members only	own	one	or two	buildings . And 2 
2 the predominance	of the	buildings	in my portfolio 3 are twenty , thirty	and	forty - year	old - - twenty ,4 thirty	and forty - unit buildings . Okay ? And	those 5 are the buildings that	I ' m concerned	about .6 They have	a typical	rent	of $ 674 a7 month	for	a studio	apartment , $ 739 for a8 one - bedroom , $ 803 for a two - bedroom	and	$ 890 for 9 a three - bedroom	apartment .10 And	these	are	the	buildings	I want	to 11 protect , the	buildings	with low rents that	form 12 the backbone	of the	affordable	housing in this 13 City .14 Eighty	and	ninety - year old	buildings 15 don ' t get	better	with age	and	must constantly be 16 maintained in order	to remain	physically	stable .17 Since economic stability	is tied to 18 physical	stability , once a downward	spiral 19 starts , it feeds	on itself . Buildings can decline 20 very rapidly . And if they	do and	if the	owners 21 don ' t have the money to provide the	essential 22 services , the quality of life	inequitably will 23 decline for	the	tenants	and the buildings  will 24 suffer .25 I care	about the	buildings	in my 2 
2 portfolio	and the tenants	who	live in them . And	I3 want to be able	to operate	them in a  proper 4 manner . But	I don ' t want to be backed into	a5 corner .6 Long - term	owners	like myself , I7 believe , are	an asset to the City	and we believe 8 we can	operate the	properties	as well or better 9 than the	speculators who might buy them .10 All	we ask	is  that we be given	the 11 resources	to do it .12 And	we  have to ask ourselves what	will 13 happen	if such increases are inadequate . Will 14 housing stock get better or worse ?15 Inevitably , housing	stock won ' t16 improve , will likely deteriorate	and	owners	such 17 as myself	will be forced from	the	business .18 The	Rent Guidelines	Board is faced 19 with a difficult	task and	an impossible	task .20 And , really , rather	than acrimony , the housing 21 stock	would	be better served if tenants	and 22 responsible	owners	worked	together to lobby	the 23 government to develop Section	8 and	SCRIE - like 24 programs	to subsidize the	rents of tenants	who 25 cannot	afford them .2 
2 There are	predictions that	oil	will 3 hit $ 200	a barrel , and	Mayor Bloomberg is warning 4 of upcoming	increases in real	estate	taxes . No 5 one knows	what is going	to happen , but waiting 6 until	next year	may	prove	to be too	late	to undo 7 the damage that	is caused	by ever - rising	costs .8 So in determining	the guidelines ,9 please	base	your	decision	both	on what has 10 happened	in the	past and what	is likely	to happen 11 in the	future . And	if you	err , please err on the 12 side of caution	and	give us the increases  that 13 will enable	us to keep	those low - rent units	on 14 the market and to hold	onto our buildings .15 I also ,  if anybody is interested , do 16 have information	on Section 8 availability , a  new 17Section 8 program that	HPD	has . They	do have 18Section 8 certificates	available	for	the	people 19who are qualified and who	can	apply	directly to 20HPD .21Thank you .22CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay .23Any	questions ?24MS . CRUZ :	Just one .25Thank you	for	your testimony today	and 

2	before .3
And	I think you told	us  this before 
4 but I just don ' t have it at my fingertips now .5 What percentage of all the	units that 6 you own are	rent	stabilized ?7 MR . FRANK	ANELANTE :	Virtually	all of 8 the units	in my portfolio , over ninety - nine 9 percent are	rent	stabilized . I have	one 10 cooperative	apartment building and I think	I have 11 maybe	a dozen or  so market	rate apartments , maybe 12 a few	more , and	that ' s it .13 MS . CRUZ :	Thank	you 14 MR . FRANK	ANELANTE :	Thank	you .15 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Chair ?16 Frank ?17 Thank you	for	your testimony .18 How	many units in  your portfolio ?19 MR . FRANK	ANELANTE :	Roughly 7 , 000 .20 MR . SCHLEIDER :	So - - and	you 21 characterized yourself	as a large	owner .22 MR . FRANK	ANELANTE :	Yes .23 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right .24 Just so the Board	understands what	an 25 impressionable large owner	is , what	would your 4 
2 definition of a  large owner be ?3 MR . FRANK	ANELANTE :	A  large owner to 4 me is what I see	happening	in the	real estate 5 market	now . It ' s these	large conglomerates ,6 primarily	I think funded by foreign	money , who 7 can come	in and	buy	New	York real	estate	at fifty 8 cents	on the	dollar	and	outbid	guys	like	me , and 9 that own	thousands	of units and that	are	trying 10 to really	get the rents	up in any	way they	can ,11 not the long - term owners like	myself	who	buy 12 distressed properties , rehabilitate	them	and keep 13 them in their portfolios forever .14 I bought my first	building	in 1981	and 15 I still have	it , and it ' s affordable	housing .16 I have	my buildings	in my portfolio 17 now , and	I shared those	operating	expenses	and 18 income	with	the	Board at my prior	testimony	- in 19 fact , there	was	a site	inspection	just last	week 20 of this property .21 And	this building	has no mortgage	on 22 it , it was rehabilitated in the late	' 70 s , and 23 the owner	- - it ' s owned	by one	individual , one 24 family , it ' s their	only	building	- - and	for	the 25 fiscal	year	ended April	30 th , it ' s earned $ 6 , 000 .2 
2 It ' s a forty - two	unit building .3 This building , if costs	keep 4 escalating like	they are , will	not be in my 5 portfolio	next year . The owner will	definitely 6 sell it and	there are buyers out	there ,7 speculators ,  that are going to buy it . And	it ' s a8 shame . It should	be preserved	as affordable 9 housing , but	our	hands	are	tied .10 We are	doing everything	possible to 11 maintain	it . It has	no mortgage . The	owner	did 12 everything right . In this	building the owner did 13 everything right . He bought it , he rehabilitated 14 it , he has been	running	it , it has Section	815 tenants in it , it has working	class	families in 16 it . The rents are very	low . The rents are too low 17 for us to sustain it . And	we ' re good	managers .18 But	there	is just	so  much we can do .19 And this	building will	be lost	to affordable 20 housing if we don ' t get	adequate	increases .21 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right .22 So what	I ' m hearing	is that	there	are 23 two types	of large	owners : There ' s the type 24 that ' s the conglomerate	and there ' s the	type of 25 you and your	brethren , your peers , who are 2 
2 managing	and	maintaining this	affordable	housing 3 stock	on a large	scale .4 MR . FRANK	ANELANTE :	Yes . That ' s my 5 belief , yes .6 MR . SCHLEIDER :	And	the	average	size 7 of these	buildings	I think	you	said	was	- what ? -8 forty / fifty / sixty units ?9 MR . FRANK	ANELANTE :	I don ' t even 10 have very	many sixty - unit	buildings . I have	maybe 11 three	hundred unit	or hundred	plus units	in my 12 portfolio . We have	over	three	hundred buildings 13 in our	portfolio . Most	are	twenty , thirty , and 14 forty - unit buildings .15 I have	some buildings ten units	and 16 less in my portfolio .17 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right .18 So you	don ' t have	these	five or six 19 hundred unit	buildings	in your	portfolio ?20 MR . FRANK	ANELANTE :	No , none	at all .21 I think the	largest	building I have	is 137	units 22 and it was built	under	a City	program and it 23 provides	some affordable housing . It was	a 70 / 30 ,24 similar to like	the	80 / 20 s , and I ' m a third - party 25 manager .2 

23	portfolio .4
And	we have another	80 / 20 in our And	the	rest is affordable	housing .
5 And even	this has rent	- - these are	rent 6 stabilized , by the	way , also .7 MS . HOLDER :	I have	a question .8 I appreciate your	coming	out as you 9 did earlier	in this	season	and	today . And you and 10 I  actually had a very good	conversation	at the 11 end of the first	panel	of expert	testimony	where 12 you presented similar evidence . And	you	also know 13 that I ' m familiar with	some of your	buildings and 14 I ' ve always	appreciated	your candor .15 You	have laid	out	for me  when we were 16 talking about how a number	of your tenants	- and	I17 know some	of them - really	cannot	afford	much 18 more than	what they	are	paying .19 I guess	my concern is is that there  is 20 this tension , and I hear you and	I actually , as I21 said , appreciate	the fact	that	you and I  have 22 been able	to have really candid conversations ,23 but what	are	we  supposed to do with	this	tension ?24 Because	I do know	from what	you ' ve 25 told me and	what	you ' ve presented	about	your rent 5 
2 rolls , that	you	are	trying	to  maintain affordable 3 housing and	you	are	trying	to  stay in the 4 community	making	sure that	you	are working	with 5 those	you	feel are	trying	to hold	true to what 6 their	commitment	is and	maintenance	of the 7 buildings	and keeping ownership of the buildings .8 But	then what	are	we  supposed to do 9 given	the	fact that	you	do admit	that many	of 10 your tenants	cannot	afford	these	escalating	rents 11 in the	very	neighborhoods	where you	all	are 12 managing ?13 What are we to do ?14 MR . FRANK	ANELANTE :	I  think there 15 has to be both a short - term and a long - term 16 solution . And I ' ll take	the long - term solution 17 first .18 It ' s really to me a societal problem .19 Everyone	in New	York City , New	York	City	itself ,20 benefits	from having affordable housing . And 21 affordable housing	is desperately	needed .22 And	the	government , the	State and	City 23 government , does	have affordable	housing	programs 24 and more	affordable	housing is being	built .25 That being	said , the	affordable 2 
2 housing we have	now	has	to  be  preserved . And on a3 long - term	basis	I think	what - - the	system	has	to 4 be changed . The	system	that we have	right now is 5 broken .6 And	I think we  should form	a coalition 7 with the	RGB	members , with	tenants , tenant 8 advocates , with	landlords	like	myself , and	go to 9 government officials and develop	a program	that 10 makes	more sense	and gives	latitude	to the 11 government .12 I mean	the	cost should be a  societal 13 cost . You	know , people	who	can ' t afford	the	rent 14 should	have	subsidies like	the	Section 8 subsidy .15 And	I do want	to mention , just	for	the 16 audience , HPD , Department	of Housing ,17 Preservation	and	Development , right	now	has	some 18 Section 8 vouchers . We sent a letter	to everyone 19 of our	tenants just	last week , it was going	out 20 last week , informing them	- we did this	at our 21 expense - informing	them of this	new	program and 22 saying	if you ' re eligible , contact us , we ' ll put 23 you in touch	with HPD and	we ' ll get	your 24 application	and	we ' ll submit it for	you .25 But	the	long - term	solution	is making 2 
2 it a more	equitable	playing field	for the tenants 3 and the owners so that	society	picks	up the	cost ,4 not the individual	owners , because you cannot do 5 your job	properly . You	don ' t have	the tools .6 Okay ? And	it can ' t be placed on the	individual 7 tenants or the individual	owners . It has	to be 8 citywide . That ' s the long - term	solution .9 In the	short - term , because	you	have to 10 vote in another	couple	of days , the	only 11 short - term solution	I feel	is to give some	sort 12 of a low - rent adjustment to owners like	myself 13 who have	very low rents . We need	a bump , you 14 know , because a percentage	increase	won ' t be 15 enough . We need	a bump	and	then a percentage 16 increase	to get	us over	the hump	because	I ' m17 worried , if oil	goes to $ 200 a barrel , what ' s18 going	to happen ?19 I mean	this is the only	industry - -20 people	don ' t ask	us , the vendors	that we have ,21 the oil companies and the	utility	companies	and 22 the suppliers , they	don ' t ask	us when they	have 23 to raise	their prices . They just	raise their 24 prices .25 We have	to  come to you and	say	we need 2 
2 a price increase . But the	price increases that	we 3 have to bear	are	beyond	our control .4 The	City just	raised	water	by 14 . 55 percent . They ' ve been constantly	raising	water .6 They ' ve been raising	real estate 7 taxes . They	are	going to raise  the real	estate 8 taxes	again .9 Insurance	after 9 / 11 went through	the 10 roof . These	are	all	costs	that	are beyond our 11 control .12 As a large	owner , I do have	a little 13 buying	power . Yes , I do have some	buying	power .14 But not as much	as people	think . We are	still 15 suffering . Just	as small owners are	suffering , we 16 are suffering too . And	my buildings , it ' s an 17 individual building - by - building basis .18 Buildings	have	to be healthy . They 19 have to be healthy . This is an important	resource 20 and we have	to protect	it .21 So I would	say	short - term we need	some 22 relief	in the form	of some	sort of a low	rent 23 adjustment and at least	10 to 15  percent 24 increases .25 And	then we have	to , before	next year ,2 
2 we have to form	a coalition with	tenants , with 3 tenant	advocates , with	the	RGB , and	get	to the 4 local	politicians and say	we need	a program .5 MS . CRUZ :	Mr . Anelante , thank	you	so 6 much for	coming	today . Myself	and	public	member 7 Kimmel , we went	to see	your building	and	we were 8 very much	impressed	with the work	that you	are 9 doing	in Washington	Heights .10 What I wanted	to ask	you	is that 11 building	in particular	was	completely occupied .12 MR . FRANK	ANELANTE :	Yes .13 MS . CRUZ :	And	the rents , as you said ,14 are very	low	for	the most	part .15 But	there	were	a number	of rents , in 16 fact ,  that you could get higher but	you	don ' t17 charge	the tenant that	market	rent , or actually 18 it ' s a legally regulated rent , because you	don ' t19 have any	market	apartments	in that building	at 20 all . All	of them	are rent	regulated .21 If we were , or if this Board was  to 22 enact	a ten	percent	increase and	a low rent 23 adjustment , how	would that	- - how	would	that 24 actually	be effectuated	by a company	like yours 25 with the	population	of tenants	that	you	serve ?2 
2 If you	could give	an example .3 Let ' s stick to that	building that	you	showed 4 us .5 MR . FRANK	ANELANTE :	Well , - -6 MS . CRUZ :	Hypothetically , a ten 7 percent rent	increase and	a low - rent	adjustment ,8 how would	that impact and	how	would	you	actually 9 apply	that to your	building ?10 MR . FRANK	ANELANTE :	Well , the 11 mechanism	would	come about	that on lease	renewal ,12 we would	take the guideline increase	and	send out 13 a regular	offer	to tenants	for	a one - year or 14 two - year	lease .15 Now , there	are	two types	of  tenants in 16 that particular	building . As I recall , about 17 twenty - five	percent	of the	tenants receive 18 Section 8 subsidy . So that	kind of a  rent 19 increase	- - the	rent increase	would	be neutral	to 20 them because	they pay thirty percent	of their 21 income	and that ' s it . So the government	would 22 pick up on twenty or twenty - five	percent	of the 23 building , the Section 8 tenants . The	government 24 would	pick up the rent	increase .25 For	the	other	tenants , they	would	be 2 
2 getting a notification	that this	is the	rent 3 increase . We would	send	it out . And	in times like 4 this we would hope	to be able	to collect	it .5 On an individual	basis , tenants	have 6 come to us in the past , not  in this	particular 7 building	but	in  other buildings that	we ' ve had ,8 and if a tenant	really	shows hardship and they 9 are a good tenant , we do try  to work	with them .10 We do often	give	a preferential rent	to tenants 11 if they can	show	hardship .12 I had one	man	in 1812 Harrison	Avenue 13 when we took	the	building	from	the City . It was	a14 distressed piece	of property . He was	paying 15 something	like $ 200	and	he really	couldn ' t even 16 understand the concept	of a rent	increase . And	we 17 just kept	- - we  kept his rent	and	he lived	there 18 for another	five , six , seven years and he passed 19 away . And	that ' s what we did .20 So we do try  to work	with the tenants .21 Long - term	owners	develop a relationship	with 22 their	tenants . We know	our	tenants , we try	and 23 work with	them . We are	not	interested in 24 squeezing	every	last dollar out of a  building . We 25 want to provide	a decent place for people  to 2 

2	live .3
As you	saw	in that building . It ' s
4 fully	occupied .  When I first offered	the	Board	to 5 go  up to see	it , I did	have one vacancy	and	we 6 rented	it and we renovated	it .7 MS . CRUZ :	Right . You rented it to a8 Section 8 family .9 MR . FRANK	ANELANTE :	We rented	it to 10 a Section	8 family , that ' s correct .11 MS . CRUZ :	Right .12 ACTING	CHAIRMAN :	Any other 13 questions ?14 ( No response . )15 ACTING	CHAIRMAN :	Mr . Anelante , thank 16 you .17 Alina Perez .18 ( Audience	participation . )19 MS . ALINA	PEREZ :	Good	afternoon .20 Thank you , Mr . Chairman	and	Members of 21 the Board , for this	opportunity to testify .22 My name	is Alina	Perez . I live	on 23 Grand	Street	in Williamsburg . I am a single	mom 24 with five	children	and	my  landlord is already 25 trying	to get me out of with  a personal	use 4 

2	holdover .3
My only	income	$ 1 , 200 a month and	I ' m
4 already struggling	paying	$ 680 , more	than half	of 5 my monthly income in rent .6 Any	increase would mean	I ' d have to 7 cut back	on food , milk	or clothes	for my kids .8 The $ 60 minimum	increase some	people	are 9 proposing	would	be nearly	nine	percent of my 10 current rent .11 I ' ve been	in my apartment for  sixteen 12 years	and	with each	new	lease	I ' ve paid	an 13 increase , even in years	when costs didn ' t go up .14 Please	look at the whole	picture and 15 be fair to my family and  be fair	to families like 16 mine .17 Thank you .18 ACTING	CHAIRMAN :	Thank	you .19 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Good afternoon , Ms .20 Perez .21 MS . ALINA	PEREZ :	Good	afternoon .22 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Now , how many 23 bedrooms	did	you	say you have ?24 MS .

ALINA	PEREZ :	All right .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Rose	Wolf , are	you 16 here ?17 MS . ROSE WOLF :	Hello ! Okay .18 Good afternoon .19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You need	to speak 20 into it .21 MS . ROSE WOLF :	Good afternoon ,22 members of the Rent	Guidelines	Board , tenants and 23 owners	throughout New York .24 My name	is Rose Wolf . I would like 25 first	to thank you	for	the	opportunity to speak 6 
2 to you	today	and	tell you	why	I feel	the	Rent 3 Guidelines Board	must approve	a fair	guideline 4 this year .5 I rarely attend a public	hearing to 6 testify , but	as  I am sure	you	have heard	from 7 other	owners	during	this process , this year	has 8 been quite different . Costs are simply higher 9 than the	amount	of rent	I can	collect .10 I am a small owner of a  twelve - unit 11 residential	building on the West	Side of New York 12 and have	been since	1965 .13 All	costs	attendant	to operating and 14 maintaining	my modest property have	risen 15 rapidly . The	cost of fuel	this	year	has	been 16 overwhelming . It has been	the	single	largest 17 factor	in the increase	in costs .18 Following	by the	looming	14 . 5 percent 19 increase	in water and sewer charges	which is due 20 in a few	short weeks .21 Utility	costs	have far outpaced	rent 22 increases	that this	Board	has	authorized . The 23 range	of proposed guidelines will	simply	not meet 24 the cost	of running	the	building .25 After forty - three	years	of being in 2 
2 the business	of providing	reliable , safe ,3 affordable housing	in New	York	City , I am forced 4 to look for	alternate means of funding to 5 maintain	my property .6 Even at the top range of the  proposed 7 guidelines , it will	be difficult	to continue to 8 maintain	a small	property	such	as mine .9 It  is humbly requested that	the	Board 10 authorize	the most	generous increase	being 11 considered in order	to allow small landlords  such 12 as myself	to remain	solvent .13 Thank you .14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .15 Any	questions ?16 ( No response . )17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .18 ( Audience	participation . )19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Juan	Hugo Antonish .20 ( No response . )21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Are you	here ?22 ( No response . )23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Juan	Hugo Antonish ?24 ( No response . )25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Geraldine Littieri .2 
2 After Geraldine will	be :3 Anne Cunningham ;4 Followed by Sid Miller ;5 Followed by Adele	Bender ;6 Followed by Alan	Weinstein ;7 Followed by David	Robinson .8 A VOICE :	What	number are we at ?9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	20 . Tenant 20 will 10 be next . That ' s Anne , our	friend	from the Tempo 11 Hotel .12 A VOICE :	What	number for the 13 landlords ?14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	A lot	of people 15 missed . No . 92 .16 ( Audience	participation . )17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We alternate . It ' s18 not the way	it works .19 Go ahead .20 MS . GERALDINE	LITTIERI :	Thank	you	for 21 inviting	me , esteemed Real	Estate	Board , fellow 22 colleagues , beautiful members	of the	community .23 I own and	manage	a very	large building 24 in Brooklyn	as well	as seven co - ops	in Manhattan ,25 nearly	all of which	are	rent stabilized , meaning 2 
2 approximately a hundred	families	I manage .3 I believe	I am considered by  my 4 tenants as well	as by those who know	me to be  a5 good and	fair landlord .6 The	cost of running	a building ,7 especially in New York	City , is an enormous	task 8 requiring	tremendous amounts of energy , time ,9 ingenuity , phone	calls , paperwork , planning ,10 financial	juggling , and	last but	not	least ,11 sensitivity	and	caring	for	our	tenants .12 Rent stabilization places limits on 13 rents	to be charged	but	does not	place limits on 14 the enormous	and	escalating costs	of properly 15 running a building .16 If costs were	low , as they	were	thirty 17 or forty	years ago , there	would be no problem 18 with rent	stabilization . But costs , as we all 19 know , are	astronomical .20 The	largest single cost	of running	a21 building	is :22 Number	one , City	property taxes , which 23 as  some other people have	mentioned	the	Mayor is 24 proposing	to increase due	to an unfavorable 25 arbitration	with	a union . This	was in this	week ' s2 
 2 Crane ' s Ne w	York in fact ;3 Number	two , the high	cost of labor	and 4 benefits ;5 Number	three , the	high cost	of fuel .6 For example , in our	Brooklyn building we have  an 7 older	boiler	which	runs	on a cheaper	grade	of 8 oil , plus	we get	a special	rate . However , despite 9 this , in 2006 our fuel	bills totalled $ 43 , 000 . In 10 2007 our	fuel costs	had	almost	tripled to 11 $ 110 , 000	in one	year . In 2008	fuel costs , as most 12 of you	know , rise higher and higher	on almost a13 daily	basis .14 The	economic  forecast  for calendar 15 year 2009	for fuel	costs is even	higher	than for 16	2008 .17 It is important to take	care of our 18 tenants . I myself have	tenants	in need and	treat 19 all of my  tenants in  a caring	and	responsible 20 way .21 It is also	necessary	to maintain our 22 buildings	responsibly in order to create	a safe 23 and pleasant	home environment	for	our tenants .24 However , a fair and	responsible	rent ,25 in keeping with	the	tenor	of our	great City	of 17 
2 New York	and	in keeping	with the	alarming ,3 escalating costs	of running a  building , has	to be 4 enacted .5 The	solution is not	rent	stabilization 6 which	is antiquated . The solution	is for	more 7 government housing	and	City programs	to help 8 those	whose	incomes	are	not enough to cover	the 9 basic	costs	of rent , food	and	medical care .10 As each	building ' s income rises , so 11 too will	taxes , which can	go to funding	the 12 government - sponsored housing and	programs .13 As to the	Rent	Stabilization 14 Association	and	Rent Guidelines Board , both	can 15 be converted	perhaps to the best	management 16 companies	in the	City .17 I thank	you for your	time and the 18 honor	of addressing	you	all .19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .20 MR . SCHLEIDER :	A question ?21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Question .22 MS . GERALDINE	LITTIERI :	Yes .23 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Thank you	for	your 24 testimony .25 How	many units did  you say	you	had ?2 
2 MS . GERALDINE	LITTIERI :	Almost a3 hundred all	together .4 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Okay .5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You said	something 6 about	you	manage	co - ops ?7 MS . GERALDINE	LITTIERI :	Well , seven 8 co - ops	in Manhattan , five	of which are rent 9 stabilized , two	are	normal	rent , and	in Brooklyn 10 it ' s roughly	87 units are	rent	stabilized . I have 11 garage	spaces that	are	rent stabilized .12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	When	you	say	seven ,13 individual co - op apartments that	number	seven ?14 MS . GERALDINE	LITTIERI :	Not 15 buildings , no .16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	That	you	own ?17 MS . GERALDINE	LITTIERI :	Yes .18 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Now , the 87 that	are 19 in Brooklyn , that ' s an apartment	building ?20 MS . GERALDINE	LITTIERI :	Yes .21 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Okay .22 Now , the fuel	expense increase	that 23 you cited	for us , was that	just for	Brooklyn ?24 MS . GERALDINE	LITTIERI :	No . The 25 impact	in Manhattan	is even worse	because the 2 
 2 co - op board	enacts	enormous increases . So none	of 3 my rent stabilized	tenants	in Manhattan	pay 4 anywhere	near the price	per share	of maintenance .5 MR . SCHLEIDER :	I understand .6 MS . GERALDINE	LITTIERI :	Those	are 7 operating	at a big	loss , yes .8 MR . SCHLEIDER :	If you know	this 9 figure	offhand , from , let ' s say , 2006 to 2007 to 10 2008 , just for the	Brooklyn property , - -11 MS . GERALDINE	LITTIERI :	That ' s12 Brooklyn	where I have to pay fuel .13 Manhattan , I just	pay maintenance .14 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Okay . Just	talk about 15 that one .16 That ' s the	one	where	it went from 17	$ 44 , 000 to $ 110 , 000 ?18 MS . GERALDINE	LITTIERI :	$ 110 , 000 ,19 yes . And	this year	it will	be even more .20 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right .21 So you	have $ 110 , 000	and	you had 22 $ 44 , 000 that	you	started with . That ' s $ 66 , 000 was 23 your fuel	increase .24 MS . GERALDINE	LITTIERI :	Yes .25 MR . SCHLEIDER :	That ' s for	one	year ?18 

234	units ?56
MS . GERALDINE	LITTIERI :	Yes .MR . SCHLEIDER :	For	eighty - seven MS . GERALDINE	LITTIERI :	Yes . MR . SCHLEIDER :		So that ' s $ 758 
7 roughly a unit , just a  fuel increase	a year , or 8 $ 63 a month	just	for fuel .9 MS . GERALDINE	LITTIERI :	Yes . I10 didn ' t calculate	it like that . It sounds	to be 11 correct .12 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Sorry . Realities	are 13 realities . Living denial doesn ' t help anybody .14 MS . GERALDINE	LITTIERI :	And 15 somebody ' s fault . I mean , the	oil	companies	or 16 whatever . But the solution , I think	we have	to 17 help everybody .18 I think	many people	really	do need 19 government housing	and	special	programs . And many 20 rent stabilized	tenants	can afford to pay more .21 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Yes . Thank	you .22 MS . GERALDINE	LITTIERI :	Thank	you 23 very much .24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you 25 Anne Cunningham . You ' ve been sitting 7 
2 there	patiently	this whole	time . We appreciate 3 it .4 MS . ANNE CUNNINGHAM :	Good	afternoon ,5 Mr . Chairman , Members of the Rent	Guidelines 6 Board , and all present .7 My name	is Anne Cunningham . Today	I am 8 testifying on behalf of the remaining tenants  of 9 the Tempo	Hotel , formerly	known as the Commander ,10 SRO , Class A and	residential rent	stabilized 11 tenants that	live in apartment	buildings .12 Residential Class	A Hotels	and	SROs .13 Attached is a  copy of my testimony	of 14 December	3 , 2207	before	the City	Council	on 15 illegal hotels along with	articles from	the	West 16 Side Spirit	and	the	New	York Sun .17 The	illegal rental situation  has 18 escalated	drastically since last	year . Currently ,19 tourists	and	corporate	individuals rent	in over 20 two hundred	buildings in Manhattan including as 21 the buildings , SROs , Class	A hotels	and 22 residential	apartment buildings , also some	small 23 buildings .24 In Manhattan alone we have	lost	over 25 10 , 000	units	of affordable	housing . The	practice 2 
2 also exists	in Brooklyn , Queens and	the	Bronx ,3 therefore	contributing	to even	greater losses 4 across	the City .5 When landlords	are collecting $ 300	per 6 night	and	$ 2500	to  $ 3500 a week for	one	and 7 two - bedroom	units ,  it would be absolutely 8 terrible	to give	these	tenants	an increase .9 Tenants	in all	categories are 10 inundated	with MCIs	while	others	struggle with 11 MCRs , MBRs , fuel	passalongs and surcharges	for 12 rooms . The Rent	Guidelines	Board	does not 13 accommodate	these charges	in their decisionmaking 14 process .15 ( Audience	participation . )16 MS . ANNE CUNNINGHAM :	Current 17 Situation .18 People	on both	sides	of the	aisle	are 19 unsatisfied . Although the	RGB	should	make 20 absolutely no concessions	for	dishonest 21 landlords , they	should	certainly	find creative 22 ways to work	alongside	those landlords who 23 actually	are	honest	as  well as tenants across  the 24 City .25 Consequently , I propose	the	following 2 
2 recommendations	for	the	RGB :3 One , develop a system of checks	and 4 balances	to track landlords ' income	along with 5 expenses ;6 Two , send	surveys	to all	landlords .7 Those	that do not respond	should	not	be eligible 8 to receive increases ;9 Three , consider violation factors . Why 10 should	landlords	be rewarded when	violations on 11 their	buildings	exist and	they	already owe	the 12 City millions of dollars in fines ?13 Fourth , now , fourth , we may	have a14 little	typo	here . And it says : Require fair 15 market	tenants to register	yearly	along	with all 16 regulated	tenants because	vacancy	decontrol 17 statistics are not	reported accurately . RGB 18 should	strongly	recommend	this	measure to the 19 Mayor .20 Conclusion .21 I really think that	the	only way that 22 we can	create a change	is by knowing	all	the 23 tenants and	all	the	landlords	and	all the 24 incomes . That ' s the	only way .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .2 
2 MS . ANNE CUNNINGHAM :	In conclusion ,3 the need	for	reform	is urgent . I sincerely 4 appreciate the Rent	Guidelines	Board	and	the work 5 of their	staff .6 Thank you	for	the	pleasure	of 7 participation once	again .8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .9 MR . LANGUEDOC :	I have	a question .10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Question .11 Anne , we have	questions	for	you , a12 couple	of questions .13 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Ms . Cunningham ,14 there ' s been	a lot	of small owners coming in  and 15 saying	that	the	Board should really	pass	some 16 kind of minimum	rent increase	for	low - paying 17 tenants .18 And	I was	wondering	if you	had	any 19 comment on that .20 MS . ANNE CUNNINGHAM :	Well , I see 21 tenants every day of  the week	and	many tenants 22 come in and	say	they can ' t pay	their	rent . We ' ve 23 had two small business	owners	in the	seven	years 24 I ' ve been	assistant	there	and	they did have 25 problems .2 
2 But	on the	Upper	West Side ,  in that 3 community	on the	Upper	West Side , you also	have 4 small	business owners renting	to tourists . Many 5 of the	smaller buildings and the	brownstones 6 there	are	like two	tenants	left and	then	they 7 will have	ten or twelve	fair market	rentals .8 This area	I believe	is dying . You 9 don ' t see	much of it , you	really	don ' t .10 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Thank you .11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Next .12 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Anne - - I ' m sorry .13 Thank	you	for your	testimony . Thank	you	for	your 14 work in support	of your	tenants .15 You	were just	speaking about SROs ?16 MS . ANNE CUNNINGHAM :	Yes .17 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Thank you .18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay .19 Thank you .20 Sid	Miller , SPONY .21 MR . SID	MILLER :	For the record I22 would	like to state	that I have a disability .  I23 have a visual disability . I cannot see in  the 24 dark . Would	you	please	provide	a light so I  can 25 see my testimony ?2 
2 Thank you . I ' ll wait	until	the	light 3 is provided	before	I start	my testimony .4 Thank you .5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay . That ' s Mr .6 Miller ? We ' ll try to find	a light	or a flashlight 7 or something .8 We ' ll go on . Why	don ' t you	sit	down .9 We ' ll find you something .10 Adele Bender .11 Mr . Miller , hold	on . We are	going	to 12 find you	something .13 Adele Bender .14 MS . ADELE	BENDER :	My name	is Adele 15 Bender . I ' m the	Queens	Borough	Coordinator	- - can 16 you hear	me ? Okay . Sorry .17 My name	is Adele	Bender . I am the 18 Queens	Borough Coordinator	for	JPAC , which	stands 19 for the Joint Public Affairs  Committee for	Older 20 Adults .21 I speak	for myself as  a senior	and	I22 also speak for other  seniors throughout	New	York 23 City .24 Not	all	seniors qualify	for	SCRIE . And 25 if their	income	is just	slightly	above what	SCRIE 2 
2 requires	in order to qualify , they keep	getting 3 these	rent increases . And	it really	is a hardship 4 on many of them .5 And	remember another	thing . Many 6 seniors , unfortunately	as we get	older , we incur 7 medical and	health - related	expenses . And	many of 8 those	unreimbursed	medical	expenses	should	at 9 least	be able to bring	that income perhaps	into 10 - - in other	words , a situation	where	the	seniors 11 can qualify	for	SCRIE because	I will	tell you 12 that I speak	- - a lot of our members	that have	a13 little	more	money , a little more	of an income 14 above	SCRIE , they have	a lot of health - related 15 expenses , expenses	for	drugs , expenses for 16 doctors , transportation	to doctors . And	it really 17 makes	it extremely	difficult for	us .18 What I would like	also to do is - -19 what is important to many	of us is to stay	in our 20 communities . We cannot	move . There is nowhere 21 else to go . And	it ' s very	important	for	us ,22 especially seniors ,  to stay within their 23 communities .24 We don ' t want	to go to shelters . We 25 don ' t want to go to hospitals . We don ' t want to 2 
2 go to nursing homes . We need  to stay	within	our 3 communities .4 And	what these high	rents are bringing 5 on , not just	the	seniors , but	just let me  give 6 you one example .7 There ' s an organization	called 8 Vantage , went into	the	Woodside area . They	were 9 having	big demonstrations	and	rallies there 10 because they	were going	big time	to people	of all 11 ages having	the	supers	- - one	of the	tenants came 12 up to JPAC , the	supers	were going	into the 13 apartments , and	if somebody , like	leaving your 14 house	sometimes	and	you	leave	the	clothes around 15 or something , you ' re in a hurry , you ' re going to 16 work , they go in and they	say , oh , these	tenants 17 are messy , they ' re sloppy , they ' re not keeping 18 the apartments right . And	they	were	trying	to get 19 evictions , a lot	of evictions . And they	were 20 having , as I say , mass	rallies	there .21 Why ? Is it because the rents are  so 22 high ? And	the landlords	want to get	a hold	of - -23 get tenants	that	have been	in an apartment	for	a24 long time , they	would like	to get	them out	of 25 there .2 
2 This is really	scary . It ' s going on .3 It ' s there . It ' s Woodside . It ' s all	over	the 4 City .5 So , seniors and tenants	want to stay 6 in their	communities because community is  an 7 important	part of New York	City . Community	is 8 where	it ' s at .9 Thank you .10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .11 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Question .12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Question , Ms .13 Bender .14 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Hello !15 MS . ADELE	BENDER :	Yes .16 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Ms . Bender , thank	you 17 for coming .18 Would you	say	you ' ve encountered a19 large	number	of senior	citizens who	are	rent 20 stabilized tenants	that	are low income and	do not 21 qualify for	SCRIE ?22 MS . ADELE	BENDER :	There are people 23 that don ' t - - I know especially one	of our 24 tenants . She	lives	in Manhattan and	she ' s a25 member	of JPAC .2 
2 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Right .3 MS . ADELE	BENDER :	And	their rent	now 4 is a little	over	$ 1300 .5 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Right .6 MS . ADELE	BENDER :	And	every time	- -7 like , for	instance , now	as of July , you	know , to 8 qualify for	SCRIE , the	income	has	to be $ 28 , 000 .9 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Right .10 MS . ADELE	BENDER :	She	says every 11 time the	limit goes	up , they just	about	miss it .12 I mean	we got	- - you	know , the	seniors 13 got a whopping 2 . 3 percent	increase	in our	Social 14 Security , you know , and	here the	real estate is 15 asking	tenants to pay a  lot more	than that	of an 16 increase .17 So there is something very	much	out of 18 proportion .19 And	as  I said , this	- - I ' m just 20 thinking	of one	example	which	represents	a lot	of 21 other	people .22 So every time	they raise	the cap for 23 SCRIE , they	get	their bit	of an increase	in the 24 Social	Security	or whatever it may be , and	they 25 just about , just	keep missing	it .2 
2 And	I know	they have	a lot	of 3 health - related expenses . And this	goes for	a lot 4 of  people . So I hope that	you	will take	this into 5 consideration .6 Thank you .7 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Thank you	for 8 bringing	that to our attention .9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .10 ( Audience	participation . )11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mr . Miller .12 Mr . Miller .13 Are	you	here ?14 I see you . Okay .15 I think	we  have a light	for	you . I16 hope . I hope	it works .17 A VOICE :	What	number are we on ?18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Let me actually 19 read the	names here .20 Mr . Miller , who we skipped	over ,21 because of the light ;22 Mr . Weinstein	- -23 Is that	good for	you , Mr . Miller ?24 MR . SID	MILLER :	I can ' t tell	yet .25 Good .2 
2CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Good . Okay .3Well , hold	on a second .4Followed by Mr . Robinson ; who is 5Tenant Speaker # 22 ;6And	then Councilmember Jessica	Lappin .7That ' s the	order .8Mr . Miller , go ahead .9MR . SID	MILLER :	You rent - regulated 10 tenants are	nothing	more than	big	cry babies . You 11 spend	your days	twisting the code	so as to  suit 12 your warped	idea	of fairness .13 You	conveniently	forget	that before 14 March	1943 there	was no rent regulation .15 Before	1943 , you	could live	in 16 Manhattan	but only	if you	were	ready , willing and 17 able to pay	the	price , to pay	the	free market 18 price . Otherwise	you would	live in any of  the 19 hundreds	of viable ,  safe neighborhoods in 20 Brooklyn , Bronx , Queens	or Staten	Island .21 You	conveniently	forget	that rent 22 regulations	are	a temporary World	War II measure 23 that after sixty - five years are still being ,24 quote , studied .25 After we are all	dead , the	spineless 10 
2 legislature	in Albany will	still	be studying the 3 problem .4 Please	remember that	the	lawmakers	do 5 not care	about any	of you . The	only	thing that 6 matters is your	vote so that they	will not	have 7 to stand	in the	unemployment line .8 I am going	to give you the	real 9 numbers on what	it costs on average	to run	my 10 buildings .11 All	expenses , not	including	any 12 profit , comes to $ 350 per	month per	apartment per 13 room . Again , $ 350 per month per apartment per 14 room . If I cannot bring	in that amount plus	what 15 I  consider an acceptable profit ,  I am walking 16 away . Then the City	can	be  your landlord . What	a17 horrible	choice ! And the choice is yours .18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you . Well 19 done .20 By the	way , people can learn from	Mr .21 Miller . If you have	a problem , just	take	the mike 22 out of the thing	and hold	it in your	hand and we 23 can hear	you	the	best .24 The	light	is not	attachable .25 So he ' s not going	to stand	there the 2 
2 whole	time .3 Mr . Weinstein , Alan	Weinstein ,4 followed	by David Robinson , followed	by 5 Congressmember Jessica	Lappin .6 Mr . Weinstein , is that you ?7 Okay .8 MR . ALAN WEINSTEIN :	Hi !9 My name	is Alan Weinstein and I  own 10 property	in the	East Village .11 I have	a total of 107 units .12 Ninety - six units	are rent	stabilized . That	means 13 ninety	percent of my units	are	rent	stabilized .14 Today , a barrel of crude	reached a new 15 52 - week high	of $ 139 . 89 . One year	ago on this day 16 crude	was	at $ 65 . 95 . Do the math	because	that ' s a17 hundred and	ten	percent	increase	year over	year .18 It is not	just	airline companies 19 anymore that	are	passing off the	cost of  oil .20 Every	business in this	country	has a passthrough 21 for oil . Even the garbage	bags	I use	everyday ,22 they have	imposed a fuel surcharge on  their 23 delivery .24 So why	is it fair	that the	only	people 25 immune	to oil increase	in this	country are	rent 2 
2 stabilized tenants . Just think about	it . Even 3 rent control	has	a passthrough .4 Allow me to bring	the situation	into 5 reality for	you . I have	a rent	stabilized tenant 6 who moved	into a four - room	apartment	in 1983 . Her 7 rent upon	signing the lease was $ 285 . 63 . Her 8 current rent	is $ 632 . 75 . Thus , over	a twenty - five 9 year period	her	rent has just	a little bit	more 10 than doubled . That ' s twenty - five	years .11 That is unbelievable . Oil alone	in the 12 last year	has doubled .13 As a rule	of thumb for saving 14 purposes , it is said that	money doubles	every 15 seven	years . Let ' s even	be more conservative and 16 say that	money doubles	every ten .17 If her	rent would	have followed	this 18 formula , it would have	gone from	$ 285 in 1983 to 19 $ 570 to 1993	and	then again to  $ 1140	in 2003 .20 Based	upon those	numbers her current	rent in 2008 21 would	be $ 1546 . 82 . That ' s for	a two - room 22 apartment	in Manhattan , way below	market	rent .23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Two - bedroom ?24 MR . ALAN WEINSTEIN :	For a25 two - bedroom . The	Rent Guidelines	Board must	act 2 
2 now and realistically address	the	incredible low 3 rents .4 Tenants	who have	been living in their 5 rent stabilized	apartments	for	ten years	must be 6 given	a special	increase . I have	tenants	who are 7 stabilized at $ 1700 . That ' s not where the issue 8 lies . Those	rents below	$ 1000	never	really	move .9 I ' m urging	you	to consider	that	every 10 rent below $ 1000	be given	a $ 110	increase - -11 ( Audience	participation . )12 MR . ALAN WEINSTEIN :	- - and each	rent 13 stabilized apartment renting at $ 1000 be given	a14 $ 55 . 00 increase .15 ( Audience	participation . )16 MR . ALAN WEINSTEIN :	My numbers are 17 still	too	small . Please	do something	realistic 18 and effective .19 Many landlords	are concerned that	they 20 will be unable to afford  to heat	their buildings 21 or not	have	the	cash to put into	their 22 properties .23 I ' ve not even	addressed	real estate 24 taxes . Let ' s take my example from	previously 25 before . Her	rent	in 1983 currently would	be 2 
2 $ 2052 , still	below	market	rent	for a two - bedroom 3 apartment	in New	York City .4 ( Audience	participation . )5 MR . ALAN WEINSTEIN :	I didn ' t even 6 address the	water issue	which , by the way , the 7 end users	are the tenants . That ' s it .8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .9 MR . ALAN WEINSTEIN :	Questions ?10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Questions ?11 ( No response . )12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	No questions . Good 13 job . Thank you .14 David Robinson .15 Good ahead . Mr . Robinson , how are	you 16 doing ?17 MR . DAVID	ROBINSON :	I ' m doing	okay .18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Did your	employer 19 give you	time off this	time , or - -20 MR . DAVID	ROBINSON :	I  work for Legal 21 Services	of New	York . I ' m speaking on their 22 behalf	as well as - -23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .24 Go ahead .25 MR . DAVID	ROBINSON :	- - that of The 2 
2 Legal	Aid	Society .3 We represent low - income	tenants 4 struggling to stay	in their homes	throughout the 5 City .6 Is the	mike working ?7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Yes . You	can	just 8 pull it out . There	you	go .9 MR . DAVID	ROBINSON :	The	first	thing I10 would	like to say  is that	who	lives	in rent 11 stabilized housing , as was	mentioned	earlier and 12 I would like	to repeat , over forty percent	of the 13 people	living in rent stabilized	housing	are poor 14 and near	poor , within two	hundred	percent of the 15 poverty level . They	cannot	afford	the rent 16 increases	that are	being discussed today .17 I ' d like to also	point out	that	what 18 is not	at stake	today is the wisdom	or non - wisdom 19 of rent stabilization . The	legislature has	passed 20 the Rent	Stabilization	Laws and has	declared a21 continuing housing	emergency .22 The	Rent Guidelines	Board implements 23 that law . It does not pass	on whether or not 24 every	landlord throughout	the	City has some	right 25 under	the	Constitution	to make	as  much profit as 2 
2 they possibly can .3 I ' d like to point	out the many	other 4 ways in which landlords	have - - can	raise the 5 rents . They	act	as if the	only	way they	ever 6 raise	the	rents	are	through Rent	Guidelines	Board 7 rent increases . We know	there	are	Major	Capital 8 Improvement	rent	increases . There	are individual 9 apartment	rent increases that	are	completely 10 unmonitored .11 There is a  rent overcharge	system	that 12 doesn ' t work	and	landlords	get	away	with	illegal 13 rent increases each	year .14 There ' s the twenty percent	vacancy 15 increase	that landlords	got passed by the 16 legislature	in 1997 .17 There are	the	many ways	in which 18 landlords	manage	to get	rid of rent	stabilized 19 tenants that	Legal	Services and Legal Aid  lawyers 20 see all the	time , through	personal use evictions 21 and owner	occupancy	proceedings and	refusal	to 22 renew	leases , and phoney nuisance	claims .23 And	this resulted	in the	City Council 24 feeling they	need to pass	a new harassment 25 legislation	this	past year .2 
2 The	pressures	on low - income	tenants 3 are unbearable . And	for	the Rent	Guidelines	Board 4 to pass large rent	increases , large	percentage 5 increases , let alone a flat rent	increase of $ 60 6 that would fall	disproportionately upon 7 low - income people - African - American , Latino 8 tenants - throughout this	City	is unconscionable .9 And	I call	on you	not to  do this .10 The	other	thing that	is rarely 11 mentioned	is landlords	rarely	applying for 12 hardship	rent increases . If they	are	failing to 13 make a  reasonable return on their	investment ,14 they have	recourse	under the law	for	hardship 15 increases . They	claim that	these	are	difficult	to 16 implement , but they	never	see	fit	to change	these 17 - - the	laws	to make	hardship increases easier to 18 implement .19 The	other	thing I would	like to 20 mention is just	a follow - up on a earlier	point 21 about	sublets . I think	it ' s worth	mentioning that 22 tenants have	a right under	the	law to sublet .23 Landlords	cannot	unreasonably	refuse	those 24 requests . And there	is really	no cost to the 25 landlord	in approving a tenant	sublet . The	only 2 
2 costs	that they	incur are	when	they	make 3 unreasonable	requests upon	the	tenants for 4 information	that	they really don ' t need	to 5 process those requests .6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .7 Any	questions ?8 MS . CRUZ :	I have a question .9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay . Hold on one 10 second . Adriene , go ahead .11 MS . CRUZ :	Sorry , Adriene .12 MS . HOLDER :	No , go ahead .13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Go ahead , Magda .14 MS . CRUZ :	Thank	you .15 You	mentioned	that there	was a16 harassment law passed this	year . Can	you	tell me 17 how many	harassment	cases	you ' ve brought	on 18 behalf	of your clients ?19 MR . DAVID	ROBINSON :	I don ' t know . I20 don ' t have the numbers .21 The	law	has only	been in effect	for 22 about	three	months . So it ' s very	early in the 23 stages	to gauge	that .24 I do know , and	it ' s in our	testimony ,25 there ' s a lot of written documentation in our 2 
2 testimony , that	harassment	complaints to the DHCR 3 are up significantly over	the	last year .4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Adriene .5 MS . HOLDER :	Just a follow - up on my 6 colleague ' s question .7 Can	you	give us examples	of  some of 8 the harassment techniques	that	perhaps you , as a9 Legal	Services lawyer , have heard	about	or seen ?10 MR . DAVID	ROBINSON :	Examples	are 11 repeated	- - one	of the	examples that	we see	is 12 repeated	frivolous	non - payment	or holdover 13 proceedings	where tenants	are	taken	to court over 14 and over	again because	the	landlords	realize that 15 a certain	number	of tenants will	give up , they 16 won ' t answer	petitions , they won ' t go to court .17 Other examples of harassment  are 18 decrease	in services , veiled threats	that come 19 from agents	of the	landlord , either	supers	or 20 managing	agents , that if they	assert	their 21 rights , they	will pay the	price , either	they or 22 members of their	family .23 MS . HOLDER :	And	the tenants that 24 come to you , when you ' re looking	at their rents ,25 people	who have	been in places	as well as people 2 
2 who perhaps	are	new	to their apartments , what  is 3 the range	of rents	that	you ' ve seen	as a Legal 4 Services	attorney of people coming to you  seeking 5 assistance on their	eviction cases ?6 MR . DAVID	ROBINSON :	Most	of the 7 tenants that	we see	are	paying	upwards of $ 800	to 8 $ 1000	in rent , often higher . There is no other	- -9 and they	certainly	in the	open	market never	find 10 apartments in that	range .11 MS . HOLDER :	And	is  this - -12 MR . DAVID	ROBINSON :	We rarely	see 13 people	with	the	kinds of rents that	were	talked 14 about	earlier by the - -15 MS . HOLDER :	And	which	borough	are 16 you talking	about ?17 MR . DAVID	ROBINSON :	Really any 18 borough : Manhattan , Brooklyn , the	Bronx .19 And	it should	be pointed	out that	the 20 landlords	- - you	know , it was	talked	about 21 artificially	low	rents . The legislature	passed	an 22 amendment	to the	Rent Stabilization	Law	in 2003 23 to allow	landlords	in many	cases	to get	out	from 24 preferential	rents	at the	end	of  a particular 25 lease	term . They ' ve gotten	significant rent 2 
2 increases	as a result of that .3 And	I think that ' s something that	I4 neglected	to  mention in the opening	but	it is 5 worth	mentioning .6 MS . HOLDER :	Has	there	been a7 particular trend	that you ' ve seen	as a Legal 8 Services	attorney in terms	of the	condition	of 9 the housing	stock that	you ' ve been representing ?10 MR . DAVID	ROBINSON :	The question	has 11 to do with the condition of  the housing	stock .12 People	are	always	coming	in to 13 complain	about apartments	in poor	conditions ,14 poorly	managed and	poorly	repaired . However	much 15 they pay	in rent , often	the conditions are 16 deplorable .17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you . We 18 appreciate it .19 ( Audience	participation . )20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Councilmember 21 Jessica Lappin .22 COUNCILMEMBER	JESSICA LAPPIN :	Good 23 afternoon .24 My name	is Jessica Lappin . I25 appreciate the opportunity	to speak	today and 2 
2 your accommodating	me .3 I represent the east	side of the Upper 4 East Side	and Roosevelt	Island .5 Rent stabilization apartments 6 represent	a significant	part of the	affordable 7 housing stock here	in the	City	and I have a8 decent	number of affordable rent	stabilized 9 apartments within my Council District .10 To remain	a vibrant , diverse 11 community , we must	keep	our affordable housing .12 ( Audience	participation . )13 COUNCILMEMBER	JESSICA LAPPIN :	New 14 Yorkers who	teach our children , nurse our sick 15 and police our neighborhoods should	be able	to 16 afford	to live in our communities , and seniors ,17 many of whom	are	here today and have	spent	their 18 entire	lives	in our	City , should	be able	to stay .19 With each	annual	rent increase	we 20 continue	to lose	affordable housing . Between 1994 21 and 2007	over 71 , 000 units	were lost	from rent 22 stabilization due to vacancy decontrol , and	over 23 40 , 000	units	were lost	to co - op / condo conversion .24 As a City , we ' ve lost one - third	of our 25 subsidized housing	since 1990 . This	attrition 2 
2 needs	to stop .3 In addition to having a  significant 4 rent burden , many of my constituents	have to deal 5 with deadbeat landlords	who fail	to uphold	their 6 end of the bargain	allowing apartments to fall 7 into disrepair and	go without	necessary	services .8 I have	one	rent stabilized	constituent 9 who went	without	heat and	hot	water	for	three of 10 the coldest	weeks this	winter . His landlord	does 11 not deserve	an automatic rent	increase .12 I have	another	constituent	who	is 13 seriously	disabled , a senior , who	periodically 14 receives	threatening letters from	her landlord 15 claiming	that he is going	to attempt	to evict 16 her . And	these go to the questions you asked  of 17 the previous	speaker . Her	landlord does	not 18 deserve an automatic rent	increase .19 You	have a choice	before	you and I  am 20 asking	you to make	the	right one	and	to oppose 21 the proposed	increases . New Yorkers ' daily	cost 22 of living	continues	to creep upward	as the	prices 23 of food , goods , medical	care and	services rise .24 Many have	not had raises in their	incomes or are 25 losing	their	jobs .2 
2 And	on behalf	of my constituents  and 3 all who are	here	today	I ask you	to do what	you 4 can to keep	this	City affordable	for	those	who 5 work so hard	and	contribute so much . We can ' t6 stand	to lose more	of our	seniors	or artists , our 7 diversity , and our	middle	class .8 And	I sincerely hope	you	will reject 9 and reduce the proposed	increases	that are	before 10 you today .11 Thank you .12 ( Audience	participation . )13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Go head . Risa .14 COUNCILMEMBER	JESSICA LAPPIN :15 Questions ?16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Yes . Questions .17 MS . LEVINE :	Thank you , - -18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Go ahead . Risa 19 hasn ' t talked today .20 Go ahead , Risa .21 MS . LEVINE :	In the	interest of full 22 disclosure , you ' re my Councilmember	and	I want	to 23 thank	you	for the job that	you	are doing . I think 24 you are doing a  great job	overall .25 COUNCILMEMBER	JESSICA LAPPIN :	Thank 2 

2	you .3
MS . LEVINE :	What	we ' ve heard a lot of 
4 testimony	about	today is who should	bear	the 5 burden	of affordable housing in New	York	City .6 We ' ve heard about	tenants on fixed 7 incomes . We ' ve heard about	City workers	with 8 union	contracts	that don ' t allow	them to pay for 9 housing in New York	City while they	are 10 protecting New York	City inhabitants	at the	same 11 time .12 We hear	about	landlords	facing	110 13 percent increases in fuel	and	14 . 5 in water .14 Now , we ' ve also heard a lot	about 15 sidewalk	violations	and	the cost	of remediating 16 the sidewalk	violations	and the lead	paint	law .17 Those	costs	have	to  be  paid in one year	but	are 18 capitalized	over	the useful life , I guess , of the 19 repair	and it can ' t be recouped from	tenants .20 I ' m wondering	if the	City Council	is 21 considering , on the	one	hand , creditor subsidies 22 for City	workers . You ' ve identified	nurses	and 23 policemen . We certainly	care about hospital 24 workers too	and	teachers , et cetera , who	we want 25 to live within the	City	limits	while	they are 4 
2 benefiting people who live	in the	City .3 Is the	City Council	going to be doing 4 anything	to help	those	people ?5 And	on the	other	hand , have	there	been 6 any considerations	made	towards landlords who 7 have to pay	for	sidewalk violations	by paying for 8 repairs , et cetera , and	it may	be a9 disproportionate	amount	of their	rent roll ?10 Are	you	considering	any	kind of 11 subsidies	for those	people ?12 COUNCILMEMBER	JESSICA LAPPIN :	There 13 are lots	of different parts so I ' ll answer	as 14 many as I  can remember .15 One , I would be open	to credits . I16 think , in terms	of the	overall	question	of 17 responsibility and	costs , I think	that landlords 18 and owners have	a responsibility	as well . And I19 think	sometimes	they would	prefer	to abdicate 20 that responsibility .21 When you look	at costs and	you	look at 22 their	profits , as opposed	to perhaps	the	Consumer 23 Price	Index , I think they	are	still	profiting and 24 that should	be reflected in what	the	increases 25 are .2 
2 The	City Council	has	over the last 3 couple	of years	done property	tax	rebates . We 4 also cut	the	property tax	last	year . That is not 5 usually passed on to the tenant . They don ' t get 6 decreases , but certainly is factored	into the 7 owner ' s profits . So I think that ' s important to 8 point	out .9 I am certainly	willing to look	at 10 anything	in my role	as a Councilmember to  keep 11 the middle class	in New	York , whatever that 12 takes .13 But	everybody	has	to do their part .14 MS . LEVINE :	Okay 15 You	also talked about losing - -  you 16 know , reduction	in the	affordable	housing stock 17 due to vacancy decontrol , which this	Board	has 18 nothing to do with . That ' s the	State	Rent 19 Regulation Reform Act of 1997 . We don ' t have 20 authority	over setting	what the vacancy	decontrol 21 numbers are .22 And	you	also mentioned losing 40 , 000 23 units	to co - op and	condo conversions . Again , not 24 something	that we have	any	control over .25 And	I ' m wondering	if you ' re looking - -2 
2 the City	Council	is looking at the causes , the 3 specific	causes	of the	reduction	in the	housing 4 stock , and what	could be done	to address	specific 5 problems	rather	than just	calling	for - -6 COUNCILMEMBER	JESSICA LAPPIN :	We 7 need home	rule . And	I ' m a big	proponent	of home 8 rule .9 ( Audience	participation . )10 MS . LEVINE :	And	what can	we do about 11 that ?12 ( Audience	participation . )13 COUNCILMEMBER	JESSICA LAPPIN :	And	we 14 can go out and campaign	for State	Senate 15 Democrats	across	New York	State . That ' s what we 16 can do about	that .17 And	until	we have	home rule , I know 18 that we can ' t change it in the	City	Council	and 19 you can ' t here . But	I mentioned it in  my 20 testimony	because it paints the picture	of what 21 the situation is .22 And	I think we have	to tell	the	full 23 story	and	that ' s an important	part of the story .24 ( Audience	participation . )25 MS . ADAMS :	Thank	you for your 2 

2	testimony .34	is needed .5
And	we certainly	agree that	home rule However , as you know , we know and 
6 everybody	else knows , there is a housing	crisis 7 with regard	to affordability . And	I don ' t know 8 that we can	wait	until	we have	home	rule .9 Last year	the	Chairman issued a10 statement	which	talked	about the	housing	crisis 11 and talked about	some of the policy	issues	that 12 were involved and called on  the City	Council ,13 elected and	appointed officials , to work	to try 14 to come up with	a resolution to the	problem .15 I was wondering what	by way	of the 16 oversight	responsibilities	that the	Council	has 17 for City	departments that	are	responsible for 18 enforcing	things	which	have to do with safe	and 19 decent	housing , has	any	headway been	made with 20 regard	to those ?21 COUNCILMEMBER	JESSICA LAPPIN :	Well ,22 certainly	the Housing and	Buildings	Committee 23 would	be able to conduct  oversight hearings	on 24 any of those	items	that	you ' ve mentioned .25 I hope	we don ' t have	to wait too long .6 
2 I hope	that	it ' s actually	not	much more	than 3 November .4 But	that said , I would  be happy	to 5 talk to the	Chair of the Committee and see	what 6 he has	done	or what	he would be willing	to do 7 moving	forward in terms	of oversight .8 MS . ADAMS :	We would	appreciate	it .9 Thank	you .10 COUNCILMEMBER	JESSICA LAPPIN :	Sure .11 MS . HOLDER :	Thank	you	for	your 12 testimony . I really	appreciate	your	coming	down 13 this afternoon , Councilmember	Lappin .14 I guess	what you ' re saying	through 15 your testimony , and	I guess what	we ' re saying , as 16 my colleague	has	responded	to  you , is that 17 everyone	needs to be accountable	for	whatever 18 their	role is in trying	to maintain	New	York City 19 housing in terms	of affordability	and what	it is ,20 the responsibilities that	we may	have either as 21 public	members , owner members	or tenant	members .22 And	I guess you would  say that	we have 23 a mandate	and we can still	do what we can to  deal 24 with affordability ,  just as you and	your 25 colleagues in the City	Council , and	perhaps	our 2 
2 representatives	in the	State Legislature	can all 3 do their	part to make sure	that we maintain 4 affordability .5 Is there anything	else that	you	think 6 that we should know	or we should	do as a Board ?7 COUNCILMEMBER	JESSICA LAPPIN :	I8 don ' t think	so , beyond	what I ' ve already	stated .9 And I know you have	a lot	more	people to hear 10 from before	the	day	and	evening is out .11 So - - but	nothing	else that	I would 12 add beyond what	I ' ve already said .13 MS . HOLDER :	Thank	you 14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .15 MR . SCHLEIDER :	We ' re not	done .16 Mr . Chair ?17 Councilmember ? Councilmember ?18 ( Audience	participation . )19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Quiet .20 COUNCILMEMBER	JESSICA LAPPIN :	Sorry .21 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Councilmember , when 22 we had	Speaker Quinn in front	of us last	week , I23 asked	her	a question about	the	renter credits and 24 about	expanding	SCRIE and	about expanding DRIE ,25 and about	doing	whatever else	is necessary	to 2 
2 help those tenants	at risk	in the	City .3 What are you doing about	that ? Aside 4 from parading home	rule , what	exactly are you 5 proposing	or have proposed	to help tenants	last 6 year , the	year before or this	year ?7 COUNCILMEMBER	JESSICA LAPPIN :	I8 would	say	- -9 MR . SCHLEIDER :	By the	way , you are 10 my Councilmember	also .11 COUNCILMEMBER	JESSICA LAPPIN :	- - on 12 a personal level , I ' ve worked	very diligently 13 with constituents who are	being harassed , as I14 mentioned , by their	landlords .15 When people aren ' t providing heat	and 16 hot water , when	people	are	sending false	bills 17 with astronomical fake	fees , we work	with them 18 one - on - one .19 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Councilmember , - -20 COUNCILMEMBER	JESSICA LAPPIN :	But 21 I ' m a member	of a collective body . The Speaker 22 who was here	spoke	for	herself	and she spoke  for 23 me . When	we work	together	and	we  come up with 24 proposals	like the	renters	tax	credit that	I - -25 we work as a body . It ' s sort of the	best	way that 2 
2 I can	answer	that for you .3 So I support the	renters	tax credit .4 I ' ve lobbied	our	elected leaders	in Albany . I5 think	it ' s a fantastic	idea , as is extending 6 SCRIE	and	DRIE . I proactively	try	to enroll	as 7 many people	in SCRIE within my community	as 8 possible . I do a lot  of public	outreach	to make 9 sure that	people	are informed	as the	income 10 levels	have	risen year	after year . I make sure 11 people	know	that	they have	gone up so that	they 12 may , even	if they weren ' t eligible the year 13 before , can	apply because	maybe they	now	fall 14 within	the range .15 But	those	are	some of the things  that 16 I have	done .17 I certainly work	with tenants who	are 18 in Mitchell - Lama , although	that ' s not before you 19 today , but I consider that	a very	important	piece 20 of our	affordable housing	stock , as their owners 21 are withdrawing	from the program , to try	and help 22 them to purchase	their	units and	maintain a plan 23 for long - term affordability so that	when	they 24 purchase	it ' s not just	affordable	for them	but 25 affordable for the	people	who	come after	them or 2 
2 the people who choose to rent .3 But	those	are	some of the things  that 4 I have	done .5 MR . SCHLEIDER :	I applaud	you . Thank 6 you .7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Very	good .8 Thank you .9 ( Audience	participation . )10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Let me read	some 11 names	here .12 Next is Chuck	Gedinsky ;13 Are	you	here ?14 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	Absolutely .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay .16 After that , Sadie	Foy ;17 After that	Zion Halili ;18 After that	Joyce	Goodman ;19 After that	Laura	Lenley ;20 After that	Barry	Soltz ;21 After that	Hal	Brill ;22 After that	Ann	Perryman .23 Mr . Gedinsky .24 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	Thank	you	for 25 having	me here today .2 
 2 My name	is Charles Gedinsky . I own	and 3 manage	property	in Queens	and	in Manhattan . In 4 Queens	we have three buildings , one	with	46 5 units , one with	30 units , one	with 40 units , and 6 some smaller	buildings	on the	West Side	and	in 7 Harlem	in New York	City .8 What I have here	is - and I ' m going to 9 leave	a copy	for	each of you - is  a price   sheet 10 that I ' ve been saving for	the	last year	from my 11 oil company .12 On February 8 th of 2007 , I was	paying 13 $ 1 . 93 a gallon for	oil .14 On February 8 th , exactly	a year	later ,15 of 2008 , I was paying $ 2 . 70 .16 On April 10 th of 2008 , I was paying 17	$ 3 . 56 .18 And	only last	week , on June	7 th of 19 ' 08 , I was paying $ 4 . 17 .20 And	I get	a fairly big shake because   I21 have over	two hundred units .22 Affordable	housing needs	to be 23 maintained . With	fuel that ' s more	than doubled ,24 fourteen	percent	increase	in water , sixteen 25 percent increase	in real estate taxes ,18 
2 maintaining	buildings that	are	getting older 3 where	the	day - to - day repairs are	more frequent 4 and more	expensive , we need increases that	will 5 maintain	affordable	housing in New York	City .6 Without	the proper increases I  think 7 the Board	is in jeopardy of losing  affordable 8 housing and	losing	landlords like	myself .9 A few weeks ago there was an   article 10 in The	New York	Times how	billion	dollar	pension 11 funds	and	equity	funds	are	approaching landlords 12 and saying sell	us your	properties , cash	out . We 13 are looking	to invest money for thirty years  down 14 the road	and	we ' ll do what	we  have to do  to make 15 those	properties	work .16 These equity funds are bigger  than 17 you , bigger	than	me , bigger than	everybody 18 sitting in this	room .19 Is that	really	what	you	want or  do you 20 want landlords who	know	how to manage the 21 properties , who	care about	the	properties , who 22 care about the tenants ,  to keep affordable 23 housing going ?24 I don ' t want anybody	to lose their 25 apartment , but this	is a democracy ,  a capitalist 2 
2 society . And	everybody	has	to hold their	own 3 weight . I  have never had a senior	citizen lose 4 their	apartment	through	a rent	increase . SCRIE 5 has pulled through . Adult	Protective	Services has 6 pulled	through .7 Section	8  vouchers are readily 8 available .9 ( Audience	participation . )10 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	I have a  tenant 11 right	now	who is  getting one . The	Section 812 program is growing .13 And , again , I ' ve never had	a tenant 14 that lost	their	housing	because of it .15 But	with the kind	of increases	we ' ve 16 been getting	for	the last	few	years , you ' re going 17 to lose affordable	housing	because people like	me 18 and other	landlords	are	going	to just throw	our 19 hands	up in the	air	and	say , you	know what , we ' ll 20 retire	early , we ' ll sell out .21 Yes , our buildings are worth 22 something . But that ' s the	future . You should be 23 more concerned with	about	now . And I think	you 24 want us to  be with	you	as landlords	because	the 25 future	doesn ' t look	pretty . I don ' t think these 2 
2 equity	funds	and	these	pension	funds	have any 3 compassion for anybody	but	themselves , and	we do .4 ACTING	CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank	you .5 Any	questions ?6 MS . HOLDER :	I have	a question .7 I just	want to clarify a couple	of 8 points .9 So you	said you own	three buildings in 10 Queens ?11 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	In Queens ,12 middle - income Queens , South Queens , yes .13 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .14 And	what ' s the	lowest rent	in those - -15 are they	all	rent stabilized ?16 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	Out of almost - -17 out of over	- - I ' d say	maybe three units	out of 18 over a  hundred units are deregulated . The rest	of 19 them are	rent controlled and rent	stabilized .20 Most are	rent stabilized .21 MS . HOLDER :	And	what are	the	range 22 of rents	in the	unregulated as well	- -23 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	Okay .24 MS . HOLDER :	- - as the	regulated ?25 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	The junior 2 
2 one - bedrooms , which	are	larger	than	studios , the 3 range	is anywhere from	$ 460 some	odd	dollars a4 month	up to a  market rent	of about $ 800	a month .5 For	the	full one - bedroom	with an 6 eat - in kitchen , we have	tenants paying us as  low 7 as $ 503 a month	with the rents going	up to about 8 $ 900 a month .9 For	two - bedroom apartments , we have 10 tenants paying like	anywhere from	the low sixes 11 up to about	$ 1100 a month .12 And	we  have one tenant in  a13 three - bedroom apartment	who is paying us a  little 14 bit under , a little	bit	under	$ 600 a month .15 Market	rent	for	those apartments	- -16 MS . HOLDER :	A three - bedroom 17 apartment ?18 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	- - is $ 1400	to 19 $ 1500 . We ' re not	getting much	more than	$ 1225 for 20 any of our apartments .21 MS . HOLDER :	Then you said	you	own 22 two buildings in Manhattan .23 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	I have a24 building	on 128 th Street in Harlem , twelve	studio 25 apartments , all	rent stabilized , all	middle 2 
2 income , professional working people . I have 3 school	teachers , I have	people	that	work	in 4 hospitals . They	all	make nice	incomes . And	I ' m5 not saying they ' re rich , but they	all make	nice 6 incomes .7 And	I have	tenants living in - - again ,8 it ' s in Manhattan , it ' s Lenox	Avenue , where 9 they ' re building	apartments that	sell between 10 $ 500 , 000	and	$ 1 , 000 , 000 , I have tenants	that are 11 paying	me  - - some of them	are	paying	me  in the 12 high $ 400 s , mid	$ 500 s , $ 675 . And , of course , I13 have tenants	also that	are	paying	$ 975 . I ' ve just 14 rented	an apartment	for	July 1 st .15 MS . HOLDER :	And	those	are	all 16 studios you	say ?17 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	They ' re all 18 studios with	kitchens , yes .19 MS . HOLDER :	All	studios with 20 kitchens	and	they ' re all rent	regulated ?21 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	Every	one	of 22 them is rent	regulated .23 MS . HOLDER :	And	how many	units is 24 that in Manhattan ?25 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	Twelve .2 
2 MS . HOLDER :	In each building	or - -3 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	No . Twelve on 4 128 th Street	in this particular building .5 And	then we have	a building	on 91 st 6 Street	which	has	ten apartments .  Seven of the 7 apartments are rent	stabilized	and three	of the 8 apartments are deregulated .9 MS . HOLDER :	And	what are	the	range 10 of rents	- -11 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	The range	of 12 rents	there	is $ 560	something	a month for someone 13 that ' s been	living	there for probably about 14 thirty	years , up to about	$ 1600 a month	for	a - -15 they ' re all	studios	and	some of them	have a16 little	sleeping	alcove .17 MS . HOLDER :	Have - - I ' m sorry ?18 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	Some	of them 19 have a small	sleeping alcove .20 MS . HOLDER :	Oh ! Okay .21 And	then you said	that - - you said 22 that Section	8 vouchers	are readily	available . I23 mean - -24 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	I have a  tenant 25 in Queens	right	now	- - in  fact , I thought that 2 
2 they were	going	to actually stay	with me , but 3 they wanted	something bigger and	I didn ' t have 4 it . And they	put	their	name on a list for   Section 5 8 and	the	apartment	- -  actually as we talk	right 6 now they ' re waiting	for	their	final	inspection	to 7 be done .8 I have	another	tenant also	in Queens 9 who had also	applied for a Section 8 voucher  and 10 she ' s been going	for her interviews	right now .11 I haven ' t found her	apartment yet 12 though .13 MS . HOLDER :	I mean , you know , I work 14 for the Legal  Aid Society	and	when " readily 15 available , " do you	know	when they	actually	put 16 their	names	on the	list ?17 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	That	I couldn ' t18 tell you . But I know - - like I said , I know	one 19 tenant	has been	approved and another	tenant	has 20 been going for interviews . And	the reason she 21 told me is she asked me  how much	time I have to 22 give her , and I said , once	Section 8  approves me ,23 I said	just	let	me know .24 MS . HOLDER :	Okay . Because	it ' s our 25 experience that	it takes years and years	- -2 
2 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	I don ' t know	the 3 history of it , but	I know	that	one has been 4 approved	and	another one is going	through the 5 process .6 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .7 And	then you ' re also	saying	that it ' s8 your experience	as being an owner	in New	York 9 City that	no one	loses	their apartment because 10 they can ' t afford it ?11 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	I have never	had 12 a tenant	- - I have	never had a senior citizen - -13 I have	never	had	a senior	citizen	move out	of an 14 apartment	because of a  rent increase .15 MS . HOLDER :	So why	do think that 16 Legal	Services and	Legal Aid continue to be  in 17 business ?18 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	Okay . I ' ve give 19 you a perfect example .20 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .21 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	I have a  tenant 22 right	now	who is under	the	auspices	of Adult 23 Protective Services . Unfortunately , emotional and 24 mental	issues have	changed	in his	life where he 25 is not	able	to manage his	money .2 
2 Adult Protective	Services came	in - -3 MS . HOLDER :	Is she	okay ? Sorry .4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Hold	on .5 MS . HOLDER :	Hold on for a - - no .6 Just hold	on for	a second .7 ( There	was	a brief pause	in the 8 proceedings . )9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Yes . Go ahead , sir .10 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	I ' ll revisit	your 11 question	again .12 I had one	tenant , Adult	Protective 13 Services	did	step in . He is a working man ,  but 14 unfortunately he lost the	ability	to take care	of 15 his day - to - day living situation , paying	his	rent .16 His electric	was	shut off .17 But	they came	in , they got	him	a grant 18 and now they	are	managing	his	money . He is still 19 employed .20 MS . HOLDER :	Right . But	it ' s his 21 income . They	are	not paying his rent .22 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	Unfortunately - -23 MS . HOLDER :	I think it ' s like	a24 payee	system .25 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	If you give	me 2 
2 your e - mail , I can	send	you a  document on the 3 case .4 Unfortunately , they	had	to come	in .5 Adult	Protective	Services	had	to get	a grant to 6 pay about	five months worth of rent .7 MS . HOLDER :	Of his	arrears ?8 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	Of his arrears .9 MS . HOLDER :	Right .10 But	they ' re not paying his	ongoing 11 rent ? They probably	have set up a payee	system	to 12 have a direct - -13 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	Yes . That ' s - -14 they have	someone - - they	have	it done for	him .15 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .16 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	Yes .17 And	I just	want to close	with a quick 18 one .19 There was	an article	in The	New	York 20 Times	in January : New York	is paying	more than 21 ever to keep	their	homes warm . After	receiving	a22 bill for	nearly	$ 1200 on Monday , Maxine	Simpson 23 turned	off the hot	water and heater	to conserve 24 oil .25 We can ' t do that .2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .3 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Sir , how many	units 4 do you	own in total ?5 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	A little	less 6 than two	hundred .7 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right .8 So by definitions	that members	on this 9 Board	are	using , you ' re considered to be a large 10 landlord , a big	landlord .11 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	I ' m mid - size	- -12 as I said , I  consider myself a  mid - size	landlord .13 I don ' t have	a thousand	units , I don ' t have 14 fifteen units .15 MR . SCHLEIDER :	I know . But you have 16 more than	a hundred	and	fifty . So  Members of this 17 Board	- -18 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	Okay .19 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- - are	going to 20 characterize	you	as  a large landlord .21 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	Yeah . Okay .22 I got to categorize	- - I consider 23 myself	- - I ' m a property manager . I submanage . I24 manage	my own buildings . I  have superintendents 25 at the	larger buildings .2 
2 And	whatever your	thought .3 MR . SCHLEIDER :	As a large	landlord ,4 characterized as a  large landlord , would	you 5 consider	yourself the same	or different	from 6 those	conglomerates	that are buying	up all	these 7 buildings	under	these pension	funds	and	sovereign 8 funds ?9 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	Of course .10 I don ' t have that	kind of - - I don ' t11 have a deep	pocket .12 I also	have compassion . I care	about 13 the destiny	of my buildings . I care	about the 14 destiny of my tenants .15 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Thank you .16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .17 ( Audience	participation . )18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We ' re going	to go 19 slightly	out	of - - Councilmember	Robert	Jackson .20 ( Audience	participation . )21 COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :	Thank 22 you .23 Good afternoon , everyone . Members	of 24 the Board , good	afternoon .25 The	woman	said	that	she	had	- -2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Yes . Well , I wanted 3 to take you	because	I count eight	- - you ' ll be 4 next . Are	you Ms . Foy ?5 MS . SADIE	FOY :	Yes .6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You ' ll be next .7 COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :	I will 8 yield	to her	if you	don ' t mind .9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay .10 Go ahead , Ms . Foy .11 Ms . Foy , you ' re next .12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	I  just called about 13 eight	names	so I want to  get you	on .14 Ms . Foy , go ahead .15 The	Councilmember	will be next .16 MS . SADIE	FOY :	I ' m a tenant in the 17 Bronx , a rent stabilized tenant . And	my rent is 18 well over	$ 800 a month .19 Whether	anybody is willing	to admit it 20 or not , we are in a recession . Everything  has 21 gone up . My insurance has	gone	up , my medical 22 insurance	has gone	up , my taxes have	gone up ,23 just like	these	landlords .24 Nobody	is considering what ' s going	to 25 happen	to the homeless	people .2 
2 I don ' t qualify for	DRIE . I don ' t3 qualify for	SCRIE . As far	as Section	8 , I don ' t4 qualify for	that , but the	tenants	that do qualify 5 for Section	8 , the	landlords are	not	accepting 6 them . More than	fifty percent	of the	landlords 7 are not accepting them .8 ( Audience	participation . )9 MS . SADIE	FOY :	Congress just	passed 10 a law	stating that	that	is not	allowed , but	the 11 President	has not signed off on it yet .12 So  we still need	help from	the	Rent 13 Guidelines Board	to keep our rents affordable .14 More than	fifty	percent	of the	homeless	people 15 are working	people . They live	in shelters because 16 they can ' t afford these	exorbitant rents .17 Rather	than the landlords making $ 500 18 a month , so they ' re making	$ 450 a month . So what ?19 If they ' re not satisfied with	that , they	need to 20 get out of the business .21 When they	took	these	buildings , - -22 ( Audience	participation . )23 MS . SADIE	FOY :	- - they	knew what	the 24 rent roll	was . But	they	are depending on the  Rent 25 Guidelines Board	to make them	wealthy .2 
2 We all	want to be wealthy . But	we also 3 want to have	a home	too .4 Most of the jobs	are	being	closed 5 down . People	are	losing	jobs . Food is expensive .6 Everything is expensive .7 Just like	these landlords are 8 complaining , the	tenants have	needs	and	wants 9 too . We have	to live . Most	of us pay	more than 10 fifty	percent of our income . I know	I do and I ' m11 sure that	mostly	everyone	in this	room does	that 12 too .13 We need	help from	the Rent	Guidelines 14 Board	to keep our rents	affordable and to keep	us 15 in New	York	City . So many	people	have gone	and 16 left New	York City , the	people	that	kept	this 17 City decent	for	these landlords to  buy and	become 18 wealthy .19 Thank you .20 ( Audience	participation . )21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .22 Any	questions ?23 MS . HOLDER :	I have	a question .24 I know	you	have to leave , but I ' ll 25 make it really quick .2

13 this afternoon .14 MS . SADIE	FOY :	Thank you .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .16 COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :	Thank 17 you .18 Good afternoon , Members	of the	Board .19 My name	is Robert	Jackson and I20 represent	the neighborhoods of Morningside 21 Heights , West Harlem , Hamilton Heights ,22 Washington Heights	and	Inwood	in the	New	York 23 City Council .24 And	my district ' s housing stock	is 25 really	quite	diverse . We have	HDFC co - ops , single 13 
2 family	brownstones , two	and three - family	houses 3 and market rate	co - ops	and	condos .4 But	still	the	majority of my 5 constituents	are	tenants living in  rental 6 apartments . With	an average income of  roughly 7 $ 34 , 000 for	a family of four , based	on the	2000 8 census , any	rent	increase , even a modest	one ,9 cuts deeply	into	the necessities	budget	for	the 10 constituents	that I represent .11 For	many paying the	rent	means	falling 12 behind	on utilities , day care	or scrimping	on 13 food .14 Affordable	housing is a  critical 15 component	of the	City ' s economic	mix	and	rent 16 stabilized apartments are	probably the largest 17 part of our	affordable	housing	stock . Because of 18 a confluence	of factors , affordable	housing	is 19 disappearing	at an alarming rate .20 While it is not the	task	of owners	to 21 fix the City ' s economic	woes , it is the	task of 22 our local	and State	legislators to devise a23 system	that	will	preserve	affordable	housing , a24 goal that	should	be pretty	universal	because of 25 the obvious	benefits to our City	of preserving 2 
2 economic	diversity	in our	residential base .3 And	my testimony	in  front of you in 4 2007 emphasized	the	necessity	of reforming	the 5 statutes	that shape	our	housing practices and 6 laws . My statement	today , unfortunately , echoes 7 the persistent need , and that	is :8 Increase transparency by requiring 9 landlords	to open their	books	and	justify their 10 expenses ;11 ( Audience	participation . )12 COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :	- - No .13 2 , use	Income and Expense	Data	for calculating 14 increases , do not base	adjustments on a  Price 15 Index	that may not	correlate ;16 Number	three , withhold increases from 17 landlords	who fail	to register all rent 18 stabilized apartments with	the	Division	of 19 Housing and	Community Renewal ;20 Number	four , withdraw increases	from 21 owners	who fail	to correct	serious violations ,22 Class	B and	C violations .23 ( Audience	participation . )24 COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :	In 25 addition	to the	above specifics , we must	revamp 2 
2 the Board	itself , in my opinion . The 3 Duane / Latimer bill	before	the	State	Legislature 4 would	mandate revisions	to the	Board ' s5 composition	and	require	City Council	approval of 6 Mayoral appointees .7 ( Audience	participation . )8 COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :	I9 believe this	legislation would begin	to address 10 the deficiencies	that keep	the	current Rent 11 Guidelines Board	practices	from preserving 12 affordable housing	in New	York	City .13 The	facts	of the	matter	show that 14 vacancy decontrol and co - op and condo conversions 15 are steadily	eroding affordable housing	stock .16 Thus , the	Rent Guidelines	Board contributes 17 significantly to the loss	of affordable	housing ,18 the very	commodity	that	it was	designed	to 19 stabilize .20 Until this	system	is fixed , I urge	the 21 Board	to vote no on any	increases .22 ( Audience	participation . )23 COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :	And 24 I ' m available for any questions that	you	may 25 have .2

CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Questions ? MS . ADAMS :	Yes .CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Betty .MS . ADAMS :	Thank	you for your COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :	You ' re 
8 welcome , ma ' am .9 MS . ADAMS :	You mentioned the need	to 10 withhold	increases . Who	would	do that ?11 COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :	Well ,12 I think the	Rent	Guidelines Board	could	send a13 serious message . Even if you don ' t have	the 14 authority	yourself	to do that , but if the  Rent 15 Guidelines Board	in establishing	whatever 16 guidelines you are	going to establish for  the 17 upcoming	year , you	can	communicate that . Whatever 18 authority	has that , whether or not it ' s HPD	or 19 whether it ' s DHCR , because	those	are	the	- - you 20 know , as you	know , HPD	deals with	the City	and 21 DHCR is at the State level , those	are the ones 22 that could implement a law	that may	be passed by 23 the State	Legislature .24 But	I think that	what you can do  in 25 your capacity as a  Board is to communicate	that 8 
2 where	a landlord	fails	to do certain	things , that 3 certain actions	should	be done .4 And	I think that	by having	an opinion 5 like that	would	be helpful	for	legislators	both 6 at the	local	level	and	at the	State	level .7 MS . ADAMS :	Do you think	that the	City 8 Council would be willing to make	that kind	of 9 communication to the Departments	that they	have 10 oversight	responsibility for ?11 COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :	I12 truly	believe that	the	City Council	will	be 13 making	that	recommendation .14 MS . ADAMS :	Is there	any	reason	it 15 hasn ' t been	done	up until	now ?16 COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :	I17 can ' t - - I cannot say why	they	haven ' t done	it as 18 of now . But	I say to you  in speaking	to you , Ms .19 Adams , that	as a Member	of the	City	Council , I20 will look	into that	myself	and	that	if that	has 21 not been	done , then	I will	make the 22 recommendation . I will	have my staff	research as 23 to the	authority	in order	to make	that 24 recommendation .25 MS . ADAMS :	Thank	you very	much .2 
2 COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :	You ' re 3 welcome , ma ' am .4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We have	another 5 question	here .6 MS . CRUZ :	Councilmember	Jackson ,7 thank	you	for coming here	today , - -8 COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :	Good 9 afternoon 10 MS . CRUZ :	- - and	thank	you	for	your 11 service , especially	in the	area of public 12 education	that I ' m very	familiar	with .13 COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :	Thank 14 you .15 MS . CRUZ :	I have	a  question about 16 your statement that	co - op and	condominium 17 conversion is eroding affordable	housing .18 I don ' t quite	understand	that 19 statement	when co - op and condo conversion gives 20 tenants in occupancy two options : Either , one , to 21 buy their	apartment	at an insider ' s price , or 22 they have	the right	to stay there	as regulated 23 tenants .24 So how	is that	in any way - -25 COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :2 
2 Eroding affordable	housing ?3 MS . CRUZ :	- - eroding affordable 4 housing ?5 COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :	Okay .6 Please	let me explain .7 I think	I heard one	of the	other 8 owner , Mr . Schleider - - did I mispronounce	your 9 last name , sir ?10 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Perfect .11 COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :	I12 think	I heard him say that , in speaking	to one	of 13 the owners that	was	up here , it appeared	- and	I14 walked	in when this	owner	was	speaking -  it 15 appears this	owner	is a relatively small	owner 16 versus	these	private equities	that are buying up 17 a lot	of large buildings .18 And	I know	on Riverside	Drive in the 19 upper	30 s , 40 s and	50 s , and which	I represent ,20 you have	Pinnacle and other large	companies 21 buying	- - purchasing a lot	of buildings	in 22 Northern	Manhattan	and	moving	those	towards	I23 think	condo	conversions	or co - op conversions .24 And	as  a result of that , even  though 25 - - that , in essence , is driving the	rent 2 
2 stabilization tenants out . You	may say : Well , how 3 is  it driving them	out	when , as long	as  they are 4 paying	their	rent , you	know , that	they can	still 5 remain	there .6 Well , I say to you that	some of these 7 large	equity	landlords	are	using	every tactic 8 that they	can in order	to force rent	stabilized 9 tenants out , in order to move	in a direction as 10 what I said .11 I think	that in my opinion	that	is 12 some of the	strategies	that they	are	using	in 13 order	to , one , to try to force people out , number 14 two , try	to increase their	rent rolls so that  if 15 they are	private	equity	groups	- and , you know ,16 private equity groups are	not	in it because	they 17 love each	other , meaning the tenants , they	are	in 18 it for	business , to make money .19 So if they	increase	their rent	rolls ,20 and then	when they	go to try to sell	it , they can 21 sell it at a higher	market	value .22 And	I think all  of those	things	are 23 happening	and , as a result	of that , eroding	the 24 affordable housing	stock in New York	City .25 And , obviously , if you have	tenants - -2 
2 I mean , if you have	people	that own	their co - op 3 or own	their	condo , and	if it ' s affordable	- and 4 the question	is what do you mean	by affordable .5 But	to go back	to  affordability , as I6 indicated	in my statement , the	average 7 constituent	that	I represent , average family of 8 four , based	on the	2000	census , is only	$ 34 , 000 .9 So it ' s not really affordable to them .10 It may	be affordable to people	earning a lot more 11 money , but not to the average	constituent .12 And	as you	know , if you	don ' t know	- -13 you may not	know	- - that the average	family	in 14 New York	City only	earns about $ 44 , 000 a year ,15 the average	family	in New	York	City .16 So that ' s what	I meant by that .17 MS . CRUZ :	Thank	you .18 MR . LANGUEDOC :	If I may , just	to 19 clarify that .20 When a building , a rental apartment 21 building , converts	to co - op or a condo in a22 non - eviction	plan , if you	choose	not	to purchase 23 your apartment , you	can	stay as a  rent stabilized 24 tenant .25 However , if you don ' t purchase	and 2 
2 then you	move out , then	any subsequent renter is 3 not under	rent stabilization ; isn ' t that	right ?4 MS . ADAMS :	Yes , it is .5 COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :	I6 believe so . I mean	I ' m not	an expert	- -7 MS . ADAMS :	It is .8 MR . LANGUEDOC :	What you said	in your 9 original	testimony	was	absolutely	correct , that 10 by buildings	converting	to co - op and	condominium 11 ownership , it does	reduce	the	number	of rent 12 stabilized apartments .13 COUNCILMEMBER	ROBERT	JACKSON :	I14 think	that as a City Council Member , as  a15 representative , as a public elected	official , I16 represent	approximately	163 , 000 people .17 And	I say	to you	that I  am constantly 18 hearing from	residents	of my community about  the 19 fact that	they are	being forced out .20 They say that	to me , and , of course ,21 just like	you , you	ask	what do you mean	by that .22 Well , what	I said	earlier as far as 23 the private	equity	groups	coming	in and	doing 24 their	very strategies in order  to increase	their 25 rent rolls and , in essence , toss	some people out .2 
2 And	then also	because - - is  that even 3 with rent	stabilization	increases , it ' s forcing 4 their	hand to decide in trying	to pay rent	and 5 buying	food . And	so I personally	know people , a6 senior , that	could	not	afford	her	rent and	that 7 was forced out as  a result	of that because	they 8 were backed	up in their	rent and	weren ' t bringing 9 enough	money	in in order to afford the rent .10 And , subsequently , after	making	a long 11 story	short , after	about two years , she	finally 12 received	Section	8 I believe and	found a land 13 owner	that would	accept	a Section	8 up in  the 14 Bronx	somewhere .15 So right now , as far	as this tenant ,16 who was basically forced  out because	she	could 17 not afford to pay the rent ,  now has	a stable 18 environment	again for herself	and	her family ,19 which	is really , really	good .20 But	also I know that	- - I know	people 21 that have	taken	an apartment , and	where	the	rent 22 was high	for	the	income	that they	were earning ,23 but they	had	other	sources	of income	- let ' s say 24 child	support and whathaveyou	- and	which that 25 financial	situation	changed , where basically they 2 
2 could	not	afford	the rent	anymore	and were	forced 3 to leave	because	they could not afford it .4 And	so there are	many , many	various 5 scenarios .6 And	I say	to you , and you ' re an owner 7 representative , I don ' t believe that	owners 8 should	be not earning a profit . Let	me just	say 9 that right now . Because	as I said	to people 10 before , I ' ve said this	to people	that I11 represent , the owners don ' t love	you . You ' re not 12 their	mother , their	father , their	sister , their 13 brother . They ' re in this for business .14 But	I do believe , though , that	all 15 things	considered , that	we have to look	at not 16 only the	owners , but look	at the	renters	and look 17 at the	income that	they ' re earning and look	at 18 the laws	that we have as far as  to make	sure that 19 owners	are complying to laws  as far	as repairs ,20 so forth	and	so on , and	we should	not have 21 tenements	with rats	crawling around , with water 22 leaking , with ceilings	falling	down . It makes all 23 owners	look	bad .24 Just like	if we have	tenants that	are 25 not paying their	rent , if they	can afford to pay 2 
2 it , and not	paying	it , it makes tenants	look bad .3 And	all	I ' m saying to the Rent 4 Guidelines Board	and all of  you who	are	members 5 that have	to decide	on what the increase	is ,6 please	understand where	the majority	of the 7 tenants are	coming	from .8 And	as this woman	that spoke just 9 before	I did , everyone	- you , me and 10 everyone	- is paying more	for	food , is paying 11 more for	oil , gas , so forth and so on .12 So just	please	understand that	in your 13 deliberations .14 ( Audience	participation . )15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .16 ( Audience	participation . )17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Zion	Halili .18 ( Audience	participation . )19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Hold	on a second ,20 Mr . Halili .21 Joyce Goodman ;22 Laura Langley ; and 23 Barry Soltz .24 Go ahead , Mr . Halili .25 MR . ZION HALILI :	Yes .2 
2 My name	Zion Halili . I ' m a small owner 3 and managing	my own	properties .4 However , I will consider	myself	as 5 pro - tenant . And	the	reason	for	that , the	majority 6 of my life I  have lived	as a tenant . And 7 particularly	I remember	my parents when	I was a8 child , what	difficulty	they had to deal	- - to pay 9 rent .10 And	the	reason	when	I now become  a11 landlord	the	last fifteen	years , I am really 12 very , very much	considering the situation of  each 13 of my tenants . And	I have	never evicted	tenants 14 because I always	remember	that	my parents , they 15 were a tenant , they	had	difficulties .16 And	I ' m trying	to  work it out , even 17 sometimes	a tenant	that	they could afford to pay ,18 one out of twenty tenants	that	I had , I did	not 19 increase	their annual rent . I let	them to stay .20 And	I did	everything	in my power  to 21 keep the	building as is and survive	without 22 making	major	profits .23 But	the	last few	years has	become	more 24 and more	difficult . Even that	I love	my tenants ,25 I love	my building . As I said , I have twenty 2 
2 units	in Harlem , which	is one	of the	most 3 beautiful	and cleanest	building on the block 4 because I care about my  tenants and	my building .5 And	I renovated every  individual 6 apartment	to make it really comfortable	and 7 livable because , as I said , I care about	my 8 building	and	my tenants .9 The	last few years has  become more	and 10 more difficult to cover	even , to reach to cover 11 my expenses . I can ' t afford to cover	the	expenses 12 out - of - pocket any longer , which the	additional 13 expenses	that I ' m covering	out - of - pocket	comes 14 from a home	equity	line	of credit	that I took on 15 my home .16 This is not healthy	for	me  as the 17 landlord	and	is not	good for the	tenant	if  I have 18 to start	to cheapen	on heat , hot	water ,19 extermination and other	services	just in order 20 for me to survive too .21 I have	to - - as I said , I have	also - -22 I am married , I have children . I have to  take 23 care of my family . I cannot always , as I said ,24 take a loan	to cover in order	to keep these 25 affordable rent	units that	I have .2 
2 So please	help	us , the landlords , so 3 that we can	provide	low	rent housing	to the 4 public .5 The	last few years  the increase	that 6 this Board has allowed	is not	sufficient	to cover 7 the increase	of the	actual	expenses . You	all know 8 the numbers , what are the	increases	and	how	much 9 you have	increased	the	rents . That never 10 justifies .11 I was checking to see  if really	it ' s12 just me losing money - -13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You need	to wrap 14 up , Mr . Halili .15 MR . ZION HALILI :	I ' m sorry ?16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You need	to wrap 17 up .18 MR . ZION HALILI :	I was	just looking 19 to see	if it was	just me losing money or is  the 20 other	properties . I  went and checked	fifteen 21 different	properties throughout the	five 22 boroughs . I have	them all	here , the	information ,23 on their	income	and	expenses . None of them	was 24 making	money ; everybody	losing	money .25 Except	I find	out	one that	was	making 2 
2 a profit	which was	a package of four	buildings	in 3 Bronx . It was showing some	profit . I wonder	how 4 can that	be ?5 I went	and	checked those	four 6 buildings . All four	buildings	full of graffiti . I7 went to check one  of these	apartments . The 8 bathrooms , the kitchens , all disaster compared	to 9 what I - -10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You have	to wrap 11 up . Go ahead .12 What level	of rent increase	are	you 13 suggesting ?14 MR . ZION HALILI :	Now , the	conclusion 15 was , after seeing this	building , I see how	he is 16 making	profit . He is cutting on heat , he ' s not 17 providing	services .18 The	question is , do you	want to ask 19 some of us , the	good landlords , like	me that are 20 trying	to provide this	low	rental , do you want	to 21 push us to become like	a slumlord	and not to 22 provide services ?23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	No .24 MR . ZION HALILI :	That ' s not what	I25 want to go . That ' s not	what I want . I need	you 2 
 2 guys just	help us - -3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .4 MR . ZION HALILI :	- - to help the 5 tenant	to keep this	low	rent .6 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Question .7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Question .8 MR . SCHLEIDER :	How	many units ?9 MR . ZION HALILI :	I got	twenty	units ,10 sir .11 MR . SCHLEIDER :	And	they ' re all rent 12 stabilized ?13 MR . ZION HALILI :	Yes , all	rent 14 stabilized .15 MR . SCHLEIDER :	And	the	rent range - -16 MR . ZION HALILI :	From	$ 260 up to 17	$ 1151 .18 MR . SCHLEIDER :	And	you	have more	at 19 the lower	end of the range ?20 MR . ZION HALILI :	Yes . I got only	one 21 or two	that	is over	$ 1000 . The	majority	of them 22 are the low	$ 800 s .23 MS . CRUZ :	What size	apartments ?24 MR . ZION HALILI :	Two - bedrooms , all 25 of - - I got	- - I ' m sorry . Two	one - bedrooms	and 18 
2 eighteen	two - bedrooms .3 MR . SCHLEIDER :	And	how	much of a4 rent increase or flat amount  would allow	you to 5 preserve	your housing stock ?6 MR . ZION HALILI :	I would	say	that 7 the increase	that you guys	whatever	discussing ,8 three	or five percent increase , that ' s okay ,9 whatever	you	feel that .10 I believe	that	it is really	necessary 11 to give a one - time	increase , one	lump sum to 12 every	apartment , every	rent that	is below $ 1000 13 in order	to ask	the	landlord to be able	to pay 14 for the oil .15 Last year	my oil	bill was - - I used 16 less than	the year	before	because	it was	warmer .17 I used	7 , 000	gallons . I paid for	that 7 , 000 18 gallons , I paid	$ 35 , 135	' 07 .19 ' 06 , which	I used	10 , 000	gallons , more 20 gallons , my cost	for oil was only	$ 22 , 000 .21 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Twenty	what ?22 MR . ZION HALILI :	$ 22 , 112	exactly .23 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Okay .24 So $ 13 , 000	in one	year for	twenty - two 25 units .2 
2 MR . ZION HALILI :	Just	on oil .3 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Just on oil .4 MR . ZION HALILI :	Not talking	about 5 insurance	and all the others .6 MR . SCHLEIDER :	That ' s over $ 590	an 7 apartment	just in increased  oil cost	per	year or 8 about	$ 50 a month , just	for an oil increase	for 9 twenty - two apartments .10 Thank you .11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .12 Joyce Goodman	representing 13 Assemblymember Daniel O ' Donnell .14 Is that	you ?15 ( Audience	participation . )16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Quiet .17 ( Audience	participation . )18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You ' ll get a chance 19 to testify just	like everybody	else , otherwise 20 you have	to be quiet during everybody else ' s21 testimony .22 ( Audience	participation . )23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Go ahead .24 MS . JOYCE	GOODMAN :	Good afternoon .25 I know	that Assemblymember	O ' Donnell 2 
2 is regretting not being	able to deliver	this 3 testimony	himself . He ' s in Albany	today .4 His	name is Daniel O ' Donnell and he ' s5 a member	of the	New	York State Assembly , District 6 69 , representing	residents	of Manhattan	Valley ,7 Morningside	Heights , the Upper West	Side	of 8 Manhattan	and Southern	Harlem .9 Thank you	for	the	opportunity to 10 discuss rent	adjustments for renewal	leases	for 11 rent stabilized	apartments .12 The	proposed rent	increases , if 13 passed , will	have a negative impact	on the	lives 14 of tenants who live	in my Assembly District	and 15 for tenants	across	the	City of New York .16 These increases will	adversely	affect 17 the very	people	that our system was	originally 18 designed	to protect .19 We cannot	continue to overlook	the 20 housing needs of our most	vulnerable	residents :21 Our seniors , immigrants , the disabled and the 22 working poor .23 First and	foremost ,  I ask the Board to 24 consider	the	fact that	over the course of  the 25 last five	months	my Community	Office	has	assisted 2 
2 more households	who	fell into	rent arrears	and 3 sought	legal	and	financial	assistance to  prevent 4 them from	losing	their	rent - regulated apartments 5 than was	the	case last	year at this	time .6 Each one of these	constituents 7 required	on average	four follow - up meetings 8 and / or comprehensive legal	services	or an 9 advocate	in Housing	Court	to try	to prevent	their 10 eviction .11 These are	mostly	non - payment cases	we 12 are talking	about .13 The	difficulties	my  constituents face 14 paying	rent	takes on added	meaning when	we 15 consider	that they	cannot	simply	relocate to 16 other	neighborhoods	to find housing .17 Affordability is an issue	across	this City .18 Many of those	who	have sought 19 assistance from	my office	are	those	who	are 20 approaching	sixty - five	but	do not	qualify for 21 SCRIE . Others are permanently	disabled but	do not 22 qualify for	DRIE .23 The	majority are	low - income	working 24 families	whose salaries	over the	last years	have 25 not increased anywhere	near the rent	increases 2 
2 that have	been instituted	by this	body .3 When these	increases	are	coupled with 4 the rent	increased	imposed	from MCIs , that ' s5 Major	Capital Improvements , a great	many	find 6 themselves overburdened	with rents that	are 7 beyond	their	means .8 It is an acknowledged fact	that	my 9 Community	Office	could	justifiably operate	solely 10 as a Housing	Assistance	Unit - - I do most of  that 11 work myself	- that ' s off the record	- - with	no 12 extra	time or resources	to devote	to the	myriad 13 of other	issues	that affect my community , given 14 that so many	of my constituents have 15 housing - related	problems .16 Based on these facts	alone , I am 17 adamantly	opposed to yet another	rent increase 18 which	will cause	a major hardship	for thousands 19 of New	Yorkers who	are	already	struggling to make 20 ends meet .21 I have	serious	concerns	with the data 22 that the	RGB	relies	on in this	decisionmaking 23 process and	I question	the	extent	to which 24 landlords ' actual expenses	and	incomes are	taken 25 into account .2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .3 Want to wrap up , please ?4 MS . JOYCE	GOODMAN :	Yes .5 I support	legislation now being 6 proposed	that would	prevent landlords with 7 serious violations	on their buildings from 8 collecting the annual increase .9 ( Audience	participation . )10 MS . JOYCE	GOODMAN :	In closing , it is 11 clear	to me that	over the	past	few years	we have 12 lost tens	of thousands	of units of previously 13 affordable housing , and	that if we continue	down 14 the path	we are	on , rent stabilized	apartments 15 will become	increasingly rare	in this City .16 It is time	for	the RGB to take	the 17 dramatic	step of enacting	the	most minimal	rent 18 increase	this year .19 Thank you .20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .21 ( Audience	participation . _22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Any questions ?23 MS . LEVINE :	I have	one .24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Question	here .25 Risa .2 
2 MS . LEVINE :	Hi , Ms . Goodman .3 We ' ve had	some	City	Councilmembers 4 here today who have	blamed	some of the causes for 5 some - -6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	On you .7 MS . LEVINE : - - of the housing problems 8 on the	State	Legislature . They	have	said	that 9 because home	rule hasn ' t been	attained in New 10 York City , that	that ' s part of the problem , co - op 11 and condo	conversions , vacancy	decontrol , which 12 is a State legislated matter , have been	causes .13 What steps	have Assemblymember 14 O ' Donnell	taken	with regard to those	issues	to 15 address the	diminishing	housing stock in New  York 16 City ?17 MS . JOYCE	GOODMAN :	Well , for	one 18 thing	we have a tenant	clinic	- - you	mean at the 19 legislative	level or - -20 MS . LEVINE :	Yes . I ' m not talking 21 about	case worker issues . I ' m talking about	at 22 the legislative	level - -23 MS . JOYCE	GOODMAN :	Right . He - -24 MS . LEVINE :	- - to address	all	of the 25 problems	that we are hearing about .2 
2 MS . JOYCE	GOODMAN :	Well , one of the 3 bills	that he introduced recently , or 4 reintroduced , was to make	MCIs	not - - a surcharge 5 rather	than	a permanent	rent increase .6 ( Audience	participation . )7 MS . JOYCE	GOODMAN :	So that ' s a big 8 step .9 People	come into	our	office	all	the 10 time with	MCI rent	increases that	they don ' t11 understand and don ' t have	the	capacity to fight .12 And there ' s really	no oversight sufficient	to 13 protect tenants	from unjustifiable MCIs .14 So that	was one he sponsored .15 He ' s also	a co - sponsor of many	other 16 pieces	of legislation now	being introduced	by the 17 Assembly , which , fortunately , have very	little 18 chance	of passing the State Senate as it   stands 19 now .20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Go ahead . Betty .21 MS . ADAMS :	Yes .22 You	mentioned	that there	was some	data 23 that we were	looking at that he had	problems 24 with . Is there other data	that	he would	like for 25 us to look at ?2 
2 MS . JOYCE	GOODMAN :	Well , I think 3 data that	looks	at landlord income .4 MS . ADAMS :	Can you	get	it  to us very 5 soon ?6 MS . JOYCE	GOODMAN :	I think it ' s7 available	to the	public . It ' s just not being 8 considered . It ' s another - -9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	It ' s not	accurate 10 to say	we don ' t consider it .11 We have	an Income	and Expense Report .12 We look at it . If you take	a look	at the	Price 13 Index	of Operating	Costs and you	use	just a14 commensurate	formula , the	rent	increases	of this 15 Board	would	be considerably higher .16 You ' re not	the	first	one	to testify ,17 but it ' s not	accurate testimony that	this Board ,18 every	Member	of  this Board , does	not	look at the 19 other	factors . It ' s just not accurate .20 And	I don ' t like	to argue , but , in 21 fact , we use	that data . Despite the	rhetoric that 22 says we don ' t use that	data , we , in fact , use 23 that data	which	is why ,  if we used the Price 24 Index	of Operating	Costs , the	rent increases over 25 the last	six	years	would have	been considerably 2 

2	higher .34
MS . JOYCE	GOODMAN :	Okay .CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	There ' s no doubt 
5 about	that .6 MS . JOYCE	GOODMAN :	I ' ll take	that 7 back now .8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Despite	the 9 testimony	from many	people	that say	we ignore it ,10 we don ' t .11 MS . ADAMS :	And I was just	saying	if 12 there	is something	that	we haven ' t looked at , if 13 you could	get it to us , we ' d appreciate	it .14 MS . JOYCE	GOODMAN :	Okay . I ' ll take 15 that up with	my boss .16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Laura	Lendley ,17 please .18 Thank you . We appreciate	it . Tell	the 19 Assemblyman	we appreciate	his	testimony .20 ( Audience	participation . )21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Laura	Lendley .22 Are	you	here , Laura ?23 ( No response . )24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Barry	Soltz .25 Is that	you , Barry ?5

MR . BARRY	SOLTZ :	Yes . CHAIRMAN MARKUS :		All right .Let	me read some	names . Give me aHal	Brill , is he here ? MR . HAL	BRILL :	Yes .CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We ' re up to Speaker 
9	26 on the	tenant	side .10 Mr . Brill ;11 Followed by Anne	Perryman ;12 Followed by Sheila Gitlin ;13 Okay .14 Followed by Maria	Toledo ;15 You	here ? Yes .16 Followed by Thomas Diana ;17 Followed by Itala	Rutter .18 She ' s not	here .19 Go ahead , Mr . Soltz .20 MR . BARRY	SOLTZ :	Howdy ! My name	is 21 Barry	Soltz . I am a tenant	and	I ' m also	the	legal 22 coordinator	and	organizer	for	the	Janel	Towers 23 Tenants Association	in the	Bronx	where I live .24 Our	rent stabilized	building is  a25 former	Mitchell	Lama that	was	removed from	its 10 
2 affordable program	and	purchased	by  Larry Gluck 3 of Stellar Management .  Larry is a large	developer 4 who preys	upon our	City ' s affordable	housing 5 stock . Upon	buyout , he attempts to bring	rents	to 6 market	rates	in all	of his	buildings .7 Our	tenant	association is currently 8 involved	in a court	battle	with him	regarding the 9 " unique or peculiar " clause in rent 10 stabilization .11 Mr . Gluck	is asking	DHCR	to grant	him 12 a rent	increase	to market	rate	or higher	for all 13 of our	former Mitchell	Lama tenants . Despite the 14 fact that	DHCR regulations	provide that	just 15 being	in Mitchell Lama	is not	sufficient	grounds 16 for a unique	or peculiar increase , Mr . Gluck and 17 his investors are challenging	these	regs	in 18 court .19 If Gluck succeeds , my rent	will 20 increase	from $ 700	to about $ 1400	a month . Our 21 tenants live	in  constant fear . There	are	about 22 6 , 500	rent stabilized families from	former 23 Mitchell	Lamas throughout	the	City facing 24 potential	U & P increases , some  of which	are 25 three	to four times	their	current	rents .2 
2 We live	in constant	fear	of 3 displacement	and	are one step	away from 4 homelessness	if a bad  court decision	is reached .5 We are	hard workers	and	good citizens ,6 yet we are under	the thumb	of greedy	predatory 7 landlords	trying	to maximize their profits	for 8 their	investors	at our	expense .9 So basically whatever rent	increase 10 this Board passes , this	is the	tip of the iceberg 11 some of us are facing .12 Unfortunately , I know I ' m not going to 13 get a fair shake	from this	Board . With all	due 14 respect , this Board	is a sham	and	a farce .15 ( Audience	participation . )16 MR . BARRY	SOLTZ :	This	is basically a17 charade to legitimize a flawed	system that	favors 18 landlords .19 You	may	deceive all	the	people	part of 20 the time , and part	of the	people	all	the	time ,21 but not all	the	people	all	the	time . Abe	Lincoln 22 said that . In other	words , you	ain ' t fooling us .23 I said	that .24 Basically , landlords	get	price 25 increases	based	on an unfair price index .2 
2 Guidelines should be based	on what landlords are 3 actually	earning	and spending	to run	a building .4 ( Audience	participation . )5 MR . BARRY	SOLTZ :	According to The 6 New York	Times landlords earn	for	every	dollar	of 7 income	thirty - seven	cents	for	profit	and	debt .8 Okay ? That ' s not	taken	into account .9 Likewise , the	City Council	should 10 confirm RGB	appointments . And	basically	the	Mayor 11 has stacked	the	Board with	too	many	people	from 12 the real	estate	industry and not	enough	from the 13 non - profit world	and social services	professions .14 ( Audience	participation . )15 MR . BARRY	SOLTZ :	Tenants	are 16 handicapped	before	the	game even	begins . I17 wouldn ' t enter into	a poker game	where the	dealer 18 is dealing from	the	bottom	of the	deck .19 Essentially , that ' s what ' s going	on here .20 In short , the	answer	is the	RGB	Reform 21 Bill . Let ' s stop	the ethnic and economic 22 cleansing	of our	neighborhoods	and reform this 23 Board	now .24 I ' ve got one quick statement . I just 25 want to add	one	thing here , that	the	real estate 2 
 2 industry	has	put	on  a great dog and	pony	show 3 with all	the	small	owners	of all	these buildings .4 I ' d like to hear	testimony	from 5 Pinnacle , the Shaloms , the	Larry	Glucks , and 6 those	landlords . Let them	show	their	hardship and 7 the problems	that they	are	facing	in their 8 buildings .9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .10 MR . BARRY	SOLTZ :	Thank	you .11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Any questions ?12 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Sir , could	you	just 13 say how many	units	are	in your	development ?14 MR . BARRY	SOLTZ :	229 .15 MR . LANGUEDOC :	So that	these	are	all 16 former	Mitchell	Lama apartments that	are	no 17 longer	under	Mitchell Lama	and	there ' s a dispute 18 going	on in the	court as to  how much	the	owner 19 can increase	the	rent - -20 MR . BARRY	SOLTZ :	Correct .21 MR . LANGUEDOC :	- - for	these rent 22 stabilized tenants .23 Do you	have any idea	how	many people 24 could	afford	- - of  these two hundred	and	- - how 25	many ? - - 220	- -2 
2 MR . BARRY	SOLTZ :	229 .3 I don ' t know - -4 MR . LANGUEDOC :	- - could afford 5 double	the rent ?6 MR . BARRY	SOLTZ :	I mean I would	say ,7 off the top	of my head , probably	half of them 8 couldn ' t afford	those rents .9 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Okay .10 MR . BARRY	SOLTZ :	I mean , you	know , a11 lot of low - income families , a lot	of middle - class 12 families .13 And	I mean	personally I don ' t know 14 that I could	afford	that rent . I don ' t think I15 could .16 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Thank you . We 17 appreciate that . Thank	you	for	coming .18 THE	ACTING	CHAIRMAN :	Hal Brill .19 MR . HAL	BRILL :	I ' m the	owner	and 20 manager of a Manhattan	building .21 And	due	to the	way the Rent	Guidelines 22 Board	operates , tenants	are stealing	even 23 minuscule	profits or breakeven	returns from 24 landlords . Landlords are , in effect , subsidizing 25 their	tenants . Expenses	today	are	often	more than 2 
2 the current	rent	covers .3 The	guidelines	also	make	it  easy for 4 people	with	substantial	incomes to steal 5 rent - stabilized	units from	the	low - income people 6 they are	intended to help . Robinhood	in reverse :7 Robbing the	poor	by diverting	rent - stabilized 8 apartments to people who could easily afford  to 9 pay market rents .10 Although the guidelines	are	intended 11 to help low	and	fixed income people	survive	in 12 New York , year after year	this	dysfunctional 13 system	has side	effects	that make	them 14 increasingly	out	of sync with	current market 15 realities .16 The	effects accumulate to the  point 17 that it makes  better business	sense	for	a18 landlord	to walk	away from	a building than	to try 19 to maintain	it at a deficit . Of course , there are 20 always	new buyers out there who don ' t understand 21 what they ' re getting into .22 Year after	year , the	rent increases 23 fall further	behind	the	overall market . And	for 24 the last	several	years	they do not even	keep up 25 with the	bare bones	costs	of running	a building .2 
2 There is no low rent	supplement	for 3 rents	that have	been grandfathered at what	are 4 now ridiculously	depressed	levels .5 The	rent increases are too	low . Small 6 landlords	have had	the	burden	of supporting	huge 7 increases	in their	expenses - insurance , real 8 estate	taxes , water	and	sewer . While	we strive	to 9 maintain	our	services , our	returns do not  cover 10 our exponentially increasing expenses .11 Okay .12 One - third	of our	apartments	on 13 Columbus	Avenue	in the	80 s are	renting for	under 14 $ 700 a month	for	one - bedroom apartments . In an 15 unregulated	market , these	same	apartments would 16 be going	for	at  least $ 1000 more	a month , two to 17 three	times	as much .18 These are	the	facts	year	after	year ,19 meeting after meeting .  What we need	are	higher 20 guideline	increases	now .21 Furthermore , the	beneficiaries	of this 22 system	are not the	tenants	with the	greatest 23 need , but	rather	the tenants who	live in our 24 buildings	the longest , regardless	of the	need .25 Because	the rent	guidelines	have not 2 
2 kept up with	the	costs , the longer a tenant	has 3 been in a  rent stabilized	apartment , the	lower 4 the rent . The system does	not	address the 5 tenant ' s merit or income , just	longevity . This 6 inspires	tenant	corruption .7 Tenants	fight	to keep their	apartments 8 and choose their	successors even	after they	move 9 out or even	die .10 People	with no rights to  succession 11 get in via illegal	sublets	and	roommates , and 12 then relax while	landlords	have to jump	through 13 hoops	to pry	them out , hoops that	are costing 14 more and	more - but	not	for the tenants	-15 inordinate amounts	of time , energy and legal 16 fees .17 This convoluted and	biased	regulatory 18 situation	burdens the legal system with	illegal 19 tenants who	know	they can	hang	on , no matter how 20 flagrantly they	don ' t qualify , and now they	even 21 claim	landlord harassment .22 The	system	is skewed	against all 23 landlords , including fair	and	reasonable	ones , in 24 favor	of tenants . The overwhelming paperwork ,25 court	cases	are	a routine	part	of  our lives , the 2 
2 lead compliance	laws , all	add	instability and 3 uncertainty	to the	very	raw deal	of owning	a4 small	residential building .5 The	Rent Guidelines	Board has failed 6 the small	landlord . It allows	only minuscule 7 increases	that have	not	kept up with	inflation 8 and , in fact , fall	father	behind	every year .9 Clearly , the situation needs to be - -10 cannot	be rectified	overnight , but incremental 11 steps	can	be taken	to turn	things	around : Raise 12 the guideline increases , reinstitute	longevity 13 supplements	and	vacancy	allowances so apartment 14 rents	can	rise to subsistence	levels .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You need	to wrap 16 up .17 MR . HAL	BRILL :	Okay .18 So we need	a $ 50 increase for low	rent 19 vacancies .20 We need	like 100	percent	vacancy 21 allowances for low	rent	apartments .22 And	that would go  a long	way toward 23 restoring	some semblance - -24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .25 MR . HAL	BRILL :	- - of balance .2

9 President	of the	Association of Tenants	of 10 Lincoln Towers whose members I represent	here 11 today .12 We live	in the	remaining	550 13 rent - stabilized	apartments	in a 4 , 000 - unit 14 development	that	went co - op some	years ago	under 15 a non - eviction plan .16 The	nine Lincoln	Towers	were built 17 more than	forty	years ago	on West	End Avenue 18 between 66 th and	70 th Streets	as part of a  West 19 Side rejuvenation that	began in the	1960 s with 20 Robert	Moses ' demolition of many	blocks	of 21 low - rise	tenements	and	the	creation	of Lincoln 22 Center .23 The	developers	received	substantial 24 public	support for	the	affordable	high - rise 25 apartment	buildings	in which we live .9 
2 Many ATLT	members	were the	first 3 tenants to occupy their	apartments . In the	years 4 since	then , we have	raised	our	families	and	we 5 have supported our	schools , cultural 6 institutions , restaurants , movie	theatres , and 7 stores	through good	times	and	bad .8 Now	we are	grandparents	and 9 great - grandparents . Some are retired	and	many of 10 us continue	to work	at full - time	and	part - time 11 jobs . We are	active	volunteers	in our community .12 We participate in the  cultural life	of the	City ,13 and we all vote .14 ATLT agrees with	the	points	our 15 colleagues in the tenant movement	have already 16 made , and	our members have	asked	me to add	just 17 one thing . They	want me to say	thank	you	for your 18 role in the	rent	stabilization	program that	has 19 allowed us to live	the	interesting lives	that we 20 sought	in one of  the greatest	cities	ever in the 21 world .22 For	our	part , we have made	New	York 23 City a richer , better place . But	we are	concerned 24 for our children , our grandchildren	and	others 25 who wish	to join	our urban	community . They	too 2 
2 would	like to raise	their	families here , and New 3 York City	needs	their talents	and	their 4 diversity .5 We need	to keep the	rent	laws strong ,6 the rent	increases	modest , and	we desperately 7 need more	affordable housing so that	a new 8 generation of teachers , librarians , writers ,9 artists , dancers , musicians , waiters ,10 shopkeepers , students and	senior	citizens will	be 11 able to live	here .12 Housing	the people of any large	city 13 will always	be a challenge	and	New York	City 14 historically	has	been a  good place for renters .15 The	DHCR is a better	agency	today	than 16 it has	been	for	a long	time . But	it and	the	Rent 17 Guidelines Board	need reform .18 The	housing rules	that we live	by 19 should	be fair and	they	should	be made and 20 enforced	in New	York City , not	in Albany .21 Thank you	for	giving	me this 22 opportunity	to speak .23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .24 You	win	the award	for the most 25 balanced	statement	of the	day .2 
2 ( Audience	participation . )3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You win	the	award 4 for the most	balanced statement of the day .5 Sheila	Gitlin .6 As I pointed our , you ' re the only 7 winner , the	only	contestant so far .8 If you	hang around , we ' ll give	you 9 some water .10 Go ahead .11 Sheila	Gitlin , go ahead .12 MS . SHEILA	GITLIN :	Okay .13 I want	to thank you	for	letting	me 14 have this	opportunity to speak first	of all .15 Thank	you	very much .16 As a small	building	owner , I am 17 finding it financially	every year	harder	and 18 harder	to afford	my property . With the heating ,19 the electric , water	and	real estate	taxes going 20 up by leaps	and	bounds	in the	last few years , I21 see a  very dim future in maintaining	and 22 affording	my property .23 The	allowed rent	increases	are	hardly 24 enough	to  keep up with	the	increases	that the 25 landlords	have to bear	in running	a building .2 
 2 I understand the	concerns for those 3 tenants who	might not be able	to afford	the 4 increases , but I  feel maybe the State should put 5 them in public assistance	housing	or not	on the 6 shoulders	- - I really don ' t really know	the 7 exact , what	really	could be done , but on the 8 shoulders	of the	property	owners	is very 9 difficult .10 Why	do the	rent increases range	from 11 such a  low percentage ? Why	not	drop	the	low	end 12 of the	increases	and go with the	higher 13 percentage and let	it stay	at least	for	two	years 14 instead of changing	it up and	down every	year ?15 I don ' t want to sell	my building and I16 have very	good tenants	and	I am a very  good 17 landlord	and	I try	to do the most	I can .18 But	that might not be  an option	for me 19 when I no longer	can afford to maintain	and	run 20 it . The rents are not even	fair market in my 21 building . I don ' t have	any	rents	even close	to 22	$ 1000 .23 And	a buyer , even	an option	to sell 24 it , a buyer	would not be purchasing	it , I25 believe , because	the rentals are	so low . The rent 23 
2 roll is very	low .3 My husband , after	a full	day labor ' s4 work , would	go to the building to  do his	chores 5 in maintenance and	fixing , et cetera , himself ,6 because we cannot afford to hire	someone .7 It has	been very	devastating all 8 around . The	bills are mounting and we  are 9 desperate . We have	taken out an equity loan	now 10 where	we are	strapped to try and	come up with the 11 money	monthly for that .12 The	requests of the	property owners 13 for larger increases are justified by  the 14 expenses	in black and white . And	I know 15 personally that	I would	like to be able	to take	a16 deep breath	of relief and	know	tomorrow , another 17 day , that	I would be able	to upkeep	the	property 18 and not fear	the	worst .19 I thank	you again	for hearing me .20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .21 MS . SHEILA	GITLIN :	It ' s a22 six - family , by the	way .23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .24 MR . SCHLEIDER :	That ' s the	first 25 question .2 
2 MS . SHEILA	GITLIN :	And	not even 3 close	to a $ 1000 , and the	lowest	rent is $ 641 .4 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Is there a  mortgage 5 on the	property ?6 MS . SHEILA	GITLIN :	Yes , there	is a7 mortgage .8 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Not	your home	equity ,9 but there	is a mortgage	on it ?10 MS . SHEILA	GITLIN :	Oh , yes . The	home 11 equity	was to help	me . Yet , there	is a - -12 MR . SCHLEIDER :	And	yet	you still 13 needed	to take out	a home	equity	loan - -14 MS . SHEILA	GITLIN :	Yes .15 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- - to make	ends meet ?16 MS . SHEILA	GITLIN :	Yes . I have a17 mortgage	and	I have	the	home equity .18 The	building - - I have put	in money 19 because if I have to do  the roof	over - - the 20 heating unit	went on me . As soon	as they	called 21 me , I had	a new	unit put in the very	next day .22 And	I thought	it  would be great . It is 23 great . It is very efficient . It ' s doing	the	job .24 But when	I got my bill	that I was	told that	my 25 heating bills would	be around	$ 200 less	a month ,2 
 2 it turns	out	that it ' s even more	so . And	I3 thought that	was	an error	on the	gas	company .4 So when	I called	them , they	explained 5 to me because of  the rise	in fuel	and everything .6 So even though I put in  a new	unit , which I would 7 have done	anyway	because the other one you 8 couldn ' t fix , it ' s just	that every time	I try to 9 put a giant	step	forward , I ' m sort of pushed back 10 financially .11 MR . SCHLEIDER :	So let	me get	it 12 straight .13 The	$ 200 a month	savings	that you	were 14 promised	you	were going	to get	by using	this more 15 efficient	unit - -16 MS . SHEILA	GITLIN :	Well , they 17 figured around that , yeah .18 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- - got	eaten up by 19 increased	cost of heating ?20 MS . SHEILA	GITLIN :	Well , the 21 heating , and	there	were	other	- - the	gas	of the 22	- -23 MR . SCHLEIDER :	The	cost of that .24 MS . SHEILA	GITLIN :	- - the	real 25 estate	taxes	went up . I mean it ' s a package . It ' s23 
2 a whole package .3 But	I try	to maintain the  building 4 which	I feel	I am borrowing money , but I  still 5 need to do this	as far	as painting , doing the 6 sidewalks , because	it was	dangerous , it was 7 cracked . So I did that .8 I tended to  the roof	for	the leaking .9 I put	a brand new roof	in .10 MR . SCHLEIDER :	How	long have	your 11 tenants been	in the	building ?12 MS . SHEILA	GITLIN :	My tenants	have 13 been there a  long time .14 I just	have one that	is moving	on the 15 20 th of this	month .16 MR . SCHLEIDER :	After how	long ?17 MS . SHEILA	GITLIN :	Well , they	were 18 there	about	seven years . So - - they	just 19 purchased	a home .20 MR . SCHLEIDER :	So living	with	you 21 they were	able to save	enough	money	- -22 MS . SHEILA	GITLIN :	Oh , yeah .23 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Very good .24 MS . SHEILA	GITLIN :	Oh , yeah .25 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Thank you .2 
2 MR . LANGUEDOC :	I was just	wondering ,3 where	is this building	located ?4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	One more	question .5 MS . SHEILA	GITLIN :	It ' s in 6 Sheepshead Bay where all the two - bedroom 7 apartments are like	$ 1200	and	up .8 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Yes . Much	more 9 expensive .10 MS . SHEILA	GITLIN :	I ' m not even 11 close	to that .12 Okay .13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .14 Maria Toledo .15 MS . MARIA	TOLEDO :	Hello .	Thank 16 you .17 My name	is Maria	Toledo . And I am the 18 D irector	of the	Bridge	Fund of N ew York	City .19 And	the	Bridge	fund	of New	York	City 20 is a private	program that ' s dedicated to helping 21 low and moderate	income	workers hold	onto their 22 affordable apartments .23 We provide	services	and	financial 24 assistance mostly in the form	of interest - free 25 loans	with flexible	repayments	so clients can pay 2 
2 rental arrears that threaten eviction and  give 3 something back to the program and to our  City.4 I have worked at the Bridge  Fund 5 for roughly ten years and want to briefly  share 6 with you what I know based solely on my work and   my 7 experiences serving clients.8 Increasingly, many hard- working 9 families and individuals are facing -- finding  it 10 difficult to make ends meet despite  having 11 full- time employment and in some cases, more than 12 two jobs.13 The problem is so serious  that 14 even individuals who have advanced college  degrees 15 and who consider themselves solidly middle  class 16 are struggling to keep a roof over their  heads.17 In fact, the average Bridge  Fund 18 client household, many of whom are headed  by 19 teachers, by hospital aides, by peace officers,  net 20 less than $ 1 , 890 . That' s one thousand eight hundred 21 and ninety dollars.22 Almost all Bridge Fund clients 23 live in rent regulated apartments and most use  more 24 than 39 percent of their income to pay for  rent.25 That means -- this basically means that  after 2 
2 paying rent there' s very little left for food, for 3 transportation for utilities and for childcare,  let 4 alone medical expenses.5 With the rising cost of food  and 6 the proposed rent increases, many hard- working New 7 Yorkers will be forced to double up or to leave   our 8 great city. Some will undoubtedly end up in  the 9 inhumane and the costly shelter  system.10 And I hope to remind you that  as 11 some of you may know, it cost about $ 36 , 000 a year 12 to taxpayers to keep a family in a public   shelter.13 Each year my office is forced  to 14 reject more and more families and  individuals 15 seeking help. Last year alone the office  received,16 on average, more than ten requests a day for   help.17 That' s ten requests per business day, I may say.18 Sadly, of the 2600 that  applied,19 only thirteen percent, thirteen percent qualified 20 for our services and for financial assistance.  The 21 overwhelming majority of applicants simply could 22 not demonstrate that despite having two, in  some 23 cases, three jobs in the household, they  had 24 futurability.25 As I -- as you consider today  the 2 
2 matter before you, obviously, rent increases, I  ask 3 that you continue to factor in all costs,  including 4 costs that we, as a society must  bear.5 MR. KIMMEL:	Thank you.6 Questions?7 ( Applause.)8 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.9 Ms. Toledo, I have a  question.10 Thanks so much for coming here 11 today.12 MS. MARIA TOLEDO:	Thank you.13 MS. HOLDER:	I know your name and 14 this is the first time I' ve ever really seen  you.15 So thank you for --16 MS. MARIA TOLEDO:	But I' ve seen 17 you.18 MS. HOLDER:	Oh!, okay. Thank 19 you so much for coming this  afternoon.20 MS. MARIA TOLEDO:	Thank you.21 MS. HOLDER:	When you say thirteen 22 percent of applicants qualify for assistance,  what 23 does that mean?24 MS. MARIA TOLEDO:	Last year we 25 got more than 2600 requests for  financial 2 
2 assistance to pay back rent that threaten  eviction.3 And only thirteen percent of those  applicants 4 qualify for us, which basically meant that most  of 5 them couldn' t demonstrate that they had enough 6 income to pay their rent and all their other  basic 7 living expenses. So they really couldn' t show that 8 they had what we in the social service field  call 9 futurability.10 MS. HOLDER:	So what you' re saying 11 is that you all would pay for any back arrears   just 12 knowing that perhaps people had fallen on  hard 13 times.14 But eligibility to you is the  idea 15 that despite the fact that you can give  them 16 assistance in the back arrears, that there has  to 17 be this demonstrated ability to pay future rent  so 18 the appearance that they can afford the  apartment 19 and they won' t have this problem again.20 MS. MARIA TOLEDO:	Right.	I mean 21 that' s a very easy to figure out when you look  at 22 someone' s expenses and then you look at their 23 income.	That' s easy math.24 We try very hard to help  people 25 access certain benefits and services that  might 2 
2 enhance their profile.	But once we' ve done that,3 if there' s nothing else, we cannot help them with 4 their rental arrears. And sadly, a lot of  people 5 are asking the help. And despite working -  because 6 all of our clients have to work - they can' t  afford 7 their apartments.8 And for those households that  we 9 have been able to approve, as I mentioned  earlier,10 the net income is about $ 1890 a month. So when  you 11 pay your rent, you have very little left  for 12 anything else.13 So a future rent increase for  even 14 those households that have qualified now, it' s very 15 hard.16 MS. HOLDER:	And it' s been the 17 testimony of some that have come before us  earlier 18 in this season, as well as today, that they  don' t19 know of any people who actually get evicted if  they 20 truly are poor or disabled and don' t have any 21 assistance.22 What has been your experienced 23 based off of what you do at The Bridge  Fund?24 MS. MARIA TOLEDO:	In terms of 25 whether people --2 

23	evicted.4
MS. HOLDER:	Actually get MS. MARIA TOLEDO:	A lot of people 
5 get evicted, yes. And I would say for people  that 6 typically come, clients that typically come to  The 7 Bridge fund - and again, those are  working 8 households - those who are not able to secure  the 9 money that they need to pay their back rent,  will 10 end up doubling up with family  members.11 But that' s only -- you know, in a12 matter of a couple of months that  housing 13 arrangement is no longer viable and they do end  up 14 in the shelter, many of them, or they simply  move 15 and leave the city.16 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.	And when you 17 say double up and that' s not viable, what do  you 18 mean by that?19 MS. MARIA TOLEDO:	Well, when you 20 have, for example, two large families living in  a21 two- bedroom apartment, you know, when you create 22 overcrowding, unsafe conditions, you know, that 23 doesn' t work for very long.24 MS. HOLDER:	But not only is 25 that uncomfortable but also landlords can  --5

MARIA TOLEDO:	Absolutely.9 We' ve seen that as well.10 MS. HOLDER:	And so you' re seeing 11 more and more working families in the  shelter 12 system then.13 MS. MARIA TOLEDO:	Yes, there are.14 There' s a substantial number of working families in 15 the shelter system.	And interestingly enough,16 Professor Dennis Cohane ( phonetic) of the 17 University of Pennsylvania, has found that when  you 18 look at most of the working poor families in  the 19 shelter system, the ones that have been there  the 20 longest are actually the ones that are  more 21 functional. Those are the ones that are able  to 22 comply with shelter stay placement. They' re the 23 ones that can keep the appointments, submit  other 24 documentation, all the reporting requirements.25 At issue really is the lack  of 7 
2 affordable housing.3 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	A question.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Steve.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	In your 7 experience -- and thank you for the work you' re 8 doing.	I think it' s very valuable -- what is  that 9 differential in rent between this $ 1890 that the 10 family can take home, the rent that they' re paying,11 and the rent that they would say need to pay   in 12 order to stay where they are?	Is it $ 50 a month?13 Is it $ 100 month?14 MS. MARIA TOLEDO:	I' m not sure I15 quite understand the question.16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The family has a17 rent burden in place from or six months ago.  If 18 they had had an extra $ 50 a month, an extra $ 100 a19 month, or whatever that number is, can you  quantify 20 what the number is so they wouldn' t have been 21 knocking at your door?22 MS. MARIA TOLEDO:	I won' t be able 23 to quantify it by having -- by saying to you   that 24 we' ve done a specific study. But I would say 25 anecdotally probably about $ 100 , $ 150 .2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right. Because 3 at a $ 100 a month, if it' s costing $ 36 , 000 a year 4 to house this family in a shelter, that $ 36 , 000 a5 year would help thirty families at $ 100 a  month.6 MS. MARIA TOLEDO:	Right.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So it seems to 8 be a policy issue from the  City.9 MS. MARIA TOLEDO:	That is.10 Yes, that is a policy issue for the City. And   I11 think that certainly one of the reasons  why 12 maintaining rents affordable is key.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, it' s not 14 necessarily keeping rents affordable, which is  part 15 of it, but also making sure the City subsidizes  or 16 supports our working families.17 MS. MARIA TOLEDO:	Both. The 18 problem --19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	If there' s going 20 to be one family, they can help 25  --21 MS. MARIA TOLEDO:	There are 22 several approaches that need to be taken to  tackle 23 this problem because the problem is  big.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.25 MR. KIMMEL:	Thank you.2

2 Real tenants and real working 3 tenants are often sacrificed to protect  social 4 disasters. Our local politicians rail  against 5 landlords.	Yet the papers are filled with  their 6 problems, with prostitutes, illegal slush  fund,7 illegitimate children, drunken raping of 8 grandmothers, embezzling City funds, hangings, and 9 defending crack dealers.10 I' m sure you' re all watching our 11 papers.12 The cheapest rent controlled rents 13 the City controls are $ 950 . Right here. And yet 14 they defend $ 90 rents from private landlords. We 15 don' t want to charge tenants more to cover the $ 200 16 rent of a chronically unemployed  tenant.17 Con Edison, DEP, the insurance 18 companies, want real cash money and more cash  every 19 year and not some outdated Mickey Mouse  percentage 20 calculation, one already below cost  rents.21 Read between the lines when  you 22 read many of the newspaper article critical  of 23 landlords. Right there.	Not- for- profit is 24 renovating apartments and renting them for $ 1000 25 yet $ 535 the private landlord is a villain.  Okay?2 
2 Construction is booming and yet  we 3 had three and four healthy adults in an  apartment,4 cellphones for everybody, cable TV, DVD  players,5 and yet mysteriously there' s only one income. Right 6 here in this article.7 Tenants are starving yet they' re 8 crying about the annual car parking fees going  up 9 to $ 75 a year. Do you know what insurance cost  you 10 for your car in New  York?11 One article cries about the 12 seventy years of drug use in Harlem and in  the 13 Village and the next cries and the same  people 14 cannot afford to pay their half cost rent. Do  you 15 think there' s a connection between these two? Right 16 here. Seventy years of drug use. Right? That' s why 17 they can' t pay their rent.18 So- called single mothers of three 19 and four kids mysteriously pretend they have  no 20 idea who the father is. Try pushing your  boyfriend 21 out of bed in the morning and tell him to get   a22 job.23 ( Audience participation.)24 MR.

8 Direct the Emergency Food and Shelter  program,9 which is run out of United Way of New York   City 10 which provides about $ 2 million in assistance to 11 advocates and social service agencies that  are 12 trying to keep people within their  homes.13 The problem that we have in  the 14 City is, of course, that the rich are  always 15 getting richer.	About twenty percent more goes to 16 the rich and the poor have remained the  same.17 New York City is the city in  the 18 country where the divergence between the very  rich 19 and the very poor is the widest. You have  some 20 people on the average making $ 350 , 000 and the 21 lowest, the lower twenty percent make about $ 8 , 000 .22 That is really a serious problem that you all   are 23 trying to deal with and that' s why people are  not 24 able to afford to pay  rents.25 A sixty dollar increase will 8 
2 really affect some of the people that I  see 3 everyday.4 We used to see an average month' s5 rent be around $ 800 , $ 900 . Now you see $ 1500 ,6 $ 1700 , $ 1800 and we process these requests everyday 7 from about forty agencies throughout the City.  And 8 we see what the trend  is.9 We also work at the Emergency  Rent 10 Coalition which represents advocates for  New 11 Yorkers who are at risk at eviction from  their 12 homes by providing education and information  on 13 issues related to emergency rent and rent  arrears.14 We assure qualitative and 15 quantitative services in eviction prevention by 16 developing new initiatives and guidelines  to 17 address the issue of homeless  prevention.18 Because since my program is  both 19 emergency food and shelter, we see the people  who 20 can' t afford rents also ending up at the pantries 21 at the end of the month. Because this is   true.22 There' s been an increase in people who are --  where 23 you have two people working in the home who  are 24 going at the end of the month to supplement  their 25 food with a pantry help.2 
2 We also see some of the people  who 3 did not manage to retain their apartments  because 4 they did not get adequate -- and also  financial 5 literacy help, frankly. They end up in shelters  and 6 we' ve seen an increase in shelters.7 In the case of children,  for 8 example, you had 13 , 564 in 2006 and you have 14 , 966 9 in January 2008 . This is in spite of the  Mayor 10 trying to really do something about  affordable 11 housing.	But it' s not enough because he doesn' t12 know what the real problems are of the people  we 13 deal with everyday.14 Thank you very much.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any questions?17 Ma' am.18 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you for coming 19 in this afternoon for your testimony.	I really 20 appreciate it.21 You said that you' re seeing rents 22 upwards of $ 1500 to $ 1700 , $ 1800 .	Is that 23 throughout the City?24 MS. ITALA RUTTER:	Yes, it is.25 There are -- of course, if you' re talking about 2 
2 people in NYCHA, that doesn' t count.	But a very 3 small minority of our clients are living in  NYCHA 4 housing.5 MS. HOLDER:	And how do you 6 determine which of those families you will  give 7 assistance and how many of them do you turn  away?8 MS. ITALA RUTTER:	Well, we don' t9 do that directly.	We work with people, like  my 10 colleague, Maria Toledo, on The Bridge Fund,  the 11 Federation of Welfare agencies, Metropolitan 12 Council on Jewish Poverty, Catholic Charities,  and 13 a variety of other smaller programs throughout  the 14 City who have case managers.	And I know that they 15 turn away the vast amount of people who come  to 16 them.	About 75 percent of the people that they  see 17 on the average I would say they would have  turn 18 away.19 And this is because people --  we 20 give one month' s rent for a year to a person of  a21 household. They' re not allowed to have more than 22 that. They have to prove that they' re not going to 23 be evicted in the next two or three months or   come 24 back for rent to some other agency. They have to   be 25 able to work towards remaining as far  as 2 

2	self- sufficient.34	question?5
MR. LANGUEDOC:	Could I ask aIs it the case that the  charity 
6 funds that you deal with, that they have  sufficient 7 funds to provide one months' rent for everyone  who 8 is in need and qualifies for it, or is it the   case 9 that the funds become depleted and even if you  are 10 qualified, you can' t get it?11 MS. ITALA RUTTER:	Well, in the 12 case of the particular stream of money that  I13 control, actually it comes to an end about  mid 14 year. So then they go to the New York Time   Funds.15 Some foundations will supply some help.	But 16 essentially, no, it' s always far short.17 And, of course, now we' ll probably 18 end up not having any more money at the end of   this 19 month I would say.20 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	One question,22 please.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Another 24 question.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The rents that you 6 
2 cited, these are for families.3 MS. ITALA RUTTER: Yes.4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So how many 5 bedrooms are we talking about for the $ 1600 , $ 1700 6 a month, two, three four?7 MS. ITALA RUTTER:	Well, you 8 know, I haven' t done a thorough study but it  could 9 be done.	And I would say it' s from one to two 10 bedrooms.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	Thank you.12 MS. ITALA RUTTER:	And I see the 13 very same thing that Maria Toledo sees, that  people 14 first to start to live with their families,  you 15 know, the extended families.16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I understand 17 that.	But the support of apartment rent  that 18 you' re providing for would be an apartment size 19 sufficient to accommodate the family.20 MS. ITALA RUTTER:	Yes.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So we' re not 22 talking about one bedroom for a  family.23 MS. ITALA RUTTER:	No.24 MR.

234	afternoon.5
Sharon Redhead, go ahead. MS. SHARON REDHEAD:	Good My family owns and manages  a
6 27 - unit building located in East Flatbush,7 Brooklyn.8 Last winter our heating costs were 9 forty percent higher than the previous winter.  Over 10 the past several weeks the price per gallon  of 11 heating oil has increased an additional  thirty 12 percent and shows no signs of  dropping.13 Almost everyday oil reaches a  new 14 record high.	Today being no exception.15 During the height of the  winter,16 we had an oil delivery for over $ 12 , 000 . This bill 17 was almost equal to our total monthly income  and 18 only provided heat for a two- and- a- half- week 19 period.20 There were a couple of  months 21 where we had to choose between paying the oil  bill 22 and paying the mortgage.	We were able to get  a23 line of credit but have used all the funds to   cover 24 heating costs and we are now operating in the  red.25 The rents in our building  range 6 
2 between $ 560 and $ 950 with only four tenants paying 3 more than $ 800 . Therefore, the proposed guideline 4 increases will not provide us with the  income 5 needed to survive the upcoming winter much less  pay 6 for any needed improvements.7 Many tenants have said that  owners 8 who are unable to manage financially should  sell 9 their buildings. However, the only people  crazy 10 enough to buy a building whose income does  not 11 cover his expenses are deep- pocketed individuals or 12 those large corporations that are now referred  to 13 as predatory investors.14 These new owners will no  doubt 15 focus their energy on getting rid of those  tenants 16 paying below market rents as is the case  with 17 Stuyvesant Town.18 The small property owners are the 19 ones providing affordable housing in this  City.20 Forcing them to sell will only exacerbate  an 21 already dire situation.22 I implore the Board to be fair  to 23 all parties involved by approving a low  rent 24 adjustment in addition to the proposed  guideline 25 increases. This would ease the burden placed  on 2 
2 property owners who are currently forced  to 3 subsidize their tenants as well as minimize  the 4 impact on tenants who are currently paying  market 5 rents.6 And to those who say no  increase,7 I say no increase equals no  heat.8 Thank you.9 ( Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question?11 MS. SHARON REDHEAD:	I have my 12 bank statement and I have my line of credit  which 13 shows that it' s been used up, if anybody wants  to 14 look at it. And a $ 15 , 000 water bill that' s due in 15 thirty days and I only have $ 7 , 000 in my account.16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	How many units in 17 your building?18 MS. SHARON REDHEAD:	Twenty- seven.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Twenty- seven.20 And where is the building  located.21 MS. SHARON REDHEAD:	East 22 Flatbush, Brooklyn.23 MR.

MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.MS. SHARON REDHEAD:	I don' t have

And what is --10 MS. SHARON REDHEAD:	Yes.	So 11 right now we' re looking at almost a hundred percent 12 increase in a year and -- in two  years.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	If you could give 14 me an idea as to how much then your fuel bill   went 15 up, just round numbers.16 MS. SHARON REDHEAD:	I believe in 17 ' 06 it was about $ 30 , 000 . This year it' s close to 18	50 .19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Fifty?20 MS. SHARON REDHEAD:	I mean in ' 07 21 it was close to fifty.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Fifty. $ 20 , 000 23 and 27 units.24 MS. SHARON REDHEAD:	Yeah.	My 25 building is on the corner and it' s -- it' s actually 19

LANGUEDOC:	Excuse me.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Another 11 question.12 MR. LANGUEDOC:	What is the range 13 of the rents of the twenty- seven units?14 MS. SHARON REDHEAD:	The rents 15 range between $ 560 and $ 950 for the most expensive 16 apartment, which is a two bedroom. Only  four 17 apartments out of twenty- seven are over $ 800 and 18 they' re all two- bedroom apartments.19 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay. Thank you.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You guys are 21 equal.

5 I don' t like it. It' s rude and it' s inappropriate.6 He was a Lieutenant and  a7 fourteen- year veteran of the Fire Department,8 Engine 249 in Brooklyn. He died on January 4 ,  2008 9 in the Ebbets Field House  fire.10 The fire was reported due to  a11 child playing with gas jets turned on because  the 12 landlord had not provided heat to the  building.13 This latter fact was reported initially and  then 14 disappeared from the reporting.	Apparently someone 15 was asked to skip that salient  feature.16 The landlord is the actual  source 17 of that firefighter' s death, not the child playing 18 with fire. He was the conduit of the landlord' s19 homicide consequent on a cascade of events  that 20 began with a lack of  heat.21 The Board needs to start 22 recognizing that the denial of services and  refusal 23 to maintain infrastructure isn' t some minor 24 inconvenience to tenants, it literally maims  and 25 kills, and not just the tenants. Nor has a penny   of 5 
2 the increases that the Board continues to vote  on 3 gone to heat, water, maintenance, major or  minor.4 I remind this Board that  their 5 obligation to actually investigate the claims  being 6 made by landlords when they assert  insufficient 7 profit and actual loss, in demanding  these 8 excessive rent increases, by asking them, have  they 9 asked for a hardship increase and if they got  it 10 and if they didn' t get it.11 ( Audience participation.)12 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	And I come 13 here year after year and ask you to do that and   I14 sit here for hours and not one of you ever   asks 15 that question.16 This year the primary claim 17 continues to be the rising cost of oil, as it   has 18 been for several years despite my reminder to  this 19 Board that climate destabilization has given  new 20 York City the hottest winters on record which  means 21 that no heat is necessary and no oil is   being 22 burned or purchased. Those using oil should  be 23 required to apply for a hardship exemption,  open 24 their books and prove that they' re operating at a25 loss.2 
2 This Board should not be  giving 3 increases on any such basis. My building uses  gas 4 but I' m paying for the oil that I' m not using.5 My heat was turned on last year  in 6 the early afternoon of November 8 . Not October 1 st,7 because it was too warm. It was turned off early   in 8 May.9 In addition, the landlords are 10 whining - and yes, it is whining - not   a11 reality- based need that the cost of water is going 12 up is a legitimizing cover story for  demanding 13 exorbitant increases. Landlords have an  obligation 14 to bear some portion of their cost of  doing 15 business, not simply pass it on to  tenants.16 Denying them increases would force 17 them to stop waste in which they engage. In   my 18 building I have just this month made three  written 19 complaints about every square inch of the  sidewalk 20 being watered over the course of twenty to  thirty 21 and more minutes. And I have clocked up to an   hour 22 and a half and that was during City  restriction 23 under drought.24 I' ll move up quickly here.25 I also want to remind this  Board 2 
2 that I am a disabled tenant and that we have a   near 3 $ 9000 disparity between DRIE and SCRIE for reasons 4 that are beyond my comprehension.	And I want to 5 tell Ms. Cruz that I have lived in my building   for 6 seventeen years and I have suffered  landlord 7 harassment of mammoth proportions.8 And I will be happy to tell  you,9 on or off the record, what I have suffered from   my 10 landlord and his employees.	And that includes 11 denial of disability accommodation.12 I have come here -- I came  here 13 for nine years and testified to the denial  of 14 services, before you were on the Board even,  and 15 finally got them two or three years ago. It cost   me 16 several hundred dollars, which I could not  recoup 17 from the landlord to go through State Supreme  Court 18 to get those accommodations to which I am  legally 19 entitled.20 And I can tell you that when  the 21 rent goes up, my ability to pay for it, I   will 22 become a homeless person because there' s no place 23 for me to go. I can' t double up with family  because 24 I have no family.25 And I' ll stop there because I have 2 
2no time.3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4Any questions? Any questions?5( No response.)6MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.7( Applause.)8CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Barbara 9	Kraebel.

BARBARA KRAEBEL:	I have 15 submitted a memorandum to the Board, which I   left 16 at the desk outside, which focuses on  issues 17 regarding the way that the increases in the  rents18 or decreases under the stabilization guidelines  are 19 computed. And there are a number of things that  I20 think the Board should consider.21 And one is, in fact, the  tenant 22 hardship is really overrated as an element in  this.23 Because if tenants are -- cannot pay the costs  of 24 the homes that they live in, then they  should 25 either find other places to live or the  government 2

5 programs tat are in place in the City. There  are 6 many charitable organizations that support people 7 who can' t pay their rent. And that' s the way it 8 should be subsidized.

We have fuel increases completely  out 14 of control and repair expenses.15 I' m an owner of a small building.16 We have ten units in our building so we don' t  have 17 a staff of electricians and plumbers on call.  We 18 have to call independent contractors  whenever 19 there' s a repair and it' s outrageous the amounts 20 that are charged.21 Another aspect of this is that  in 22 computing the rents, the Board does not  consider 23 the fact that building income is not something  that 24 owners should have to share with rent  stabilized 25 tenants.	In my cases, buildings have  been 5 
2 renovated at huge expense by the owners  or 3 apartments have been renovated at huge expense.  The 4 tenant pays no share of that. And the idea  that 5 because there are high rents in another  apartments,6 a rent stabilized tenant should pay less than  the 7 economic rent for their apartment I think  is 8 completely misguided.9 And in that regard, the  RPIE 10 filings with the Department of Finance, which  the 11 Board relies on, I believe, in computing  expenses,12 does not include any expense for  capital 13 improvements in apartments or any deduction  for 14 depreciation. So all of those costs that  owners 15 incur in order to raise rents are  automatically 16 excluded in your deliberations.17 I had a number of other  comments 18 as well, including the fact long- term tenants are 19 not charged additional amounts based upon the  fact 20 that their apartments, installation, equipment,21 improvements, deteriorate over time. And  this 22 requires increasing expenses, increasing capital 23 improvements for which owners are not  compensated,24 unless the tenant agrees to it, which the  tenant 25 has no reason to agree.	So the owner has to  bear 2 
2 all those costs without any change in the  rent.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 4 wrap up.5 What do you recommend?6 MS. BARBARA KRAEBEL:	Well, I' ve 7 made a number of recommendations, as a matter  of 8 fact, in my memo.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. We' ll 10 look at it. But what are you recommending for  the 11 allowable lease increase?	Do you have a12 recommendation for that?13 MS. BARBARA KRAEBEL:	For the 14 guidelines for this year?15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.16 MS. BARBARA KRAEBEL:	Yes. I' m17 recommending that the guidelines be the  price 18 increases as found by the Board.	Because it seems 19 to me that' s the most relevant figure and the  only 20 really objective figure that the Board can  use.21 Relying on anecdotal evidence as to what  tenants 22 can pay, what owners receive --23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 Any additional questions?25 MS. BARBARA KRAEBEL:	-- is 2

( No response.)CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.Alonzo Jordan. Thank you.Pull the mike towards to you.  MR. ALONZO JORDAN:	Okay. Good 
9	afternoon.	My name is Al Jordan.10 I think I' m going to have to 11 piggy- back on, I think, his name was Attorney Bob 12 Andrews and what he said about the harassment,  kind 13 of tied into what my testimony  has.14 I thought I went through a  great 15 ordeal with me and my wife when we lived in   a16 section of Briarwood and one of the tenants  over 17 there in the housing projects and some of  the 18 tricks they would use like putting in the  rent 19 check late.	And subsequently my wife had to  take 20 off of work to go to Landlord Tenant  Court.21 And I thought that was  devastating 22 until I read this article here from the  testimony 23 from the Department of -- New York City  Department 24 of Investigation.25 It reads, it says a manager at  the 10 
2 New York City Housing Authority was arrested  on 3 charges that he stole tens of thousands of  dollars 4 in rental payments made by 32 unsuspecting  NYCHA 5 tenants.6 The NYCHA employee is charged  with 7 taking advantage of his position by  instructing 8 eighteen NYCHA tenants, who were behind in  their 9 rent, to make their rent payments to him with  the 10 promise that he would expedite the payment  process.11 Upon receipt of the tenants'  money 12 orders, the NYCHA employee credited the  tenants'13 rental account but deposited the money orders  into 14 his personal bank account.15 And the last paragraph says,  the 16 NYCHA employee also convinced fourteen tenants,17 just moving into the NYCHA development, many  of 18 whom are elderly or did not speak fluent  English,19 to pay their first month' s rent, security deposit,20 and various other surcharges directly to  him.21 The NYCHA employee is now  charged 22 with grand larceny. I thought that was a   little 23 overwhelming. I' m not sure how it plays it out  in 24 this forum.	But like I said, kind of piggy- back 25 about what Attorney Andrew said about  the 2 
2 harassment issue and a lot of the tricks that  the 3 landlords use.4 Like I said, they would put  the 5 check in late. I don' t know if this is the  purview 6 for that or if you have any jurisdiction  or 7 authority to somehow maybe get the landlords  to 8 have some kind of stipulation of time factor  where 9 they can get the checks in so the tenants  wouldn' t10 have to go through this type of  harassment.11 Because my wife had to take  off 12 days of work. I had to go down and miss out   on 13 employment. It was just a very big  inconvenience 14 amongst everything as far as services not  being 15 rendered.16 But that was pretty much all I  had 17 to say concerning that.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 Any questions?	Thank you, sir.20 MS. HOLDER:	I have a quick 21 question.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.23 MS. HOLDER:	Where do you live?24 MR. ALONZO JORDAN:	Now I live in 25 the Cambria Heights section of Queens. But this  was 2 
2 during when I lived in the Briarwood section  of 3 Queens.4 MS. HOLDER:	How large is your 5 apartment?6 MR. ALONZO JORDAN:	That apartment 7 was a one- bedroom at the time. It was a8 one- bedroom.9 MS. HOLDER:	It was rent 10 stabilized?11 MR. ALONZO JORDAN:	No, no. I12 think the base rent --13 MS. HOLDER:	Were you a NYCHA 14 tenant?15 MR. ALONZO JORDAN:	No.16 MS. HOLDER:	Oh!17 MR. ALONZO JORDAN:	It' s a private 18 development.19 MS. HOLDER:	Are you currently 20 in a rent stabilized apartment?21 MR. ALONZO JORDAN:	No. I live in 22 a private home development now. I do -- what it   is,23 I do a lot various legwork for State  Senator 24 Malcolm A Smith. And we had a project  called 25 Protect Your Home.	And what it encompassed,2 
2 because it' s in the jurisdiction now of being the 3 Chair and so forth, Minority Chair,  involved 4 protecting the homes and tenants.	And he' s sent me 5 out to various meetings like with the  Briarwood 6 Association and they have some developments  over 7 there, various, you know, things with NYCHA and  so 8 forth like that.9 I guess you want to know how  that 10 all tied in more or less with the harassment  maybe,11 is that what your question was  or?12 MS. HOLDER:	I was asking about 13 your particular experience with the rent  stabilized 14 unit.15 MR. ALONZO JORDAN:	Well, I16 testified last year to living with  my 17 mother- in- law, subsequently living in the Rangel 18 Houses, formerly I guess the Polo Grounds, and  how 19 that was rent stabilized at one time.  And 20 subsequently she moved into development in  the 21 Bronx.22 MS. HOLDER:	Right.23 MR. ALONZO JORDAN:	And it' s a24 three- family home.	But I feel by her being,  you 25 know, a Christian and somewhat elderly, that  this 2 
2 would some kind of upgrade for her.	But she said 3 no. She had rather had stayed in the  rent 4 stabilized because being on a supplemental  income 5 and her husband subsequently passing away was  more 6 advantageous to her. But now it' s a bit of a  burden 7 right now to try to come up with the  funds.8 MS. HOLDER:	All right. Thank 9 you.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 Council Member Gale Brewer;12 Followed by Curtis Harger;13 Elena Wong;14 Jay Sobhraj; and 15 Then Claire Dockery.16 Let me make it clear that  the 17 sign- in ends at 6 : 00 so anybody who wants to sign 18 in can do so until  then.19 COUNCILWOMAN GALE BREWER:	Thank 20 you very much.21 My name is Gale Brewer.  I22 represent the Council District 54 th Street to 96 th 23 Street on the West Side of  Manhattan.24 And I' m here today to request that 25 the Rent Guidelines Board members support no  rent 2 
2 increase, particularly for residents of Class  A3 hotels, --4 ( Applause.)5 COUNCILWOMAN GALE BREWER:	--6 SRO' s rooming houses, and, of course, rent 7 regulated residents.8 I think you know that there  are 9 about a million rent stabilized units in the  City 10 currently, over 43 , 00 rent controlled and I think 11 in Manhattan about a third of the stabilized  is 12 where the rent stabilized units are. This  is 13 millions of people.14 And if I could think of one  thing 15 to say today in summary - and I' ll leave this  for 16 you - is that in my district and elsewhere  where 17 you have a great deal of conversion to the   market,18 I would say that in the market, since the  decontrol 19 law went into effect in 1994 , there have been  over 20 71 , 000 stabilized apartments that have become 21 market rate units. During that same period  about 22 40 , 000 or more condo or co- op.23 And, of course, it continues.24 The issue for as you debate  this 25 endless dance over and over again year after  year 2 
2 is particularly now where we have vacancy  decontrol 3 providing market rate units and condos and co- ops 4 with a rental building.	In those particular 5 situations, as we have suggested before, similar  to 6 the SROs and the hotels, there should be, in  my 7 opinion, absolutely no increase, particularly in 8 those buildings.9 The second issue, of course, is 10 that as you are looking at these issues, the  other 11 questions that come up is the issue of  illegal 12 hotels. It' s an issue because nobody can decide --13 ( Audience participation.)14 COUNCILWOMAN GALE BREWER:	-- how 15 to deal with it. And I have to say that the  Mayor' s16 Office and the City Council are looking  very 17 closely at this issue.18 But that' s another example where 19 there is an alternate type of income coming  into 20 the owners.	Absolutely no increase should come 21 from the Rent Guidelines Board where there  are 22 other kinds of rent available to those  particular 23 owners.24 In our area we just had, for  the 25 last six months, once a month, thanks to the  Urban 2 
2 Justice Center and Riverside' s SRO Law Project, we 3 had wonderful attorneys there one evening  per 4 month. Over 300 people, unduplicated in name,  came,5 many of them seniors, to be able to get   assistance 6 just in our neighborhood regarding keeping  their 7 apartment.8 And they are often in  these 9 buildings that are " being cleared out." That is not 10 how to keep the middle class in the City of   New 11 York.12 And what I' m urging you today to 13 think about it very, very carefully despite  the 14 fact that you' re going to hear opposite, is that 15 where you have buildings where all of this  turmoil 16 is going on, where we don' t have Assembly Member 17 Rosenthal' s bill, which I support, we would get rid 18 vacancy decontrol, I support looking at this  whole 19 issue of rent stabilization, rent control, and  loft 20 hotels, very differently.21 There' s an alternate way of 22 figuring out how income can come in and where  there 23 isn' t an alternate kind of income, working with 24 city agencies to try to be  supportive.25 Thank you very much.2

CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.Any questions? ( Applause.)MS. LEVINE:	Yes.CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Questions. Go MS. LEVINE:	Hi, Council Member.COUNCILWOMAN GALE BREWER:	I' m
11 fine. Nice to see you.12 MS. LEVINE:	Nice to see you too.13 As the day goes on it  becomes 14 increasingly difficult for us to hear  respected 15 members of the City Council, like you,  particularly 16 ones that I consider a friend, to talk about  all 17 the things that we can' t do as a  Board.18 Specifically, we have no control 19 over vacancy decontrol, as you  mentioned.20 COUNCILWOMAN GALE BREWER: I21 certainly know that.22 MS. LEVINE:	And co- op and condo 23 conversions. And we need to know what you' re 24 working on, what you' re going to do, what you  can 25 do to address those issues.11 

23	hotels -- 4
And you also mentioned the  illegal COUNCILWOMAN GALE BREWER:	Which 
5 we' re working on. We' re working on it.6 MS. LEVINE:	Exactly.7 COUNCILMWOMAN GALE BREWER:	No. I8 was clear about that.9 MS. LEVINE:	And we have no 10 enforcement powers.11 COUNCILWOMAN GALE BREWER:	Yes.12 But the issue for me is where you  have,13 particularly condos and markets in a building  along 14 with rent regulated, you do have some  control.15 Because where you have the SRO' s and the rooming 16 houses and the Class B hotels, to your credit,  you 17 have a proviso that says where there' s a  certain 18 amount of other than stabilized units, there  will 19 be no hotel increase.20 MS. LEVINE:	Well, in our 21 preliminary vote we recommended zero  so.22 COUNCILWOMAN GALE BREWER: Exactly.23 But I want you to do that. I' m taking another  step 24 for other buildings.25 So the answer to your question  is,5 
2 yes, you can do that. That' s a small step but it' s3 one I would recommend for you to consider. It' s4 very much something you can do. You can' t  do 5 illegal hotels and you can' t get rid or continue  or 6 change vacancy decontrol, but the proviso you  can 7 do. It would be a really big  step.8 MS. CRUZ:	Councilwoman, how is 9 that going to assist the cause of  affordable 10 housing?	I don' t follow. I don' t follow, since 11 SRO' s are continuously being eliminated from the 12 housing stock despite the fact that they  have 13 gotten zero increases for quite a number of  years.14 How is a zero increase a  solution?15 COUNCILWOMAN GALE BREWER:	I can 16 tell you that the -- you' re talking specifically in 17 general or just --18 MS. CRUZ:	No, just I' d like to 19 focus on the SROs --20 COUNCILWOMAN GALE BREWER:	Sure.21 MS. CRUZ:	-- because it' s a22 classic example of how not compensating owners  for 23 their basic building expenses has, in  fact,24 directly, I my opinion, caused the elimination  of 25 this form of housing or slowly is causing  the 2 
2 elimination of this form of housing in New  York 3 City.4 COUNCILWOMAN GALE BREWER:	I think 5 that there are -- you' re correct that there are 6 very few stabilized residences left because let  me 7 give you an example.8 The hotels on Broadway in the  West 9 70 ' s:	The Lucerne on 79 th Street, the Hudson 10 Hotel, they all have maybe somewhere between 25  and 11 110 residents.12 Those residents, in my opinion,13 can stay there for a long time. It wouldn' t  matter 14 whether there was an increase or not. But they  are 15 still -- they are low income individuals  almost 16 exclusively. If they were to get a large  increase,17 they would have to move. At least they can stay   for 18 the duration of that building  standing.19 When they die, and unfortunately 20 they do, like the rest of us, that unit  usually 21 becomes a hotel unit. In other times, like  the 22 Dexter or other buildings like that, what you  have 23 is a situation now you have -- you' re right. I  call 24 hotel guests that I would consider illegal.  The 25 owners might consider them legal. It will  be 2 
2 decided by the courts I  assume.3 But the issue there is, I  think 4 the city needs to come in and figure out a way   to 5 help keep those units stabilized. I don' t disagree 6 with you on that. But I don' t think the answer  is 7 to increase the rents to such an extent that  those 8 individuals cannot remain in those buildings.9 I think it' s incumbent on us as 10 the City to work with those owners to get rid   of 11 the illegal hotels. But it is not -- you can' t  --12 you could drive them out with eight and  five 13 percent increases. These folks cannot afford  that.14 So we need to work as a City  to 15 increase their support for those buildings. But  I16 don' t think the answer is to give them huge  rent 17 increases. It doesn' t preserve that housing.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 Any questions?	Yes. Betty.20 ( Applause.)21 MS. ADAMS:	I thank you for your 22 testimony and also for what you' ve done to deal 23 with the problem.24 There are a couple of things,  as 25 always, that we are struggling with. And I  would 2 
 2 appreciate your insights or if there' s anything you 3 could share with us, that would be helpful as  we 4 try to come up with our final vote on  this.5 One has to do with the owners  of 6 buildings that have rent stabilized units in  them.7 We get a lot of testimony from small owners  of 8 small buildings who are having problems meeting  the 9 increases in costs that all owners are  dealing 10 with.11 Of course, the larger owners who 12 own hundreds or thousands of units have more  to 13 spread it across and can negotiate economies  of 14 scale with regard to electricity and all the  rest 15 of it.16 Many of these are what we  would 17 call the good guys in terms of the kind of housing  18	--19 COUNCILWOMAN GALE BREWER:	Many of 20 my neighbors.	I own a building.21 MS. ADAMS:	-- that they are 22 trying to provide. And they will show us  their 23 books and what their costs have been and  how 24 they' re struggling to pay.25 We' re trying -- we can' t make a19 
2 distinction between small owners and big owners.  So 3 that' s a dilemma that we have.4 ( Audience participation.)5 MS. ADAMS:	I raised the same 6 question with Vick Bott this afternoon. And he  said 7 that, you know, in his mind part of it was   that 8 people, even if they own small numbers  of 9 stabilized units, also had market rate units  and 10 that the costs could be spread that  way.11 That, as we know, is not  always 12 the case. There are some people who have only  rent 13 stabilized units. They may only have eight.  They 14 may only have sixteen. So anything that you  can 15 share with us that would help us as we  struggle 16 with that would be helpful.17 COUNCILWOMAN GALE BREWER:	Okay.18 But I mean I would go back to the question I   was 19 asked earlier, which is that where there is  a20 mixture, I would suggest perhaps a different  tier.21 If you have a building, I' m making 22 this up, that has ten units and five are market   and 23 five are not, that' s a very different situation 24 perhaps than somebody who' s got a hundred percent 25 regulated.2 
2 So I' m actually saying to the 3 Board, be a little creative.	Think outside the box 4 and see if there isn' t some way of doing  both 5 because it would take more analysis in terms  of 6 keeping track. But if we can keep track with  the 7 stabilized units, it seems to me we could  keep 8 track of where the stabilized becomes market  or 9 condo if that' s the situation.10 It is desperate out here,  folks.11 Let me tell you. It is desperate, I know   perhaps 12 for the small owners. I own a building. I  don' t13 have tenants but I own a building. Everybody in   my 14 neighborhood has tenants, two, three, four  tenants.15 You know, they' re not struggling 16 in my situation, they tell me, because they' re 17 getting high rents in Manhattan. But that' s not 18 everywhere. It' s the five boroughs.	It' s different 19 everywhere.20 But I do think -- and  my 21 residences, my neighbors tend to be owner- occupied 22 which is not a business in the same sense. So   my 23 question to -- my answer to you would be try   to 24 look at a different model than what you have  for 25 the last many years. That' s what I would suggest.2 
2 MS. ADAMS:	And if you have 3 anything you want to share with us on that,  just 4 send it over.5 COUNCILWOMAN GALE BREWER:	Thank 6 you. Thank you very much.7 MS. ADAMS:	We' d appreciate it 8 very much.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One more 10 question.11 MS. ADAMS:	The other thing --12 I' m not quite finished.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.14 MS. ADAMS:	The other thing that 15 we' ve asked, particularly Council People, because 16 you' re probably aware of the statement that our 17 Chairman issued last year and all of that. And  we 18 have been calling on Council People,  especially 19 Council People who, unlike you, have not done  as 20 much in addressing this particular problem  --21 COUNCILWOMAN GALE BREWER:	Well,22 not all of them --23 MS. ADAMS:	-- if they had 24 exercised as much as they could with respect to  the 25 oversight of departments that have  some 2 
2 responsibility for enforcing laws that lead to  the 3 conditions that people have to operate  under.4 COUNCILWOMAN GALE BREWER:	I have 5 been doing that.6 MS. ADAMS:	You have, yes.7 COUNCILWOMAN GALE BREWER:	I have.8 MS. ADAMS:	Do you have anything 9 to suggest to us as to how we could get more of   our 10 colleagues to do the same  thing?11 COUNCILWOMAN GALE BREWER:	No.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you. Go 13 ahead.14 MS. HOLDER:	I just would like 15 to thank you for showing up  this evening.	And I16 really do appreciate all the efforts.17 And I know my organization  has 18 enjoyed working with you through the years  and 19 thank you so much because you really are holding  it 20 down for all tenants throughout New York City,  not 21 just in your district.

STRINGER:	Well,14 good evening, everybody. And it' s great to be here,15 I think, again, with all of  you.16 ( Laughter.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Especially you,18 Mr. Markus.19 I' m going to submit prepared 20 testimony that goes into a lot of the  larger 21 questions. I do want to just make a couple   of 22 comments for your consideration.23 In May of 2008 the IBO has  now 24 projected a loss of 59 , 000 jobs in this City. New 25 Yorkers are taking home an average of less than  one 2 
 2 percent more than they did last year at this  time.3 For those of you who follow this sort of thing,   the 4 cost of food is rising  rapidly.5 Fifty- five percent more New 6 Yorkers are having difficulty affording food  this 7 year compared to last year. And thanks, in part,  to 8 your efforts, the City lost 5 , 088 rent stabilized  9 units in 2007 bringing the total loss since 1994 to 10	173 , 354 units.11 So I come here today to ask  you,12 when this is going to end?	We' re slowly --13 ( Audience participation.)14 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:	We' re 15 slowly becoming a city for very, very  wealthy 16 people with enclaves for very, very poor people  and 17 nothing in between.18 And unfortunately despite the 19 City' s best efforts to construct 165 , 000 affordable 20 housing units on one hand, we' re losing 173 or 21 we' ve lost 173 , 000 units. On the other hand this is 22 absurd. This is absurd.23 ( Applause.)24 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:	And I25 understand that you have to make decisions based  on 11 
2 oil, based on expenses, and yes, you  should 3 calculate that in. Obviously, you know, rent is  a4 -- owning a building is a for- profit making 5 venture. And I certainly respect that. I think  that 6 we should give relief when needed to  small 7 landlords.	That' s important as well.8 But it is absolutely outrageous  to 9 institute the final proposal I' ve heard, which is 10 the so- called poor tax on the people who are  the 11 poorest, most elderly people in the city. And I   ask 12 for a commitment tonight not to go there  because 13 you are single- handedly causing even more hardship 14 and more evictions.15 I wish this process were 16 different. I wish all of you had a better   mechanism 17 for dealing with these issues. Obviously  the 18 tenants, this has been stacked against them  for 19 quite some time.	But I do want to recommend  to 20 you, as Council Member Brewer alluded, you have  an 21 opportunity, whatever you do, to make a  great 22 statement, to talk about the struggles in the  City,23 to talk about, as Gale says, thinking out of  the 24 box, to try to make a difference for this   City 25 instead of blindly going along with what may  look 2 
2 good on paper, but in reality is causing  a3 disparity in the City that if we' re not careful,4 we' re not going to recover from.5 I ask you to consider giving  the 6 benefit of the doubt to the poorest people in  the 7 City, the people who are struggling the most  and 8 they' re called tenants.9 Thank you very much.10 ( Audience participation.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any questions?12 Go ahead.13 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you, Borough 14 President Stringer.15 You have always been a  champion 16 for all New Yorkers.	I especially appreciate how 17 you' ve always been outspoken and you have sometimes 18 taken the unpopular stance when you were in  the 19 State Legislature.	And I really do appreciate  your 20 leadership here in the City, as our  Borough 21 President, for looking at issues that actually  --22 ( Applause.)23 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:	Thank 24 you.25 MS. HOLDER:	-- make it hopeful 2 
2 for the entire City.3 When you talk about thinking 4 outside of the box, because I know, I sat on   the 5 panel and you talked about thinking outside of  the 6 box with zoning, you had a lot of great ideas   and 7 things that really have provoked thought from  me.8 What would you suggest this  Board 9 look at besides, or in addition to  keeping 10 increases low, what other things do you think  this 11 Board should look at or do in order to  assist 12 tenants during this whole period as we go  through 13 this every year?14 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:	I15 mean, you know, one of the great things about  this 16 Board is that you' re the Rent Guidelines Board. So 17 you' re supposed to give us some guidance. And 18 you' re privy to the statistics that I' m not privy 19 to and not everybody in the city gets to  analyze 20 them the way you do and your staff support  does.21 So why don' t you, this year, say 22 it like it is. Talk about the housing crisis.  Talk 23 about what is on paper is not necessarily  what 24 you' re hearing out in the streets. Talk about the 25 fact that if you give a poor tax of $ 60 to  somebody 2 
 2 who' s paying rent of $ 500 , it' s not just well,3 that' s such a low rent, that is for people who  have 4 disabilities, who can' t function, who can' t go out 5 in the street and get food, they' re living 6 day- to- day.7 I' ve delivered food to people who 8 are making or paying $ 500 a month in rent and  you 9 walk into their little small, tiny  apartment.10 There' s not enough to eat. They' re existing despite 11 the good efforts of City Meals on Wheels in  the 12 City of new York. They are  existing.13 If you hit them with another $ 60 ,14 they cease to exist. They leave their  apartment.15 They become part of our homeless population.  We 16 need guidance from you. We need guidance from  you 17 to make sure that that' s not going to happen in 18	2008 .19 Now, all of you know this  economy 20 is changing and we have to start recognizing  that 21 the people who are barely making it are now  the 22 ones who are going to be victimized by serious  City 23 and State cutbacks.24 So what I' m saying to you today, I25 would argue for a zero  increase.19 
2 I' ve submitted --3 ( Applause.)4 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER: I' ve 5 submitted testimony where you could sort of look  at 6 it from a statistical point  of view.	But I really 7 want you, in addition to whatever you' ve decided,8 to really give us a little more guidance, put   a9 little more into this, put a little  understanding 10 about our policy.	And yes, part of it is land  use 11 and zoning. But also this is part of our  rent 12 stabilization laws.13 Could you imagine, we' ve lost 14 175 , 000 units. That, in some way, has to do with 15 the fact that we did not have guidance from  you,16 that we had a lot of increases but no   roadmap.17 A lot of you I know and  respect 18 greatly. Give us some guidance this year and  maybe 19 give the tenants a break, the people who can' t  eat,20 the people who are barely making it in the  City.21 Because they' re the people who work in home care.22 They' re educating our children. They' re the people 23 in the front lines in this City. They need  relief 24 and they need it now.25 MS. ADAMS:	I have one question.2

ADAMS:	The statement that 10 went beyond what we' re asked to do and talked  about 11 the affordability crisis in the City, are  you 12 telling us that that has no meaning at  all?13 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:	I --14 the statement that you released last  year?15 MS. ADAMS:	Yes.16 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:	No. It 17 had no meaning.

MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:	Thank MR. SCHLEIDER:	For the past five 
6 or six years or so I' ve called -- I' ve called upon 7 the City Council, your office, the Mayor' s Office 8 and such, to expand SCRIE, to expand DRIE,  lately 9 to question City Council Members about the lack  of 10 a renter' s credit, or even the ability for renters 11 to deduct rent payments or part of their  rental 12 burden from income taxes.13 We see it here as an  income 14 problem rather than affordability. If the  tenants 15 had income or income support, rent burdens,  food 16 burdens would be easier.17 You' ve proven to be a very 18 creative and resourceful public servant.19 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:	Thank 20 you.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	What can you come 22 up with to allow government to take on this  burden 23 rather than putting it on the shoulders  of 24 landlords?25 ( Audience participation.)6 
2 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:	Hold 3 on. No, no, listen, let me -- no, no. Hold   it,4 folks.	Hold it.5 ( Audience participation.)6 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:	Folks,7 he' s asking real questions and let' s listen.8 First of all, I' m glad you' re 9 talking about the Vacant Building report because  if 10 we could do a Citywide vacant building count and  if 11 we could change the tax rate for some of  that 12 vacant property above 110 th Street, it could spur 13 the creation of much needed affordable  housing.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Or how about 15 even a fund to offset tenant rent  burdens.16 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:17 Absolutely.18 What I would urge you to do is  to 19 work with us.	See, in some respects government 20 comes to you and we say don' t raise the rents.  You 21 have questions for government and the City  Council,22 for all of us. It' s up to you in a way, I   think,23 respectfully, to take a stand here and maybe  play 24 on everybody' s housing.25 Maybe if you said we can' t2 
2 continue on this way given what we' re dealing with 3 and maybe some larger statement that is a  little 4 more radical that maybe offends both owners  and 5 tenants to say that we have to change the  system.6 Because through the years we never deal with  the 7 vacancies, we never deal with the tax  structures,8 as you say.9 And you' re right, if we could --10 you know, as somebody who was the author of  DRIE,11 it is woefully underfunded and the same people  who 12 are living in those apartments paying $ 500 a  month 13 are the very same people who now scramble to get   on 14 DRIE.	And it' s such a low income that hardly 15 anybody qualifies.16 Maybe the thing to do is to  simply 17 not impose a $ 60 increase on the most  vulnerable 18 because you now know what I know is they can' t  make 19 it with that increase.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I appreciate what 21 you' re saying except for the past five years I' ve 22 been calling upon the tenants to petition the  City 23 Council Members, to petition the legislators  to 24 increase it.	And the only way we can really make  a25 statement here is by putting forth those types  of 2 
2 increases so that the pressure is now put  upon 3 government to change this policy.4 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:	But 5 this is where you play a role where the  tenants 6 don' t have a voice.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Unfortunately if 8 we don' t -- I' m sorry.9 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:	No,10 I' ll tell you. I served thirteen years in the 11 Assembly, thirteen years on the Housing  Committee.12 I must have introduced fifty bills that would  have 13 dealt with a lot of  these issues.	I did not get 14 one passed even by accident by the Senate,  right?15 Not even a discussion because there is  no 16 discussion.17 A VOICE:	So you failed.18 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:19 Probably.	No, that is fair blame.	And I' m not --20 I' m not here simply to say it' s all on you. It' s21 all on everybody.22 The issue for us now is in  order 23 to make the statement, we are now at the   tipping 24 point so if we do an increase and we have   more 25 evictions, these same tenants are going to be  in 2 
2 such a vulnerable position we are not going to   be 3 able to get this back. And what I' m suggesting  to 4 you tonight is if you were to say no increase,   and 5 you would outline why, you would play a major  role 6 in shaping this debate, I  think.7 ( Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Risa.9 MS. LEVINE:	I hate doing this.10 I don' t think there' s a person on 11 this Board sitting here who doesn' t think the 12 system is broken. And we sit here and we have   a13 couple of public hearings and a couple of  public 14 meetings. And we' re not full- time people. We all 15 have full- time day jobs. We do this for a  nominal 16 amount of money, as you well  know.17 We can make all the 18 recommendations in the world. But we all do  agree 19 that at the end of the day it needs to be an   effort 20 between the tenants and the landlords and  the 21 government.	Because we don' t have legislative or 22 enforcement abilities to make some of the  changes.23 You talked about the loss 24 affordable housing. I' ve asked some of the Council 25 people if they' ve done a study as to what  caused 2 
2 the loss of affordable housing. We' ve heard about 3 vacancy decontrol and loss to co- ops and condos.4 We have no ability to change  the 5 AG' s review of plans to include impact on 6 affordable housing as part of the elements  that 7 they look at.8 We have no ability to  change 9 vacancy decontrol and we also can' t address the 10 union contracts that don' t allow City workers to 11 pay for housing in New York City, which  is 12 deplorable and offensive as a resident of the  City.13 And we' re looking for guidance.14 You' re looking for guidance from us. We' re looking 15 for the opportunity for you to sit on your  task 16 force to be asked. You know, we will come  and 17 testify now in front of your meetings to tell  you 18 what we' ve heard that we have no power to  change 19 so.20 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:	I21 would invite you to serve on the various  task 22 forces that we have in my office working on this.   I23 would invite you to work with many of us on   this 24 whole issue of cataloguing vacant property  in 25 abandoned buildings.2 
2 You know, we do a homeless  count 3 every December to figure out the  homeless 4 population in the City.	Yet we never do a  private 5 vacant lot and building count with the idea of  some 6 day moving people from homelessness into  housing.7 And I would certainly work with you on that,  Ms.8 Levine. I think that makes a lot of  sense.9 And I have to tell you that it  is 10 a little refreshing to come to this meeting  and 11 actually have this dialogue, which has alluded  me 12 over the last few years. So I know you are   feeling 13 it and I know you are seeing it on the   streets.14 The question is, as the  Senate 15 changes in November, so will a legislative  agenda.16 I don' t want to see --17 ( Audience participation.)18 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:	Our 19 immediate concern today is to do the limited  amount 20 of damage to the people who are struggling in   this 21 City before there' s a Senate change. Once there' s22 Senate change, then we' re going to be able to  have 23 the conversation that Steve and you are  talking 24 about because suddenly there' s going to be a25 different political dynamic.2 
2 I' m here tonight to tell you just 3 to hold the line a little bit longer until we   can 4 get that change and that is coming. And it' s  coming 5 in November.6 ( Audience participation.)7 MS. LEVINE:	And do you really 8 think that if we grant a zero increase to   the 9 tenants of this City, that the good landlords  who 10 are here testifying and taking the time, are  going 11 to be incentivized not to sell their buildings  that 12 are showing losses?13 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER: I14 couldn' t hear you.15 MS. LEVINE:	We' ve heard a lot 16 of testimony from small property owners  in 17 particular who are badly hit by the City  Council,18 regulations with regard to led paint and  sidewalk 19 violation laws, who are hit by fuel costs and  water 20 increases.21 And they' re telling us that they 22 can' t afford to run their properties but they want 23 to keep them rather than sell them to  the 24 speculators.25 Will a zero increase address  those 2 

2	problems?34
( Audience participation.) MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:	I
5 started out -- I started out today making  a6 distinction for the small, struggling landlord  to 7 help them open their books.	And I said --8 ( Audience participation.)9 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:	I said 10 that being a landlord is not a charity. It' s  a11 for- profit making situation and you should be able 12 to make a profit.13 I want to help those  small 14 landlords where they are not making it. That' s not 15 good for the City. It' s not good for the  economy.16 It' s not good for tenants.	But because we have a17 percentage of small landlords who are  struggling 18 does not mean we put in jeopardy the entire  tenant 19 people in this City.20 And we do feel for the  small 21 tenant but why can' t we isolate their issues and 22 their concerns?	Why do we have to suddenly  give 23 huge rent increases to struggling people and  think 24 that we' ve created some balance. I don' t think it' s25 balanced.5 
2 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Stringer, I don' t3 think this Board has enacted large rent  increases 4 for a very, very long time, certainly  not 5 commensurate with cost.	And I want to just  --6 ( Audience participation.)7 MS. CRUZ:	-- pick up on what  you 8 just said how we should not be making  guideline 9 decisions on the basis of discrete groups of  people 10 that have come to speak to  us.11 In fact, why do you use  the 12 terminology poor tax when the people that have  come 13 to testify before this Board that have told us  that 14 there the ones that need the across- the- board $ 60 15 to $ 100 rent increase for the lowest rent paying 16 apartments, those are the struggling small  owners,17 why are they saying that, Mr. Stringer,  because 18 they cannot meet their expenses.19 ( Audience participation.)20 MS. CRUZ:	And one more point, Mr.21 Stringer.22 Why do you believe that those  are 23 the tenants, those are the tenants that  cannot 24 afford a $ 60 a month rent increase?	How do you 25 know?	How do we know that these aren' t individuals 2 
2 that can well afford that kind of an increase  and 3 above?	We don' t. You are assuming that the lowest 4 rent apartments across the City of New York  are 5 populated by the poorest New Yorkers. That is  not 6 accurate.7 ( Audience participation.)8 MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:	I will 9 tell you, I will tell you, based on many years   of 10 experience both as a local legislator and  now 11 someone who represents an entire borough, that  yes,12 the people who come to me for emergency  rent 13 payments, who need help fighting landlord  eviction,14 are the poorest people in the City paying $ 500  a15 month or less in rent, whether they' re ninety years 16 old, eighty years old. They also happen to be  the 17 oldest.18 Do I have data except what  my 19 staff says or what every legislative office  will 20 come here and tell you?	What Adriene Holder sees 21 every single day?	Of course, these are the  poorest 22 people in the City. They are.

( Audience participation.) MAN. BORO. PRES. STRINGER:	I

2	me now? Hello?345
MR. LANGUEDOC:	A little louder. MR. CURTIS HARGER:		Okay.Members of the Rent Guidelines 
6 Board, thank you for the opportunity to offer  my 7 statement.8 The front page of The Daily  News 9 on Friday the 13 th read: It' s Here and it will get 10 worse. Next to the warning was a picture of a   gas 11 station priced at $ 5 . 09 per gallon.12 Yes, we are, in fact, facing  tough 13 economic times in the housing market where  the 14 current crisis is due, in no small part, to  the 15 rising price of everything from gas to  groceries.16 At no time in our recent past have both owners   and 17 tenants faced such hard economic times.18 In 1970 the average price --  the 19 average tenant household paid twenty percent of  its 20 income for rent.21 In 2005 it rose to 36 . 7 .22 Today we have one- third of our 23 tenants dedicating half their rent to income  or 24 half of their income just to pay their  rent.25 Meanwhile the cost of living keeps 6 
2 going up and wages do not keep pace.  Compounding 3 the housing crisis, defaults on home mortgage  loans 4 in New York City are also at an all- time  high.5 As for owners of rental 6 properties, substantial rises in operating  costs,7 for example, skyrocketing increase of expenses  for 8 water, recently increased by the New York  City 9 Water Board by 15 . 5 percent, a hundred percent 10 increase in fuel cost. All of this has taken  place 11 with only small increases of rental incomes  which 12 have pushed many owners to the brink of  losing 13 their properties.14 This out- of- balance relationship 15 between income and expenses prevents an owner  from 16 being able to finance needed improvements  and 17 repairs to their properties. Consequently, our 18 housing stock will suffer and tenants will  suffer.19 It' s a difficult assignment of 20 this Board to approve a renewal rate increase  for 21 one and two- year lease renewals of rent stabilized 22 apartments that will promote the health of  our 23 housing stock for the benefit of both owners  and 24 tenants.25 One of the tools used by the  board 2 
 2 to determine what is an appropriate  renewal 3 increase is the 2008 Income and Expense Study.  The 4 Income and Expense Study indicated that  the 5 Citywide net operating income in rent  stabilized 6 buildings increased from 8 . 8 in the year 2006 .7 However, the dramatic increase in 8 fuel costs, over a hundred percent, and this is  in 9 light of the fact that we are now overdue for   a10 cold winter season since we' ve had three mild 11 seasons in a row.12 The water and sewer costs 13 increased by over 14 . 5 nullifies the usefulness of 14 the I & E Study as a predictor for the NOI for  15	2008 / 2009 .16 Clearly, any realistic prediction 17 of achieving a positive NOI must include at least  a18 double- digit percentage increase for a one or 19 two- year lease, but we know that the cost to  owners 20 will be dramatically increased beyond the  costs 21 increase for recent years.22 This Board must do its part  to 23 maintain the health of our housing stock  by 24 providing a rate increase that will keep  owners 25 from experiencing losses.16 
2 At the same time the City of  New 3 York must do more with our tax dollars to   provide 4 great financial assistance to a greater number  of 5 tenants.6 Specifically, the City must lower 7 the income restrictions on existing financial  aid 8 programs for affordable housing such as Section  89 and assistance provided by agencies such as  Health 10 and Human Resources, as well as to create  new 11 programs specifically devised to help persons  whose 12 income is insufficient to maintain  affordable 13 housing.14 By the City doing its part to  keep 15 housing affordable, this Board can provide a  rate 16 increase for renewal leases that is not  an 17 artificially suppressed way to create a  pseudo 18 affordable housing program on the financial  backs 19 of owners who already have contributed to the  City 20 by funding affordable housing programs  through 21 payment of rent.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 23 wrap, sir.24 MR. CURTIS HARGER:	Let me just 25 conclude that by driving around New York City  there 2 
2 are already many empty and  abandoned buildings.	We 3 don' t want more of this and reducing the available 4 housing stock as well as the New York City  tax 5 base.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 MR. CURTIS HARGER:	We cannot 8 afford to allow this to  happen.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 Any questions?11 ( No response.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 ( Applause.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Helena Wong.15 MS. HELENA WONG:	Hi.16 So my name is Helena Wong. And  I17 work with the Chinatown Tenants  Union.18 We' ve been here for about six 19 hours. And because of some  miscommunication,20 actually a couple of our folks aren' t able to 21 testify because they have to leave soon which  is 22 really unfortunate.	But it is what it  is.23 Okay.24 First, I' d like to point out that 25 a lot of the language used by landlords here  today 2 
2 is a little bit disturbing to me. You know,  people 3 getting a free ride, handouts, people lying  about 4 their income, drugs, drug use, loudness,  partying.5 I hope that these depictions don' t6 criminalize people who rent. Right? People who  make 7 up the labor force, people who raise  their 8 families, people who in the community that I  work 9 with actually do more to maintain their  buildings 10 than their landlords do.11 ( Applause.)12 MS. HELENA WONG:	In Chinatown our 13 buildings are being purchased more and more  by 14 large developers whose sole purpose is to empty  out 15 the buildings. In the past they' ve deregulating as 16 many units as they can so they can charge  market 17 rate rents while cutting services and  evicting 18 long- time tenants.19 For example, Ms. Tang, who  was 20 going to testify, she testified last year about  her 21 landlord cutting off heat and hot water during  the 22 winter. She' s in a rent stabilized building. This 23 year the landlord sold the building to an  even 24 bigger landlord.	The new landlord isn' t making 25 repairs without asking for keys from  current 2 

2	tenants.3
The tenants gave the keys to  the 
4 landlord and then without permission, the  super 5 went into people' s apartments, starting taking 6 pictures, and when they asked for repairs, does  not 7 make any repairs. And at the same time is  not 8 collecting rent from a lot of the long- time 9 tenants.10 So this is the kind of  stuff 11 that' s happening a lot in the community.	And I12 know that a lot of the buildings in Chinatown  are 13 still owned by smalltime landlords who only own  one 14 or two buildings. And it' s true that they' re 15 probably struggling. But it' s also true that larger 16 landlords have more capital and they' re buying up 17 the buildings in the community.18 And what we' re seeing is that 19 they' re investing in the -- they' re not investing 20 in tenants and people who live in the  community.21 They' re investing in the building of the land and 22 the property. And so there' s a real serious  issue 23 around who is -- who are profits being made  for?24 It' s not being -- it' s -- wait. It' s definitely --25 the profits that are being made by landlords  are 4 
2 definitely not for the people. It' s not to maintain 3 community and culture.4 And so, you know, I' ve been 5 bringing Chinatown tenants to these hearings  every 6 year for the past few years.	Each time before we 7 come, I spend a lot of time educating them   about 8 the process and encouraging people  to testify.	But 9 more and more I' m disillusioned knowing that as the 10 rents are going up, tenant protections are  going 11 down and a lot of people have talked about  this.12 So I believe that we' re playing a13 game that tenants can never win because it  seems 14 that we' re rewarding landlords' bad behavior every 15 time we increase rents for  tenants.16 And so the only thing that I  would 17 agree with the landlord side and everybody here  on 18 the panel today is that the process if flawed  and 19 the system is flawed.20 And so that' s why I think that 21 because it doesn' t serve the needs of the majority 22 of renters in the City, I' m asking that this  Board 23 vote on a moratorium on any rent  increases.24 Thank you.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2

 8 There he is.	Great.9 Followed by Claire Dockery, which 10 should get us done by about 6 : 05 and we' ll be back 11	at 6 : 30 .12 Go ahead, Mr. Sobhraj.13 MR. JAY SOBHRAJ:	Good afternoon,14 members of the Board.	Thanks for listening to me.15 Since 9 / 11 the rents have gone up 16 by over twenty percent cumulatively,  while 17 insurance has gone up by a hundred  percent.18 Last Friday, as my predecessor 19 said, the price of gas, if you saw the  newspaper,20 will be exceeding $ 5 a gallon.21 Mayor Bloomberg said water and 22 sewer taxes will go up by fourteen percent,  not 23 forgetting repair and maintenance costs and  legal 24 costs going up drastically.25 The city, State and Federal 12 
2 Government should step in and give the  tenants 3 subsidies. Not the landlords should do  that.4 Everybody wants to know why do  the 5 landlords need the increases? I will tell you  why.6 To cover inflation, cover utilities, insurance  and 7 taxes.	But most of all, what we' re getting 8 increases for is to protect the housing stock  for 9 all of us. Not for me, not for you, but for   our 10 children and grandchildren.11 A typical example is, these 12 buildings were built thirty, forty, years  ago.13 They' re considered new buildings, some of the ones 14 we manage in the Queens area, as much as   ninety 15 years old.16 A typical building like that  would 17 have electric service of fifteen and twenty in  an 18 apartment, a one- bedroom and a two- bedroom. Today' s19 demand for electricity in an apartment, people  have 20 air conditioners, Internet service, five  TVs,21 microwave.	These need to be upgraded.22 An average apartment to be 23 upgraded would cost you $ 2000 for a unit. So  if 24 you' re speaking a forty- unit building, it' s in 25 excess of $ 80 , 000 . This is to preserve the stock 2 
2 and to make life comfortable for our tenants,  our 3 children, and grandchildren.4 We all speak about drug 5 activities. Sure we have it in the City. We   are 6 living in New York. Some of the things we are   doing 7 is providing security cameras and  surveillance 8 cameras twenty- four hours to give the tenants a9 feeling of safety.10 If you have a building and  the 11 complex is say a 45 - unit building, you easily need 12 a minimum of thirteen cameras. You' re speaking 13 about a $ 50 , 000 investment. Who' s it for? It' s for 14 the tenants' safety.15 What I' m asking you today is what 16 we can do with increase.	It' s not to fill the 17 landlord pocket but it' s to protect our property 18 and not to have more and more properties  going 19 abandoned.	As the last Borough President said,  he 20 lost count. He doesn' t want to count it. He  just 21 pretending he doesn' t know. The City has to step  up 22 to the plate and start to subsidize some of  these 23 programs.24 Thank you very much.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2

2 MR. ROMEO YMALAY:	Good morning.3 I mean good evening.4 My name' s Romeo Ymalay, a5 legislative Aid for Senator Duane. And I' m reading 6 excerpts from his testimony for the  record.7 My name is Thomas K. Duane and  I8 represent New York State' s 29 th Senatorial 9 District, a mixed income district composed  largely 10 of tenants, thousands of them rent stabilized,  many 11 of whom already allocated too high a percentage  of 12 their income to pay their rent.13 Thank you for this opportunity to 14 present testimony before the New York City  Rent 15 Guidelines Board.16 As you know, last month  I17 testified before the RGB regarding the Rent  Board 18 Reform Bill that New York State Assembly  Member 19 George Latimer and I have introduced in the  State 20 legislature.21 The need for that legislation' s22 common sense reforms, which would make the  system 23 much more evenhanded and ensure that  its 24 determinations are based upon more accurate  and 25 relevant information, is painfully apparent in  the 2 
2 thoroughly predictable, dysfunctional process in 3 which we are presently engaged.4 Let' s be honest.	We know that 5 when the final vote is taken on June 19 th, the  RGB 6 will approve rent increases for one and two- year 7 leases that will further squeeze tenants  despite 8 the RBG' s own 2008 Income and Expense Study that 9 shows that landlords' median rental income  has 10 increased more than the median operating  costs.11 Meanwhile the 2005 New York  City 12 Housing and Vacancy Survey found that the  median 13 income for rent stabilized households in New  York 14 City has fallen 5 . 6 percent in real dollars since 15 the last survey, and 43 percent of renters  Citywide 16 paid fifty percent or more of their income  for 17 rent.18 Clearly, the system is broken.19 The RGB justified this year' s20 proposed rent increase by citing its 2008  Price 21 Index of Operating Costs, a one side,  deceptive 22 report.23 The RGB' s annual Income and 24 Expense Study is a more meaningful report  because 25 it shows that landlords' net operating  income,2 
2 according to the RGB' s 2008 Income and Expense 3 Study, which is based on 2006 data,  landlords'4 operating costs increased by 4 . 1 percent over the 5 prior year. However, their rental income  increased 6 by 5 . 6 percent and net operating income increased 7 8 . 8 percent.8 As the report itself stated,9 because operating costs grew less than the  increase 10 in income, net operating income increased.11 Let us recall that the  RGB 12 approved rent increases in 2006 , the same year in 13 which data -- the data showed landlords'  net 14 operating profits increased 8 . 8 percent.15 This exposes the degree to  which 16 the system is skewed against the  tenants.17 I implore the RGB not to make  the 18 same mistake. The urgent need for a fair  and 19 balance Rent Board is underscored by the  rapidly 20 dwindling affordable housing stock in our  city.21 It is absurd that the RGB is  even 22 considering passing additional financial burdens 23 onto tenants this year. The vote is meant  to 24 determine rent adjustments based on the  relative 25 cost of maintaining and financing buildings  of 2 
2 available housing supply as defined by the  vacancy 3 right and the cost of  living.4 If the Board bases its decision  on 5 these standards - and I strongly, though  futilely,6 urge it to do so - it would impose a freeze   on 7 rents for all rent regulated apartments as well  as 8 for lofts, hotels, rooming houses, single  room 9 occupancy buildings and lodging houses.10 While I appreciate the public 11 service that you the Board Members perform,  there 12 is no question in my mind that the current  system 13 is not designed to uphold these  standards.14 That is why I joined  Assembly 15 Member Latimer in introducing the sweeping,  but 16 common sense, Rent Board Reform Bill. I count  on 17 having greater success in swaying my colleagues  to 18 pass this desperately needed legislation than I  and 19 other tenant advocates have historically had  in 20 influencing the RGB.21 ( Applause.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 Any questions?24 MR.
