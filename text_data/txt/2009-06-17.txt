2	P	R O	C	E	E	D	I N	G	S 34 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Good	morning .5 My name	is	Marvin	Markus .	I ' d	like 6 to	welcome	everybody	to	this	meeting	which	is	a7 public	hearing , one	of	a	series	of	public 8 meetings	and	public	hearings	held	annually	by 9 the	Rent	Guidelines	Board	in order	to	discharge 10 our	statutory	mandate	of	promulgating	an annual 11 lease	renewal	guideline	for	rent	stabilized ,12 hotel	stabilized	and	loft	stabilized 13 apartments .14 Before	we	get	started ,	a	couple	of 15 announcements .16 The	final	vote	on	adjustments	is 17 scheduled	to	be right	here	at Cooper	Union ,	718 East	7 th	Street , on	Tuesday , June	23 rd ,19 starting	at	5 : 30 p . m .20 One	of	the	follow - ups	from	our 21 meeting	of	several	weeks	ago	was	a	request	to 22 the	staff	for	tax	arrears	data	for	the	Class	223 properties .24 You	have	in	your	file ,	in	your 25 folder ,	a	- -	what	I ' ll	characterize	as	a very 4 
2 important	and	interesting	memo	which	indicates ,3 just	so	I	can	read	from	it , that	in	fiscal	2009 4 11 , 000	more	than	last	year , which	was	about 5 14 , 000	apartments ,	Class	2	parcels ,	are	in 6 arrears .7 The	total	owed	in	taxes	in fiscal 8 ' 09 is	$ 150	million	in	comparison	to	$ 85 9 million	in	fiscal	' 08 .	So	you	can	see	a10 significant	increase	in	tax	arrears .11 If it ' s	possible ,	if	we	can	get	this 12 somehow ,	staff , disaggregated	to	neighborhoods 13 or	some	sort	of feel	for	whether	or	not	we	can 14 or	not ,	it	would	be	great .15 All	right .	Okay .	We ' ll	ask	Finance 16 for	community	planning	boards	or	whathaveyou .17 But	disaggregated	data	I	think	would	be more 18 interesting .	I	would	doubt	that	zip	code	10021 19 has	very	many	of these	delinquencies .20 Why	don ' t	we	get	started .21 The	first	speaker	- -22 MR . LANGUEDOC :	What	is	a	Class	223 property ?24 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	What	we regulate .25 MS . LEVINE :	What	did	you	ask	him ?2 

23	property .4
MR . LANGUEDOC :	What	is	a	Class	2CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	As	it	says	in	the 
5 memo ,	it ' s	not	necessarily	rent	stabilized ,	but 6 it ' s apartment	houses .7 Anita	Romm	is	first .8 Would	you	like	some	musical 9 accompaniment	today ?10 ( Laughter . )11 MS . ANITA	ROMM :	If	I	have	some 12 time .13 Good	morning .14 My name	is	Anita	Romm .	I ' m the 15 songwriter	for	Metropolitan	Council	on	Housing 16 and	I ' m	speaking	on	behalf	of an	endangered 17 species	-	rent	stabilized	tenants .18 For	as	long	as I	can	remember ,	you 19 have	enacted	humongous	and	largely 20 unjustifiable	rent	increases	which	eventually 21 had	the	effect	of removing	many	apartments	from 22 rent	regulation , endangering	the	stability	of 23 families	of	our	fair	city .24 People	who	have	to	pay	an	outrageous 25 percentage	of	their	income	for	rent	have	less 5 
2 money	to	spend	on goods	and	services	which 3 leads	to	the	loss	of	jobs	and	to	business 4 failures .5 I	have	gone	to all	of	your	meetings 6 at	22 Reade	Street	and	have	read	the	reports .	I7 conclude	that	expenses	have	not	been	going	up 8 as	much	as	incomes	of	landlords	and	that	last 9 year ' s	8 . 5	percent	increase	turned	out	to be 10 unjustified	due	to	the	later	reduction	in fuel 11 costs .12 You	can	do	your	part	to	get	us	out 13 of	the	Great	Depression	by	voting	a	stimulus 14 package	in	the	form	of	a	rent	freeze .15 Yes ,	you	can .16 Laissez	faire , mon	derriere .17 ( Singing )	Rent	Guidelines	Board ,	you 18 strike	a	dissonant	chord ,19 Because	you	always	raise	rents ,	it 20 doesn ' t	make	sense .21 ( Unintelligible )	ahead	of	their 22 expenses .23 Rent	Guidelines	Board ,	you	strike	a24 dissonant	chord ,25 You	always	pay	the	landlords .2 
2 And	so	we ' re	asking	you ,	please ,	we 3 really	need	a	rent	freeze .4 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .5 I	must	tell	you	- -	Anita ,	you ' re 6 almost	up	to	a	full	album	now .7 ( Laughter . )8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	know ,	I	mean 9 we	are	going	to definitely	tape	all	of	them	and 10 put	out	a	greatest	hits	of	the	Rent	Guidelines 11 Board .12 ( Laughter . )13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Robert	Rosenberg .14 You	ready	Mr .	Rosenberg ?15 MR . ROBERT	ROSENBERG :	Yes .16 Thank	you .17 Okay .	Good	morning ,	Honorable 18 Members	of	the	Rent	Guidelines	Board .19 Affordable	housing	has	been	my 20 life ' s	work .21 Since	the	' 60 s to	the	present ,	I22 have	seen	the	worst	of	times	and	I ' ve	seen	the 23 best	of	times ,	from	abandoned	burned - out 24 buildings	to	renovated	buildings	that	I see 25 today .2 
 2 My company	has	renovated	every 3 single	property	in	my	portfolio ,	and	many 4 others	joined	me in	this	challenge	and	we take 5 credit	for	the	renaissance	that ' s	happened	in 6 the	Bronx .7 We are	New	York	City ' s	housing	of 8 last	resort .	We are	not	affordable	housing .	My 9 company	is	real	affordable	housing .10 I	have	not	one	rent	anywhere	near 11	$ 2000 .12 I	recently	reviewed	a	survey	of	351 13 of	my way - below	market	rentals .14 Fifteen	apartments	were	below	$ 200 .15 Fifty	were	below	$ 500 .16 And	three	hundred	below	$ 600 .17 A	minimum	basic	cost	is	$ 600	without 18 mortgage ,	without	basics ,	capital	expenses ,	so 19 way	under	what	it comes	to , a	cost	for	just 20 basics ,	basic	expenses .	So	they	are	woefully 21 below	market	rent .22 And	my	tenants	want	quality 23 apartments	at	an affordable	rate	and	I	want	to 24 provide	that .	That ' s	what	I do .25 But	New	York	City	taxes ,	and	water ,12 
 2 the	high	cost	of fuel	is	skyrocketing	when	my 3 rents	are	severely	low	to	cover	the	basic 4 expenses .	And	that ' s	where	owners	have	to cut 5 back	on	the	maintenance	or	not	pay	the	taxes ,6 like	the	quote	you	just	stated .	There	are	a	lot 7 of	taxes	for	that	reason .8 I	often	hear	an outcry	actually	from 9 my	tenants .	And	they	are	very	angry	because 10 they	might	pay	$ 200	or	$ 300	less	than	their 11 neighbor	with	the	same	size	apartment	simply 12 because	of	the	antiquated	rent	laws ,	or the 13 rents	have	nothing	to	do	with	the	tenant ' s14 ability	to	pay .15 So I	think	every	tenant	must	pay	a16 fair	share .	So	I ' m	suggesting	supplements .	I ' m17 only	here	to	talk	about	the	supplement .18 And	if	your	rent	is	from	$ 100	to 19 $ 500 ,	I	believe	you	should	get	a	$ 100 20 supplement .21 If your	rent	is from	$ 500	to	$ 700 , 22	$ 85 .23 Because	a	2	percent	increase	to	a	724 percent	increase	on	a	$ 300	rent	really	is not 25 going	to	do	it . It	doesn ' t	really	- -	it ' s	not 23 
2 adequate	when	their	percentages	are	calculated 3 on	such	a	low	rent .	I ' m	sure	if	your	rents	are 4 higher ,	I	can	understand	that .5 So we	need	to	maintain	our 6 properties ,	provide	good	maintenance ,	pay	our 7 bills .	But	it ' s impossible	with	the	low	rents .8 So I ' d	like	not	to	turn	the	hands 9 back	to	the	time	of	abandonment	and	continue 10 the	wave	of	prosperity	with	the	properties	how 11 they	look	through	billions	of dollars	that	were 12 invested	by	the	City	and	by property	owners 13 over	the	last	three	decades .14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	need	to	wrap 15 up , Mr .	Rosenberg .16 MR . ROBERT	ROSENBERG :	So let ' s17 pledge	to	be	fair	to	both	owners	and	tenants 18 starting	now .19 Thank	you	very	much .20 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .21 Any	questions ?22 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Yes .23 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Yes .	Mr .24 Schleider .25 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr .	Rosenberg ,2 
2 thank	you	for	your	testimony .3 Maybe	I	missed	this	in	the 4 beginning .	But	how	many	buildings	did	you	say 5 that	you	own	in the	Bronx ?6 MR . ROBERT	ROSENBERG :	I	didn ' t7 say .8 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Okay .9 MR . ROBERT	ROSENBERG :	But	it ' s10 probably	over	forty	properties .11 MR . SCHLEIDER :	And	the	number	of 12 units	within	those	forty	- -13 MR . ROBERT	ROSENBERG :	I	would	say 14 about	2500 .15 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right .16 And	you ' ve	been	doing	this	for	quite 17 some	time	now .	I believe	you	said	- -18 MR . ROBERT	ROSENBERG :	Since	the 19 ' 60 s ,	the	early	' 60 s .	I	started	when	oil	was 20 eight	cents	a	gallon .21 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Okay .22 MR . ROBERT	ROSENBERG :	So that ' s23 how	old	I	am .24 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I	thought	you 25 were	going	to	say	you	started	when	you	were 2 
2 eight	years	old .3 MR . ROBERT	ROSENBERG :	I	started	in 4	1962 .5 MR . SCHLEIDER :	If	I	remember	your 6 testimony ,	you	said	you ' ve	seen	the	cycles ,7 you ' ve	lived	through	the	cycles ,	you ' ve worked 8 through	the	cycles .9 MR . ROBERT	ROSENBERG :	Right .10 MR . SCHLEIDER :	This	report	that	we 11 just	got	from	the	staff	on	the	delinquency	rate 12 for	selected	property	types , I ' m	not	going	to 13 ask	you	to	recite	it ,	because	I	don ' t	know	if 14 you	have	it	front	of	you ,	but	I ' ll	just	make	a15 few	observations .16 For	fiscal	year	2005 ,	fiscal	year 17 2006 ,	fiscal	year	2007	and	fiscal	year	2008 18 there	were	anywhere	from	13 , 000	to 19 approximately	15 , 000	parcels	that	were	listed 20 as	tax	arrears	for	that	whole	fiscal	year .21 MR . ROBERT	ROSENBERG :	Okay .22 MR . SCHLEIDER :	For	fiscal	year 23 2009	through	April	it ' s	25 , 715	parcels .24 In your	experience	as	a	seasoned 25 property	owner , what	do	you	see	as	on	the 5 
2 horizon	for	properties	if	we are	doubling	the 3 amount	of	parcels	that	are	in delinquencies	in 4 a	fraction	of	a fiscal	year ?5 MR . ROBERT	ROSENBERG :	Well ,	it ' s6 strictly	projecting .7 And	I	would	certainly	say	that	I	was 8 around	at	the	time	when	there	were	property 9 delinquencies	and	people	used	to	give	the 10 properties	way	back	in	the	' 70 s .	If	you	owed 11 taxes ,	it	was	probably	just	better	to	give 12 away .	It	didn ' t matter .13 The	values ,	though ,	today	are	a14 little	higher .	Property	values	are	higher .	So 15 owners	would	struggle	not	to give	their 16 property	up	for	tax	arrears .17 But ,	unfortunately ,	if	you	can ' t18 afford	to	pay	it ,	then	that ' s	the	route	that 19 will	go .20 But	I	believe	that	Section	8	rents 21 are	reasonable	but	- -	in	the	affordable	housing 22 -	I can	only	talk	from	my	sector	-	these	rents 23 that	I	stated	are	so	far	below	that	you	really 24 have	to	rely	on vacancies	and	other	people	to 25 pay	for	people	who	really	are	not	paying	their 2 

2	fair	share .3
So if	the	City	is	really	concerned ,
4 I	think	they	should	credit	through	tax 5 abatements	or	various	types	of	programs	to 6 lower	the	cost	if they	don ' t want	the	tenants 7 to	pay	a	higher	rent .8 But	if	the	City	would	say	we ' re 9 going	to	lower	to affordable	housing	in water	-10 if	you ' ve	retrofitted	your	building	and	you 11 have	everything	for	conservation	measures ,	you 12 deserve	to	have	a	low	price	because	we	cannot 13 watch	our	tenants '	consumption	on	water .14 And	the	same	thing	with	taxes	if	the 15 City	would	lower	it .16 So I	am	always	optimistic	no	matter 17 what .	That ' s	just	my	nature . And	we	fight	the 18 system .19 But	I	would	like	to	be	able	to	put 20 as	much	as	I	can	into	the	property .	I	renovate .21 I	don ' t	put	the	money	in	the	pocket .	That ' s	the 22 thing .23 I	don ' t	know	what ' s	going	to	happen ,24 but	I	know	we	have	to	collect	a	fair	rent 25 that ' s	reasonable	without	going	too	high ,	but	a4 

2	fair	rent .3456
MR . SCHLEIDER :		Thank	you , sir . MR . LANGUEDOC :	Question .CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :			Sure .		Question . MR . LANGUEDOC :	I	don ' t	know	if	Mr .
7 Rosenberg	can	answer	this ,	but	just	- -	if we ' re 8 going	to	be	asking	questions	about	this	tax 9 data ,	- -10 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Sure .11 MR . LANGUEDOC :	- -	there ' s something 12 I	need	to	understand .13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Sure .14 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Okay .15 The	fiscal	year	2009	data	through 16 April	30 ,	2009 , it ' s	divided ,	as	in	all	cases ,17 it	gives	a	total ,	25 , 715	parcels .	That ' s from 18 the	lower	right	corner	of	the	second	page .19 And	it	lists	five	categories .	It 20 says :	Walk - ups , elevator ,	cooperatives ,21 condominiums	and	" res "	I	assume	residential .22 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Multi - use	with 23 commercial	space	probably	in the	bottom .24 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Okay .25 So - -	okay .7 

2345	questions .6
For	example ,	- -CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :			You ' re	excused . MR . LANGUEDOC :	I	have	several CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	He	wants	to 
7 discuss	this	memo	which	you	don ' t	have .8 So go	ahead .9 Thank	you ,	Mr . Rosenberg .10 MR . ROBERT	ROSENBERG :	I	can	only 11 say	that	if	you	own	a	property ,	you	want	to 12 keep	it .	You	think	it ' s	lucrative .	If	you ' re	a13 doctor	or	if	you ' re	a	small	property	owner ,	you 14 own	one	or	two .15 So when	your	taxes	build	up ,	that ' s16 not	a	good	thing .	You	really	want	to	pay	but 17 you	can ' t	pay .18 So there	is	something	wrong	if	that 19 many	people	owe	taxes .	You ' re not	collecting 20 enough	and	trying	to	maintain	the	buildings 21 properly .	That ' s the	reason	and	it	can	only 22 lead	to	disaster	if	it ' s	not	cleared	up , like 23 in	the	past .24 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I	think	we	can 25 all	agree	that	it ' s	not	good .7 
2 MR . LANGUEDOC :	I	would	like 3 somebody	to	please	explain	- -4 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Sure .	Go ahead .5 MR . LANGUEDOC :	- -	what	are	- -6 ( Applause . )7 MR . LANGUEDOC :	- -	the	- -	I ' m	sorry .8 I	didn ' t	mean	- -9 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	No .	Go	ahead .10 MS . HOLDER :	I guess	it ' s like	a11 point	of	clarification .12 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Can	somebody	explain 13 what	the	five	categories	are	and	are	they 14 overlapping	and	do	they	all	cover	rent 15 stabilized	buildings ?16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	They	are	not 17 overlapping	because ,	you	know ,	elevator	and 18 walk - ups	are	not	the	same .	And	the 19 residential - multi	use	is	a	separate	category 20 which	could	be	either	an	elevator	or	a	walk - up .21 And	obviously	cooperatives	and	condominiums ,22 which	show	the	lowest	rates , although 23 individual	- -	condominiums , remember ,	are	in 24 these	buildings	but	individual	units .	So you ' re 25 seeing	an	increase	in	individual	unit	property 2 
2 tax	delinquency	- -3 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Right .4 MS . HOLDER :	Right .5 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	but	you ' re	not 6 seeing	it	in	co - ops	- -7 MS . HOLDER :	Right .8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	because	co - ops 9 tend	to	be	- -10 MS . HOLDER :	I guess	- -11 MR . LANGUEDOC :	That ' s	by	far	the 12 most	- -13 MS . HOLDER :	The	increases ,	the 14 major	- -15 MR . LANGUEDOC :	- -	delinquency 16 increase	- -17 MS . HOLDER :	- -	increase	is 18 condominiums	and	it ' s	not	guaranteed	that	all 19 these	parcels	are	rent	stabilized	units ;20 correct ?21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Correct .22 MS . HOLDER :	And	it ' s	not 23 guaranteed	that	some	of	these	are	not 24 owned - occupied ; right ?25 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	They	could	be .2 
2 You	mean	the	condominium ?3 MS . HOLDER :	Yes .4 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Condominiums ?5 MS . HOLDER :	And	the	cooperatives .6 But	the	condominiums	because	that 7 represents	- -8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Well ,	the 9 cooperative	is	the	building	is	delinquent ,	the 10 condominium	- -11 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	it ' s going	to 13 be	a unit .14 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .15 But	none	of	these	overlap .16 So even	though	you	could	have	a17 condominium	in	a elevator	building ,	that 18 doesn ' t	overlap ?19 MR . McLAUGHLIN :	Right .20 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Right .21 Because	that ' s the	way	Finance	keeps 22 the	categories .23 MS . HOLDER :	Right .24 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	So	- -25 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Okay .2 
2 So walk - ups	refers	to	rental 3 apartments	in	walk - up	buildings	and	elevator 4 refers	to	rental	apartments	in	elevator 5 buildings .6 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Well ,	it ' s not 7 number	of	apartments ,	Ron .	It ' s	the	number	of 8 parcels	that	- -9 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Parcels .10 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Parcels .	Okay .	Got 11 it .12 MS . HOLDER :	Condominiums	are 13 units .14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	What ?15 MS . HOLDER :	But	the	condominiums 16 are	units ?17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Yes .	Because 18 that ' s	- -	each	condominium	unit	is	a	parcel .19 MS . HOLDER :	And	they	don ' t20 overlap ;	right ?21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	What ?22 MS . HOLDER :	They	don ' t	overlap ?23 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	They	do not 24 overlap .25 MS . HOLDER :	And	we ' re	not	sure 2 
2 that	all	of	these	parcels	are	rent	stabilized ?3 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	That	is correct .4 MR . McLAUGHLIN :	We ' re	sure	that 5 they	are	not	all	rent	stabilized .6 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Right .	That ' s7 what	we ' re	sure	of .8 MS . HOLDER :	We ' re	sure	that	they 9 are	not	all	rent	stabilized .10 Are	we	sure	that	they	are	all 11 rentals ?12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Yes .13 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .14 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr .	Chair ?15 MR . McLAUGHLIN :	They ' re	rental 16 condominiums .17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	No ,	no , not	the 18 condominiums .19 MS . ADAMS :	Well ,	the	condominiums ,20 they	would	have	to	be	- -21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Class	2 has	to	do 22 with	multiple	dwellings ,	six	or	more	so that 23 subject	to ,	you	know ,	various	habitability	laws 24 and	the	like .	So condominiums	are	lumped	in 25 with	rental	properties	because	of	the	nature	of 2 
2 the	bulk	of	these	condominiums .3 MS . HOLDER :	So	- -4 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	A	condominium 5 that ' s	a	two - unit	condominium	in	a	brownstone 6 would	not	be	in this	list	because	it	would	be 7 Category	Class	1 .8 MS . HOLDER :	Right .9 But	if	it ' s	in a	building	of	six	or 10 more	units ,	it ' s in	this	list ,	and	this	easily 11 could	be	an	owner - occupied	unit	that	we could 12 be	assisting	if they ' re	on	fixed	income	or	low 13 income	in	a	foreclosure	proceeding .14 MS . CRUZ :	It	could	also	be occupied 15 by	a rent	regulated	tenant	whose	rent	is not 16 covering	the	common	charges	of	the	unit	owner .17 MS . HOLDER :	No ,	I	understand .	I18 totally	understand	that .	We don ' t	have	to 19 argue .20 It ' s	just	a	point	of	clarification 21 because	the	data	just	is	not	clear	as	to how 22 many	of	these	are	rent	regulated	tenants .23 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Adriene ,	maybe	this 24 will	help	clarify	it .25 Just	a	quick	clarification .2 
2 If we	look	at	the	total	of the 3 parcels	without	the	cooperatives	and 4 condominiums ,	just	going	back	for	say	fiscal 5 year	2005 ,	it ' s 6745	parcels	without	co - ops	and 6 condos	for	fiscal	year	2005 , 7190	parcels	for 7 fiscal	year	2006 .8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Why	don ' t	we	do 9 this .10 Rather	than	read	it	here , - -11 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr .	Chair , it	will 12 only	take	another	four	or	five	seconds	to make 13 a	point	here .	Please	indulge	me .14 7800	for	fiscal	year	2007 ;15	6768	for	2008 ;16		11 , 569	for	the	fraction	of a	year 17	2009 .18 This	is	without	co - ops	and 19 condominiums .20 So obviously	we are	still	seeing	a21 significant	degree	of	distress	for	rental 22 properties	in	New	York	City .23 MR . LANGUEDOC :	I ' m	sorry . Just	a24 question	about	what	you	said .25 Those	are	the	numbers	if	you	take 18 
2 the	co - ops	and	the	condominiums ?3 MS . CRUZ :	Yes .4 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	All	right .5 We are	actually	going	to	- - we ' ll 6 update	this	report .	But	I	think	it	is 7 legitimate	to	take	out	the	co - ops	and 8 condominiums	because	they	are	clearly	not	under 9 our	purview .10 And	in	terms	of	parcel	numbers ,	it 11 is	distorted	- -12 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Which	could	be 13 easily	- -14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	because	of	the 15 condominiums	which	are	individual	parcels .16 So it	would	be interesting	to	take 17 it	out	and	see	what	the	aggregate	arrears	are 18 in	dollar	amounts	of	that	because	I	think	one 19 would	believe	that	it ' s	likely	that	the	dollar 20 amounts ,	despite	the	overwhelming	number	of 21 parcels	that	are	condos ,	are	likely	to	show	a22 different	kind	of relationship .23 So we ' ll	redo	this	report . We ' ll	try 24 to	redo	this	report	- -	not	try	to ,	we	will	redo 25 this	report	for	this	and	we will	check	with 2 
2 Finance	as	to	whether	or	not	we	can	get 3 disaggregated	data	by	community	planning 4 district	or	whathaveyou .5 MS . HOLDER :	But	there	is no	way	we 6 can	get	disaggregated	data	by rent	stabilized 7 units ?8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	No ,	no . It ' s	the 9 same	problem	with	the	I & E	and	all	the	rest .10 It ' s not	the	way	they	keep	data .11 MS . HOLDER :	All	right .12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	They	keep	it	by 13 buildings .	So	- -14 MS . HOLDER :	Thank	you .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	All	right .16 The	next	speaker	is	Jooyeon	Lee .17 Are	you	here ?18 There	you	go .19 I	would	indicate ,	as	we	said	in 20 terms	of	the	rules	of	discussion	here ,	each 21 Board	Member	has	two	priorities	that	they	can 22 indicate	in	terms	of	timing	and	other	kinds	of 23 things ,	and	this	is	one	of	the	Board	Members '24 priorities .25 So if	anybody	else	has	a	priority ,2 
2let us	know	and	we	will	take	them	as	soon	as	we 3can consistent	with	fairness .4Go ahead .5MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Hi !	Good	morning .6Thank	you	very	much	for	the 7 opportunity	to	testify .8 My name	is	Jooyeon	Lee .	I ' m a	staff 9 attorney	at	Bedford - Stuyvesant	Legal	Services .10 Today	I ' m	speaking	on	behalf	of 11 Legal	Services	New	York	City .12 Together	with	the	Legal	Aid	Society 13 we	have	submitted	a	written	testimony 14 documenting	in	detail	the	dire	situation	faced 15 to	low - income	tenants .16 My work	as	a	staff	attorney	in	Legal 17 Services	involves	direct	representation	of 18 tenants	in	Brooklyn .	So	my	clientele	includes 19 people	on	fixed	income	because	they	are	retired 20 or	disabled ,	or people	of	working	families	with 21 low	income .22 Because	I	work	on	a	grassroots 23 level ,	I	would	like	to	give	you	some	examples 24 how	- -	you	know , what	our	office	sees	as the 25 impact	of	a	rent	increase	in our	neighborhood .7 
2 Most	of	my	tenants ,	most	of my 3 clients	are	paying	forty	percent	or	more 4 towards	their	rent ,	including	people	who	are 5 working	full - time .	So	let	me give	you	an 6 example .7 One	of	my	clients ,	who	is	working 8 full - time	as	a	chef	at	Community	Services 9 Center ,	she	brings	about	$ 1200	per	month	to	her 10 home .	She	lives	with	her	daughter ,	a	single 11 mother .12 Her	rent	is	$ 715 ,	which	is sixty 13 percent	of	her	income ,	leaving	her	less	than 14 $ 500	to	maintain	her	and	her	daughter ' s living .15 This	year ,	because	of	the	$ 85	rent 16 increase ,	now	she	has	to	pay	more	than	seventy 17 percent	of	her	work	income	towards	rent ,18 leaving	her	less	than	$ 100	to support	her	and 19 her	daughter ' s	living	to	buy	utilities ,20 Metrocards ,	food	and	clothing .21 Most	of	the	rent	stabilized 22 apartments	in	our	neighborhood	I	see	from 23 clients	are	more	than ,	you	know ,	a	thousand 24 dollars ,	between	$ 1000	and	$ 2000 ,	even	in 25 low - income	neighborhoods .2 
2 So I	think	there ' s	disappearing	low 3 end	of	rent	stabilized	units	costing	less	than 4	$ 1000 .5 In rare	cases	where	I	see	renters 6 who	are	paying	about	$ 500 ,	they	are	harassed 7 and	abused	by	the	landlords	because	they	are 8 paying	such	a	low	rent .	And	one	of	my	clients 9 is	suffering	from	five	years	of	mice	and ,	you 10 know ,	rat	infestation ,	roach	infestation ,	and 11 leaking	problems ,	but	she	was	accused	by the 12 landlord	that ,	you	know ,	you ' re	not	paying 13 enough	rent	and , you	know ,	I don ' t	need	to 14 repair	anything	in	your	apartment .15 So we	see	this	type	of	neglect	and 16 harassment	by	the	landlord	for	long - term	rent 17 stabilized	tenants	who	are	paying	less	than 18 $ 1000	per	month	rent .19 So , therefore , I	urge	the	Board	to 20 consider	the	current ,	unprecedented	economic 21 hardship	facing	the	tenants . People	are 22 unemployed .	They	have	lesser	wage	now	because 23 of	the	economy .24 And ,	you	know , there	shouldn ' t	be 25 any	minimum	increase	for	long - term	tenants .5 
2 So I	urge	the	Board	to	freeze	the 3 rent	increase	this	year .4 The	landlords	can	have	other	options 5 to	increase	the	rents	such	as vacancy 6 allowance ,	MCI	increase ,	1 / 40 th	of	an 7 individual	apartment	increase ,	or	even	applying 8 for	a	building - wide	adjustment	based	on a9 hardship .10 Also ,	they	enjoyed	a	huge	rent 11 increase	last	year .12 This	year	- -13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	need	to	wrap 14 up .15 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Yes .16 - - tenants	who	face	unemployed	or 17 reduced	income , they	cannot	- -	they	have	only 18 one	alternative , which	is	homelessness , which 19 cause	huge	social	cost	to	the	community , to	our 20 own	community .21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .22 Any	questions ?23 MS . HOLDER :	Mr .	Chairman , I	have	a24 few	questions .25 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Sure .2 
2 MS . HOLDER :	Do	you	represent 3 tenants	that	rent	housing	from	the	New	York 4 City	Housing	Authority ?5 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Yes .6 MS . HOLDER :	What	percentage	of 7 your	practice	is public	housing	tenants ?8 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	I	would	say	for 9 my	office ,	which	is	about	ten	percent	or 10 fifteen	percent	of	total	that	we	spend	time	on 11 public	housing	tenants .12 MS . HOLDER :	And	the	tenants	that 13 you	represent ,	are	there	landlords	also	in 14 small	buildings , one	and	two - unit	houses ?15 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Yes .16 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .17 What	percentage	of	your	clientele 18 rent	apartments	from	owners	that	are	in one ,19 two	and	three	unit	housing ?20 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	About	thirty 21 percent .	You	know ,	but	those	are	not	rent 22 stabilized	because	there	are	less	than	six 23 units	in	those	buildings .24 MS . HOLDER :	Right .25 So would	you	say	that	the	rental 2 
2 problems	of	your	clientele	are	the	same	or 3 different	depending	on	the	type	of	housing	that 4 they	are	renting ?5 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Yes .6 MS . HOLDER :	Can	you	describe	the 7 differences ?8 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Differences	in 9 terms	of	public	housing	and	- -10 MS . HOLDER :	Yes .11 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	- -	rent 12 stabilized ?13 MS . HOLDER :	And	the	tenants	in 14 housing	that	is one	to	three	units .	I	mean	are 15 their	rents	also	beyond	their	means ,	that	they 16 are	facing	non - payment	proceedings	because	they 17 can ' t	afford	the	rents ,	because	they ' ve lost 18 their	jobs	or	that	their	jobs	are	not	enough	to 19 sustain	the	rent	even	in	public	housing ?20 That ' s	what	I	would	like	for	you	to 21 elaborate	on .22 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Yeah .	Okay .23 For	public	housing	tenants	the	rent 24 is	at their	income	level	so it	should	be 25 affordable	by	definition .2 
2 For	those	tenants	living	in one ,3 two , three - unit	buildings ,	they	are	facing	the 4 problems	now ,	but	they	don ' t have	the 5 protection	of	rent	stabilization ,	which	means 6 that	after	the	lease	expires ,	they	have	no 7 option	except	the	offer	of	a renewal	lease .8 For	rent	stabilized	apartments ,	we 9 see	similar	problems ,	and	- - but	they	do have 10 - -	should	have	a protection	of	rent 11 stabilization .	But	just	because	they	don ' t	have 12 now	means	to	pay	the	rents , they	don ' t	have	any 13 other	option	now .14 And	the	rental	of	City	apartments 15 are	less	and	less	available	for	those	tenants .16 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .	Thank	you .17 MR . WENK :	Mr . Chair ?18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Yes .	Go ahead .19 Mr . Wenk .20 MR . WENK :	Thank	you ,	Ms .	Lee .21 I	think	you	testified	that	one	of 22 your	tenants	you	represented	had	an	$ 85 23 increase	in	her	rent	- -24 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Yes .25 MR . WENK :	- -	to ,	I	think	you	said 2 

2	$ 715 .34
MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Yes .MR . WENK :	So	she	was	presumably	at 
5 $ 630	before	that	increase ?6 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Oh !	She	was 7 paying	$ 715 .	Now	she	is	paying	about	$ 800 .8 MR . WENK :	Now	she ' s	paying	$ 800 .9 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Right .10 MR . WENK :	Do	you	happen	to know	why 11 she	elected	a	two - year	lease	with	the	$ 85 12 minimum	increase	as	opposed	to	a	one - year	lease 13 with	a	$ 45	minimum	increase ?14 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	She	is	a15 long - term	tenant	and ,	you	know ,	it ' s	just	a16 matter	of	habit	that	she	always	signed	two - year 17 leases	as	opposed	to	a	one - year	lease	because 18 she	intends	to	live	there	for	many	more	years .19 MR . WENK :	She	was	aware	that	a20 one - year	lease	would	have	been	a	$ 45	increase ?21 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Right .22 But	in	the	next	year	she	would	get 23 another	$ 45 ,	or the	rate	set	by	the	Guideline 24 Board .25 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I	think	- - she 5 
2 would	take	a	risk ,	but	the	next	year	is not	- -3 would	not	automatically	be	$ 45 .	It	could	be 4 zero .5 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Right .	We	are 6 hoping	that .7 MS . HOLDER :	Right .8 Yeah .	It	could	vary .	But ,9 unfortunately ,	when	we	got	- -10 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	No ,	we 11 understand .12 MS . HOLDER :	Right .13 I	mean	the	concern	was	last	year 14 that	fuel	cost	prices	were	going	to	continue	to 15 go	up and	I	know	a	lot	of	people	were	scared	as 16 to	what	- -	they	needed	to	lock	into	whose 17 leases	were	up	last	year .18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Yes .	They	are 19 very	legitimate	concerns .20 Thank	you .21 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr .	Chair ?22 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Sorry .23 Question ?24 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Yes .25 Ms . Lee ?2 
2 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Yes .3 MR . SCHLEIDER :	If	I	hear	you 4 correctly ,	you	are	proposing	that	the	Board	do 5 a	rent	freeze	because	of	the	current	economic 6 conditions	and	the	recession .7 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Yes .8 ( Applause . )9 MR . SCHLEIDER :	How	long	do	you	see 10 the	recession	lasting ?11 ( Audience	participation . )12 MR . SCHLEIDER :	But	I ' m	asking	the 13 question	here .14 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	I	don ' t know ,	but 15 I	can	only	see	from	its	impact	to	my	clients 16 who	are	tenants	who	are	paying	the	rent .17 MR . SCHLEIDER :	So	if	it	lasts	for 18 one	year ,	three	years ,	five	years ,	six	years 19 longer	-	and	it could	quite	well	possibly	last 20 that	long	-	are	you	going	to come	back	every 21 year	and	propose	a	rent	freeze	because	of the 22 prevailing	recession ?23 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	This	year ,24 because	of	the	high	rent	increase	last	year ,	I25 think	the	tenants	are	impacted	more	this	year 2 
2	- -	MR .	SCHLEIDER :	Is	that 3	- -4 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	- -	because	of	the 5 economy .6 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- -	yes	or is	that	a7 no ? I ' m	not	sure	I	understand	what	you ' re 8 saying .9 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	I ' m	not	sure	what 10 your	question	is .11 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right .12 For	your	clients	in	the	NYCHA 13 properties ,	- -14 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Yes .15 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- -	you	say	that 16 those	rents	are	income - based .17 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Right .18 MR . SCHLEIDER :	And	you ' re aware 19 that	NYCHA	is	going	through	a	voluntary 20 conversion	with	a	good	proportion	of	their 21 housing	stock	because	they	can ' t	afford	to	keep 22 it	up because	the	rents	are	so	low ?23 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	I	think	that 24 NYCHA	is	something	else	that	is	beyond	our 25 discussion	today .4 

23	you .456
MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right . Thank MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Thank	you . CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .MS . HOLDER :	I mean ,	just	for	a
7 point	of	clarification ,	there ' s	a	lot	of issues 8 going	on	with	the	New	York	City	Housing 9 Authority .10 We actually ,	having	a	complicated 11 relationship	with	government	as	legal	services 12 organizations ,	oftentimes	work	collaboratively 13 with	them	as	we try	to	make	applications	to 14 HUD .15 The	issue	sometimes	has	to be	dealt 16 with	from	the	idea	of	how	some	of	those 17 developments	are	underfunded	by	HUD ,	and	that 18 some	of	the	State	and	City	developments	have 19 been	underfunded	by	the	City	and	the	State .20 So I	mean	that ' s	a	whole	another 21 analysis .	It ' s	a housing	stock	that	we	value ,22 but	it ' s	not	necessarily	a	housing	stock	that 23 needs	to	be	discussed	here .24 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Well ,	they ' re 25 underfunded ,	Adriene ,	because	the	rents	don ' t7 
2 - -	the	rent	structure	doesn ' t	cover	the 3 expenses .4 So they ' re	in	the	same	boat	as	the 5 private	landlords	where	the	rents	don ' t cover 6 the	expenses .7 MS . HOLDER :	The	rents	don ' t	cover 8 the	- -9 MR . LANGUEDOC :	It ' s	not	the	rent .10 It ' s the	subsidization	levels .11 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right , Ron .12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	It ' s	a	fact ;	not 13 the	rent ,	because	the	rent	is a	function	of	the 14 income ,	but	it	is - -	the	difference	is	not	made 15 up	at the	right	level	by	the	other	levels	of 16 government	the	way	the	program	works .17 But	you	can	say	it ' s	the	rent 18 because	the	rent	is	restricted ,	but	the	rent	is 19 restricted	consistent	with	what	I	at	least	have 20 advocated ,	which	is	a	rent - to - income	ratio 21 test .22 So at	the	end	of	the	day	the	people 23 who	are	not	meeting	their	responsibility	are 24 the	other	levels	of	government	who	are	supposed 25 to	make	up	the	difference	to the	Housing 2 
2 Authority	so	that	they	can	break	even .3 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Fine .4 Which	is	what	I ' ve	been	saying	all 5 along ,	at	least	for	quite	a few	number	of 6 years ,	that	it	should	be	on government ' s7 shoulders ,	not	the	private	landlord ' s	shoulders 8 to	make	up	these	operating	deficits	in	the 9 private	housing	stock .10 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Well ,	that ' s	not 11 the	law .12 MS . HOLDER :	And	- -13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I	think	we	agree 14 on	a policy ,	you	and	I	at	least ,	but	it ' s	not 15 the	law ,	whereas	in	the	Housing	Authority	it	is 16 the	law	and ,	therefore ,	it	changes	the	dynamic .17 Go ahead .18 MS . HOLDER :	And	what	we ' ve 19 experienced	is	that	tenants	have	been 20 shouldering	a	lot	of	this	burden	for	years	now .21 And	that ' s	also	what ' s	been	the	subject	of	- -22 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Shouldering	the 23 burden	by	paying	for	services ,	- -24 MS . HOLDER :	- -	our	recession .25 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- -	by	paying	for 2 

2	rent ?3
MS . HOLDER :	Shouldering	the	burden 
4 by	having	all	kinds	of	increases	put	off	on 5 them .	That ' s	what	happened	last	year	in 6 addition	to	previous	years .7 I	thank	you ,	Ms .	Lee ,	for	your 8 testimony .	You	did	a	wonderful	job .	Thank	you .9 MS . JOOYEON	LEE :	Thank	you .10 ( Applause . )11 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Mr .	Anderson ,12 James	Anderson .13 MR . JAMES	ANDERSON :	Honorable	Rent 14 Guidelines	Board !15 I	respect	you	because	you ' re 16 appointed	from	the	Mayor .	Even	seven	people	of 17 you	very	good ,	and	two	not	- -	I	still	obey	your 18 power .19 You	understand	the	problem	- -20 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Are	you	going	to 21 say	something	different	from	what	you	said	the 22 other	night ?23 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Let	him	talk .24 MR . JAMES	ANDERSON :	Yes . Very 25 different .4 
2 Last	night	they	do	not	say	that 3 Mayor	don ' t	care	nothing .	He has	$ 9	billion	for 4 himself	and	want	to	have	landlords	to	pay	more 5 tax	and	other	expenses .	He ' s a	rich	bum	anyway .6 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	A	rich	what ?7 MR . JAMES	ANDERSON :	A	rich	bum .8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Bum ?9 MR . JAMES	ANDERSON :	Yes .10 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .	We ' ll	send 11 him	the	transcript .12 MR . JAMES	ANDERSON :	This	is	very 13 different	than	before .	Before	I	didn ' t	mention 14 that	seven	people	make	- -	if you	make	right 15 decision ,	and	two	people	miss	the	zero , for 16 lawyer	liars ,	educated	bums .17 Anyway ,	let ' s	see	the	problems .18 Because	everybody	know	that	expenses 19 grow	over	time . Last	night	I mentioned	tax ,20 but , you	know ,	that	small	landlord	has	usually 21 worn	building ,	old	floors ,	which	too	much 22 renovation .	That ' s	something	different 23 definitely .24 And	tax	cannot	go	down ,	nothing	else 25 cannot	go	down , because	we	have	too	many	City ,2 
2 State	and	Federal	employees	and	other	bums	who 3 stay	in	their	offices .4 And	now	mention	the	crisis , a	lot	of 5 banks	( unintelligible ) ,	but	City	and	State	rise 6 their	salaries	much	more .	Without	to	us ,7 nobody ,	just	appointed	committee ,	then	the 8 Mayor	approve	it and	now	they	receive	the 9 biggest	salary	here	in	the	City .10 The	next	mayor	will	receive 11 $ 225 , 000 .	That ' s the	second	or	third	salary	in 12 the	United	States ,	bigger	than	Vice	President ,13 Speaker	of	the	House .	Another	rich	bum .14 And	all	these	people	who	are	running 15 for	offices	now , City	Councils ,	next	year	will 16 be	Assemblymen , the	same	thing	worse	like 17 another	legislator	before .	Don ' t	care	nothing .18 Just	cheating	to be	elected .

JAMES	ANDERSON :	You	don ' t	give 19 me	time .20 ( Audience	participation . )21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Jeanette	Doal .22 MS . JEANETTE	DOAL :	Good	morning .23 MS . ADAMS :	Good	morning .24 MS . JEANETTE	DOAL :	You ' re an 25 oppressive	group ,	voting	last	year	to	raise 6 
2 rents	4 . 5	percent	and	8 . 5	percent	or	$ 40 and 3 $ 80 increases	for	a	million	New	York	City 4 renters	beginning	October	of ' 08 .5 If you	remember ,	the	Fed	Chair 6 Bernanke ,	on	a	6 0 Minutes interview	testified 7 to	the	fact	that	in	mid - October	of	' 08 , just 8 when	your	rent	guidelines	were	going	into 9 effect ,	our	economy	almost	completely 10 collapsed .11 In the	past	eight	months	we ' ve	seen 12 huge	job	losses , decreased	hours	in	pay ,13 personal	savings	losses ,	bankrupt	or	bailed	out 14 everything	else .15 And	this	is	proof	that	you	don ' t16 have	the	insight ,	perception	and	awareness	of 17 the	task	that	you	have	been	called	to .18 Last	Friday ,	I had	a	conversation 19 with	an	Ob - Gyn	fellow	at	a	medical	conference .20 We	were	discussing	her	dilemma	of	affordable 21 housing	for	herself	and	other	medical	students .22 She	said	she	had	enormous	difficulty	finding 23 affordable	housing .	She	finally	ended	up with	a24 rent	that ' s	forty - five	percent	of	her	income .25 Student	housing	was	too	high	in 2 
2 demand ,	the	waiting	list	was	too	long .	It was 3 impossible	to	meet	her	needs .	And	she	said 4 other	medical	students	are	in need	of 5 affordable	housing	and	they	are	not	getting	it 6 either .7 I	asked	her	about	finding	rent 8 regulated	apartments .	She	dismissed	the	notion 9 with ,	quote ,	I	can ' t	afford	a	lawyer .	The	rent 10 increases	every	year	are	destroying	it	anyway .11 Nothing	much	is available	there	either .12 In your	decisionmaking	process	do 13 you	factor	these	needs ?	Are	you	concerned	about 14 the	needs	of	these	and	others	on	limited 15 income ?16 How	many	seeking	to	advance	their 17 training	and	skills	that	must	live	in	the	City 18 are	able	to	be	- -	are	not	being	served	by 19 rent - regulated	housing ?20 I	would	ask	you	might	consider 21 probing	the	incomes	of	owners ,	the	rents	that 22 their	tenants	pay ,	go	back	over	time ,	look	at 23 how	the	rent	rolls	have	changed ,	identify 24 exactly	what	landlords	are	pulling	in	as income 25 and	just	exactly	what	rents	tenants	are	paying ,2 
2 and	factor	this	information	into	your	formula 3 for	evaluating	whether	an	increase	is 4 advisable .5 Thank	you .6 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .7 Any	questions ?8 ( Applause . )9 ( No response . )10 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .11 Patrick	Siconolfi .12 Mr . Siconolfi ? Just	walked	in	- -13 out .14 Robert	Desir .	Mr .	Desir	is also	a15 priority	of	a	Board	Member .16 Would	somebody	get	Mr .	Siconolfi	in 17 so	he can	go	next .18 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	I ' m here .19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	All	right .	You	go 20 next .21 Go ahead .22 MR . ROBERT	DESIR :	Good	morning !23 I ' m a	staff	attorney	with	the	Legal 24 Aid	Society	Civil	Practice . Our	mission	is	to 25 improve	the	lives	of	low - income	New	Yorkers	by 2 
2 helping	vulnerable	families	and	individuals 3 obtain	and	maintain	the	basic	necessities	of 4 life :	Housing ,	health	care , food	and	subsidized 5 income	or	self - sufficiency .6 The	Legal	Aid	Society	annually 7 represents	thousands	of	tenants	faced	with 8 eviction	which	provides	the	Legal	Aid	Society 9 with	valuable	insight	into	the	landlord / tenant 10 relationship .11 On behalf	of	the	Legal	Aid	Society	I12 thank	this	Board	for	the	opportunity	to speak 13 before	you .	I	thank	this	Board	for	the 14 opportunity	to	speak	on	behalf	of	the	one 15 million	low - income	tenants	living	at 16 rent - regulated	housing	that	will	be 17 significantly	impacted	by	this	Board ' s18 decision .19 Currently ,	forty - two	percent	of	the 20 City ' s	poor	and	near - poor	households	live	in 21 rent - regulated	housing .	These	people	are 22 already	suffering	from	increasing	rent / income 23 burdens	and	declining	residual	income .24 These	tenants	are	seeing	increases 25 in	utility ,	transportation	and	consumer	costs .2 
2 They ' re	feeling	the	effects	of	rising 3 unemployment .4 According	to	the	CSS	Report ,	" Making 5 the	Rent ,	Who	is at	Risk ? " , from	2005	to 2008 6 poor	people ' s	residual	income	per	person	fell 7 sharply ,	from	$ 146	to	$ 133	per	month	in 8 inflation	adjusted	dollars . That	study	found 9 that	for	poor	families	increases	in	income	did 10 not	keep	pace	with	rent	increases .11 The	income	of	rent	stabilized 12 tenants	in	New	York	increased	a	mere	1 . 413 percent	from	2004	to	2007 ,	after	dropping	8 . 614 percent	between	2001	and	2004 .15 According	to	the	most	recent	US 16 Census	Bureau ' s 2008	New	York	City	Housing	and 17 Vacancy	Survey , fifty - three	percent	of	rent 18 stabilized	tenants	have	household	incomes	below 19 the	New	York	City	median ,	thirty - seven	percent 20 of	rent	stabilized	tenants	are	paying	rent	that 21 is	more	than	forty	percent	of their	income ,22 forty - nine	percent	of	rent	stabilized	tenants 23 are	paying	rent	that	is	more	than	thirty 24 percent	of	their	income ,	that	percentage	being 25 the	number	at	which	rent	is considered 2 

2	affordable .3
According	to	the	New	York	State 
 4 Comptroller ,	the	median	monthly	contract	rent 5 for	a	rent	stabilized	unit	is $ 925 .6 A	family	of	three	that	earns	twice 7 the	poverty	rate	earns	about	$ 35 , 000	a	year .8 For	them	an	affordable	rent	is	about	$ 880 ,9 using	that	thirty	percent	formula .10 If such	a	person	cannot	afford	a11 rent - regulated	apartment ,	they	certainly	will 12 not	be	able	to	afford	a	two - bedroom	apartment 13 that	is	outside	of	rent	regulation .	And	that	is 14 not	just	in	Manhattan .15 In Crown	Heights ,	Brooklyn ,16 Bushwick ,	Brooklyn	and	Elmhurst ,	Queens , for 17 example ,	the	asking	price	for	a	two - bedroom 18 apartment	is ,	by and	large , $ 1500 .19 The	asking	rents	in	areas	such	as 20 Jamaica	and	Far	Rockaway ,	Queens	are	in the 21	$ 1300	range .22 These	rents	are	unimaginable	for 23 such	a	family .24 In closing ,	I	remind	the	Board	of 25 its	stated	goal	of	protecting	the	public 22 
2 health ,	safety	and	welfare	and	to	prevent 3 extractions	of	unjust ,	unreasonable	and 4 oppressive	rents	and	rental	agreements .5 The	proposed	increases	of	2 to	4 . 56 percent	for	one - year	leases	and	4	to	7 . 57 percent	for	two - year	leases , as	well	as the 8 minimum	rent	increases ,	will	only	force	an 9 increasing	number	of	poor	New	Yorkers	to become 10 homeless	or	forego	other	necessities	of life .11 We respectfully	urge	this	Board	to 12 vote	to	maintain	the	rents	at their	current 13 levels .14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Any	questions ?15 MS . ADAMS :	Yes .16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Question .17 MS . ADAMS :	Thank	you .18 Would	you	clarify	something	earlier 19 for	me ?	I	think	you	said ,	but	I ' m	not	sure ,20 forty - two	percent	of	the	poor	- -21 ( Audience	participation . )22 MS . ADAMS :	- - live	in 23 rent - regulated	housing ?24 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I ' m	sorry .25 MS . ADAMS :	Did	you	say	earlier	in 2 
2 your	testimony	that	forty - two	percent	of the 3 poor	live	in	rent - regulated	housing ?4 MR . ROBERT	DESIR :	Correct .5 MS . ADAMS :	Okay .6 And	how	are	you	defining	poor	there ?7 MR . ROBERT	DESIR :	Excuse	me ?8 MS . ADAMS :	What	are	you	including 9 under	" poor ? "10 MR . ROBERT	DESIR :	That	is peoples 11 whose	income	based	on	family	size	falls	below 12 the	poverty	line .13 MS . ADAMS :	Okay .14 So you ' re	saying	that	half	of	those 15 roughly ,	or	forty - two	percent	are	in	rent 16 stabilized	housing ?17 MR . ROBERT	DESIR :	Rent - regulated 18 housing .19 MS . ADAMS :	Okay .20 Do you	have	any	stats	on	those	who 21 are	middle	income ?22 MR . ROBERT	DESIR :	I ' m	sorry .23 MS . ADAMS :	Do you	have	any 24 statistics	on	those	who	are	middle	income ,	what 25 percentage	of	them	- -2 
2 MR . ROBERT	DESIR :	Well ,	I did	not 3 include	- -	I	really	wanted	to focus	my 4 testimony	on	the	low - income	population	so I	do 5 not	have	those	statistics .	Sorry .6 MS . ADAMS :	That ' s	all	right .	Thank 7 you	very	much .8 MR . LANGUEDOC :	I	have	a	question .9 You	used	the	term	residual	income .10 Could	you	explain	what	that	is ?11 MR . ROBERT	DESIR :	That ' s	income 12 left	over	after	paying	rent , to	pay	for	other 13 basic	necessities ,	some	that	I	mentioned :14 Transportation	costs ,	utility	costs ,	food ,15 other	incidents	of	life .16 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Okay .17 Thank	you .18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .19 MS . CRUZ :	Mr . Chairman ,	I have	a20 question .21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Question .22 MS . CRUZ :	Mr . Desir ,	isn ' t it	true 23 that	many	of	your	clients	have	the	ability	to 24 supplement	their	income	levels	with	Section	825 benefits	both	as existing	tenants	or	tenants 2 
2 that	want	to	find	housing	in the	outer	boroughs 3 as	you	described ?	Families	that	cannot	get 4 housing	in	the	outer	boroughs	because	they 5 can ' t	afford	it , can ' t	they	apply	for	Section	86 and	get	housing	with	Section	8	vouchers ?7 MR . ROBERT	DESIR :	Well ,	a lot	of 8 our	tenants ,	my clients ,	do have	Section	89 vouchers .	It ' s	not	an	infinite	resource .10 As you	know ,	it was	a	long	time 11 before	vouchers	were	made	available	to	tenants 12 and	they ' ve	recently	been	made	available .13 However ,	that	list	has	been	significantly 14 limited .15 And	we	are	working	with	the	City 16 Council	to	increase	priority	and	to	increase 17 the	number	of	people	that	will	be	eligible	for 18 Section	8	vouchers .19 But	I	think	your	question	and	the 20 statement	you	made	is	partly	true .	However ,	in 21 the	whole	there	is	a	significant	amount	of 22 tenants	who	do	not	qualify	for	Section	8 and 23 those	who	do	qualify	are	not	able	to	get 24 vouchers .25 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .2 

23	wait	list ?4
MS . HOLDER :	And	how	long	is	the MR . ROBERT	DESIR :	Well ,	recently 
5 the	wait	list	can	vary .6 I	have	witnessed	tenants	who	have 7 been	on	the	waiting	list	for	upwards	of ten 8 years	and	recently	received	vouchers .	So there 9 is	no way	to	tell	exactly .	But	it	can	be ten 10 years ,	it	can	be one	year .	It varies 11 significantly .12 I	think	that	what	is	the	guiding 13 factor	is	the	extent	to	which	vouchers	are	made 14 available	and	the	extent	to which	the	subsidy 15 program	is	funded	at	the	national	level .16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .17 Thank	you .18 MS . HOLDER :	Robert ,	thank	you	so 19 much	for	your	testimony .20 ( Applause . )21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Mr .	Siconolfi .22 Let	me	call	some	other	names	because 23 unlike	the	hearing	we	had	the	other	day , we 24 want	people	to	be here	before	they	are	called .25 So it ' s	Mr .	Siconolfi ;5 

2345678	morning !9
Followed	by	Dave	Whitmore ; Followed	by	Larry		Wood ; Followed	by	Ed Korman ; Followed	by	Matt	Shotkin . Mr . Siconolfi , go		ahead .MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	Good I ' m Patrick	Siconolfi ,	Executive 
10 Director	of	the	Community	Housing	Improvement 11 Program .	We	represent	a	thousand	owners	of 12 stabilized	property ,	primarily	owners	of small 13 and	medium	holdings .14 Earlier	this	year ,	I	testified	to 15 you	about	some	of the	larger	financial	trends 16 involved	in	stabilized	properties	and	owners '17 need	for	guidelines	at	least	equal	to	the	Price 18 Index	of	Operating	Costs	this	year	and	as a19 regular	practice .20 This	remains	true ,	and	I	again	urge 21 to	take	this	step .22 But	I	want	to	make	two	additional 23 points	at	this	time .24 The	largest	component	of	a25 building ' s	expenses	is	taxes	and	other	payments 10 
2 to	the	City	of	New	York ,	accounting	for	about 3 thirty - five	percent	of	every	dollar	spent	to 4 operate	housing .5 This	is	also	the	fastest	growing 6 component	at	about	a	twelve	percent	increase .7 The	proposed	guideline	increases 8 fall	below	the	threshold	of what	is	needed	to 9 pay	this	increase .	Just	this	increase	and 10 nothing	else	you	would	need	a	five	percent 11 guideline .	And	that	would	only	be	to	address 12 the	tax	issue .13 And	this	point	I ' m	making	ties	in 14 very	closely	with	the	data	that	you	released	at 15 the	beginning	of this	meeting	about	buildings 16 being	in	arrears .17 The	second	point	I	would	like	to 18 make	is	that	we are	asking	you	to	focus	on	the 19 low - rent	supplement	which	the	Board	included 20 again	this	year	in	its	preliminary	guideline .21 The	low - rent	supplement	is critical 22 for	smaller	owners	where	low	rents	have	a23 disproportionate	effect	and	make	building 24 finances	fragile .	For	this	reason	we ' d	like	to 25 share	important	new	findings	with	you .2 
2 CHIP	recently	engaged	an	independent 3 research	firm	called	Urbanomics	to	examine	and 4 characterize	the	owners	of	rent	stabilized 5 property .	This	is the	first	such	research	study 6 of	its	type	in	a generation .7 The	findings	of interest	here :8 Most	owners	of stabilized	properties 9 are	long - term	holders	of	property .	71	percent 10 have	owned	their	building	for	twenty	years	or 11 more ,	and	44	percent	-	you	know ,	coming	very 12 close	to	half	- have	owned	their	buildings	for 13 thirty	years	or more .14 Thirty - five	percent	of	owners	live 15 in	their	rent	stabilized	building ,	and	over	70 16 percent	live	in New	York	City .17 Additionally ,	the	great	majority ,	86 18 percent	of	owners ,	manage	their	own	property .19 And	seventy	percent	of	the	owners ,20 they ' re	not	corporate	entities	at	all ,	they	are 21 either	individuals	or	family	businesses .22 Interestingly , fully	forty - three 23 percent	of	owners	of	stabilized	property	are 24 immigrants	or	children	of	immigrants .25 Now ,	most	shockingly ,	forty - nine 2 
2 percent	of	owners	of	stabilized	property	are 3 not	making	money	on	their	buildings .	Fourteen 4 percent	have	actual	negative	cash	flow	and 5 thirty - five	percent	are	on	the	verge	of 6 negative	cash	flow .7 These	findings	demonstrate	that 8 ownership	does	not	conform	to popular 9 stereotypes .	Most	owners	have	small	holdings ,10 almost	half	are	distressed	or in	danger	of 11 becoming	distressed .12 And	further	-	and	I	find	this	very 13 interesting	-	most	of	these	people	live	either 14 in	their	buildings	or	in	the	neighborhood .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	need	to	wrap 16 up , Mr .	Siconolfi .17 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	Okay .18 To sum	up ,	mostly	long - term	holders 19 of	property	have	a	commitment	to	the	stability 20 of	their	property	and	to	the	City .21 We ask	you	to	do	two	things .22 What	these	people	need	as	a group	is 23 they	need	guidelines	equal	to the	core	PIOC	and 24 they	need	that	low - rent	supplement .25 Thank	you	very	much .2

CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .Question .Can	this	report	be	made	available	to MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	Yes ,	we 
7 will	make	it	available .	Absolutely .8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	We	haven ' t	seen 9 it	before ,	have	we ?10 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	No .	The 11 other	one	I	showed	you	was	a separate	report .12 This	is	newly	released	and	we will	share	a	copy 13 with	you ,	absolutely .14 MS . ADAMS :	Mr . Chairman ,	I have 15 another	question .16 The	people	who	were	surveyed	in	your 17 study ,	who	were	they ?18 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	They	were 19 owners	of	rent	stabilized	property	in	New	York 20 City .21 MS . ADAMS :	How	many	of	the	owners 22 and	- -23 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	Well ,	we 24 took	- -25 MS . ADAMS :	- - how	many	- -7 
2 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	- - a3 sample ,	a	three	percent	sample .	I	don ' t know 4 the	exact	numbers	that	that	correlates	to ,	but 5 it ' s in	the	study .6 MS . ADAMS :	Excuse	me .7 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	And	the 8 methodology	and	all	the	rest	- -9 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	The 10 methodology	- -	excuse	me .11 MS . ADAMS :	The	Association	that	you 12 belong	to	represents	a	thousand	owners	of 13 stabilized	property .14 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	Yes .15 MS . ADAMS :	Would	it	be	three 16 percent	of	that	number ?17 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	No ,	no ,	no .18 We took	a	database	that	was	much 19 larger .	We	took	a	12 , 000	property	database .20 MS . ADAMS :	And	if	we	could	get	that 21 database .22 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	Between	us 23 and	some	of	the	other ,	you	know ,	owner 24 membership	organizations	including	RSA	and 25 ourselves ,	we	have	that	data .	And	it ' s2 
2 correlated	with	City	data .3 The	actual	manipulation	of the	data 4 was	based	on	DHCR	data	and	Department	of 5 Buildings	data	and	Department	of	Finance	data .6 The	methodology	is	fully	explained 7 in	the	report .	So rather	than	re - create	it 8 here ,	I ' d	rather	show	you	the	study .9 MS . ADAMS :	I	heard	you	tell	the 10 Chairman	you	would .	When	will	that	study	be 11 shown ?12 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	We will	get 13 it	to you	before	the	end	of this	week .14 MS . ADAMS :	Thank	you	very	much .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Could	you	put	it 16 in	e - mail	form ?17 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	Absolutely .18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	So	it	will	go	to 19 Senator	Drew	and	then	he ' ll circulate	it to	the 20 Board .21 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	Sure .22 Okay .23 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	The	sooner	the 24 better	because	I think	- -25 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	We ' ll	get 2 
2 it	to you	right	away .3 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	we	would	like 4 input	and		our	decision	is	Tuesday	night	at 5	5 : 30 .	So	- -6 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	I7 understand .8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .9 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	We will	get 10 it	to you	quickly .11 MR . LANGUEDOC :	I ' d	like	to ask	a12 question .13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Sure .	Go ahead .14 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Okay .15 So 71	percent	of	owners	- -16 VOICES :	Louder ,	please .17 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Thirty - five	percent 18 of	owners	live	in the	building	and	seventy - one 19 percent	of	owners	have	been	owners	for	twenty 20 years	or	more	I believe	you	said ,	something 21 like	that .22 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	Seventy - one 23 for	twenty	years ,	for	at	least	twenty	years ,24 and	forty - four	percent	for	at least	thirty 25 years .6 
2 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Okay .3 But	if	you	looked	at	it	in terms	of 4 units ,	you	would	come	up	with	a	very	different 5 analysis ,	would	you	not ?6 In other	words , there	are	- -	there 7 are	a	small	number	of	owners	that	own	a very 8 large	- -9 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	No ,	I10 disagree	with	you .	You	heard	the	gentleman 11 earlier	today ,	Robert	Rosenberg ,	speak	about 12 the	fact	-	and	he ' s	a	relatively	larger	owner ,13 I	think	he	said	he	had	2500	units ,	and	he ' s14 been	owning	those	units	since	the	' 60 s . So	he 15 would	be	even	beyond	- -16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	But	he	can	only 17 live	in	one	of	his	forty	buildings .18 ( Laughter . )19 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	I ' ll	grant 20 you	that .21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	So	I	think	there 22 is	- -23 MR . LANGUEDOC :	I ' m	saying	that	- -24 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	validity	to 25 that .2 
2 MR . LANGUEDOC :	- -	there	is a3 significant	number	of	rent	stabilized	units	-	I4 think	we ' ve	been	told	something	like	thirty	to 5 forty	percent	of them	-	are	owned	by	owners	who 6 own	many	thousands	of	units , such	as	Tishman 7 Speyer	and	the	Lefrack	Organization ,	- -8 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	So ,	- -9 MR . LANGUEDOC :	- -	like	Pinnacle	and 10 Gluck .11 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	- - if	I ' ve 12 heard	you	correctly ,	you	are	saying	that	sixty 13 to	seventy	percent	of	the	owners	are	not	in 14 that	category .15 Thank	you .16 MS . HOLDER :	So	that	is	- - the 17 minority	of	owners	are	the	ones	that	you	are 18 referring	to .19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Why	don ' t	we	look 20 at	the	study	because	I	think	there	is	a21 legitimacy	to	the	fact	that	it ' s	likely	to 22 represent	a	smaller	ownership .23 However ,	that ' s Mr .	Siconolfi ' s24 constituency ,	smaller	property	owners	of New 25 York .2 
2 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	Right .3 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	So	he ' s making	a4 point	for	them .5 But	let ' s	look	at	the	study	because 6 the	study ,	like	every	other	study	we	have ,	it 7 has	shortcomings	I ' m	sure .	And	I ' m	sure	those 8 who	choose	to	find	the	shortcomings	will	and 9 those	who	choose	to	find	the	virtues	will 10 equally	find	them .11 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	And	when 12 you	get	the	study ,	if	you	have	any	questions ,13 I ' d be	happy	to answer	that .14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Sure .15 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	Okay .16 Thank	you .17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .18 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr .	Chair ?19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Yes ,	Mr .20 Schleider .21 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Thank	you	for	your 22 testimony .23 The	recent	budget	for	the	City	that 24 was	passed	shows	that	real	estate	taxes	are 25 going	to	go	up	well	in	excess	of	ten	percent 2 
2 for	the	next	year ,	and	the	pattern	will 3 continue	- -	the	pattern	continues	to	show	real 4 estate	tax	increases	over	the	next	four	or	five 5 years .6 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	Right .7 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Barring	nothing 8 else ,	how	is	that	going	to	impact	your 9 budgeting	or	your	modeling	or the	forecast	for 10 your	properties ?11 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	Well ,	it ' s12 a	very	important	question .	It ' s	going	to be	a13 disaster	for	a	lot	of	owners .14 You	are	talking	about	thirty - five 15 percent	of	the	budget	now	going	- -	of	the 16 building ' s	budget	now	going	for	City	payment ,17 payments	to	the	City ,	primarily	taxes .	That ' s18 going	to	rise	to fifty	percent	in	no	time .19 You	know ,	one	of	the	things	the	City 20 would	do ,	if	it were	serious	about	maintaining 21 affordable	housing ,	is	to	freeze	taxes	on 22 affordable	housing .23 You	know ,	the	members	of	CHIP 24 collectively ,	if you	took	them	together , they 25 provide	more	affordable	housing	to	this	City 2 
2 than	NYCHA	and	then	the	Section	8	program	or 3 then	the	Mitchell - Lama	program .	We	provide	much 4 more .5 And	these	are	the	people	you	need	to 6 preserve	and	support .	All	right ?7 And	if	taxes	keep	increasing	- -	you 8 know ,	we ' re	just	acting	as	the	collection	agent 9 for	the	City .	It ' s	an	ingenious	program . We ' re 10 just	a	collection	agent .	We ' re	not	imposing 11 these	fees .	They ' re	imposed	on	us .	And	then ,12 you	know ,	it	places	a	burden	on	us	that	gets 13 passed	along	to the	tenant , you	know ,	and	- -14 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Well ,	the	burden	is 15 placed	on	you	whether	you	collect	it	from	the 16 tenant .17 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	Whether	we 18 collect	it	or	not ,	we	have	to pay	that	amount .19 And	you	can	see	yourself ,	you	can 20 see	in	the	statistics ,	that	non - compliance	with 21 those	payments	is - -	and	you ' re	telling	me	it ' s22 almost	doubling	in	one	year .23 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Yes .24 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	That ' s25 amazing .2 
2 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	do	realize	-3 not	to	defend ,	you	know ,	the	City	Council	-4 they	really	don ' t	have	the	power	to	freeze	the 5 taxes	consistent	with	State	law .6 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	I7 understand	that .8 But	it ' s	not	as if ,	as	a	society ,9 we ' re without	- -10 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Correct . But	the 11 City	can ' t	do	it .	The	point	I ' m	trying	to make 12 is	that	the	City	cannot	do	it .	The	State	law 13 that	governs	real	property	taxation	- -14 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	No .15 But	you	have	a role	here	which	is	to 16 pass	that	on	in its	full	effect	because	that	is 17 not	something	we can	control .	That ' s	your 18 responsibility .19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Well ,	I think	- -20 MR . SCHLEIDER :	That ' s	right .21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	we	have	a	role 22 here	which	is	to ,	quote	unquote ,	deal	with	it 23 and	perhaps	pass	it	on	in	parcel	or	full 24 effect .25 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	We ' re	just 2 
2 a	collection	agent .	That ' s	all	we	are .3 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	We	understand 4 that .	We	understand	that	for	those	purposes .5 MR . SCHLEIDER :	You ' re	more	than 6 the	collection	agent .	You ' re the	collection 7 agent	with	the	responsibility	for	a	shortfall .8 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	Right .9 It ' s	like	no	place	else	in the 10 world .11 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Well ,	it depends 12 on	what	you	- -	obviously ,	- -13 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Property	taxes	are 14 due	- -15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	if	the	building 16 has	a	shortfall	- -17 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- -	whether	you	get 18 it	from	the	tenant	or	not .19 MR . PATRICK	SICONOLFI :	If you	give 20 us	the	high	raise	- -21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Taxes	are	due ,22 but	shortfall ,	you	know ,	there ' s	more	money 23 than	just	the	taxes .	So	what	you	choose	not	to 24 pay	is	in	the	owner ' s	discretion .25 Anyway	- -2 
 2 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Twenty	percent	of 3 housing	is	distressed .4 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Mr .	Whitmore ,5 Dave	Whitmore .6 Thank	you ,	Mr . Siconolfi .7 ( Applause . )8 MR . DAVID	WHITMORE :	Good	morning ,9 Members	of	the	Rent	Guidelines	Board .10 My name	is	David	Whitmore	and	I	am	a11 small	property	owner	and	the	managing	agent	for 12 other	small	property	owners	in	Brooklyn .13 I ' m here	before	you	today	to	plead 14 my	case	on	two	eight - unit	rent - regulated 15 properties	in	Park	Slope ,	Brooklyn	whose	rent 16 increases ,	in	comparison	to the	increased 17 expenses ,	continue	to	run	in the	negative .18 In 2007 ,	the	water / sewer	charges	for 19 my	7 th	Street	property	were	$ 1504 .	In	2008 ,	the 20 water	charges	cost	me	$ 3627 , thereby	showing	a21 dollar	cost	increase	of	$ 2123	difference	from 22	2007	to		2008 .23 For	the	same	property	in	2007 ,	the 24 real	estate	charges	were	$ 10 , 602 ,	and	in 2008 25 the	charges	were	$ 10 , 943 ,	again	showing	a23 
 2 dollar	cost	increase	from	2007	to	2008	of $ 340 .3 In total ,	for	the	2008	period ,	said 4 water / sewer	charges	and	real	estate	tax 5 increases	combined	came	to	$ 2463	more	than	they 6 did	for	2007 .7 On the	rent	increase	side	for	2008 ,8 this	property ' s rent	increases	totaled	$ 2372 9 more	than	in	2007 .	Said	2008	increase	showed	to 10 be	$ 91	less	than	the	increased	cost	of	just	the 11 water	and	sewer	and	real	estate	taxes	for	the 12 same	period	for	this	building .13 In 2007 ,	the	water / sewer	charges	for 14 my	8 th	Street	eight - unit	property	were	$ 2256 .15 In	2008 ,	the	same	property ' s water / sewer 16 charges	totaled	$ 4816 ,	a	dollar	cost	increase 17 of	$ 2560	over	the	previous	year .18 For	the	same	property	the	2007	real 19 estate	tax	payment	was	$ 12 , 914 ,	while	in 2008 20 the	real	estate	payment	was	$ 13 , 430 ,	an 21 increased	dollar	cost	of	$ 516 .22 Combining	both	the	water / sewer 23 charges	and	the	real	estate	payments	for	2008 24 in	comparison	to the	2007	dollar	costs	were 25	$ 3076	more .2 
2 On the	income	side	for	2008	for	the 3 8 th Street	property	income	from	rent	increases 4 totaled	$ 1964 .	Said	increases	were	$ 1112	less 5 than	the	expenses	incurred	from	just	the 6 water / sewer	charges	and	real	estate	tax 7 payments	for	the	same	year .8 I	have	not	even	listed	the	increased 9 charges	for	the	fuel	costs , electrical	costs ,10 increased	supply	costs	as	well	as	labor	costs 11 for	these	properties	during	the	same	period .12 The	Rent	Guidelines	Board	every	year 13 undertakes	a	Price	Index	of Operating	Costs 14 study ,	known	as PIOC ,	as	a	guide	for	that 15 year ' s	rent	increases	to	be set	for	the 16 regulated	rents	citywide .17 However ,	it	amazes	me	why	year	after 18 year	the	RGB	ignores	its	own	independent	owner 19 data	and	only	allows	for	rent	increases	of 20 approximately	half	of	what	its	own	numbers 21 state	should	be the	minimum	increase	for	the 22 year	in	question .23 Just	since	2003	through	2007 ,	the 24 RGB	one - year	guideline	increases	totaled	twenty 25 percent	while	their	PIOC	showed	to	support	a2 
2 figure	of	40 . 9	percent .	The	RGB	has	thereby 3 only	allowed	property	owners	a	tad	less	than 4 half	of	its	operating	costs	to	be	recovered .5 Like	any	business ,	we	need	to	show	a6 profit	in	order	to	improve	our	properties	which 7 will	improve	the	standard	of living	for	those 8 residents	residing	there .9 Our	core	income	is	the	monthly	rent 10 from	the	residents .	Slowly	the	rent	increases 11 set	forth	by	this	Board	are	greatly	assisting 12 in	the	further	decaying	of	our	buildings 13 because	we	do	not	have	the	continued	adequate 14 income	to	keep	up with	the	needed	expenses	and 15 improvements	of our	aged	buildings	as	even	your 16 own	data	shows	we need	to	obtain .17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	need	to	wrap 18 up .19 MR . DAVID	WHITMORE :	At	the	very 20 least ,	give	us	the	7 . 8	percent	for	a	one - year 21 increase	as	your	own	data	shows	is	just , and	an 22 additional	fair	increase	for	those	desiring	a23 two - year	lease	renewal .24 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .25 Let	me	ask	you	a	question .2 
2 MR . DAVID	WHITMORE :	Sure .3 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	What	do you 4 attribute	- -	I	mean	we ' ve	heard	a	lot	of sort 5 of	gross	numbers	on	the	water	and	sewer	side .6 What	do	you	attribute	the ,	what	I ' ll	say	is 7 above	norm	jumps	in	water	on your	two 8 buildings ?9 MR . DAVID	WHITMORE :	I ' ve pondered 10 that	myself .	These	buildings	down	here	in Park 11 Slope ,	or	I	should	say	the	area	in	general ,	are 12 known	to	have	a lot	of	young	people	living 13 together ,	cohabitating .14 These	particular	buildings	are	seven 15 and	eight - room	apartments .16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Seven	and 17 eight - room	apartments ?18 MR . DAVID	WHITMORE :	Yes . Each 19 apartment	is	seven	and	eight	rooms .20 So there ' s	a	number	of	young	people 21 down	there	that	are	taking	friends	and	taking 22 others	to	live	with	them	with	which	to	enjoy	a23 cheaper	rent	amongst	themselves .24 So that ' s	the	only	way	I	can 25 attribute	why	the	water	is	being	used	as much 2 
2 as	it is	from	one	year	to	the	next	because ,	as 3 one	roommate	moves	out ,	they	may	take	two	or 4 three	more	in	with	which	to help	the	rent .5 Because	I	find	that	it ' s	an 6 abnormity .	My	other	properties	I	don ' t	have 7 this	as	I ' m	having	here .	The	other	properties 8 are	larger .9 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Right .	Okay .10 Question .11 MS . ADAMS :	Question .12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Go	ahead .13 MS . ADAMS :	How	many	tenants	roughly 14 do	you	have	or	how	many	units ?15 MR . DAVID	WHITMORE :	I	manage	six 16 hundred	but	I	don ' t	own	six	hundred .	I ' m a17 property	manager .18 MS . ADAMS :	Units .19 MR . DAVID	WHITMORE :	Six	hundred .20 Most	of	them	co - ops	and	condos .21 MS . ADAMS :	Okay .22 Do you	know	of those	how	many	took 23 one - year	leases	last	year ?24 MR . DAVID	WHITMORE :	Well , in	the 25 co - ops	and	condos	it	doesn ' t come	into	play .2 
2 Historically ,	anywhere	from	forty	to 3 fifty	percent	of my	rents	turn	over	from	year 4 to	year .5 MR . SCHLEIDER :	That ' s	consistent 6 with	our	ratios .7 MS . HOLDER :	And	when	they	turn 8 over ,	you	take	the	vacancy	increase ?9 MR . DAVID	WHITMORE :	No ,	no .	I	mean 10 turnover	is	when	a	lease	expires	and	is 11 renewed .12 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .	Thank	you .14 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr .	Chair ?15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Yes .	Go ahead .16 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr .	Whitmore ,	thank 17 you	for	very	testimony .18 For	the	- -	well ,	for	your	whole 19 portfolio	of	buildings	that	you	manage , when	do 20 you	typically	purchase	fuel	oil	for	heat ?21 MR . DAVID	WHITMORE :	Well ,22 previously	we	had	gone	into	contracts	with 23 various	fuel	oil	companies . But	because	of	the 24 unsettleness	in the	fuel	industry	we	have	not 25 been	able	to	lock	in	a	good	price	because	the 2 
2 prices	they	offer	you	are	extremely	higher	than 3 what	you	could	be paying	today .	So	we	end	up 4 paying	as	we	need .5 MR . SCHLEIDER :	As	you	need .	Okay .6 MR . DAVID	WHITMORE :	Yes .7 MR . SCHLEIDER :	So	which	months 8 would	you	be	doing	your	bulk	purchasing	then ?9 MR . DAVID	WHITMORE :	Oh ,	from 10 December	through	March .11 MR . SCHLEIDER :	December	through 12 March .13 Okay .	Thank	you .14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .15 MR . DAVID	WHITMORE :	Thank	you .16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Larry	Wood .17 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	Good	morning !18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Hold	on one 19 second .20 Ed Korman	will	follow	Mr .	Wood ;21 Then	Matt	Shotkin ;22 Then	Krystyna	Piorkowska ;23 Then	Richard	Steiger ;24 And	then	Hal	Brill .25 Okay .	Go	ahead .2 
2 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	Thank	you .3 I	just	want	to say	thank	you	to	all 4 of	the	Guideline	Board	Members ,	which	is my 5 tradition .	I	just	want	to	thank	you	for	your 6 service .	I	also	appreciate	the	fact	that	many 7 of	you	have	been	on	for	many	years	because	that 8 institutional	memory	is	very	helpful	as we	go 9 through	all	of	this	stuff .10 Again ,	I	know	it ' s	not	a	sham	and 11 you	guys	really	do	deliberate .	I	don ' t	think 12 it ' s always	appreciated	by	everybody	who	comes 13 to	these	guideline	hearings .14 And	I	also	appreciate	the	attempts 15 that	you ' ve	tried	to	think	outside	the	box	with 16 the	provisos ,	with	other	attempts	to	adjust	- -17 come	up	with	a	guideline	that	wasn ' t	a18 one - size - fits - all .19 I guess ,	as	you	know ,	we	are	taking 20 a	different	approach	on	behalf	of	the	SRO 21 tenants	in	hotels .	We	are	asking	a	return	to 22 the	one - size - fits - all	guideline .	And	I ' ll speak 23 to	why	in	a	moment .24 Just	to	reiterate ,	in	terms	of	the 25 universe	of	SROs ,	there	were	165 , 000	units	of 2 
2 SRO	housing	in	' 71 .	The	Blackburn	Study	in 3 1986 ,	we	were	down	to	65 , 000	units .	So	100 , 000 4 units	or	two - thirds	of	the	stock	were 5 demolished	or	converted	over	that	period .6 Our	current	estimates	are	somewhere 7 between	25 , 000	and	30 , 000	units	left .	Some 8 significant	number	are	operated	by	non - profits 9 who	have	acquired	these	properties	over	the 10 years	to	preserve	them	as	affordable	housing .11 But	unless	you	are	acquired	by	a	non - profit ,12 the	pressures	for	those	owners	to	come	up with 13 other	uses ,	other	profitable	uses	-	renting	out 14 to	college	students ,	special	needs	populations ,15 tourists	-	I	know	you ' ve	heard	that	testimony 16 before	about	this	and	this	is still	a	trend .17 We know	you ' ve made	some	valid 18 attempts	to	finetune	the	adjustment	for	the 19 hotels	based	on the	five	different	categories 20 of	SROs .	There	have	been	different	guidelines 21 for	the	different	size	buildings	over	the 22 years .23 And	then	the	provisos ,	I	think ,	also 24 were	very	valid	attempts	looking	at	the 25 different	economics	that	occurred	in	different 2 
2 buildings	and	where	a	rent	increase	was 3 warranted	and	where	it	wasn ' t .4 This	year ,	though ,	as	I	said 5 earlier ,	we	are	seeking	a	straight	zero 6 across - the - board	and	foregoing	the	provisos .7 And	it ' s	based	on several	considerations	for 8 us .9 One	which	we ' ve mentioned	is	the 10 difficulty	in	enforcing	the	provisos .	It ' s	an 11 enormous	amount	of	time	and	energy	spent	on 12 trying	to	count	how	many	units	-	you ' re trying 13 to	get	to	eighty	percent	or eighty - five	percent 14 -	how	many	units	are	warehoused ,	are	used	as ,15 for	tourist	rentals	or	not .16 It ' s	not	that	hard	when	you	have	a17 building	with	twenty	permanent	tenants	and ,	you 18 know ,	two	hundred	units	that	are	deregulated .19 It ' s the	buildings	that	are	on	the	cusp	that 20 makes	it	extraordinarily	difficult .21 We also	believe ,	based	on	the	June 22 4 th memo	that	the	staff	produced	for	the	Rent 23 Guidelines	Board ,	there ' s	a lot	of	information 24 in	there	that	kind	of	bears	out	our	request 25 this	year .2 
2 One ,	there ' s	only	144	buildings	that 3 contain	- -	I	guess	the	first	thing	I	want	to 4 note	about	the	data	is	that	we	found	almost 5 thirty	additional	buildings	and	7 , 000 6 additional	SRO	units .	The	data	in	2005	was 7 under	16 , 000	units	were	stabilized ;	in	2008 8 we ' re closer	to 23 , 000 .9 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	need	to	wrap 10 up , Larry .11 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	Okay .12 I	would	entertain	some	questions	on 13 the	other	reasons	we	are	putting	forth	for	why 14 it	should	be	a	zero	increase	this	year .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You ' ve	got	the 16 system	figured	out ,	heh ?	You ' ll	entertain	some 17 questions .18 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr .	Chair ?19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Go	ahead .20 Are	you	going	to	entertain	us	too ?21 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Why	not !22 Mr . Wood	- -	so , you	said	there	are 23 144	buildings	that	contain	SRO	units	plus	this 24 additional	thirty	buildings	that	you	were	able 25 to	uncover .2 
2 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	No .	There	was	a3 greater	number .4 The	144	is	the	buildings	that	would 5 be	eligible	for	an	increase	based	on	last 6 year ' s	proviso . And	that	represents	about	less 7 than	twenty - five	percent	of the	units .	So 8 seventy - five	percent	of	the	units	would	not	be 9 eligible	for	an RGB	increase	based	on	last 10 year ' s	proviso .11 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Right .	Okay .12 So how	many	buildings	are	there	that 13 contain	SRO	units ?	Do	you	have	that	figure ?14 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	Well ,	based	on	the 15 data	that	was	- - this	is	self - reported , but 16 there ' s	472	buildings	that	were	reported	to 17 DHCR	containing	22 , 827	rent	stabilized	units .18 We believe	there ' s	an 19 underreporting . And	that ' s	not	audited	or 20 anything .	But	that ' s	the	best	data	we	have .21 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right .22 And	you	do	good	work	and	I ' ve	told 23 you	this	many	times .24 How	many	of	those	four	hundred	and 25 somewhat	buildings	would	you	say	would	have	a2 
2 - -	are	lucky	enough	to	have	someone	like 3 yourself	to	represent	those	tenants ,	- -4 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	Well ,	- -5 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- -	to	be	an 6 advocate	for	those	tenants	- -7 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	No ,	I	understand 8 your	question .9 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- -	or	to	work	with 10 those	tenants ?11 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	It ' s	a	fraction	of 12 the	buildings ,	to be	honest	with	you .	It ' s13 triage	for	us	in terms	of	the	cases	that	can	be 14 taken .	And	because	of	budget	cuts ,	there ' s	only 15 two	organizers	on staff	at	the	West	Side	SRO 16 Law	Project	and	three	attorneys	currently .	So 17 it ' s even	more	of a	triage , dealing	with 18 holdovers	or	building - wide	situations .	And 19 we ' re only	assisting	those	folks	in	Manhattan .20 About	a	third	of the	stock	is outside	of 21 Manhattan .22 They	might	be	assisted	by	MFY	or	in 23 some	cases	by	another	Legal	Aid	Office . But 24 it ' s only	a	fraction	of	the	tenants .	More 25 tenants	go	without	representation	in	Housing 2 
2 Court	by	far	than	do .3 MR . SCHLEIDER :	And	even	though 4 this	Board	has	been	increasing	the	threshold 5 under	the	proviso ,	you	still	think	that	is	not 6 enough ?7 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	Well ,	at this 8 point	with	the	proviso	at	eighty - five	percent ,9 three - quarters	of the	stock	would	not	be 10 eligible	for	the	increase .11 I	believe	if	returning	to	a12 one - size - fits - all	increase , I	think	an	argument 13 could	be	made	that	a	zero	guideline 14 across - the - board	would	be	fair .15 If you	look	at the	buildings ,	the 16 other	thing	about	the	June	4 th	memo	is , if	you 17 look	at	the	ends	- -18 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Historically ,	if 19 you	look	at	what	the	Board	has	proffered	for 20 increases	for	those	SRO	units ,	you	will	see 21 that	recently	there	have	been	zero	percent 22 increases .23 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	Well ,	last	year 24 was	the	highest	increase	we ' ve	had	in	over 25 twenty	years .2 
2 MR . SCHLEIDER :	I	would	say	forget 3 last	year ;	the	year	before	that ,	the	year 4 before	that ,	the	year	before	that .5 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	Yes .6 But	there	had	been	zero	some	years 7 and	there ' s	been	a	minor	increase	with	the 8 provisos .9 MR . SCHLEIDER :	So	the	Board	is	not 10 insensitive	to	the	plight	of the	SRO	tenants .11 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	No .	I	say	we 12 appreciate	that	and	that ' s	certainly	why	I13 thank	you	guys	for	your	service	- -14 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Thank	you .15 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	- -	and	for 16 listening .17 MR . SCHLEIDER :	But	as	last	year 18 showed ,	and	I	believe	this	year	shows	too ,19 there	are	circumstances	that	may	require	some 20 sort	of	increase .21 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	Well ,	I	think 22 what ' s	interesting	about	the	June	4 th	memo ,	the 23 average	mean	and	median	rents	for	those 24 buildings	that	are	eighty - five	percent	or more 25 stabilized	are	very	high .2 
 2 In fact ,	I	was	struck	by	they	are 3 much	higher	outside	of	Manhattan	than	in 4 Manhattan ,	which	is	obviously	different	for 5 apartment	buildings .6 In fact ,	the	- -7 MR . SCHLEIDER :	It	shows	then	that 8 those	buildings	are	being ,	if I ' m	hearing	you 9 correctly ,	used	for	the	SRO	program	rather	than 10 as	transient	hotels .11 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	Well ,	I	think	the 12 smaller	rooming	houses	and	for	the	most	part 13 the	buildings	outside	of	Manhattan	tend	to	be 14	- -15 MR . SCHLEIDER :	They	are	still 16 being	used	as	their	intended	purpose .17 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	That ' s	right .18 And	they ' re	collecting ,	Staten 19 Island	$ 900	for	a	room ,	Queens	$ 924 ,	Manhattan 20	is	$ 555 .21 MR . SCHLEIDER :	But	they	are	still 22 being	used	for	their	intended	purpose .	They	are 23 not	being	used	as transient	hotels .24 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	Right .	And	I	think 25 they ' re	quite	profitable .21 

23	But	- - 45
MR . SCHLEIDER :	You	don ' t	know	that .MR . LARRY	WOOD :	Well ,	- -MR . SCHLEIDER :	- -	they	are	still 
6 being	used	for	their	intended	purpose .7 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	- -	I	think	if	you 8 look	at	the	mean	and	median	rents	and	you	look 9 at	the	jump	also	from	2005	data	to	currently ,10 the	registered	rents	are	actually	much	higher 11 than	the	actual	rent	collected .12 So for	some	reason	there ' s a13 preferential	rent	in	place . So	if	you	granted 14 an	increase ,	the	registered	stabilized	rent	may 15 go	up but	the	actual	rent	they ' re	collecting 16 may	not .17 MR . SCHLEIDER :	So	these	landlords 18 then ,	rather	than	transfer	these	units	into	a19 transient	hotel	type	of	situation ,	are	electing 20 to	house	the	SRO	population	at	rents	that	are 21 below	what	they	could	legally	collect .22 Maybe	they	can ' t	collect	those	legal 23 rents	under	SRO	conditions . Maybe	they	could 24 under	a	transient	hotel	situation .25 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	And	I	think	- -6 
2MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	I ' m	hearing 3from you	is	that	these	owners	still	elect	to 4stay in	the	system .5MR . LARRY	WOOD :	Yes .6I	mean	obviously	some	- -7MR . SCHLEIDER :	Thank	you .8MR . LARRY	WOOD :	- -	do .9Betty ?10MS . ADAMS :	Yes .11Thank	you	for	your	testimony .12Is there	anything	else	you	would 13like to	share	with	this	Board	about	the	zero 14 percent	increase	that	you ' re recommending ?15 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	Well ,	I	guess	just 16 to	underscore	that	point	that	for	the	- - I	know 17 there	is	a	concern	about	the	buildings	that	are 18 still	operating	as	rent	stabilized	buildings ,19 and	if	we	don ' t give	them	an increase ,	is this 20 going	to	hasten	their	departure	from	the 21 system .22 I	don ' t	believe	that ' s	the	case .	I23 think	a	zero	guideline	is	warranted	this	year .24 There	was	a	significant	increase	granted	last 25 year .	The	average	rents	that	are	being 14 
2 collected	in	these	buildings	are	quite	high 3 relative	to	apartment	buildings	on	a	square 4 foot	basis .	Both	the	rent	collected	is	high ,5 much	higher	than	apartment	buildings .	The 6 operating	costs	on	a	square	foot	basis	is much 7 cheaper	than	a	comparable	apartment .8 And	those	rents	outside	- - I	think	a9 lot	of	the	rooming	houses	outside	of	Manhattan 10 really	operate	outside	the	rent	regulated 11 system .	People	largely	don ' t know	they	are	in 12 stabilized	units .13 And	the	jump	in the	rents	where	the 14 stabilized	rent	is	well	over	$ 1000	according	to 15 this	data	just	strikes	me	as - -	you	know ,	they 16 are	collecting	pretty	good	rents	and	I	believe 17 they	are	really	maintaining	those	properties .18 So for	a	variety	of	reasons	I	think 19 a	zero	increase	is	fair	this	year ,	you	know ,20 across - the - board ,	particularly	around	the 21 enforcement .22 And	I	think	the	key	thing	though	is 23 that	the	buildings	are	making	money .	A	majority 24 of	owners	are	doing	quite	well	and	an	increase 25 is	not	warranted .2 
2 In addition ,	they ' re	not	down	here .3 I	mean	that	always	strikes	me as	if	this	really 4 was	something	that	affected	their	buildings ,	it 5 was	important	to them ,	SRO	owners	would	come 6 out . And	I	think	you	had	one	over	the	last 7 couple	of	years .8 So if	they	really	needed	it ,	they 9 would	be	here .10 You	do	hear	from	the	tenants .	They 11 do	really	need	relief .	And	I think	this	is	the 12 year	to	give	it .13 MS . ADAMS :	Thank	you	very	much .14 MS . CRUZ :	Mr . Chairman ?15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Another	question .16 ( Applause . )17 MS . CRUZ :	Mr . Woods ,	I ' d like	to 18 just	understand	why	you	believe	a	zero	increase 19 would	cause	a	private	property	owner	to want	to 20 continue	to	rent	out	to	SRO	tenants	as	opposed 21 to	transitioning	that	housing	to	another	more 22 profitable	means .23 I	want	to	understand	- -24 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	Sure .25 MS . CRUZ :	- -	exactly	why	you	think 2 

2	that .3
MR . LARRY	WOOD :	The	bulk	of 
4 buildings	and	units	are	already	going	that 5 route .	It ' s	a	minority	of	buildings	that	are 6 still	being	used	under	just	stabilized	units .7 There	is	no	guideline	that	you	are 8 going	to	be	able	to	grant	that ' s	going	to stop 9 the	historic	trends	that	we ' ve	been	seeing 10 since	the	' 70 s . It ' s	just	not	reality	to think 11 that	you	could	give	a	guideline	that	is going 12 to	keep	these	units	stabilized .13 The	smaller	buildings	outside	of 14 Manhattan ,	I	think	they ' re	doing	well	anyway .15 And	if	they	are	not	collecting	the	stabilized 16 rents	that	they	are	potentially	entitled	to ,	I17 think	there ' s	a limit	to	how	much	someone	is 18 going	to	pay	for	a	single	room ,	you	know ,	in	a19 rooming	house .20 So I	think	if	they	could	collect 21 more	rent ,	they	would .	There	are	preferential 22 rents	out	there	already .23 So I	don ' t	think	it	matters	what	you 24 do	here ,	to	be	honest	with	you ,	to	a	lot	of 25 these	buildings .4 
2 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .3 MR . LARRY	WOOD :	Thank	you .4 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	The	next	speaker 5 is	Ed Korman	from	SPONY .6 Mr . Korman .7 MR . ED	KORMAN :	Good	morning ,	Mr .8 Chairman ,	Members	of	the	Board .9 My name	is	Ed	Korman .	I ' m	the 10 Executive	Vice	President	of Small	Property 11 Owners	of	New	York ,	also	known	as	SPONY .12 You	have	heard	and	will	continue	to 13 hear	from	owners ,	mostly	small	owners ,	about 14 rising	costs	from	fuel ,	repairs ,	and	both	real 15 estate	taxes	and	water .16 The	City	depends	on	our	real	estate 17 taxes	to	pay	for	City	workers ,	but	we ,	as 18 owners ,	are	workers	also .	Where	is	our	salary ?19 Why	are	we	always	begrudged	every	penny	we	earn 20 when	it ' s	less	than	some	of the	salaries	that 21 not - for - profit	employees	get ?22 There	are	many	small	houses	that 23 still	have	rents	in	the	$ 600	and	$ 700	range 24 which	cannot	sustain	these	rising	costs . All 25 these	increases	in	taxes ,	water ,	fuel ,	et 2 
2 cetera	are	killing	the	small	owners .3 You	must	re - establish	the	low - rent 4 adjustment .	It ' s not	a	poor	tax .	It ' s	an 5 equalization	process .6 You	passed	it	last	year ,	but	many 7 tenants	have	two - year	leases	and	were	not	given 8 this	adjustment . It	should	be passed	again	this 9 year .10 We all	have	to share	the	burden	of 11 rising	fuel	and	maintenance	costs .	Vendors	and 12 government	pass	the	increases	on	to	us . We 13 can ' t	pay	the	increases	unless	we	get	some	of 14 them	passed	on	to the	tenants .15 Speaker	Quinn , quoted	in	the	paper ,16 said :	So	owners	will	make	a little	less . The 17 problem	is	less	means	no	bottomline	or	a red 18 line .	If	some	owners	make	any	less ,	they	will 19 not	be	able	to	get	another	job	to	support	their 20 buildings ,	or	they	could	be out	in	the	streets 21 as	well .22 Another	quote	from	the	City	person :23 This	is	disgraceful .24 Last	year ,	the	Rent	Guidelines	Board 25 set	the	low - rent	adjustment	at	$ 85 . 00	for	two 2 
2 years	and	$ 45 . 00 for	a	one - year	lease .	This 3 amount	should	remain	the	same	to	equalize	these 4 tenants	with	two - year	leases	who	did	not	have 5 the	increase .6 Rents	above	$ 1000	could	increase	as 7 per	the	guidelines .8 Rent	control	has	a	fuel	charge .9 Perhaps	it	could	be	considered	for 10 stabilization .11 There	are	a	lot	of	good	owners	out 12 there	that	care	for	their	tenants ,	but	it seems 13 that	some	elected	officials	only	want	to have 14 tenants	live	for	nothing .15 We all	need	to share	the	cost ,	not 16 just	the	small	owners .17 If the	Administration	does	not	think 18 about	the	' 70 s	or ' 80 s ,	they	better	open	up 19 their	eyes	because	they	are	coming	back	if 20 they ' re	not	already	back	in some	neighborhoods .21 This	will	continue	to	be	the	cause 22 of	the	deterioration	and	loss	of	fine 23 buildings ,	homelessness	and	unaffordable 24 housing ,	mostly	in	the	six	to fifteen - family 25 range	which	are	owned	and	maintained	by small 2 
2 owners ,	mom	and	pops ,	and	newly - migrated 3 families	that	have	saved	and	saved	to	be able 4 to	own	a	piece	of this	wonderful	City .5 Many	of	them	now	are	losing	their 6 homes	and	their	investments .7 Needy	tenants	have	subsidies .	Others 8 have	jobs	working	off	the	books	and	also	get 9 subsidy .	It ' s	why	owners	will	not	take	these 10 tenants .	No	one	cares	about	tenants	with	more 11 than	one	identity .	I	can	give	you	plenty	of 12 them .13 Many	owners	are	starting	to sell	off 14 their	buildings . Unfortunately	for	the	tenants ,15 the	only	ones	that	are	able	to	buy	these	are 16 foreign	developers	with	all	the	cash .17 Do you	know	what	they ' re	doing	to 18 housing ?	Have	you	read	the	newspapers ?19 When	they	get	through	with	the 20 housing	industry ,	there	will	be	nothing	but 21only the rich	and	the	projects	left .22( Applause . )23CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .24Any	questions ?25MS . CRUZ :	Mr . Korman ,	- -
2 MR . ED	KORMAN :	Yes .3 MS . CRUZ :	- -	could	you	give	us	an 4 idea	about	the	amount	of	members	that	are	part 5 of	your	organization ?6 MR . ED	KORMAN :	Approximately	a7 thousand .8 MS . CRUZ :	And	approximately	how 9 many	buildings	would	they	- -10 MR . ED	KORMAN :	They	could	own	from 11 like	say	maybe	one	to	three	or	four .	And	they 12 are	small .	They	are	like	six - family ,	some 13 three - family .	Could	go	up	to fifteen	families .14 MS . CRUZ :	And	their	buildings	are 15 in	what	areas	of the	City ?16 MR .

ADAMS :	Just	one	clarification .21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Sure .22 MS . ADAMS :	Did	I	understand	you	in 23 answering	her	to say	that	most	of	the	buildings 24 were	three	or	four	units ?25 MR . ED	KORMAN :	No .	I	said	some	are 2 
2 three	and	four , sixes ,	up	to fifteen .	There ' s	a3 variety	of	the	sizes .4 MS . HOLDER :	How	many	are	rent 5 stabilized ?6 MR . ED	KORMAN :	I	would	think	the 7 majority	of	them .8 And	may	I	say	what	the	gentleman 9 before	me	said , many	of	them	have	registered 10 rents	and	a	lot	of	them	are	getting 11 preferential	rents	just	to	maintain	the 12 tenants .13 There	are	good	tenants	out	there ,14 but	there	are	tenants	that	do destroy	our 15 buildings	which	are	causing	us	to	spend	a	lot 16 of	our	money	that	we	could	use	for	other	things 17 and	that	we	could	earn	as	a living	to	pay	for 18 the	damage .19 And	I	could	substantiate	this .	And 20 if	you	would	really	want	to see ,	I ' ll	spend 21 some	time	with	you	and	show	you	hundreds	of 22 pictures	of	what	they	did .23 I	just	had	one	building ,	thirteen 24 families ,	where	I	had	a	drug	situation . And 25 then ,	you	know , you	have	a	variety	of	people 2 
2 that	stick	with	these	people .3 I	had	six	apartments	vacant	since 4 September .	I	just	rented	them	now .5 ( Audience	participation . )6 MS . HOLDER :	He ' s	answering 7 questions	for	us .8 You	said	that	some	of	them	have 9 preferential	rents .	So	what	does	an	increase	do 10 for	those	landlords	who	are	- -11 MR . ED	KORMAN :	Well ,	in	my case 12 what	I	do	is	I	give	- -	when	a	lease	comes	up ,13 whatever	guidelines	you	are	going	to	impose	now 14 will	increase	my registered	rents	to	whatever 15 the	legal	thing	is .	And	then	I	will	go	to the 16 tenant	and	say , well ,	if	the	registered	rent	is 17 $ 1300	for	argument	sake ,	and	the	person	now	is 18 paying	$ 1100	or $ 900	or	whatever ,	and	I have	a19 couple	that	are	paying	$ 600 , about	three	or 20 four	of	those ,	that	haven ' t had	an	increase 21 because	their	leases	expire	this	year	rather 22 than	last	year , and	if	it ' s a	tenant	that	we 23 have	a	good	relationship ,	they	care	for	their 24 building	and	for	their	neighbors ,	I	don ' t	take 25 the	maximum	that	we	are	allowed .2 

23	$ 85 . 00 .45	Ed .6
I ' ll	say ,	you	know ,	we ' re	allowed Well ,	I	can	only	afford	$ 50 or	$ 60 ,I	say :	So ,	fine .	So	we	make	some 
7 kind	of	arrangement .8 But	it ' s	getting	really	tough	on	us .9 And	the	City	has	no	regard	for	the	tenants	nor 10 for	us	owners .	They ' re	just	hitting	us .11 Like	they	just	hit	us	for	a fourteen 12 percent	asking	water	charge .13 Why ?14 Because	the	money	has	to	go 15 somewhere	else ?16 So they	gave	us 12 . 9 .17 Do have	any	idea	what	impact	that 18 is ?19 And	somebody	else	quoted	before	that 20 the	seven	and	eight	bedrooms ,	I	have	two	and 21 three - bedroom	apartments	where	I	have	double - up 22 and	triple - up .23 Oh , it	don ' t	cost	anymore .24 It doesn ' t	really ,	except	for	the 25 wear	and	tear ,	the	amount	of water	that	they 7 
2 use	and	the	fuels	that	they	use	to	heat	the 3 water .4 MS . HOLDER :	And	so	what	would	you 5 suggest	or	what	does	SPONY	talk	about	in terms 6 of	reforms ?	Because	I	hear	what	you	are	saying .7 You	are	saying	that	owners	and	tenants	are 8 being	hit	and	not	being	properly	supported	by 9 government .	What	things	are	you	all	working	on 10 as	an organization	to	try	to get	some	relief ?11 MR . ED	KORMAN :	Well	- -	well ,	as 12 you	know	what ' s going	on	in Albany ,	that	they 13 want	to	take	back	everything	that	they	gave .14 And	I	think	if	they	do ,	it ' s going	to	hurt	the 15 City	itself	because	- -	excuse	me	- -	because ,	as 16 I	just	mentioned	to	you	and	described	to you ,17 that	we	don ' t	get	all	of	the	increases	that 18 we ' re entitled	to .19 Eventually ,	maybe	my	children	or	my 20 grandchildren ,	if I	can	get	and	keep	raising 21 the	rents	legally	and	get	over	the	threshold	to 22 free	market	the	apartments , of	which	I	have 23 some	that	were	over	$ 2000	because	I	had	to	put 24 a	ton	of	money	into	them	and	I	was	entitled	to 25 raise	the	- -	increase	1 / 40 th ,	and	I	have	some 2 
2   nice working people where the rents are over  3   $ 2000 , I ' m only getting $ 1000 , $ 1150 , $ 1200 , 4  $ 900 .5 So we are trying to save what   we 6 have and be able to afford to give our   tenants 7 decent housing .8 And , unfortunately , the 9 administration really doesn ' t see it . They ' re 10 only	looking	one	way .11 MS . HOLDER :	Thank	you .12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .13 Matt	Shotkin .14 MR . MATT	SHOTKIN :	Good	morning ,15 Mr . Chairman .16 Mr .

2 This	will	allow	people	like	myself ,3 the	people	living	in	the	apartments	that	we 4 currently	live	in ,	and	also	assist	residential 5 Section	8	housing .6 In today ' s	AM	New	York	on	page	3	it 7 says	that	people	like	myself ,	who	have	constant 8 one - year	leases	with	constant	lease	extensions ,9 have	a	4 . 5	percent	increase . And	according	to 10 tenant	Incolino	( phonetic )	on the	back	page	it 11 says	that	Chairman	Marvin	Markus	either	agrees 12 - -	doesn ' t	agree	with	or	doesn ' t	understand	the 13 rent	control / stabilization	laws	of	1969 .14 And	Pedro	Espada ,	the	Senate	GOP 15 leader ,	whom	I	totally	detest ,	has	said	that 16 back	on	June	9 th he	was	voting	for	some 17 pro - tenant	bills	before	they	actually	came	out .18 Thank	you	very	much .19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .

KRYSTYNA	PIORKOWSKA :	I	know ,16 sir .17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I	didn ' t take 18 your	time .	So	you ' re	going	to give	us	the 19 highlights .20 MS . KRYSTYNA	PIORKOWSKA :	I	know ,21 sir .22 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	And	we ' ll	read 23 it .24 MS . KRYSTYNA	PIORKOWSKA :	And	I ' ve 25 emphasized	how	necessary	the	low - rent 2 
2 guidelines	are .3 I	dared	to	invest	in	New	York	when 4 all	about	me	were	fleeing	and	have	provided 5 safe ,	decent	owner - subsidized	-	yes ,6 owner - subsidized	-	housing	for	twenty - eight 7 years .8 I	am	here	to	call	upon	you	to 9 maintain	the	low - rent	guideline	for	this	period 10 and , in	fact ,	to maintain	it for	the	upcoming 11 years .12 Because	I	have	pride	in	running 13 well - maintained , clean	and	safe	buildings	-	no 14 HPD	or	DOB	violations	-	I	have	an	extremely	low 15 turnover	rate .16 My buildings	are	located	within	four 17 blocks	of	this	Great	Hall ,	yes ,	directly	in	the 18 center	of	it	all ,	and	have	a total	of 19 twenty - eight	residential	units ,	of	which	ten 20 are	rent	stabilized	and	have	a	monthly	rent	of 21 less	than	$ 1000 , while	an	additional	six	rent 22 for	between	$ 1100	and	$ 1500 .23 The	remaining	twelve	units	are	a24 combination	of	rent	stabilized	and	free	market 25 rents	of	less	than	$ 1900 .2 
2 The	attached	line	graph	presents	the 3 minuscule	annual	rent	increases	for	the	less 4 than	$ 1000	rent	apartments , which	have	been 5 continuously	occupied	by	the	same	tenant	since 6 at	least	1992 .	And	that	would	be	on	page	three .7 On page	four	you	have	another	chart .8 The	line	graph	represents	the	increase	in the 9 three	greatest	non - deferrable	variables	for	my 10 building :	Property ,	water	and	fuel	costs ,	as 11 well	as	those	specific	low - rent	guidelines .12 As you	can	see , clearly	see ,	over 13 the	period	of	2002 - 2009	the	rents	remain	at 14 almost	a	horizontal	level	while	the	expenses 15 present	a	sharp	incline .16 On page	five ,	you	have	a	projected 17 annualized	rent	stabilized	less	than	$ 1000 18 income	-	meaning	monthly	rental	-	for	ten 19 apartments	versus	the	three	nondeferrable 20 expenses	over	the	period	of 2009	to	2022 .	And 21 it	presents	the	increasing	discrepancy	which	I22 project	based	on current	trends	were	you	not	to 23 approve	a	low - rent	guideline	for	this	in the 24 same	amount	that	you	approved	last	year .25 Let	us	now	consider	several	of	the 2 
2 nondeferrable	expenses	and	where	they	will 3 stand	in	2022	based	on	the	pattern	of	the	last 4 eight	years .5 My property	taxes	-	that	is ,	not 6 assessment	-	have	been	increasing	at	the	rate 7 of	10 . 47	percent	annually ,	which	will	bring 8 them	to	an	annualized	$ 238 , 000	a	year .9 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	need	to	try 10 to	wrap	up ,	please .11 MS . KRYSTYNA	PIORKOWSKA :	Fuel	oil 12 will	have	increased	to	$ 124 , 000 ;13 And	water	and	sewer	would	have 14 increased	minimally	to	$ 45 , 250 .15 At that	same	time	the	total	income 16 for	these	low - rent	income	units ,	based	on these 17 increases	will	not	exceed	$ 145 , 500 ,	while	their 18 proportional	share	of	these	three	building 19 expenses	will	amount	to	$ 147 , 000 .20 Again ,	just	to sum	up ,	the	people 21 living	in	these	apartments	are	not	low - income 22 people .	They	include	filmmakers ,	professors ,23 two	attorneys ,	teachers ,	a	vice	president	of	a24 TARP - funded	corporation ,	contractors	and	other 25 professionals .2

I	didn ' t	- -15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .16 Thank	you .17 Mr . Steiger .18 MS . RICHARD	STEIGER :	Good	morning ,19 Board	Members .20 Thank	you	for	the	opportunity	to 21 testify .22 The	Rent	Guidelines	Board	was 23 created	in	1969 , quote ,	to	prevent	exactions	of 24 unjust ,	unreasonable	and	oppressive	rents	and 25 rental	agreements	and	to	forestall 9 
2 profiteering ,	speculation	and	other	disruptive 3 practices .4 Sadly ,	over	the	past	forty	years 5 this	Board	has	failed	miserably	to	live	up	to 6 its	legislative	purpose .7 ( Audience	participation . )8 MS . RICHARD	STEIGER :	In	fact ,9 they ' ve	done	everything	in	their	power	to 10 undermine	it .11 New	York	City ' s housing 12 affordability	crisis	has	only	deepened	in the 13 past	four	decades .	The	median	rent - to - income 14 ratio	for	the	City ' s	one	million	stabilized 15 households	is	over	the	Federal	hardship	level 16 of	thirty	percent .17 Bronx	residents	are	the	hardest	hit 18 with	33 . 1	percent	paying	half	or	more	of their 19 income	in	rent .20 The	Rent	Guidelines	Boards	of 21 Nassau ,	Westchester	and	Rockland	Counties 22 consistently	approve	lower	rent	increases	than 23 does	the	New	York	City	Board .24 ( Audience	participation . )25 MS . RICHARD	STEIGER :	Not	once	in 2 
2 forty	years	has	there	been	a rent	freeze	or	a3 rollback .4 Part	of	the	problem	is	that	the 5 Board	does	not	use	up - to - date	income	and 6 expense	filings	from	landlords	as	does	the 7 Nassau	County	Board .	The	New	York	City	Board 8 uses	a	Price	Index	that	measures	changes	in	the 9 cost	of	items	such	as	fuel	and	insurance .10 Landlords	even	have	a	hardship	provision	under 11 which	any	owner	can	open	their	books	and 12 demonstrate	they	are	not	making	a	fair	rate	of 13 profit	and	then	be	entitled	to	increases	above 14 the	guideline	amounts .15 This	provision	is	designed	to	avoid 16 raising	rents	for	all	one	million	stabilized 17 households	to	protect	those	few	owners	who 18 legitimately	might	merit	special	consideration .19 Even	so ,	only	a handful	of owners 20 each	year	are	able	to	claim	that	they	are 21 entitled	to	the	hardship	increase .22 No such	hardship	provision	applies 23 to	tenants	who	are	in	economic	distress .24 ( Audience	participation . )25 MS . RICHARD	STEIGER :	Tenants	who 2 
2 lose	their	jobs	or	have	staggering	medical 3 bills	must	fend	for	themselves .	There	are	not 4 rent	reductions .5 And	the	Congressional	Budget	Office 6 forecasted	that	Social	Security	recipients 7 would	not	receive	any	cost	of living 8 adjustments	in	2010	or	2011 .9 But	it ' s	not	just	the	poor	who	are 10 hurting .	An	article	in	the	May	5 th	Ne w	Yor k	11 Times highlighted	middle	income	and	affluent 12 people	reeling	under	this	dreadful	economy .13 ( Audience	participation .14 MS . RICHARD	STEIGER :	Many	are 15 crowding	into	the	City ' s	already	burdened 16 Housing	Courts , long	known	as Poor	People 17 Court .18 One	man	laid	off	by	Merrill	Lynch 19 was	forced	to	move	out	of	his	$ 5700	a	month 20 Tribeca	apartment	owing	$ 20 , 000	in	back	rent .21 Year	in	and	year	out	tenants	take	it 22 on	the	chin	from	this	Board	with	unbearable	and 23 unconscionable	rent	increases	and	poor	taxes .24 And	if	that ' s	not	enough ,	there	are	Major 25 Capital	Improvements	that	last	forever	and 2 
2 become	part	of	the	base	rent .3 ( Audience	participation . )4 MS . RICHARD	STEIGER :	Furthermore ,5 tenants	who	fight	their	landlords	in	Housing 6 Court	are	then	blacklisted	and	can	never	rent 7 another	apartment .8 That	is	why	the	RGB	must	be 9 reformed .	Marvin	Markus	neither	understands	nor 10 agrees	with	the	Rent	Stabilization	Law	that	he 11 has	taken	an	oath	to	enforce .	He	might	have 12 even	been	instrumental	in	canning	Public	Member 13 Martin	Zelnick	in 2006	after	Mr .	Zelnick	voted 14 for	a	rent	freeze	the	prior	year .15 Having	Marvin	Markus	serve	as	RGB 16 Chair	is	like	hiring	Willy	Nelson	to	do your 17 taxes .18 And	I	would	be remiss	if	I didn ' t19 mention	Steven	Schleider	whose	family	grew	up 20 in	rent	regulated	housing	but	feels	no	one	else 21 today	has	a	birthright	to	it .	It	was	good 22 enough	- -23 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	have	to	wrap 24 up .25 MS . RICHARD	STEIGER :	- -	for	him ,2 
2 but	why	should	we and	our	families	enjoy 3 affordable	housing	- -4 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Mr .	Steiger ,	you 5 need	to	wrap	up .6 MS . RICHARD	STEIGER :	I	am wrapping 7 up	right	now .8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Go	ahead .	Good .9 MS . RICHARD	STEIGER :	This	Board 10 needs	to	understand	that	housing	is	a	right ,11 not	a	privilege .12 ( Audience	participation . )13 MS . RICHARD	STEIGER :	It ' s high 14 time	you	lived	up to	your	mandate	to	prevent 15 exactions	of	unjust ,	unreasonable	and 16 oppressive	rents	and	stop	being	a	fence	for	the 17 real	estate	industry	and	an out - of - touch	Mayor .18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .19 MS . RICHARD	STEIGER :	Thank	you	for 20 your	time .21 ( Audience	participation . )22 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Mr .	Brill .	Mr .23 Brill .24 Go ahead ,	Mr .	Brill .25 MR . HAL	BRILL :	Good	morning !2 
2 I ' m Hal	Brill , owner	and	manager	of 3 a	small	Manhattan	apartment	building .4 Rent	stabilization	has	caused	severe 5 dysfunction	- -	I almost	agree	with	that	guy ,6 but	on	the	opposite	side	- - to	New	York	City ' s7 rental	market .	The	inadequate	guideline 8 increases	have	created	long - term	rentals	with 9 rents	too	low	to cover	costs .10 Water	rates	continue	to	increase	by 11 almost	thirteen	percent	this	year .	Real	estate 12 taxes	continue	to go	through	the	roof .	Repairs 13 and	labor	costs	go	up .14 One	wonders	how	the	Rent	Guidelines 15 Board	justifies	the	measly	increases	that	you 16 have	provided	over	these	last	past	forty	years .17 The	minimum	increase	rents	have 18 helped	by	providing	a	minimum	increase	for	the 19 lowest	rents	in our	buildings .	This	must	be 20 continued	this	year	and	I	urge	you	to	implement 21 the	highest	minimum	increase	of	$ 45	for	a22 one - year	lease	and	$ 75	for	a two - year	lease ,23 and	the	4 . 5	percent	for	a	one - year	lease 24 renewal	and	a	7 . 5	percent	for	the	two - year 25 lease	renewal .2 
2 Because	the	rent	guidelines	have	not 3 kept	up	with	costs ,	the	longer	a	tenant	has 4 been	living	in	our	buildings ,	the	lower	the 5 rent .	The	system	does	not	address	merit , income 6 or	family	need , just	longevity .7 This	inspires	tenant	corruption .8 Tenants	fight	to keep	their	apartments	and 9 choose	their	successors	after	they	move	out	or 10 even	die .11 People	with	no rights	to	succession 12 get	in	via	illegal	sublets	and	roommates ,	and 13 then	relax	while	landlords	have	to	jump	through 14 hoops	to	try	to pry	them	out ,	hoops	that	cost 15 the	landlords	money	but	not	the	tenants ,16 inordinate	amounts	of	time , energy	and	legal 17 fees .18 This	convoluted	and	biased 19 regulatory	situation	burdens	the	legal	system 20 with	illegal	tenants	who	know	they	can	hang	on 21 no	matter	how	flagrantly	they	don ' t	qualify .22 Now	they	even	claim	landlord	harassment .23 The	system	is	skewed	against	all 24 landlords ,	including	fair ,	reasonable	and 25 cooperative	ones	in	favor	of tenants	and	the 2 
2 overwhelming	paperwork	that	we	have	to	file	-3 these	court	cases	are	a	routine	part	of our 4 lives	-	the	lead	compliance	laws ,	all	add 5 instability	and	uncertainty	to	the	very	raw 6 deal	of	owning	and	managing	small	residential 7 units	in	Manhattan	and	in	the	rest	of	the	City .8 The	Rent	Guidelines	Board	has	failed 9 the	small	owners	and	it	only	allows	minimal ,10 minuscule	increases	that	have	not	kept	up with 11 inflation	and ,	in fact ,	fall	further	behind 12 every	year .13 Clearly	the	situation	cannot	be 14 rectified	overnight ,	but	incremental	steps	can 15 be	taken	and	must	be	taken	to gradually	turn 16 things	around ,	raise	guideline	increases ,17 reinstitute	vacancy	allowances ,	which	you 18 haven ' t	had	in	I don ' t	know	how	many	years ,	so 19 apartment	rents	can	rise	to subsistence	levels .20 Thank	you	very	much .21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .22 ( Audience	participation . )23 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Any	questions ?24 Thank	you .25 MS . CRUZ :	Yes , I	have	a	question .2

CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	have	aMR . SCHLEIDER :	There ' s	a question 
5 here ,	please .6 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Question	Mr .7 Brill .8 MS . CRUZ :	Have	you	had	any 9 experience	with	DHCR	proceedings ?10 MR . HAL	BRILL :	Yes .	Many	times .11 MS . CRUZ :	Have	you	tried	to	adjust 12 your	rents	through	a	DHCR	process ?13 MR . HAL	BRILL :	No .	I	just	file	the 14 guideline	increases .15 MS . CRUZ :	Just	the	registrations ?16 MR . HAL	BRILL :	Yes .17 MS . CRUZ :	Okay .	I	wanted	to	see	if 18 you	had	anything	to	relay	about	the 19 administrative	process	for	raising	rents	and 20 how	that	impacts	on	your	business .21 MR . HAL	BRILL :	Like	I	said ,	you 22 know ,	we	are	in Manhattan	so most	of	our	rents 23 are	way	below	market	because ,	you	know , we	have 24 long - term	tenancies ,	thirty / forty	years . You 25 know ,	we	have	like	probably	a	third	or	more	of 5 
2 the	building	with	rents	under	$ 600 / $ 700 .3 So , you	know ,	we	have 4 multigenerational	families	that	stay	on . Even 5 when	people	die , you	know ,	it ' s	hard	to get	the 6 apartments ,	or	if not	impossible .7 MS . CRUZ :	Thank	you .8 MS . HOLDER :	How	long	have	you 9 owned	your	buildings ?10 MR . HAL	BRILL :	My	family	has	owned 11 that	building	for	probably	fifty	years .12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	have	one 13 building ?14 MR . HAL	BRILL :	Yes .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .16 Maxine	Zeifman .17 ( Audience	participation . )18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Anita ,	I hear 19 you . Quiet .20 A	VOICE :	That ' s	not	Anita .21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	No ?	All	right .22 Sorry .	I	hear	you ,	whoever	you	are .	Quiet .23 All	right .24 Go ahead ,	ma ' am .25 MS . MAXINE	ZEIFMAN :	I	have 2 
2 testified	every	single	year	before	this	Board 3 and	I	am	as	disgusted	as	that	man	who	spoke	a4 few	speakers	before .5 This	Board	is	appointed	by 6 Bloomberg .	He	has	appointed	in	Mr .	Marvin 7 Markus	Goldman	Sachs .	Everybody	else	that	is 8 supposed	to	be	public	is	either	real	estate	or 9 a	banker .10 This	country	is really	sick	of 11 having	special	interests ,	special	interests	buy 12 what	happens	in this	country ,	buy	what	happens 13 in	our	Federal	government	and	buy	what	happens 14 in	the	Rent	Guidelines	Board .15 You	have	a	tiny	amount	of	money 16 given	to	you ,	but	you ' re	appointed	by	- - you ' re 17 appointed	by	the	City	to	make	this	City 18 healthy ,	to	be	patriotic .19 This	City	needs	affordable	housing 20 for	its	working	class	and	for	its	middle	class .21 It	needs	affordable	housing	for	the	Ivy	League ,22 for	the	regular	universities	that	teach	your 23 kids ,	that	make	peanuts .24 For	the	medical	researchers ,	the 25 M . D . / Ph . D . s	at	Columbia	University ,	who	are 2 
2	working	on		a	vaccine	for	cancer ,	that	earn 3	$ 37 , 000	a	year . 4 For	the	artists	that	come	to	the 5 City .6 This	City	is	great	because	of	the 7 people	that	come	from	everywhere	in	the	world .8 And	they	need	affordable	housing .9 I	live	in	a	rent	stabilized	housing 10 and	I ' m	told	by your	landlords ,	who	don ' t	have 11 to	show	their	books ,	that	a two - bedroom	gets 12 $ 400	a	year	- -	$ 400	a	month	rent .	I ' ve	been 13 there	since	1972 ,	started	at $ 700 .	It ' s $ 2200 14 now .15 My neighbor	who	came	in	' 50 in	two 16 bedrooms	is	now	paying	$ 3300 .17 Somebody	who	has	a	one - bedroom ,	has 18 been	there	even	longer ,	one	bedroom	is	paying 19	over	$ 3000 .20 So , you	know ,	it ' s	nonsense .	The 21 small	owners ,	yes ,	they	need	to	help	them .22 But	this	- -	you	are	appointed	by	the 23 City	to	do	something	patriotic ,	to	do	something 24 for	the	health	of the	City . This	is	a	special 25 interest .20 
2 Rockefellar	took	housing	to Albany 3 in	' 72	because	it was	a	special	interest .	We 4 have	never	been	able	to	repeal	that	Erstadt 5 Law .6 This	country	is sick	of	being	run	by 7 special	interests .	It	needs	to	be	run	for	the 8 health	of	the	country .9 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .10 Any	questions ?11 ( Audience	participation . )12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .13 Nicholas	Petras .14 MR . NICHOLAS	PETRAS :	That ' s	a15 tough	act	to	follow .16 My name	is	Nicholas	Petras	and	I	am 17 President	of	the	Community	Housing	Improvement 18 Program ,	an	association	of	small	and 19 medium - sized	apartment	owners .20 Among	other	things ,	my	family	owns 21 several	hundred	rent	stabilized	apartments ,22 about	ninety	percent	of	which	are	in	Queens .23 And	like	a	large	portion	of rent	regulated 24 owners ,	we	have	owned	most	of our	apartments 25 for	more	than	twenty - five	years .2 
2 I ' ve	been	in	charge	of	day - to - day 3 operations	of	our	real	estate	business	for	the 4 past	fifteen	years .5 I ' ve	come	to	testify	about	the 6 long - term	tenant	discount .	I ' d	like	to	thank 7 you	for	last	year ' s	guideline	order	including	a8 minimum	rent	increase	for	long - term	tenants .9 We landlords	come	here	year	after 10 year	to	ask	for	such	relief	and	almost	every 11 year	the	Board	does	nothing . Thankfully	you	did 12 something	last	year .13 I ' m asking	for	the	Board	to 14 acknowledge	the	problem	that	the	long - term 15 tenant	discount	has	created	for	building 16 finances	and	to continue	with	the	minimum 17 increase	this	year	at	least	at	last	year ' s18 level .19 I	think	everyone	in	New	York	knows 20 that	the	longer	a	tenant	has	been	in	a	rent 21 regulated	apartment	-	and ,	interestingly ,	I	was 22 sitting	over	there	with	some	landlords	and	we 23 were	trying	to	figure	out	the	history	with	what 24 was	just	recited	of	those	neighbors	of	the 25 previous	speaker	-	the	better	the	deal	the 2 

2	tenant	has .3
And	savvyer	New	Yorkers	know	that 
4 the	lowest	rents	in	a	building	belong	to the 5 first	rent	stabilized ,	not	rent	controlled ,6 tenants .7 In 1981 ,	my	family	purchased	a8 48 - unit	building	on	29 th	Street	in	Astoria 9 consisting	mostly	of	one - bedroom	apartments 10 with	a	total	of 127	rentable	rooms .	Forty - five 11 of	the	apartments	are	rent	stabilized ,	two	are 12 rent	controlled , and	one	is occupied	by the 13 super .14 The	average	rent	in	that	building	is 15 $ 1000 . 96 ,	and	a bit	fewer	than	half	of	the 16 apartments ,	23	of the	47	rented	apartments ,17 rent	for	less	than	$ 1000	and	would	be	subject 18 to	this	increase .19 When	my	dad	bought	the	building ,	the 20 tenants	were	attempting	to	get	a	7 A21 administrator	appointed	and	were	conducting	a22 rent	strike .23 Well ,	I	guess	the	striking	tenants 24 got	the	well - run	building	they	wanted .	More 25 than	a	quarter	of the	tenants	in	the	building 4 
2 have	lived	there	for	more	than	twenty	years .3 This	number	includes	only	two	rent	controlled 4 apartments .5 Average	rent	for	these	long - term 6 rent	stabilized	tenants	is	$ 682 . 95 .7 The	average	rent	for	the	two	rent 8 controlled	apartments	is	actually	higher .9 Considering	our	debt	and	our	cost	of 10 equity ,	the	tenants	don ' t	cover	the 11 proportionate	costs	of	running	the	building .12 Last	year	I	testified	that	the	cost 13 of	heating	oil	for	this	building	increased	by 14 $ 40 . 15	per	apartment	per	month ,	the	real	estate 15 taxes	increased	by	$ 9 . 15	per	apartment	per 16 month ,	and	the	insurance	on this	building	by 17 $ 7 . 36 per	month . That	is ,	these	three	expenses 18 alone	increased	a	total	of	$ 56 . 66	per	apartment 19 per	month .20 How	many	of	the	ten	long - term	rent 21 stabilized	tenants	paid	the	minimum	for	last 22 year ?	Two .	The	other	eight	were	in	the	midst	of 23 two - year	leases	and	did	not	renew	during	the 24 year	of	the	current	guidelines	order .25 Accordingly ,	it is	only	fair	that	the	minimum 2 
2 increase	for	these	tenants	be extended .3 I	know	many	of you	are	thinking	that 4 my	cost	of	heating	oil	in	the	building	went 5 down	this	year . It	did ,	by	a total	of	almost 6 $ 20 , 000	or	$ 34 . 30 per	apartment	per	month .	But 7 I ' ve given	a	good	chunk	of	that	savings , about 8 $ 7800	or	$ 13 . 61 per	month	to the	City	of New 9 York	in	higher	real	estate	taxes .10 This	year	my	real	estate	taxes	on 11 this	building	are	scheduled	to	increase	by 12 another	$ 28 . 92	per	apartment	per	month .13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	need	to	wrap 14 up , Mr .	Petras .15 MR . NICHOLAS	PETRAS :	Okay .16 Let	me	leave	you	with	several	points 17 to	consider .18 These	three	costs	I ' ve	discussed	are 19 the	same	for	all	tenants	of comparable 20 apartments ;	that	is ,	the	long - term	tenant	in	5 C21 paying	$ 632	a	month	and	who	winters	in	Florida 22 and	has	actually	taken	a	homestead	exemption 23 there ,	incurs	the	same	proportionate	cost	of 24 oil , real	estate	taxes	and	insurance	that	the 25 guy	in	6 C ,	who	pays	$ 1325 ,	does .2

This	is	a	very	typical	- -CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	need	to	wrap MR . NICHOLAS	PETRAS :	This	is	a

2 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- -	where	they	came 3 off	their	highs	last	year .4 When	were	you	purchasing	your	fuel 5 oil ?6 MR . NICHOLAS	PETRAS :	We	purchase 7 on	the	spot	market .	We	haven ' t	locked	in .8 This	past	year	we	actually	burned	a9 fair	amount	of	gas .	But	we	did ,	yes .10 MR . SCHLEIDER :	The	price	of	gas 11 for	heating ,	is that	as	volatile	as	the	price 12 of	oil ?13 MR . NICHOLAS	PETRAS :	It	wasn ' t	as 14 volatile .	We	had	some	mechanical	problems	and 15 our	service	company	recommended	that	we burn 16 gas	until	they	had	a	part	that	was	backordered 17 reinstalled .	So that ' s	why	we did	that .18Oil	is	coming	- -	one	of	the	funny 19things	is ,like	many	of	my	members ,	we	get	- -	I20get	my	new price	for	oil	everyday .

SCHLEIDER :	All	right .14 And	where	do	you	see	the	oil 15 trending	now	going ?16 MR . NICHOLAS	PETRAS :	I	have	no 17 idea .18 ( Audience	participation . )19 MR . NICHOLAS	PETRAS :	It ' s actually 20 up .21 MR . SCHLEIDER :	It ' s	actually	up .22 MS . HOLDER :	I have	a	question .23 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .24 Go ahead .	Sure . Adriene .25 MS . HOLDER :	Thank	you ,	Mr .	Petras .6 
2 You	said	that	you	all	represent	the 3 small	and	medium - sized	property	owners .4 MR . NICHOLAS	PETRAS :	Yes .5 MS . HOLDER :	Could	you	kind	of	give 6 me	an idea	of	how	many	units	that	is ,	like 7 quantify	that	for	me ?8 MR . NICHOLAS	PETRAS :	Our	members 9 or	me ?10 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Your	members .11 MS . HOLDER :	Well ,	you	own	several 12 hundred	units ;	right ?13 MR . NICHOLAS	PETRAS :	Right .14 And	Pat	Siconolfi ,	who	is	our 15 Executive	Director ,	testified	before	about	the 16 size	of	our	membership ,	yes .17 MS . HOLDER :	Right .18 So how	do	you	classify	yourself ?19 MR . NICHOLAS	PETRAS :	I ' m a20 small / medium - sized	owner .	I ' m	a	medium - sized 21 owner	I	guess .22 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .23 So could	you	quantify	those 24 categories	for	me then ;	small	being	- -25 MR . NICHOLAS	PETRAS :	A	small	owner 2 
2 is	one	building	or	less .3 A	medium	owner	is ,	you	know ,	five 4 hundred	apartments .5 You	need	a	certain	- -	I	had	this 6 debate	with	a	landlord	friend	of	mine .	You	need 7 a	certain	- -	the	business	has	become	so complex 8 that	you	need	to do	it	as	a full - time	business .9 I	really	feel	sorry	for	the	guys	who 10 have	one	small	building	because	the	laws	are 11 just	- -	at	times	it ' s	very	complex	and	it ' s12 just	very	difficult	to	keep	up	with .13 So you	really	need	to	have	several 14 hundred	units	in order	to	manage	your	business 15 efficiently .16 MS . HOLDER :	But	several	hundred 17 units	being	like	maybe	a	small	landlord . So	a18 medium	landlord	- -19 MR . NICHOLAS	PETRAS :	No , no .	I ' d20 say	five	hundred	is	a	medium - sized	landlord .21 I	mean	we ' ve	done	studies . I ' m	sure 22 there	are	plenty	of	studies	of	who	owns	what ,23 or	maybe	there	haven ' t	been	enough .	Maybe 24 that ' s	something	- -25 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	He	talked	about 2 
2those studies .He ' s	going	to make	available	the 3study you	did .4MS .HOLDER :	Thank	you .5MR .NICHOLAS	PETRAS :	Okay .	Thank 6you .7 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .8 We ' re	going	to call	some	names .9 The	stenographer	needs	some	relief .10 It ' s twelve	o ' clock	now .	We are	going	to go	to 11 approximately	12 : 30	and	then	we ' ll	take	a12 fifteen - minute	break .13 The	names :14 Mr .

Mr .	James	Jones .23 MR . JAMES	JONES :	Over	excess	fifty 24 pages	of	tax	lien	foreclosure .	New	York	City 25 residential	properties	have	recently	appeared 7 
2 in	the	New	York	Daily	News	paper ,	more	than 3 three	or	four	times .	Does	that	indicate	an 4 additional	line	category ,	owner	line ,	tenant 5 line ,	tax	lien	foreclosure	line ?6 Wadleigh	Court	possesses	thirty 7 independent	units ,	full	apartments ,	one	full 8 unit	or	apartment	also	in	the	basement	making 9 thirty - one	units .10 Senior	tenants	at	Wadleigh	Court 11 indicated	infamy	and	notoriety	of	negro	CEO 12 seeking	the	rent	rolls	of	Wadleigh	Court ,	the 13 general	idea	being	to	abscond ,	vanish	with 14 large	sums	of	money .15 New	York	City	would	always	back	down 16 or	back	out ,	bend	back ,	bend	around ,	bend	over .17 This	process	is known	as	an in	rem	application ,18 letting	the	negro	CEO	approach	a	Chinese	or 19 Asian	city	worker	in	a	closet	somewhere	and 20 demand	the	money .21 No one	will	know	the	Chinese	or 22 Asian	city	worker ,	give	me	the	money	in rem ,23 gave	the	negro	CEO	the	missing	money .24 How	is	it	that	the	negro	CEO	shows 25 up	in front	of	the	building ' s	premises 2 
2 operating	several	latest	edition	luxury 3 automobiles .4 Mr . Chairman ,	point	of	information .5 You	may	have	excellent	justification	for 6 excluding	Staten	Island .7 Mayor	Bloomberg ' s	Board	on Police 8 dealt	with	the	same	issue .	After	holding 9 several	meetings	on	all	of	the	outer	boroughs ,10 restricted	all	meetings	thereafter	to	the 11 Borough	of	Manhattan .12 The	newly	selected	chairman ,	Ernest 13 F .	Hart ,	has	directed	Jones	to	refrain	from 14 actually	addressing	the	Board	until	the	new 15 members	have	had	a	chance	to look	at	the 16 record .17 Although	one	commissioner	indicated 18 to	Jones	that	he did	not	necessarily	agree	with 19 the	policy	of	directing	Jones	to	refrain	from 20 addressing	the	Mayor	Bloomberg ' s	Board	on 21 Police	simply	because	the	Board	had	allowed	or 22 establish	a	case	for	Jones .23 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you ,	Mr .24 Jones .25 Jessica	Anderson .2 

23	morning .4
MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	Good Last	year	I	was	here	and	I told	you 
5 how	I	live	in	a co - op	and	we offered	the 6 tenants	the	ownership	of	the	rent	- -	not	once ,7 but	twice ,	ownership	of	the	rent	stabilized 8 apartments	for	free	two	years	ago .9 They	refused .10 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Who	owns	the 11 shares	in	the	co - op ?12 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	At the	time 13 we	owned	the	shares ,	the	corporation .14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	The	corporation .15 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	The	owner 16 had	to	own	the	shares .17 We recently	were	able	to	get	an 18 investor	who	is now ,	of	course ,	struggling .	And 19 we	turned	that	money	into	Major	Capital 20 Improvements	through	weatherization	and	put 21 ourselves	back	in debt	because	we	want	to be 22 good	landlords .23 As a	manager ,	I want	everybody	to 24 profit .	I	want	everything .	But	I	can ' t	make 25 this	building	stable .5 
2 Thirty - five	percent	of	our	budget	-3 and	I	have	copies	here	for	you	-4 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	We ' ll	get	them 5 later .6 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	Thirty - five 7 percent	of	our	budget	is	water	and	taxes ,8 $ 30 , 000	in	fuel	oil	this	year	for	the	two 9 buildings .	This	is	for	two	small	buildings	of 10 eight	units	each .11 Each	of	these	apartments	is 1000 12 square	feet	and	1450	square	feet .13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Where	are	these ?14 Where	is	this	property ?15 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	This	is	in 16 Queens .17 The	reason	that	the	tenants	didn ' t18 accept	these	apartments	and	become	owners	is 19 because	of	the	huge	difference	between	the 20 maintenance	and	the	rents .21 You ' ll	see	in	there	the	rents	are 22 about	$ 500	below	what	it	costs	to	maintain	the 23 building .	That ' s just	the	way	it	is .	It ' s	not 24 that	we	want	people	to	have	unaffordable 25 housing .	It ' s	- - you	impose	these	expenses	on 2 
2 us . And	we	have	to	make	ends	meet .3 We are	a	corporation .	We	have	to	be 4 fair .5 So that	means	that	the	other	people ,6 the	owners	here , who	are	small	people	- school 7 teachers	- -	and , yes ,	I ' ll	open	my	books	any 8 time	you	like	- - you	know ,	a school	teacher	who 9 lost ,	you	know , half	her	pension	just	got 10 slashed ,	and	a	grandmother	who	- -	I	mean	we ' re 11 small	people	and	we	can ' t	make	ends	meet .12 And	we	are	paying	for	our	neighbors .13 It ' s not	right . It ' s	not	fair	to	anyone .14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	So	how	many	rent 15 stabilized	apartments	do	you	have	among	the 16 sixteen ?17 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	I	have	- -18 only	one	of	them	face	the	$ 85 rent	increase .19 The	other	four	will	go	up	for	renewal	this 20 year .21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .22 So you ' ve	got	five	out	of	sixteen 23 that	are ,	based	on	your	numbers ,	which	we will 24 look	at ,	are	losers ,	if	I	can	call	them	that .25 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	$ 3000	a2 
2 month	losers .3 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	How	much ?4 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	$ 3000 .5 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	In	total ?6 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	In total	a7 month	losers ,	yes .8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	And	the	rest	of 9 the	co - op	has	to make	up	the	difference ?10 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	Yes .11 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	So	it ' s , just 12 quick	math ,	I ' m going	to	use	ten	instead	of	- -13 $ 300	a	month	more	for	everybody	else .14 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	Yes .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .16 Any	questions ?17 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Yes .	Mr .	Chair ?18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Yes .19 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	Any 20 questions ?21 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Yes .22 Now ,	you ' re	running	as	a	co - op	- -23 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	Right .24 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- -	which	means	that 25 you	are	not	looking	to	make	a	profit .2 
2 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	No .3 MR . SCHLEIDER :	So	if	this	was	out 4 in , say ,	the	real	world ,	a	landlord	would	also 5 be	looking	to	make	a	return	on	their 6 investment .	But	you ' re	lucky	enough	not	to	have 7 to	do that	so	you ' re	not	- -8 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	All	I	want 9 is	for	them	to	pay	what	it	costs	to	live	there .10 That ' s	it .11 And	every	single	one	of	these	people 12 would	be	eligible	for	SCRIE	or	DRIE	or	Section 13 8	or whatever .	I ' d	be	happy	to	accept	any	State 14 subsidies	that	would	come	along	and	help	these 15 people .	I	don ' t want	to	lose	them .16 I	just	can ' t	afford	them .17 MR . SCHLEIDER :	I	understand .18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Have	they	applied 19 for	SCRIE	or	DRIE ?20 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	No . Why 21 should	they ?	They ' re	only	paying	$ 500	or $ 600	a22 month .23 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	But	the	rent 24 increase ,	the	$ 85 or	whatever	their	increase	- -25 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	That ' s	with 2 
2 the	rent	increase .3 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	What ?4 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	The	$ 600 5 reflected	on	4 B is	with	the	$ 85	rent	increase .6 Everybody	else	hasn ' t	faced	the	rent 7 increase	yet .8 ( Audience	participation . )9 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	This	is	at 10 149	Sanford .	We ' ll	accept	tenants	if	you	want 11 to	move	in	and	be a	roommate .12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	At	what	price 13 have	you	offered	the	co - ops	to	these	people ?14 For	free .15 A	VOICE :	She	offered	them	for	free .16 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	We offered 17 them	in	2000 ,	we offered	them	two	years	ago .18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	For	free ?19 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	For	free ,20 ownership .21 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Okay .22 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	And	the	person 23 who	bought	- -	did	the	person	buy	all	five	units 24 or	- -25 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	No .2 
2 One	person	bought	four	units	and	the 3 other	person	bought	that .	We then	paid	off	our 4 debts .	We	were	substantially	in	debt .	We owed 5 everybody .	We	owed	$ 60 , 000	on our	equity	line 6 of	credit .	We	owed	$ 18 , 000	to the	oil	company .7 We	paid	it	all	off .8 We then	signed	up	with 9 weatherization	and	went	and	put	ourselves	into 10 $ 35 , 000	worth	of debt	again	in	order	to upgrade 11 the	windows ,	boilers ,	all	that	stuff .12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .13 Mr . Schleider , - -14 ( Audience	participation . )15 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	No , we	can ' t16 pass	on	because	weatherization	- -17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Stabilized .18 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	No . We ' re 19 getting	help	from	the	State	because	half	of	the 20 people	who	live	in	these	buildings	qualify	as 21 low	income .	That ' s	owners ,	renters ,	everybody .22 So	we qualified	for	weatherization .	And	that 23 means	that	we	will	not	get	a Major	Capital 24 Improvement .	But	it	was	the	only	way	we could 25 afford	to	do	the	maintenance .2 
2 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	got	a3 weatherization	loan	or	grant	from	NYSERDA ;	- -4 MS . JESSICA	ANDERSON :	Yes .5 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	is	that	right ?6 Okay .7 Thank	you .8 Debbie	Stevens .9 ( Applause . )10 MS . DEBBIE	STEVENS :	Hi !11 My name	is	Debbie	Stevens . Excuse	my 12 voice .	I	just	got	over	having	laryngitis	about 13 a	weeks	ago .	So I ' m	still	a little	hoarse .14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	That ' s	okay .15 MS . DEBBIE	STEVENS :	I	am here	with 16 my	son	Michael	who	has	autism	and	epilepsy .	I17 have	pulmonary	fibrosis	of	the	lungs	and	never 18 smoked .19 I	would	like	- - I	would	now	like	to 20 read	a	paragraph	from	the	heat	sensor 21 monitoring	company	that	controls	our	heat .	Now ,22 I	gave	pamphlets ,	packets ,	to you	guys	up there 23 and	girls .	I	don ' t	know	if	you	have	it . I	gave 24 nine	packets ,	paperwork .	I	guess	Charmaine 25 didn ' t	give	it	to you ,	but	she ' ll	give	it to 2 

2	you	later .3
Underneath ,	I	would	now	like	to	read 
4 a	paragraph	from	the	heat	sensor	monitoring 5 company	that	controls	our	heat .6 Under	peace	of mind	settings ,	they 7 state ,	this	company ,	occasion ,	such	as	an 8 imminent	HPD	inspection	or	a manager	headed	for 9 vacation	may	call	for	special	temporary 10 settings .11 Now ,	the	key	word	is	" temporary "12 when	a	HPD	inspector	comes .13 Ensure	your	peace	of	mind	without 14 completing	bypassing	the	system ,	set	points	may 15 be	created	-	created	now ,	another	key	word	-16 for	only	a	specified	length	of	time	with	the 17 system	automatically	reverting	to	original 18 settings	following	the	defined	event .19 Okay .20 So let	me	get	back .21 This	statement	speaks	for	itself	and 22 is	basically	ensuring	the	landlords	that	when 23 an	HPD	inspector	is	expected ,	heat	settings	can 24 be	temporarily	changed	to	give	the	impression 25 that	adequate	heat	is	being	provided	when	it	is 4 
2 not . It	is	as	if the	third	party	heat 3 monitoring	company	is	a	magician	that	is 4 creating	an	illusion	for	the	landlords	to avoid 5 detection .6 I	have	here	printouts	for	311	heat 7 complaint	calls	from	the	tenants	at	our 8 building	where	inspectors	are	constantly	on	the 9 run	but	are	rarely	able	to	write	up	a	violation 10 because	of	a	computerized	system	that	is 11 designed	to	deceive	and	manipulate	the	tenants 12 as	well	as	the	inspectors	that	work	hard .13 Ask	yourself :	Why	would	an occasion 14 like	an	imminent	HPD	inspection	call	for 15 special	temporary	settings	if adequate	heat	was 16 being	provided ?17 This	heat	sensor	company	refuses	to 18 talk	to	tenants . They	will	not	talk	to	tenants 19 despite	being	the	heat	company	that	provides 20 our	heat .	The	super	states	he ' s	not	allowed	to 21 touch	the	boiler ,	yet	an	inspector	told	him 22 outright	that	he wanted	to	check	the	boiler	and 23 the	super	refused	to	allow	that .24 I	suffered	pneumonia	a25 year - and - a - half	ago	due	to	lack	of	heat	and 2 
2 these	heat	sensors	should	be banned	or	at least 3 monitored	-	I ' m almost	done	-	by	either	HPD	or 4 an	independent	government	agency .5 In addition ,	the	landlord	should	not 6 be	given	prior	notice	when	a 311	complaint	is 7 made ,	especially	for	heat ,	because	this	enables 8 the	landlords ,	the	super	and	the	monitoring 9 company	a	chance	to	cover	up and	manipulate .10 They	need	to	be caught	offguard .11 I	am	asking	the	Board	to	either 12 allow	for	relief ,	which	is	probably	not	going 13 to	happen ,	but	at the	very	minimum	only	an 14 increase	of	2	percent	for	one	year	or	4 percent 15 for	two - year	leases .16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .17 MS . DEBBIE	STEVENS :	I	hope	you 18 guys	do	it	because	I	could	have	died .	And	I19 have	a	son	here .20 And	this	goes	on .	A	lot	of people 21 are	not	getting	adequate	heat .22 And	I ' m	asking	you	guys ,	you	have	- -23 Charmaine	will	give	you	the	papers ,	to	look	at 24 everything .

You	guys	don ' t	have 12 an	easy	job .13 ( Applause . )14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .15 You ' re	going	to get	in	trouble	for 16 showing	appreciation	for	us .17 Elizabeth	Crane ,	please .18 Elizabeth	Crane	will	be	followed ,	as 19 I	said	before ,	Bethany	Jankunis ;20 And	that	will	be	followed	by	Roberta 21 Bernstein ;22 Followed	by	Faith	Steinberg .23 Elizabeth	Crane .24 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	Good 25 afternoon ,	Members	of	the	Rent	Guidelines 6 
2 Board ,	my	colleagues	and	members	of	the 3 community .4 My name	is	Elizabeth	Crane . I ' m	the 5 Vice	President	of Rosedale	Management	Company .6 We are	a	small , family - owned	firm 7 that	has	been	in business	since	approximately 8 1917 .	We	are	property	owners	and	manage 9 approximately	1200	units	in eighteen 10 family - owned	buildings	built	or	purchased	by	my 11 grandfather ,	my father	or	myself	in 12 neighborhoods	such	as	Highbridge ,	Morris 13 Heights ,	Soundview ,	Pelham	Parkway ,	Jamaica ,14 Park	Slope ,	Flatbush ,	Crown	Heights ,	Marble 15 Hill ,	Inwood	and	Washington	Heights .16 These	are	solid ,	well - maintained 17 buildings	with	no or	few	violations ,	and	where 18 all	building	services	are	provided .	We	adhere 19 to	New	York	City	building	code	requirements	and 20 pay	all	of	our	bills ,	including	payroll 21 expenses ,	property	taxes	and	water	bills 22 timely .23 I	spoke	to	you	last	year	and	raised 24 my	concerns	about	my	ability	to	continue	to 25 manage	these	buildings	without	a	substantial 2 
2 rent	increase .3 At that	time	I asked	the	Board	to 4 consider	a	flat	increase	on low - rent	apartments 5 with	long - term	tenants .	I	was	pleased	that	you 6 approved	the	increase	last	year	and	I	thank	you 7 for	your	actions .8 I	am	here	today	because	I	remain 9 concerned	about	these	buildings .	I	hope	that 10 you	will	approve	a	flat	rate	increase	for 11 low - rent	apartments	again	this	year	and	a12 reasonable	guideline	increase .13 It is	extremely	important	for 14 property	owners	like	myself	so	that	we	can 15 continue	to	make	our	properties	viable	in this 16 sluggish	economy .17 In preparation	for	today ' s meeting ,18 I	analyzed	the	rent	rolls	from	December	31 ,19 2006	through	today	and	found	an	increase	of 20 between	two	percent	and	ten	percent	throughout .21 That ' s	on	the	rent	rolls .22 But	my	operating	costs	continue	to 23 outpace	the	increases	approved	by	the 24 Guidelines	Board .25 A	mid - year	7 . 5 percent	property	tax 2 
2 increase ,	double	digit	water	and	sewer	rates ,3 rising	insurance	premiums	and	constantly 4 fluctuating	oil	markets	make	it	difficult	to 5 make	ends	meet .6 For	example ,	between	that	same 7 December	2006	and	July	1 ,	2009 ,	my	water	bills 8 increased	by	forty - five	percent	overall	and	my 9 property	taxes	increased	by twenty	to	thirty 10 percent	in	all	buildings	for	the	same	time 11 period .12 Please	be	aware	that	the	2 to	10 13 percent	figure	I quoted	for	the	increase	on	the 14 rent	roll	does	not	necessarily	reflect	an 15 increase	in	income .	It	is	based	on	the 16 assumption	that	all	apartments	were	rented	all 17 the	time	and	that	all	tenants	paid	their	rent 18 in	full	during	the	year .19 Unfortunately , this	did	not	happen .20 In	this	economy	apartments	have	remained	empty 21 for	increasingly	longer	time	periods ,	not 22 because	the	rents	were	too	nigh ,	but	because	it 23 was	harder	to	find	qualified	tenants .24 Families	have	been	living	doubled 25 and	tripled	up	in apartments	placing	an 2 
2 unexpected	strain	on	the	infrastructure	and 3 surge	in	expenses	for	building	fixtures	and 4 services ,	among	other	things .5 Section	8 ,	for	those	of	us that 6 welcome	tenants	who	participate ,	has	increased 7 its	processing	time	for	rentals	from	two	months 8 to	four	months	as a	result	of its	own	budget 9 cutbacks .	And	more	residents	vacate	without 10 fulfilling	their	lease	obligations	and	owing 11 rent	for	many	months .12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You ' re	going	to 13 have	to	wrap	up .14 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	Attached	to 15 my	presentation	- -16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Why	don ' t	you	go 17 to	your	last	paragraph ,	last	two	paragraphs .18 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	Okay .19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	We ' ll	look	at	the 20 individual	items .21 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	I ' ve analyzed 22 the	leases	that	will	be	renewing	during	the 23 guideline	period	and	provided	that 24 documentation	to you .25 At 1491	Watson	Avenue ,	for	instance ,2 
2 a	building	with	sixty	units , there	will	be	44 3 leases	renewing , and	of	these	thirty - four	are 4 under	$ 1000	per	month	for	apartments	where	the 5 current	resident	has	lived	for	more	than	six 6 years .7 We have	nowhere	else	to	go except	to 8 our	residents	to obtain	the	funds	that	we need 9 to	maintain	these	buildings . Most	of	them	were 10 built	during	the	first	half	of	the	last	century 11 and	require	a	significant	investment	of capital 12 in	order	to	comply	with	modern	building	codes 13 and	living	standards .14 They	contain	no commercial	tenants ,15 no	rooftop	cell	phone	towers	or	other	sources 16 to	generate	funds	for	repairs	and	other 17 expenses .18 Luxury	decontrol	and	vacancy 19 decontrol	are	meaningless	in most	of	these 20 neighborhoods .21 The	faltering	economy	has	burdened 22 everyone .	It ' s	critical	that	we	obtain 23 meaningful	rent	increases	- -24 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	One	more 25 sentence .2 
2 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	- -	this	year 3 so	that	buildings	such	as	the	ones	that	I	own 4 will	continue	to provide	affordable ,	clean ,5 safe	housing	to New	York	City	residents .6 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .7 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	Thank	you .8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Any	questions ?9 Question .10 MS . ADAMS :	You ' re	speaking	of 11 sixteen	properties	that	are	rent	controlled ;	is 12 that	right ?13 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	I ' m sorry .14 MS . ADAMS :	Sixteen	units	that	are 15 rent	controlled ; is	that	correct ?16 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	I	didn ' t17 speak	about	rent	controlled	at	all .18 MS . ADAMS :	I ' m sorry .	Rent 19 stabilized .20 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	I	spoke	about 21 eighteen	buildings	that	are	rent	stabilized ,22 yes .23 MS . ADAMS :	Okay .	Thank	you .24 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr .	Chair ?25 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Go	ahead .2 
2 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Ms .	Crane , thank 3 you	for	your	testimony .4 The	rent	roll	that	you	attached	to 5 your	testimony , there ' s	a	code	over	here	under 6 the	column	SA	and	you	have	initials	SL , S ,	P ,7 O ,	what	do	those	mean ?8 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	O	stands	for	a9 tenant	receiving	a	senior	citizen	rent	increase 10 exemption .11 P	is	Section	8 , but	also	rent 12 stabilized .13 These	are	all	rent	stabilized 14 apartments .15 And	I	showed	the	ones	that	will	be 16 expiring	during	the	next	guideline	period ,	that 17 are	the	ones	that	are	subject	of	the 18 discussions	before	us	today .19 MR . SCHLEIDER :	And	those	are	the 20 ones	with	the	checkmarks	or - -21 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	The 22 checkmarks	are	the	ones	- -	the	column	you	are 23 looking	at	with	the	checkmarks	shows	the	date 24 that	the	tenant	moved	in .	The	last	flat	rate 25 increase ,	as	we all	were	aware ,	was	for	tenants 2 
2 paying	below	$ 1000	a	month	who	had	been	in 3 their	apartments	for	more	than	six	years .4 You ' ll	see	that	some	of	them	are 5 below	$ 1000	a	month	but	the	tenants	moved	in 6 less	than	six	years	ago	and	those	are	not 7 checked .8 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Right .	No , I9 understand	that .10 And	the	number	of	checked	apartments 11 is	quite	significant	in	terms	of	proportion .	So 12 you	have	extremely	low - paying	renters	here .13 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	That ' s14 correct .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	That ' s	her	point .16 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Thank	you	for 17 opening	your	books .18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .	Thank	you .19 Bethany	Jankunis .20 MS . BETHANY	JANKUNIS :	Hi !21 My name	is	Bethany	Jankunis .	I ' m	the 22 Chief	of	Staff	for	Assemblymember	Deborah	Glick 23 who ' s	up	in	Albany	and	apologizes	that	she 24 can ' t	be	here .25 I ' m here	today	on	behalf	of the 2 
2 thousands	of	rent - stabilized	- -3 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	She ' s	in the 4 Assembly ,	so	she ' s	working ; right ?5 MS . BETHANY	JANKUNIS :	She	is .	I6 will	make	no	comment	about	the	Senate .	But ,7 yes , she	is	working .8 I	am	here	today	on	behalf	of	the 9 thousands	of	rent - stabilized	tenants	in my 10 Lower	Manhattan	Assembly	District .11 I	thank	the	Rent	Guidelines	Board 12 for	the	opportunity	to	testify	and	I	hope	that 13 you	will	seriously	consider	the	proposal	that 14 I ,	and	no	doubt	countless	others ,	will	make 15 today ,	that	is , that	the	Board	reject	the 16 proposed	rent	increases	and	enact	a	rent 17 freeze .18 ( Applause . )19 MS . BETHANY	JANKUNIS :	First ,	let 20 me	say	that	I ' m disturbed	by the	tax 21 delinquency	discussion	that	took	place	earlier .22 Without	further	analysis	and	an	understanding 23 of	how	many	rent	stabilized	units	are	affected ,24 the	discussion	is premature	and	misleading .25 Clearly ,	it ' s	part	of	a	larger	crisis .	It ' s	one 2 
2 factor	in	the	foreclosure	crisis	and	it ' s	a3 national	crisis . So	to	insinuate	that	it ' s	just 4 that	the	rent	stabilized	rents	have ,	you	know ,5 something	to	do with	this	in the	City	I think 6 is	misleading .7 There	is	ample	evidence	that	tenants 8 are	finding	it	increasingly	difficult	to make 9 ends	meet	while	building	owners '	operating 10 costs ,	and	therefore	their	profits ,	have 11 remained	steady .12 ( Applause . )13 MS . BETHANY	JANKUNIS :	To place	a14 higher	burden	on tenants	to the	benefit	of 15 owners	at	this	time	would	be completely 16 unjustified	and	highly	misguided .17 New	York	City , like	the	rest	of	the 18 nation ,	is	experiencing	its	worst	economic 19 crisis	since	the	Great	Depression .	Unemployment 20 in	the	City	has	reached	record	levels ,	many 21 individuals	have	been	downsized	or	had	salary 22 freezes ,	and	the	number	of	food	stamp 23 recipients	is	on the	rise .24 Both	low -	and	middle - income 25 residents	continue	to	pay	a disproportionately 2 
2 large	share	of	their	income	toward	housing	and 3 struggle	to	absorb	the	rapidly	increasing	costs 4 of	utilities ,	transportation	and	other 5 necessities .6 Furthermore ,	due	in	part	to the 7 recent	substantial	rent	increase	granted	by	the 8 Board	over	the	past	few	years ,	the	City 9 continues	to	lose	rent - regulated	apartments	at 10 an	alarming	rate .	The	2008	rental	vacancy	rate 11 of	2 . 88	percent	is	proof	that	the	City	is 12 facing	not	just	a	housing	shortage ,	but	a13 housing	emergency .14 The	rate	at	which	affordable	housing 15 is	being	lost	is accelerating .	As	the	Board ' s16 own	report	shows ,	there ' s	been	a	loss	of 8 , 267 17 rent - stabilized	units	in	2008 ,	over	3 , 000	units 18 more	than	in	2007 .19 While	renters	struggle	and 20 apartments	are	being	rapidly	deregulated ,21 owners	have	enjoyed	record	profits .22 This	year	for	the	first	time	in	the 23 Board	history	the	Board ' s	yearly	price	study 24 showed	owners '	costs	have	not	risen 25 significantly .2 
2 The	report	found	that	the	four 3 percent	increase	in	owners ' operating	expenses 4 was	offset	by	decreases	in	both	fuel	oil	and 5 insurance	costs .6 Furthermore ,	owners	have	benefited 7 from	past	rent	hikes .	In	particular ,	last 8 year ' s	8 . 5	percent	rent	increase	for	two - year 9 leases	was	more	than	double	the	increase	in 10 owners '	operating	expenses . Even	if	the 11 projected	2 . 2	percent	increase	in	operating 12 costs	that	the	Board	predicts	for	the	coming 13 year	is	added ,	operating	expenses	still	will 14 not	exceed	last	year ' s	rent	increase .15 These	figures	negate	the	argument 16 used	in	past	years	that	rent	hikes	are 17 necessary	because	owners '	costs	have	increased .18 Clearly ,	owners	- -19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Are	you	almost 20 done ?21 MS . BETHANY	JANKUNIS :	Yes ,	I	am .22 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Good .23 MS . BETHANY	JANKUNIS :	Clearly ,24 owners	will	continue	to	make	a	profit	if rents 25 are	frozen .2 
2 It is	simply	unconscionable	that 3 during	this	economic	downturn	the	Board	would 4 consider	additionally	burdening	tenants	in 5 order	to	further	enrich	owners .6 I	call	on	the	Board	to	do	the	right 7 thing	and	freeze	rents	at	the	current	level	so 8 that	rent	stabilized	tenants	can	get	through 9 these	difficult	times	and	our	City	can	continue 10 to	recover .11 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Any	questions ?12 ( No response . )13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .14 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Are	you	going	to 15 freeze	the	personal	income	taxes	too ?16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	We	are	going	to 17 take	the	following	six	speakers	before	the 18 break .19 Roberta	Bernstein ;20 Faith	Steinberg ;21 Sandy	Rosen ;22 Romeo	Ymalay ;23 Scott	Donner ;	and 24 Don	Castagno .25 Those	are	the	people	before	the 2

Roberta	Bernstein .MS . ROBERTA	BERNSTEIN :	Good 
5 afternoon ,	Chairman	Markus , and	other	Members 6 of	the	Board .7 I ' m Roberta	Bernstein ,	President	of 8 the	Small	Property	Owners	of New	York 9 representing	over	a	thousand	owners	of 10 owner - subsidized	small	buildings .11 Tenant	advocates	claim	that	housing 12 is	a right .	But	there	are	two	kinds	of	rights :13 Positive	and	negative .14 Negative	rights	have	no	associated 15 expense ,	such	as the	right	of free	speech .16 Positive	rights	have	an	associated	expense .17 Someone ' s	got	to pay	for	them .	A	right	demands 18 that	society	at large	has	the	obligation	of 19 provision ,	not	individuals .20 The	obligation	of	government	to 21 subsidize	impecunious	tenants	has	been	unfairly 22 fostered	upon	us ,	and	we	have	the	additional 23 burden	of	subsidizing	all	tenants ,	needy	or 24 not .25 Yet	government	looks	to	us to	help 5 
2 run	its	economic	engine ,	resulting	in	real 3 estate	taxes	that	account	for	forty	percent	or 4 more	of	our	operating	costs . The	double - digit 5 and	mid - year	tax	rate	increase	we	have	received 6 in	recent	years	will	be	unthinkable	were	they 7 rent	increases , and	guidelines ,	no	matter	how 8 high ,	can ' t	possibly	balance	them .9 Many	of	our	lawmakers	in	Albany	and 10 New	York	City	have	a	very	cavalier	attitude 11 about	this	and	have	said ,	" So ,	landlords	will 12 make	a	little	less , "	or	" I ' ve got	to	help	my 13 constituents	who	can ' t	pay	rent . "14 These	lawmakers	are	dangerous .	They 15 are	careless ,	tunnel - visioned	and	uninformed 16 about	economics	and	the	realities	of	the 17 housing	market .18 They	are	really	saying :	" I want	to 19 be	elected	again	and	I	don ' t care	if	I	destroy 20 owners	in	my	attempt . "	They	use	their 21 compassion	to	buy	votes .	They	irresponsibly 22 testify	before	you	or	stand	outside	and	ask	for 23 rent	freezes	or zero	guidelines	or	no 24 guidelines	or	low	guidelines ,	or	whatever .25 Now ,	we	small	owners	provide	the 2 
2 safest ,	best - maintained	housing ,	not	the 3 government .	There	are	no	price	controls	on	the 4 services	and	goods	we	need	to maintain	our 5 properties ,	yet	there	are	controls	on	us ,6 putting	us	in	a very	difficult	position , even 7 more	difficult	than	yours	is .8 Low	guidelines	yield	minimal	rent 9 increases	on	low	rents	and	they	don ' t	pay	for 10 an	apartment ' s	basic	operating	costs .	Most 11 tenants	in	low - rent	apartments	aren ' t	in need 12 of	subsidy .	I	know	of	many	cases	where	tenants 13 own	second	homes	and	earn	more	than	the 14 property	owner , resulting	in middle - class 15 owners	subsidizing	rich	tenants .16 In many	more	cases	middle - class 17 tenants ,	who	wouldn ' t	qualify	for	any 18 government	program ,	are	being	subsidized	by 19 middle - class	owners .20 Last	year ,	you	wisely	passed	a21 low - rent	adjustment	so	that	unreasonably	low 22 rents	would	receive	a	reasonable	increase .23 However ,	since	many	tenants	sign	two - year	lease 24 renewals ,	a	high	percentage	of	tenants	never 25 received	the	adjustment .2 
2 I	am ,	therefore ,	asking	that	in	the 3 interest	of	fairness	and	preserving	house ,	the 4 same	guidelines , and	more	especially	the 5 low - rent	adjustment ,	be	passed	again	this	year .6 Thank	you	for	your	attention .7 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .8 Any	questions ?9 A	VOICE :	Open	your	books .10 MS . ROBERTA	BERNSTEIN :	They	are 11 open .	What	about	yours ?12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .13 Faith	Steinberg .14 Is she	here ?	Faith ?	I	know	she	was 15 here .16 All	right .17 We ' ll	see	if	she	comes	back	later .18 Sandy	Rosen .19 MS . SANDY	ROSEN :	I	was	going	to 20 say	good	morning ,	but	at	this	point	it ' s good 21 afternoon .22 I	want	to	thank	you	for	the 23 opportunity	of	speaking	today .24 My name	is	Sandy	Rosen .	I	own	a25 six - family	house	in	Brooklyn .2 
2 I	am	here	to	voice	my	concern	for 3 landlords	of	small	buildings .	Now ,	let	me 4 explain	what	I	mean	by	that . I	have	a5 six - family	house .	And	I	was	here	last	year 6 commenting	the	laws	are	too	broad	and	too 7 general .	They	really	should	be	broken	down	from 8 one	to	three ,	three	to	six . It ' s	too	broad .	You 9 cannot	put	a	small	landlord	in	the	same 10 category	as	someone	who	owns	a	twenty	apartment 11 building ,	a	forty	apartment	building ,	a fifteen 12 apartment	building .13 We have	to	generate	the	same 14 expenses	with	just	six	tenants	as	someone	who 15 has	more	tenants .	So	let	me continue .16 The	cost	of	maintaining	my building 17 has	increased	as everyone	else ' s	has .	My water 18 has	increased	thirteen	percent ,	gas	6 . 519 percent ,	my	real	estate	taxes	11 . 7	percent ,20 certainly	the	electricity	company	has	increased 21 their	cost .	My	building	insurance	has	gone	up 22 and , of	course , labor	and	supplies	have 23 increased .24 This	is	just	because	of	the	dire 25 economy	that	we ' re	in	and	everybody	increases 2 
2 because	they	feel	their	expenses	have	gone	up 3 and , of	course , it	translates	to	everyone 4 else ' s	expenses	going	up .	You	have	to	meet 5 those .6 I	don ' t	know	where	we	go	for 7 compensation .	I don ' t	know	how	you	change	the 8 laws .	I	don ' t	know	how	you	regulate .9 If you	cannot	increase	the	rent	for 10 tenants ,	then	you ' ve	got	to give	the	landlords 11 some	kind	of	remuneration	for	their	cost 12 increases ,	or	freeze	utilities	from	increasing 13 their	costs .14 Does	the	Water	Board	give	me	any 15 more	than	what	I have	been	given	all	this	time ?16 Just	that	the	prices	go	up .17 What	is	Con	Edison	doing	for	me ?	Are 18 they	doing	anything	beneficial	to	me ,	but	yet 19 they ' ll	raise	their	cost	of electricity ?20 The	heating	goes	up .	It ' s	still	the 21 same	heating .	It ' s	just	costing	me	more	to	heat 22 my	house .23 There	have	been	no	improvements 24 anywhere	that	they	give	me	as a	landlord ,	but	I25 have	to	meet	these	expenses .2 
2 How	do	I	translate	it	to	a tenant ?	I3 was	once	a	tenant .	I	understand	their	plight .4 But	how	do	we	equalize	this	so	that	everybody 5 is	not	burdened	and	that	I	can	keep	my	building 6 running	in	a	safe	and	secure	manner ?7 I	meet	all	my	expenses .	I	pay	my 8 bills .	I	do	not	have	any	outstanding	loans .	And 9 if	there	is	anything	wrong	with	the	building ,	I10 repair	it .11 I	have	nobody	going	to	court .12 Now ,	I	will	tell	you ,	if	I have	a13 vacancy ,	I ' m	very	careful	about	who	I	rent	it 14 to	because	I	have	other	landlords	in	the	area 15 that	I ' ve	known	since	I ' ve	been	a	child . This 16 building	has	been	in	my	family	and	mine	for 17 many ,	many	years .18 Do you	know	- - I ' m	going	to make 19 this	very	brief . I	had	a	real	estate	agent	who 20 said	to	me	would	I	be	willing	to	take	in an 21 illegal	alien	as a	tenant .	This	is	what	I	am 22 faced	with .23 I	don ' t	know	how	you	are	going	to	be 24 able	to	help	the	small	landlord .	And	I	say 25 small ,	because	the	laws	are	too	blanket . And 2 
2 you	cannot	expect	the	small	landlord	to deal 3 with	laws	that	apply	to	larger	land	owners .4 That ' s	all	I	have	to	say	at this 5 time .6 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .7 MS . SANDY	ROSEN :	I	don ' t want	to 8 burden	anybody	with	any	more .9 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .10 ( Applause . )11 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Romeo	Ymalay .12 MR . ROMEO	YMALAY :	Good	afternoon ,13 Board	Members .14 My name	is	Romeo	Ymalay .	I ' m	a15 legislative	aide	for	State	Senator	Tom	Duane 16 and	I	am	reading	his	testimony	for	the	record .17 My name	is	Thomas	K .	Duane	and	I18 represent	New	York	State ' s	29 th	Senate 19 District .	This	mixed - income	district	is 20 composed	largely	of	tenants , thousands	of them 21 rent	stabilized , many	of	whom	already	allocate 22 too	high	a	percentage	of	their	incomes	to pay 23 their	rent .24 Thank	you	for	the	opportunity	to 25 present	testimony	before	the	New	York	City	Rent 2 
2 Guidelines	Board	on	its	proposed	rent	increases 3 for	the	approximately	one	million	apartments 4 that	remain	subject	to	the	New	York	City	Rent 5 Stabilization	Law .6 I	am	dismayed	that	the	RGB	is	even 7 considering	rent	increases	of 2	percent	to	4 . 58 percent	for	one - year	lease	renewals	and	49 percent	to	7 . 5	percent	for	two - year	lease 10 renewals	in	light	of	the	current	economic 11 climate	and	the	steady	rent	increases	the	RGB 12 has	approved	in years	past .13 Passing	additional	financial	burdens 14 onto	tenants ,	many	of	whom	are	still	reeling 15 from	prior	increases ,	would	be	an	unfair	and 16 unnecessary	hardship ,	particularly	when	the 17 RGB ' s	own	yearly	Income	and	Expense	Studies 18 from	2007	to	2009	have	shown	landlords ' net 19 operating	income	has	increased	1 . 9	percent ,	8 . 820 percent	and	9 . 3 percent	respectively .21 As you	know ,	these	are	especially 22 difficult	times	for	New	York ' s	working	people .23 In his	Fiscal	Year	2010	Executive 24 Budget	released	on	May	1 ,	2009 ,	Mayor	Bloomberg 25 forecast	that	the	City	will	lose	328 , 000	jobs 2 
 2 during	this	recession	and	stated	that	105 , 000 3 jobs	had	already	been	lost	since	August	2008 .4 In his	testimony	last	month	before 5 the	RGB ,	James	Parrot ,	Deputy	Director	and 6 Chief	Economist	of	the	Fiscal	Policy	Institute ,7 noted	that	the	City	unemployment	rate	has	risen 8 to	8 . 2	percent	while	real	median	wages	fell	by 9 3 . 5 percent	from	2001	to	2008 ,	and	the	median 10 household	income	for	renters ,	adjusted	for 11 inflation ,	fell	by	4 . 2	percent	from	2001	to 12	2007 .13 According	to	U . S .	Representative 14 Anthony	Weiner , Federal	census	data	shows	that 15 more	than	a	quarter	of	New	York	City	renters 16 are	spending	fifty	percent	or more	of	their 17 income	on	housing .18 New	York ' s	rent	regulated	tenants 19 simply	cannot	afford	another	rent	increase 20 under	these	circumstances .21 The	RGB	has	historically	justified 22 annual	rent	increases	by	citing	its	Price	Index 23 of	Operating	Costs .	This	year ' s	Price	Index 24 found	that	operating	costs	for	rent - stabilized 25 buildings	increased	by	4	percent	in	the	past 13 
2 year ,	down	from	7 . 8	percent	in	2008 .3 However ,	as	I	noted	in	my	testimony 4 before	you	last	year ,	the	Price	Index	measures 5 changes	in	the	cost	of	items	landlords 6 typically	purchase	to	run	their	buildings ,7 rather	than	actual	expenditures ,	and	it 8 contains	no	information	about	the	incomes 9 landlords	collect .10 As a	result ,	it is	misleading	and	it 11 is	not	an	appropriate	tool	to use	to	justify 12 rent	increases .13 A	more	meaningful	report	is the 14 RGB ' s	annual	Income	and	Expense	Study	because 15 it	shows	landlords '	net	operating	income .	The 16 RGB ' s	2009	Income	and	Expense	Study	shows	that ,17 even	while	landlords '	operating	costs	increased 18 by	5 . 2	percent	over	the	price	year ,	their 19 rental	income	increased	by	6 . 5	percent	and	net 20 operating	income	increased	9 . 3	percent .21 Last	year ,	the	RGB	ignored	its 22 Income	and	Expense	Study	which	showed 23 landlords '	net	operating	income	had	increased 24 8 . 8 percent ,	and	passed	its	highest	rent 25 increases	in	twenty	years :	4 . 5	percent	for 2 
2 one - year	lease	renewals	and	8 . 5	percent	for 3 two - year	lease	renewals .4 This	exposes	the	degree	to which	the 5 system	is	skewed	against	tenants .	Indeed ,	this 6 fundamental	anti - tenant	bias	is	one	of	the 7 reasons	New	York	State	Assemblymember	George 8 Latimer	and	I	have	introduced	and	are	committed 9 to	passing	a	Rent	Board	Reform	bill	that	would 10 revamp	the	method	of	establishing	rent 11 adjustments	- -12 ( Applause . )13 MR . ROMEO	YMALAY :	- -	for 14 rent - regulated	apartments	in New	York	City	and 15 suburban	counties .16 While	we	continue	to	press	for 17 passage	of	this	legislation , it	behooves	the 18 RGB	to	reject	rent	increases	that	serve	only	to 19 enhance	landlord	profits	and	further 20 destabilize	New	York	City ' s affordable	housing 21 stock .22 As you	all	are	very	much	aware ,	New 23 York	continues	to be	in	a	housing	crisis	with 24 affordable	housing	stock	rapidly	dwindling	in 25 the	midst	of	the	worst	economic	downturn	since 2

According	to	the	RGB	report	entitled 
4 " Changes	to	the	Rent	Stabilized	Housing	Stock 5 in	New	York	City	in	2008 , "	there	was	a	net 6 decrease	of	8 , 267	rent - stabilized	apartments 7 throughout	the	five	boroughs	last	year , over 8 3000	more	units	than	were	lost	in	2007 .9 The	report	cites	Division	of	Housing 10 and	Community	Renewal	rent	registration	records 11 that	indicate	12 , 800	units	were	deregulated	in 12 2008	because	of the	vacancy	decontrol	law ,	an 13 alarming	increase	- -14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	need	to	wrap 15 up .16 MR . ROMEO	YMALAY :	- -	of	about	24 17 percent	from	10 , 342	- -18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Especially	since 19 we	didn ' t	- -	we never	put	the	clock	on , so 20 you ' re	at	six	minutes .21 MR . ROMEO	YMALAY :	Sure .22 I ' m almost	done .23 - - an	alarming	increase	of about	24 24 percent	from	10 , 342	in	2007 .25 The	RGB	is	meant	to	determine	rent 4 
2 adjustments	based	on	the	relative	cost	of 3 maintaining	and	financing	buildings ,	the 4 available	housing	supply	as defined	by	the 5 vacancy	rate ,	and	the	cost	of living .6 If the	Board	bases	its	decision	on 7 these	standards , and	I	strongly	urge	it to	do 8 so , it	will	impose	a	freeze	on	rents	for	all 9 rent	regulated	apartments	as well	as	for	lofts ,10 hotels ,	rooming	houses ,	single	room	occupancy 11 buildings	and	lodging	houses .12 Given	all	the	facts ,	the	only 13 acceptable	outcome	of	this	Board ' s	vote	is	no 14 rent	increases .15 Thank	you	for	your	consideration	of 16 my	remarks .17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .18 ( Applause . )19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Question .20 MS .

ROMEO	YMALAY :	With	the	current 6 situation	in	Albany	we	are	not	sure .	But	the 7 Senator	- -8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	That ' s	the	most 9 accurate	statement	anybody	has	made	today .10 MS . ADAMS :	And	my	other	question	is 11	- -12 MR . ROMEO	YMALAY :	Sure .13 MS . ADAMS :	- - are	there	other 14 things	that	the	Senator	is	involved	with	that 15 would	address	some	of	the	problems	that	you 16 cited ?	Housing	would	not	be covered	if	the 17 legislation	- -18 MR . ROMEO	YMALAY :	Sure .19 As I	mentioned , there	is	a vacancy 20 decontrol	law	and	that ' s	one	of	the	Senator ' s21 top	priorities , to	repeal	that	law .22 MS . ADAMS :	Thank	you .23 MR .
