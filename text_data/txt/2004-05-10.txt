2 As I sat here over the last  few
3 weeks - -45
(Audience participation.)MR. PAGAN:	- -  I know there were
6	three issues that were important to, seems  to7 have been important to the owner.	One was the8 issue of lead paint ; insurance and taxes.9 And quickly as I went through  my10	note I notice that specif ically the testimony11	that Mr. Andrew Goldberg12 (Audience participat ion .)13 MR. PAGAN:	Now - ­14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. PAGAN:	Okay.16 The testimony that Andy17 Goldberg and Cashay	(phonetic) was very18 interesting.	In particular, because they  put19 in context the issue of the lead law .20 When the last law, I  believe21 1999, was struck down we had the Local Law 1  of22 1982 , which is a very stringent law in23 reference to the actions that an owner has  to24 take and in order to evade lead paint in  their25 apartments.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2 The local law that was passed  in3 2004, Local Law 1, gave them a little bit  more4 time to get the things done and it makes it   a
5	lot easier.6
The testimony of Mr. Schultz  was
7 interesting because,  in general, the position8 of HPD in part icular was that this was very
 9	expensive. 10
Yes, it was very expensive,  but
11 it was very expensive to the  City.12 That' s what I got of the13 testimony.14 They have to spend money in15 getting testing done and getting  abatement16 certification done.	So there is expense that17 otherwise come to the owners that are now,   that18 the City have to take  over.19 A VOICE:	Wrong.20 MR. PAGAN:	The number of21 lead- based cases really has been dropping,22 according to the City.	That's another thing23 that we have to take into  account.24 There was a time when there  was25 many cases coming in, especially for   childrenROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC .521 Fifth Avenue , 17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2 under seven.	Now those numbers keep on3 dropping.	It means that many of the  apartments4 that were there no longer have the same  problem5 as we had, including many of the  renovations6 having been done in the past have been  abating7 the lead.8 Taxes are based on two  things.9 One is the tax rate has been given and  the10 second part is the assessment.	We notice that11 we haven' t heard any issues about increasing12 the tax rate this year.	As a matter of fact ,13 they' re talking about , in certain cases, giving14 some rebate.15 (Audience participation.)16 MR. PAGAN:	Over the last two17 years we have seen the assessment really   has18 not gone up because of the issues in many  of19 the neighborhoods.	Tax assessment is one  of20 the areas that have, really  have dropped.	It21 may come up , but  I don' t think it 's going to22 come up to the levels that were there  before.23 So we have, in reference  to24 insurance,  " Cranes" put out a report on,   I25 believe it was in April 14th, I don' t have  theROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2 name, where they indicated that this year   in3 particular,	insurance rates have dropped4 between  10 and  20 percent .5 (Audience participat ion.)6 MR. PAGAN:	We' re looking at7 drops in insurance.8 Not only that , the other part is9 that more insurance companies are coming in   to10 the City.	It's going to be more  competition11 for insurance.
1213 things.       
Insurance rates are based on two One is the returns on the investments        
14 by the companies.	And the second part has  to15 do with liabilities and  claims.16 The return on investments is17 something that started dropping  before18 September 11, 2001.	It dropped further down19 after September 11th with the coming back  of
20 the stock market.21 come back.
Those things are starting  to
22 On the other hand, as we saw in23 the income and affordability expense,  the24 economy shrunk by 2.2 percent back in  2003 .	So25 people' s income dropped.	Unemployment ratesROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue , 17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2 increased by 8.4 percent.	The average number3 of families in temporary shelters each  night4 increased by 14 percent.	There were 318,0005 cases of nonpayment in court .	And i t	looked6 more likely that there will be a major cut   in7 Section 8, which is one of the ways  that8 tenants have as a way of paying the  rent.9 In prior years, recommendation10 of staff for increases based on their   studies11 have been ignored.	For that reason we need  to12 make sure that this year increases that  take13 into account all these years of increases   than14 was higher than what was recommended on the15 traditional  convention adjustment are16 considered.17 For that reason my mot ion is to,18 zero percent  increase for one and two-year19 (Audience participation.)20 (Applause.)21 MR.

2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma' am.3 Both of you, quiet .4 MR. LUBELL:	We can't affect5 those poor tenants because we can't  provide6 them with additional income.	Someone who is7	unemployed or paying 60 percent or more of her8 income for rent doesn' t require a stabilization9 of cost or only a modest	increase of expenses.10 The plain fact is that she  needs income.	And11	we on the Board can't deliver.12 We also can't do much for  the13 owners of those distressed buildings.	Since14 our guidelines are simply inadequate to give15 them appropriate  relief  - -16 (Audience participation.)17 MR.  LUBELL:	- - they too need18 some form of public  assistance.19 (Audience participation.)20 MR. LUBELL:	On the other hand,21 we do affect thousands of owners who  need22 income to maintain their buildings,23 particularly  those buildings  - -24 (Audience participation.)25 MR.

2 Brooklyn, Queens and , yes, even in many  areas3 of Manhattan where there is little or  no4 turnover in tenancy.5 (Audience part icipation. )6	MR. LUBELL:	If we deprive these7 owners of an adequat e increase to pay soaring8 real estate taxes  - -9	(Audience participation.)10	MR. LUBELL:	Let me remind the11	Board that 's been an increase of 31 percent12 over two years.13 Yes, 3 1 percent.14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. LUBELL:	And Mr. Pagan, the16 increase of insurance costs over two years  has17 been 55 percent.18 Yes.	55 percent.19 (Audience participation.)20 MR. LUBELL:	The increase of21 audit charges over a two- year period , 1222 percent.	These are facts.23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. LUBELL:	I didn't have to25 read it in " Cranes. "	These  are facts.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
2 (Audience participation.)3 MR. LUBELL:	If we don' t give4 enough money to pay these increases then  we' re5 jeopardizing a substantial port ion of our6 housing stock and the many thousands of   tenants7 who live in those  buildings.8 (Audience part icipation.)9 MR. LUBELL:	We should have read10 in the news recently that another spike in   fuel11 oil is not unlikely as oil prices reached $40   a12 barrel , which is a 13 -year  high.13 (Audience part icipation.)14 MR. LUBELL:	And don' t believe15 the bubbameister,  that is the false old wive' s16 tale, for those who don' t know what a17 bubbameister  is, that the entire spectrum of18 the real estate industry is in great  shape.19 Just as we know that the economic  recovery20 doesn' t do much for the very poor and it21 doesn' t do much for many of our unemployed.22 And just as there are poor tenants, there  are23 poor buildings.24 (Audience participation.)25 MR.

1	242 for a nano- second, that' s a little fraction of3 a second , that buyers are lining up to buy4 16-unit  buildings  in Rockaway,  Brownsville ,5 Hunts Point , Morrisania, Ridgewood and the many6 other neighborhoods  that are effected by our
7	guidelines.8
We also need to recognize  the
9 cumulative negative  impact of continued10 dramat ic, often dramatic increased costs for11 the thousands of buildings that are  marginally12 prof itable.13 Last year' s guidelines  - ­14 (Audience participation. )15 MR. LUBELL:	Last year's16 guidelines hardly compensated owners for the17 fuel costs and real estate tax increases  of18 that year.	And bear in mind that the  200319 price index reflected a core increase of  10.620 percent .	Forget about the fuel increase.	A21 core price increase of  10.6 percent.	And it22 wasn' t much different for the 2004 price  index,23 which showed a 9.2 percent core  price24 increase.25 Let 's not make the situation any ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175

3 buildings4
(Audience participat ion. )
5	MR. LUBELL:	They need our6 help.	They need our help to  survive.7 We should also be aware  that8 more than 50 percent of our housing  stock9 predat es 1950 and requires increased10 maintenance.	And again, that 's where most of11 our vulnerabl e housing exists.12 Finally, let 's further recognize13 that buildings predating	1960, regardless of14 what you have heard just a moment ago,  will15 also have increased costs due to Local Law  1 .16 (Audience participation.)17 MR. LUBELL:	I included in the18 package for the Board today, not a  confusing19 chart reflect ing a 1982 law that was never20 enforced, replaced by a 1938 law that  was21 challenged by the people who sought  to22 challenge everything that has been dealing   with23 lead paint since 1982.24 I included in your package  a25 copy of the notice of petition  challengingROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175

MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you, Mr.
4 During  last year's discussions5 and compromises we emphasized the need for  more6 affordable housing as the salient solution   to7 the inadequacies of the housing market as  well8 as to the most times troublesome tasks  this9 Board addressed.10 As noted during this year' s11 testimony and responses to the Board' s12 questions, it appears that a lack of  income13 rather than relative rent levels is the  real14 dilemma.	And publ ic policy should be toward15 supplementing  income, not  forcing landlords16 into subsidizing housing  costs  - -17 (Audience participation.)18 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - subsidizing19 housing costs by artificially  restricting  rent20 increases and thus straining the limits  of21 operating habitable apartments.22 (Audience participation.)23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Housing stock,24 deterioration has waned in the last few   years.25 The qual ity of the housing stock has improvedROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
2 because of this type of reinvestment   landlords3 put back into their  inventory.4 (Audience participation.)5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But continuance6 of such destructive,  restrictive rent  increase7 action will only serve to cause more  property8 in distress  and  increase  abandonments - -9 (Audience participation.)10 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - which goes to11 reduce the stock of exist ing affordable housing12 opportunity.13 (Audience participation. )14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Also, the right15 to a renewal lease with limited rent  increases16 is not a birth right , but a   privilege.
171819	Board - - 2021 
(Audience participation. ) MR. SCHLEIDER:	And this(Audience participation. )MR. SCHLEIDER:	And this Board
22 needs to realize  - -23 (Audience participation.)24 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - a renewal25 lease is not a birthright.	And especially notROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2 a birthright with limited renewal rent  leases.3 It 's a privilege.4 (Audience participation.)5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And this Board6 needs to realize that all part ies to the7 housing situation need to pull their  weight.8 The affordability figures9 indicate that the median rent stabilized  rent10 is $700 a month, which equates to  a11 rent - to- income ratio significantly lower than12 what the federal government  sets for its13 housing programs.14 If the 30 percent federal15 income- to- rent ratio was applied to the median16 rent stabilized income of $32,000 a year,  the17 median rent stabilized rent would rise to 800   a18 mont h, a 14.3 percent increase.19 (Audience part icipation.)20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Last year's21 numbers show, and this year' s numbers continue22 the uphill march in landlord operating costs23 with a 28.5 percent combined two-year  increase24 with the O and M cost - to- rent ratio increasing25 this year alone  to  46.7 percent	- -ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue , 17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2 (Audience participation.)3 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - a 14 and a4 half percent  increase from the prior year.5 (Audience part icipation. )6	MR. SCHLEIDER:	The books were7 presented in testimony.	And as the testimony8 showed, this O and M ratio was an  important9 indicator of profitability,	with the higher the10	cost ratio the lower the  prof itability.	And11	the current ratio clearly signals that a large12 rent increase is necessary to compensate  the13 landlords  for years - -14 (Audience part icipation. )15 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - years of16 increased costs without  the necessary rental17 income relief.18 (Audience participation.)19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	It 's not20 surprising then that net operating income   for21 rent stabilized buildings  actually declined  by22 a tenth of a percent last  year.23 (Audience part icipation. )24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there a25 motion  in there somewhere, Mr. Schleider?ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes, there is.3 (Audience participation.)45	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Under the net6	revenue formula, the guideline that  would7 preserve net operating income in the face  of8 this year 6.9 percent rise in direct operating9 prices, that formula suggests a 5 and a  half10	percent increase for a one- year lease and  911	percent for a two-year lease.12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	If under the14 CPI - adjusted operating income formula, which15 looks forward and accounts for the  anticipated16 increase in inflation and the current rise   in17 operat ing price costs, this formula indicates  a18 7 percent one-year lease increase and an 11   and19 a half percent increase for a two-year   lease.20 (Audience participation.)21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The motion will22 present ed by Mr. Lubell.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.24 (Audience part icipation. )25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Motion.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue , 17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2 Mr . Lubell .3 MR. LUBELL:	I am moving for a4 guideline which is not unusual.	We had this5 guideline when I first came on the Board in   6	1984- 85.7 (Audience participation. )8 MR. LUBELL:	The guideline again9 in 1986 and	'87, the guideline again in10 1988- 89 , where the price index and the real11 increase was not as great as it was last  year12 and  this year .13 And the guideline then, which  is14 reasonable this year, reasonable,  is 6 percent15 for one year and 9 percent for two years.16 (Audience participation. )17 MR.

19 motion, Chair.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead .21 (Audience participat ion.)22 MS. HOLDER:	Mr. Lubell is23 right .	This is a very, very  difficult24 situation we find ourselves in.	But I think25 that it 's difficult for much different reasonsROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2 than Mr. Lubell does.3 I sit on a Rent Guidelines  Board4 and before I sat on this Board I used to  watch5 a Rent Guidelines Board that year after  year6 paid attention or was only drawn to the  issue7 of rent stabilized property owners'  expenses8 only.	This was especially true last year  when9 the price index of operating costs, a  severely10 flawed measure of owners' actual expenses,  was11 unusually high.12 Two years ago when the PIOC was13 low the same attention was not given  and14 tenants  weren' t  given the true readjustment ,15 downward readjustment that was necessary  at16 that time.17 (Audience participation.)18 MS. HOLDER:	It is our19 obligation, Board, to consider other  factors,20 including, crucially, the issue of  owners'21 incomes and , perhaps most importantly, we have22 a vital and a real responsibility to  consider23 the economic situation of rent  stabilized24 tenants.25 It 's not enough to say that ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2 people need more income and consequently   then3 we just don' t pay attent ion to that as a factor
4	in our5
deliberations.No.	We have to consider  that
6	the median income for rent stabilized  tenants7 is $31,000 a year.	That' s the median income8 here in New York City.	And that owners' median9 income is almost double that , over $60,000 a10 year.11 (Audience part icipation.)12 MS. HOLDER:	We have to consider13 the prevalence of unemployment , of the14 unemployed that we know of .	It 's 8.4 percent.15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.17 (Audience participation.)18 MS. HOLDER:	There are a number19 of people that are invisible , who are visibly20 unemployed.	We know this as New Yorkers.	I21 know this as a legal  aid attorney.	There are22 thousands upon thousands in addition that  are23 not captured in that 8.4  percent number.	We24 all know this.25 (Audience participation .) ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2	MS. HOLDER:	We have to consider3 profit , the overall profit	factors in New York4 City.	We can't ignore that and cannot  continue5 to give it short shrift and say that  it's6 someone else' s responsibility  to deal with
7	that .8

HOLDER:	- - are housed18 nightly in the New York City shelter  system.19 This is unacceptable during  a20 time, a time when we supposedly have the  best21 systems in place to deal with anti or  eviction22 prevention.	It is unacceptable.	But we know23 that it is due to these unfathomable  rent24 increases that we continue to see over and   over25 and over and over again.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175

I'm suggesting a24 different approach this year; that is, I  want25 to suggest a mot ion that would have for aROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
2 one-year lease a range and for a two-year   lease3 a range for rent increases which then we   can4 debate and listen to the  testimony.5 Because we have a fixation on  a6 particular number and this is very early in   the7 process right now and I believe that this   Board8 is not ready to make a final decision or  to9 even have a preliminary without having a   range.10 I am going  to suggest , because11 my Chairmanship at least , I believe that  the12 Board needs to look at  all factors.	And13 despit e the testimony or debate that we have14 heard , we have looked at all factors.	We look15 and we have an income and affordability   study.16 We have a price index.	We have income and17 expense.	Many, many factors.	Both sides seem18 to be looking for a silver- bullet - type number.19 But there is no silver-bullet - type number.20 So I suggest that the range  for21 a one- year lease be 3 percent to 5 and a half22 percent	for a one -year lease.23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Five and a25 half to 7 and a half percent for a  two- yearROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175

HOLDER:	New Yorkers deserve15 this.	We' re talking about over 2 million16 households who are affected  by this.	This is17 one of the most important things that is  going18 on in renters lives this year.19 Can we talk about what the20 public members participating,	what is on21 everyone' s mind about the testimony that we22 have had and the reports that have been   issued23 by our most excellent staff that would  warrant24 such high increases knowing full well  that25 tenants need to have a readjustment , actually aROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175

23 brief .
MR. ZELNIK:	I will be very
4 With respect to the range,  I5 find it diff icult at this point to support any6 range that would be in excess of last  year' s7 numbers at this point.8 (Audience participation.)9 MR. ZELNIK:	I do, however, Mr.10 Chair, support the notion of a range that  might11 deal with building types as opposed  to12 percent	- -13 (Audience participation.)14 MR.  ZELNIK:	- - but I know that15 is not on the table at this  point.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me just17 clarify what we mean by range so that it 's18 totally clear.	Because that item about by19 building type is on the floor if you want   to20 make an amendment to  that.21 This is a preliminary  guideline22 and therefore this is, the Guidelines  Board23 cannot adopt a guideline that says for  a24 one- year lease one can choose between 3 percent25 and 5 and a half.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue , 17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2 This is a range for public3 discussion,  for public hearing.4 I appreciat e what you're saying.5 Just  so we understand , the6 intention of the Chair, because this is  very7 early in the process, we have not heard  from8 many, many people, we have only had  the9 reports, which as you know, are complicat ed  and10 detailed and take a lot of t ime to digest.	We11 have had some invited testimony.	Despite both12 sides feeling that we don' t listen to the13 testimony, I believe that the public  members14 do, in fact , listen to the testimony.15 I believe that the process  would16 be well served to provide for a range  of17 possible outcomes.	But let 's make it clear18 that the ultimate outcome will be a  single19 number for a one-year lease and a  two-year20 lease.

So the range is for the public
23 I just want ed to clarify that.24 (Audience participation.)25 MR. ZELNIK:	I understand , Mr. ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue , 17th Floor, New York, New York  10175

2 MR. ZELNIK:	My feeling is that3 this is probably one of the most critical   areas4 of housing in New York City that this Board  has5 to address.	I bel ieve last year this Board6	made an attempt to provide additional  income7 for the owners of these hotels and SROs  and8 lodging houses by passing an increase of  3 .59 percent.10	Based on the information that  I11	have received to date and the sense of what 's12 happening with SROs and Class A and B  hotels,13 my feeling is that what we did last year   didn't14 work in terms of stemming the tide of  losing15 SROs and affordable housing in the  City.16 Accordingly,	I would like to17 make the following motion for the Board   to18 consider:19 In recognition of the lack  of20 sufficient affordable housing in New York City,21 and the ever increasing homeless  population;
22 and 23
Recognizing that owners of  rent
24 stabilized hotels have continued to  remove25 existing housing units from this  stipulatedROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC .521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
2 housing type and its various subcategories;   and3 Further recognizing that  the4 owners of these properties  continue to convert5 these housing units as a result of  market6 pressures that bring them substantially   higher7 rentals than the legally rent  stabilized8 rentals or any Rent Guideline Board increases;9 and10 Recognizing  that these11 conversions have been brought  about through  the12 rental of these units by colleges as  dormitory13 space, the conversion of these spaces  to14 boutique tourist hotels, or the rental of   these15 units by other not for profits;  and16 Further recognizing that  these17 owners continue to make illegal alterations  to18 these units that result in harassment of  the19 tenants;20 It is hereby resolved that  the21 renewal decrease for:22 Residential  Class A Hotels be23 minus 3 .5 percent.

2 for public hearing purposes of zero to  23 percent.4	It is the Chair' s intention at5 this point , subject to public hearing, to vote,6 in fact , for zero at the final hearing, but we7 would like to have people debat e this matter .8 This is a preliminary  guideline.9 Consistent with that we  will10 provide in the draft language the proviso   as11 currently writt en, the proviso providing  for no12 increase provided that at least 75 percent  of13 the units are available, the way the proviso   is14 writt en .15 I would like to, further like  to16 say that if the ultimat e adoption were zero17 that the proviso be removed, however  there18 would be appropriate  language indicating,  in19 the text of the Board' s report indicating  that20 the Board realizes that the proviso  is21 important and should the Board , the Board' s22 intent , that should the Board have a level of23 rent increases in future years in the  event24 that the number is zero next time, at the  final25 vot e the Board would provide for such a  provisoROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue , 17th Floor, New York, New York  10175

And I16 think  it ' s too high to start the  discussion.17 I think we' re all fully aware,18 if not we need to become intimately  aware,19 looking at the testimony of the types of  units20 these are, the landlords, the  substantial21 prof its that they reap from the transient22 guests that they have, from rent ing out to  the23 City itself , as well as universities and24 colleges, I think we need to continue  with25 we need to establish a zero percent   increaseROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2 and keep the proviso in  effect.3 Even with the proviso in  effect4 hotel owners are still able to reap  substantial5 prof its by renting out their remaining rooms  to6 these transient guests at  nightly rates.	We7 know how high they get.	We know how the8 tenants in these units live as compared to   the9 transient guests.	This is the housing of last10 resort.
1112 it tonight.   
I would like for us to deal with  I don' t think this matter needs a   
13 range.	There is no increases that  are14 justified.15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any additional17 debate?18 Go ahead, Mr. Schleider.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You have owners20 that are just barely hanging on to this  type21 housing stock, this housing of last  resort.22 With the proviso only  those23 owners who are adhering to the rules, who   are24 providing	this housing of last recourse,  are25 getting the advantage of a rent increase   thatROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
 2 isn't sufficient to cover their  costs.3 By putt ing a negative or even a4 zero or even an increase that isn't as high  as5 last year on the table , you're effectively6 decimating that industry.

CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.MR. LUBELL:	These are spaces

11 that frequently are incredibly  valuable.12 for purposes of , just for purposes of
And
13 discussion, why don' t we at least have the  same14 guideline for lofts as we do for  apartments?15 And I can't understand why  we16 single them out differently.	We're talking17 about somet imes space that 's worth a million18 and a half dollars, $2 million on a  premarket.19 I am just , a friendly amendment ,20 3 to 5 and a half percent ; 5    and a half to 721 and a half percent for purposes of  discussion.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I am not going23 to accept that amendment.24 I appreciate your vot es on some25 of the other things.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175

234 have debate.
MR. LUBELL:	Can I ask why? CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' re going toAnd obviously the Board has  the
5 power within that to  go higher.	We have6 traditionally been lower.	It has a lot to do7 with utilities and what have  you.8 I think that the difference  is9 justified.10 At least for now, I think  that11 we ought to stay with our  rhythm.12 MS. HOLDER:	Chair?13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.14 MS. HOLDER:	I think that the15 range that is being proposed  is too high  for16 the same reasons that we have said in the  past.17 One , the economic  indices don' t18 relate that there should be this  range19 discussed or even considered.20 But , secondly, because tenants21 in these spaces do pay for their own ut ilities.22 And given that the landlords always try to   tell23 us these types of services cost so much,  and24 then for tenants to have to bear  those25 increases on top of the expenses of  maintainingROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175

7 purpose, I will vot e yes.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Motion passes9	5 -4.10 Let me just make sure, let  me11 offer an amendment going back to  the12 apartments; that the apartment guideline,  the13 draft guideline will have no vacancy  allowance.14 I think I neglect ed to say that.15 Earlier  I said no supplemental16 adjustment.	No equalization allowance,  1017 percent  sublet allowance, but  I didn't , I18 believe, offer an amendment on the  vacancy19 allowance.20 So I offer an amendment on  no21 vacancy allowance.22 Second?23 MS. LUSSKIN:	Second.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any debat e?25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue , 17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	We have had4 testimony,  even the tenants' representatives5 have said that the lowest rent units don' t turn6	over.	If you're trying to prot ect that class7 of tenancy, you don' t need to take away a8 vacancy allowance from those apartments  that9 the landlord can use to help subsidize the   rest10 of the building .11 By taking away the  vacancy12 allowance and giving the landlord the chance   to13 at least bring up to market some of the  units14 in their buildings,  these apartments don' t turn15 over all that frequently.	You may have one16 turnover in seven years, eight years.17 Anybody who has a  rent18 stabil ized apartment and enjoys a significant19 positive leasehold , which means that their  rent20 is well below market , they are not going21 anywhere.	Maybe they can't afford to  go22 anywhere, but there are not going to  go23 anywhere.	That apartment is not going to  free24 up.	You're going to get it when somebody  moves25 out of the area or leaves feet first .ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
1	872 It 's unfair not to allow the3 landlords to at least capture a market - orient ed4 increase on those apartments.	It 's still going5 to be under the Rent Stabilization Law,  because6 most of the rents, the vast majority of  the7 rents in the suburbs, the market rents are  well8 below the 2000 a month  threshold.
9 You know that .10 this Board knows that.
And the rest of
11 To take away this vacancy12 increase and allow these landlords to  somehow13 subsidize the paltry increases that this  Board14 promot es each year is unfathomable and unfair.15 MR. LUBELL:	Just as a matter of16 clarif icat ion, this vacancy allowance is in17 addition to the statutory vacancy allowance   of18 20 percent .19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Correct.20 And that is my point.21 My feeling is that we do  not22 have the power to adopt a vacancy  allowance.23 In fact , the legislature has24 spoken on that question numerous times both25 giving a 20 percent turnover and while  theROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
2 owners  asked , and having  a destabilization3 above 2000, et cetera, et  cetera.4 So forgetting about the  debate,5 I don't believe it 's in the power of the6 Board.	The Board never voted such an increase ,7 as far as I know .	And if it was, in my8 personal belief , it is not within the legal9 power.	The legislature has spoken on  this10 particular matter and has taken away  that11 right , in my opinion, from the Board.12 MR. LUBELL:	Can we ask for a13 clarification?14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You can ask
