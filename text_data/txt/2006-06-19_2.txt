2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. We will.3	Why don't you sit down.	We'll find4 the translator and then5 So why don't we go to Lisette6 Mendez.7 DIRECTOR PAGAN:	(Speaking Spanish.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Make sure if I9 call your name let me know if you're planning to10 speak in Spanish or any other language.11 DIRECTOR PAGAN:	(Speaking12 Spanish. )13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Hold on14 one second.	Okay, you can start.15 Ms. Mendez.16 MS. LISETTE MENDEZ:	Okay. My17 name is Lisette Mendez.18 I reside at the Bronx, 296419 Valentine Avenue.	And I also work at the Lower20 East Side.21 With my experience as a tenant22 organizer I see a lot of displacement because23 people cannot afford the rent.	And as a resident24 of the Bronx I see that when I went to get my25 apartment, I'm paying a very high price for my9 
1	1022 apartment.	My apartment is in very disrepair.3 And besides that, landlords are not doing4 anything to fix the building or the apartment.5 Sometimes tenants withhold the rent6 because they want to go to court and dispute that7 in court in the way they can get repairs done.8 But as it is, you know that if you withhold the9 rent and the landlord give you a non-payment10 petition, you will have a bad credit because they11 will say that you don't pay the rent.12 It's not that it's just that you13 want repairs done, but at the same time people14 are getting, especially seniors, disabled.	And15 people who work and they work in, you know,16 factories and they get a low pay, you know,17 displace because of the rent are too high.	And18 we want, at least for myself, and see people that19 they are not displaced and that the rent will be20 freeze for these two years.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 (Applause.)2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Silva.24 The lady behind you is the25 translator.24 
2	Can you tell her?3	DIRECTOR PAGAN: (In Spanish.)4 MS. MARY SILVA:	(Through5 interpreter) the communities that she mentioned6 near Jerome Avenue and they have - - all the7 buildings need a lot of repairs.	And this is8 nothing new, it's been going on for a long time.9 I'm hoping - - that what I wish for10 is for the landlords of all these buildings to11 have some heart and have some dignity for the12 tenants.	If they want to raise the rent two or13 three dollars, that's no problem, but they should14 take care of the buildings.15 (Applause.)16 MS. MARY SILVA:	The poor people of17 the Bronx can't afford to have - - they cannot18 afford to have breakfast and lunch because of the19 rent, that most of the money goes into the rent.20 They can't really afford anything else with21 everything going up, the electricity and all the22 bills.23 The reason why they want to increase24 they want to increase the rent, the landlords,25 is because they want the people out of the4 
2 buildings.3 They should respect the people they4 know that they can't afford to pay this rents.5 Things are - -6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 Go ahead.8 MS. MARY SILVA:	Things are going9 to get really bad because the people, they're not10 willing to pay the rent increase and that they11 should listen to the tenants.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 Gracias.14 (Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker16 is Jose Rodriguez.17 Is Mr. Castro going to speak?18 You'll be - - yes?	Okay.19 Mr. Rodriguez;20 Mr. Castro;21 Then Hilda Chavez.22 Mr. Rodriguez, Jose Rodriguez, is he23 here?24 (No response.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Castro.9 
2 Mr. Castro.3 MR. JERRY CASTRO:	Good afternoon,4 again.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 MR. JERRY CASTRO:	Earlier on I was7 here to sort of like speak about the8 affordability on SRO tenants.9 I work with SRO	the West Side SRO10 Law Project.	And I'm just going to make this11	very, very brief.12 SRO tenants are the poorest rent13 stabilized tenants in the City of New York.	In14 2002, sixty percent of SRO tenants paid more than15 fifty percent of their income for rent.16 Currently we have some tenants here.17 And in addition to that I am also working with18 two tenants who, one of them is making $1,100 a19 month and is paying $850 a month for rent which20 leaves him with $250 just to fend for himself, as21 well as maybe to take care of his family if he22 has someone living with him.23 I'm asking the Board on behalf of24 this specific group to reconsider the increases25 that you are thinking of adding to the SRO units.12 
2 Because that specific group if you add those3 increases, I don't - - we don't think that they4 are going to be able to survive the little two5 percent, three percent or three percent that the6 Board may consider to the units.7 In addition to that, they're also8 facing being displaced because most of these9 landlord, specific SRO landlords, are making huge10 amount of monies by renting illegally to tourists11 to which is adding more pressure to these guys12 and these ladies who are hard-working New Yorkers13 and are here basically to live the American14 dream.15 That's about it.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 (Applause.)18 MR. JERRY CASTRO:	Thanks.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker20 is Hilda Chavez;21 Followed by Edwin Soto;22 Followed by Brenda Irrizarry.23 Hilda.24 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Hilda?25 MS. HILDA IRRIZARRY:	Yes.
1	1072 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Did you need to3 wait?4	MS. HILDA IRRIZARRY:	I wanted to5	wait.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You wanted to7	wait, fine.8	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	So go ahead. I'll9	give you a - -10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' ll let you11 wait.12 MS. HILDA IRRIZZARY:	Thank you.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No problem.14 Edwin Soto.15 You just let us know.	Wave when16 you're ready.17 MR. JERRY CASTRO:	I'll translate18 for him.19 MR. EDWIN SOTO: (Through the20 interpreter.)21 His name is Edwin Soto.	And he22 lives on 306 West 95th Street.	And he has been23 living on that unit for past the twenty years,24 yeah.25 MR. EDWIN SOTO:	(In English) now,
1	1082 the problem, this building now is working almost3 like a hotel.	I don't know why they intentional4 increase the rents when they make more money5 everyday, a week.	I don' t know why they increase6 the rents in New York City.	That' s the problem.7 Maybe I hope so the City take some control of8 this because this is a problem to have for many9 New Yorkers.10 Thank you so much.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 (Applause.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Brenda14 Irrizarry.15 MS. BRENDA IRRIZARRY:	Good16 evening, everyone.17 My name is Brenda Irrizarry.	And I18 reside at 3215 Bainbridge Avenue in the Bronx.	I19 am also a member of the Northwest Bronx Community20 and Clergy Coalition Housing Committee.21 And what I would like to say to the22 Board tonight is this, I am appealing to you that23 there be no rent increases at this time.24 The reasons I'm going to state25 first, at a personal level, my building used to2 
1	1092 have a full-time super up until 1984.	Now the3 super is part time.	He only works twenty hours a4 week, Monday through Friday for a 53-unit5 building .6 Also, our exterminating services7 have been sporadic.	We were supposed to get an8 exterminator every month.	We' re lucky if we see9 him every two, three months.10 Rent increases in my building, we11 were hit with a Major Capital Improvement12 increase in 1992 for the boiler, roof and window13 replacement.	We were charged $11 a room.	That14 is a permanent increase that never comes out of15 the rent and it compounds when the Rent16 Guidelines Board comes up with these increases17 every year.18 In addition to that, it turns out19 that our roof is in need of repair.	Luckily the20 landlord did a smart thing, he got a Section 821 loan which fortunately for tenants there is no22 rent increase.	We are not only getting a our new23 - - a new roof replacement, we also got bathrooms24 and kitchens remodeled, upgrade in wiring.	It's25 a good deal.	I think this is the way to go.2 
2 For new tenants they' re the most3 vulnerable because if they don't know the rental4 history of their apartment, many do not even5 challenge.6 One case in my building, for a7 studio apartment a tenant was charged $80 over8 the rent that he was paying.	It was through my9 advocating and also through the Northwest Bronx10 that he found out he was being overcharged $80.11 As a member of the Housing Committee12 I would just like to say there have been many13 tenant complaints as far as no heat, no hot14 water, our sporadic heat and hot water or the15 rent regulations have not - - the heat regulations16 have not been followed, which we all know is from17 October 1st to May 31st, but some landlords feel18 it's from October 15th to April 15th.19 Finally what I'd like to say to you20 is this, tenants are paying more and getting21 less.	Tenants are being shorted-changed.	There22 are no more three-years leases.	Decontrol of23 rent regulations for apartments that pay $2,00024 or more.	Loss of affordable housing - - the25 implications of this is loss of affordable - -2 
2 loss of tenant protection against rent gouging.3 Use the power to make the difference.	Please4 support us.5 Thank you.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 (Applause.)8 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I have a9	question.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question,11 question.12 Brenda, question.13 MS. BRENDA IRRIZARRY:	Yes.14 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Yes.	Thank you15 for coming out.	Thank you for your testimony.16 I just want to make sure I17 understood.	You said that there was an MCI that18 was granted in 1992 - -19 MS. BRENDA IRRIZARRY:	Yes.2 0	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	for a new21 roof, a boiler - -22 MS. BRENDA IRRIZARRY:	New roof,23 boiler, window replacement and I forgot to24 include brick pointing.	It turned out that was a25 private loan.	The contractor that did the roof21 
2	did a poor job because the roof did not last more3	than five years.	It was through HPD, the4 Housing Preservation Department, that spoke to5 Mr. Yazgur,	(phonetic) our landlord.	And finally6 he had agreed to get an Sa loan which the7 landlords will get a tax abatement.	And8 fortunately - - fortunately for tenants we will9	not be - - get a rent increase.	And that' s a10 win-win situation for everyone and it keeps the11 housing stock viable and affordable.12 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	But you still13 are saddled with the MCI.14 MS. BRENDA IRRIZARRY:	That' s15 correct.16 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Did you all try17 to challenge the MCI or try to get rid of the18 MCI?19 MS. BRENDA IRRIZARRY:	No.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	She's saddled.21 MS. BRENDA IRRIZARRY:	How can you22 challenge?	Try to file with the Division of23 Housing, the community24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need a good25 lawyer like Adriene.10 
2 MS. BRENDA IRRIZARRY:	All right.3 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	One other4 question.5	MS. BRENDA IRRIZARRY:	Yes.6 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Vacant7 apartments, how much are the vacant apartments8 running for in your building at this time?9	MS. BRENDA IRRIZARRY:	Well, I do10 know one thing, the landlord accepts Section  8.11 The average right now is, I believe is $600  and12 up.	And that 600 I believe is for a studio.  And13 this is a walk-up.	The building is about eighty14 years old.15 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 MS. BRENDA IRRIZARRY:	You' re quite18 welcome.	Thank you.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker20 is21 (Applause.)22 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair, Mr.23 Chair.24	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oh. Sorry.25	Brenda, more questions.
2MS. BRENDA IRRIZARRY:My lucky3night.4Yes.	Go ahead, please.5DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:Thank you.6 The building-wide upgrades that you7 mentioned before, you said bathrooms, wiring;8 what else?9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Boiler.10 MS. BRENDA IRRIZARRY:	Kitchen.11 The loan under the BA.	Was our kitchen and12 bathroom was remodeled, upgraded.	Oh, I forget13 to mention, the plumbing.14 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Okay. So15 wiring, plumbing, kitchens and bathrooms.16 MS. BRENDA IRRIZARRY:	Yes. And the17 roof included.18 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Very nice.19 Thank you.20 MS. BRENDA IRRIZARRY:	You're21 welcome.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 The next speakers will be:24 Javier Avelar;25 Followed by Fausto Echavarria;10 
2	Followed by Diletta Pina, okay.3	Javier Avelar with a translator,4	right?	Okay. Go ahead.5	MR. JAVIER AVELAR:	(Through6 interpreter) his name is Javier Avelar who lives7 on 187th Street in Upper Manhattan who' s8 currently renting a room in that area who has9 very bad conditions.10 He says that this past January rent11 went up 25 percent because of the cost of fuel12 that was providing him heat in his unit .13 He says that for the past five years14 that they've been living in the house or15 building, they have not been able to have16 adequate heating in the room.	And they started17 - - he started making complaints with the - - with18 HPD.19 He says that through the process of20 making complaints about the landlord, there' s21 been some kind of hesitation as well as some type22 of like the tenant/landlord fights that has lead23 some people to be hurt.24 And to add another increase for the25 conditions that he' s currently living is not - -6 
2 it's not adequate given the fact that he' s3 already paying more than fifty percent of his4 income for rent.5 He says that time and time again6 there's been constant complaints through the7 Department of Housing and Preservation8 Development about the condition that' s going on9 in his room and it's gotten to the point where he10 does not know what they have to do.	And bottom11 line is the conditions of the building needs to12 be fixed and that' s what he' s here for.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 Thank you.15 (Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Fausto17 Echavarria;18 Followed by Dilleta Pina.19 Jumaane Williams is after Mr.20 Echavarria.21 Go ahead.22 MR. FAUSTO ECHAVARRIA:	(Through23 interpreter) thank you for the opportunity.24 My name is Fausto Echavarria and I25 work with Maras Miramar	(phonetic) Community2 
2 Service to organize and inform the community.3 He wants to reinforce the testimony4 of the people who speak of the MCis.5 We have information about a Pinnacle6 Organization which is a real estate company who7 has taken 5,000 people, tried to evict 5,0008 people within the last two years.9 One of the things that they do in10 order to increase the rent is to submit MCI11 unfair and unrealistic MCI	MCI capital12 improvements - - I mean Major Capital Improvement.13 I forget the right words, illegal.14 They had submitted a lot of them15 which have been denied.	But there's a lot of16 them who has been submitted like Juan Gosally17 (phonetic) has let us know through The Daily News18 sections.19 Our organization submitted a20 petition to Eliot Spitzer to investigate Pinnacle21 on the grounds of criminal cases.	These tactics22 are not only used by Pinnacle but there's a lot23 of landlords who are using the tactics of the24 MCis.25 Pinnacle controls about 20,0002 
2 units.	Imagine if you approve this rent	this3 increase and how you going to promote this4 tactics to be happening all over.5 Thank you.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 (Applause.)8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker9	is Diletta Pina.	Hold on one second.10 Followed by Jumaane Williams;11 Followed by Oscar Ruiz.12 Go ahead.13 MS. DILETTA PINA:	Okay. Good14 evening, everybody.15 I'm here on behalf of myself.	I16 just want to let you know I'm a widow living on a17 fixed income.	And right now I'm paying over 5718 percent of my income in rent.19 Times are very hard not only because20 I have to pay the rent, which is outrageous, but21 also my medicines, my monthly medicines and the22 fact that gas and other things are going up.2 3	If more increases come up, I don't24 know how I'm going to make it, I really don't.25 And basically I'm trying to survive here like24 
2 many others .	We are trying to retain our housing3 so that we won 't be another statistic as a4 homeless person .5 I'm really appealing to you tonight6 to really take a hard look at what 's going on.7 You know, the cost of living is increasing faster8 than our incomes and another rent increase would9 be really outrageous for the working poor - - for10 the working class and for the poor.11 We sometimes having to decide12 whether to buy food or pay the rent or pay the13 utility bills that we are now facing right now.14 So I'm really, really asking you, all of you, to15 really consider what we 're going through .16 I want take this opportunity also to17 thank you for coming to the Bronx.	It was about18 time that you came and heard this part of the19 City .20 (Applause.)21 MS. DILETTA PINA:	Like myself,22 there are a lot of people that are on a fixed2 3	income.	I am a single person, I don't have a24 second income in my house and many of us here in25 the Bronx are facing the same thing .	In a way I24 
2 guess I can consider myself lucky because I don't3 have children like a lot of people here do, that4 then they have to decide whether they have to pay5 the rent or feed the children, buy the medicine,6 take them to the hospital, whatever they need to7 do.	It's very hard for people that have8 children.9 So on behalf of everybody I want to10 really ask you, please look into your hearts and11 please do whatever you can not to let any12 increases go forth.13 Thank you.14 (Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 One second.17 Jumaane Williams;18 Followed by Oscar Ruiz;19 Followed by Adolfo Viscaino.20 Mr. Williams, go ahead.21 MR. JUMAANE WILLIAMS:	Good evening22 and thank you for the time.23 My name is Jumaane D. Williams and24 I'm Executive Director of the New York State25 Tenants and Neighbors.2 
2 There' s a perfect storm brewing in3 affordable housing as we speak.	As housing nuts4 have been scrabbling about this for years, no one5 listens.	Now people have no choice.	The issues6 are palpable.7 A string of reports - from the8 housing and vacancy and vacancy survey and the9 comptrollers report form the loss of10 Mitchell-Lama housing - to yesterday' s release of11 Pratt's Time - - last week' s release of Pratt' s12 Time for Government, we have reported on the13 Pataki years of bringing the issue to light.14 Affordable housing is vanishing forever.	How15 unfortunate that all levels of oversight are16 failing us and all sorts of affordable housing17 are under attack all at once.	And when I say18 affordable, I mean to the poorest and working19 class.20 There is no housing being created21 that is for these citizens of New York who look22 after our children and grandparents, who clean23 our homes, who police our streets and teach our24 children.	It simply isn't there.	We only25 continue to lose.2 
2 For instance, the 120,000 subsidized3 apartments lost from 1990 to 2005 which is4 thirteen percent, are in jeopardy.	Or the5 one-third of Mitchell- Lama housing gone and the6 14,000 units of rent stabilized housing lost in7	2005.8 The RGB's mandate is to review,9 research and have a fair and balanced discussion10 on increases for the year.	However, the fact11 that there' s never been a meaningful discussion12 on whether there should be a rollback or freeze13 is appalling.	Since the RGB' s inception, never14 once has there been a freeze or rollback15 regardless or whether the Price Index and income16 expense data was up or down.17 Are intelligent people supposed to18 believe that in all the years of the RGB since19 1969 there has never ever been a year when20 findings pointed to zero increase or rollback.21 It doesn't make any sense.22 It seems to me the Board is making a23 mockery of balanced research and discussion.	The24 Board begins discussions with the preconceived25 ideas that landlords will get an increase. This8 
2 is more of a sham than an analysis.3 The HVS says - -4 (Audience participation.)5	MR. JUMAANE WILLIAMS:	The HVS says6 that rents are up and incomes are down despite7 this increase and the same reports that there are8 hundreds and thousands of apartments with heating9 breakdowns and other code violations and HPD has10 2.8 million uncorrected violations.11 Additionally, in 2004, for example,12 for the Price Index surged 16.9 percent in 2004,13 the landlords still showed an increase in net14 operating income from 37.8 to 38 percent.	This15 year the Price Index is only capped 7.8 percent.16 What part of that is an increase for landlords,17 none of it.	Adding further to the belief that18 the Board's mind set is only to assist the19 landlord community is the refusal to adopt the20 Home Rule Resolution to the point that the Chair21 of the - - the Chair of the Board can no longer22 hide his true colors.23 There is absolutely no reason why24 this Board, under its jurisdiction, cannot adopt25 such a resolution, none. It has been done in the6 
2 past and it can be done now.	The RGB should not3 work in a vacuum.	Everything around it points to4 tenants suffering and landlords who continue to5 prosper.	Home Rule will be a first great step6 in alleviating the pressures being felt in this7 City.8 The only reason the Board would not9 approve such a resolution and, in fact,10 disintegrate into playground antics at the mere11 suggestion of it, is the Board doesn't want to12 consider the needs of a tenant, but only wants to13 help landlords get richer.14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. JUMAANE WILLIAMS:	I hope and16 pray that the merely 29 percent of tenants who17 pay over half their income on rent and tenants as18 a whole who are paying over 82 percent more now19 than they did in 1989, are in your thoughts2 0	somewhere.	They are real people.	Certainly21 housing is a right and this Board has the power22 to help maintain that right, not to trample it.2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 MR. JUMAANE WILLIAMS:	Thank you25 and goodnight.24 
2	(Audience participation.)3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oscar Ruiz.	Mr.4 Ruiz?5 Followed by Alfonso Viscaino;6 Followed by Maria Cordones.7 MR. OSCAR RUIZ:	Good evening.8 I live at Pelham Parkway South off9 of Holland and Wallace Avenue.10 I'm a community activist.	I sit on11 two executive boards.	I'm involved in my12 community for the last seven years.	And you know13 I'm disabled.	I'm on a fixed income.14 You're asking for close to eight and15 a half percent when the cost of living went up16 4.7 percent so you're taking more money out of my17 check.	I mean how can I survive month- to-month?18 You know, the Rent Control19 Guidelines Board ought to come back down to the20 City.	You know, it needs to be controlled and21 these landlords are getting away with too much.22 All these MCis.	I hear all these testimonies,23 it's the same thing over and over again.24 Something is wrong here.	Something25 needs to be fixed.	And I know the landlords4 
2 have the power to control the Board, influence,3 that' s all it comes down to.4 (Audience participation.)5 MR. OSCAR RUIZ:	It's all6 influence, money, politics.	You give politicians7 what they want, they get what they want in8 return.	That's what it comes down to.	People9 like us out here, we don' t get nothing but yet we10 support and we pay their rent.	No matter what11 happens they want their rent on the first of the12 month.13 You know, it's ridiculous.	There14 comes a time when you have to freeze it at least15 for a year or two.	You got to freeze it right16 now.	Look at the situation we' re in.	There' s no17 money coming into the City but they still want18 more.	They want more.	They want more.	Come on,19 let's be for real.	You know, the eight and a20 half, that's too much money.	It's way too much.21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. OSCAR RUIZ:	We willing to23 work and meet somewhere down the middle.24 (Applause.)25 MR. OSCAR RUIZ:	I'm quite sure2 
2 that we're willing to meet them halfway, an even3 level playing field.	That' s all we ask you for.4 We know they've got to survive.	We've got to5 survive too.	What does it say here?	What does6 it say here?	We need to survive (indicating.)7 You know, we need to survive, come on. Enough is8 enough.	You know, I don't know what more to say.9 I heard it all. I heard it all.	It's ridiculous.10 Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Adolpho14 Viscaino.15 (No response.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Maria Cordones17 will be next, but she's going to need a18 translator.19 Is that you?20 MS.

MARIA CORDONES:	(Through15 interpreter.) I'm not really sure what the16 hearing is - - what the hearing is about today,17 but I'm interested in the - - in what' s going on18 with the tenants of New York.19 Before you come to a decision you20 could - - you should all come together and listen21 to the tenants and listen to all the things that22 they had to go through before you can increase23 the rent.24 There's a lot of people here living25 in very poor conditions like in third-world15 
2 countries and we have to remember that we 're3 living in New York City .4 I was invited to a hearing regarding5 the - - what' s going on in the buildings in6 Washington Heights .	The building that I live on7 is one of the buildings with the worst violations8	in the City.	I was thrown out of my building by9 the landlord and by his lawyers and they will not10 let me go back into - - open the doors to get back11 to my apartment .12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 (Audience participation .)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One more .15 MS . MARIA CORDONES :	I was five16 years in that apartment without any heat.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank - -18 MS. MARIA CORDONES:	More than19 fifteen floods during the time that I was there.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	All right . She21 has to wrap up. You have to - - it's way over.22 Tell her to wrap up.23 Thank you .24 Go ahead.25 MS . MARIA CORDONES :	This place

Dolores? Coming?	Oh,9 she's waving to us.10 Luz Montoya is after Dolores.11 Luz Montoya, are you here?	Yes.12 Okay.	You'll be next.	Why don't you go near13 there while Dolores makes her way down.14 And then Raquel Navas.15 So Dolores is on her way down.16 Luz Montoya;17 And then Raquel Navas.18 MS. DOLORES SANTA ANA:	Good19 afternoon to everyone.	My name is Dolores Santa20 Ana.	And I live at Riverside Studio located at21 342 West 7lst, New York, New York 10023.22 These are my complaints:23 I have lived there since 1989 and my24 room was never painted and it's almost seventeen25 years now;
2 Number two, same with the carpet in3 my room, it has never been changed.	The carpet4 of the hallway has been changed four times, but5 not the carpet in my room.	So my carpet is6 already seventeen years old;7 Third, I live in - - my next door8 room is being rented to a tourist.	And I9 remember the last time was January 1, 2006 and10 the tourist sleep there for two nights.	The11 other tourist was from California.	She was there12 with her son just to watch the Times Square, you13 know, New Year event.14 I wanted to know if Riverside Studio15 is a registered hotel because they could just16 accept tourists and rent it for two nights.	I17 know it's a resident hotel.18 Some of the other problems:19 Room are	rooms are infested with20 bed bugs, cockroaches;21 Needs new mattress and bed frame;22 There are cracked walls;23 Rooms need painting, as I have told24 you;25 And carpets are old and torn;2 
2 Peephole in the door to room does3 not work;4 Third floor bathroom, it is a common5 bathroom, are infested with cockroaches;6 Outlet plate cover is room is loose;7 Exposed wires in third floor - -8 there are some exposed wires on the third floor9 hallway;10 Bathtubs are clogged frequently;11 Venetian Blinds in my room are old12 and discolored;13 Light switch in room does not14 function properly;15 Chain on the door is not secured;16 Third floor hallway are filthy and17 have not been cleaned.18 That's all.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 (Applause.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Luz Montoya.22 Go ahead.23 MS. LUZ MONTOYA:	(Through24 interpreter) good evening.25 (Audience participation.)2 
2 MR. LUZ MONTOYA:	I live at 12693 Willoughby in Brooklyn, New York, Bushwick.4 I am here5 (Audience participation.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Tell her to7 wait.	Can we have some water here, please?8	MS. LUZ MONTOYA:	I'm here because9 I think everyone, independent of their race,10 class or immigration status, has the right to a11 decent place to live12 (Applause.)13 MS. LUZ MONTOYA:	- - with an14 affordable rent.15 The conditions we live in though16 currently, the owners only want to receive money17 without having responsibilities like providing18 sufficient services; problems like broken floors19 and holes in the walls.	They never exterminate20 so we are infested with rodents and other pests.21 Our children and our elderly deserve22 better living conditions, good housing,23 affordable rents.	We demand and we urge zero24 increase.25 (Audience participation.)9 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3	Hold on.4	Raquel Navas;5	Followed by Elsa Lopez;6 Followed by Violeta DeLeon.7 Raquel.8	MS. RAQUEL NAVAS:	(Through9 interpreter) good evening to the general public10 and to the Board.11 My name is Raquel Navas and I live12 at 98 Linden Street in Bushwick, Brooklyn.13 My building's history and its14 problems are too long to discuss in three15 minutes.16 This building has passed from owner17 to owner as a result of mortgage fraud.18 Specifically it was owned by one gentleman named19 Joseph Paradello (phonetic) who had 63 other20 buildings in Bushwick, as well using fraudulent21 names.22 He would collect rent and not23 provide any maintenance services to the building.24 What is most important is to live like decent25 people in decent housing - -9 
2	(Audience participation.)3	MS. RAQUEL NAVAS:	- - without4 broken walls and with heat; without rats, without5 walls that are separated from each other so I can6 take a shower without it being cold.	So we can7 live like decent human beings.8 (Audience participatio n.)9	MS. RAQUEL NAVAS:	The owners keep10 collecting rent and we urge and we struggle for11 our rights and nobody listens.	Why an increase?12 To benefit who?13 We now have another new owner.	He14 greeted us with eviction cases.	He preferred to15 see the building in bad conditions.	He didn' t16 have any concerns about the way we were living.17 Do you think it's just to give an increase or18 grant an increase to an owner who doesn' t care19 how we live.20 That's why we are here to tell you21 we demand and we urge no rent increase - -22 (Audience participation.)2 3	MS. RAQUEL NAVAS:	- - no more24	support for owners like this.	We hope that our25	voice is heard.	Zero increase.
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3	(Audience participation.)4 MS. RAQUEL NAVAS:	Thank you.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Elsa Lopez;6 Violeta DeLeon;7 Followed by Jeanie Dubnau.8	Elsa Lopez?9	MS. ELSA LOPEZ:	(Through10 interpreter) good afternoon, good evening.11 She's going to speak briefly about12 her experiences in her building.13 Since 2001 to 2006 my building has14 had five different owners, all of which have15 asked us to accept money to leave our apartments.16 We've been harassed by telephone calls and17 personal insults.	And we've been denied basic18 services like heat and hot water.	We have no19 door bell.	We have no one who is in charge of20 day- to-day maintenance of the property .21 We have a lot of accumulation of22 dirt.	No one takes the garbage out.	There are23 no locks on our front doors even though the locks24 are broken by the same owners.	They've placed25 construction materials in the hallways .	They've10 
2 made repair work or construction work in the3 apartments while we've been there.4 Right now I'm in court.	Every time5 we go to court the judge tells us the building6 has been sold.	And I feel they do this to avoid7 responsibility.	Owners hide behind corporations8 to confuse us about their ownership.9 (Audience participation.)10 MS. ELSA LOPEZ:	I, as a tenant, I11 demand and I urge that our rights be respected12 and there be no increase until we're treated like13 human beings.14 (Audience participation.)15 MS. ELSA LOPEZ:	So thank you very16 much.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 Thank you.19 Violeta DeLeon;20 Jeanie Dubnau.21 You' re not next.	First Violeta22 DeLeon;23 Then the Reverend John Powis.24 Violeta.25 MS. VIOLETA DELEON:	(Through2 
1	1382 interpreter) good evening.	My name is Violeta3 Deleon and I live at 163 Harman Street in4 Bushwick.5 I've lived at a building for 286 years and I'm going to describe to you the7 conditions and experiences I've had there for the8 last four years.9 In the last four years I've had a10 number of owners.	In the beginning about four11 years ago when one of them came and knocked on12 all the doors and told us that he wanted us to13 leave our apartments.14 When he saw that we paid no15 attention to his demands, he started calling us16 by telephone at all hours of the night.	He said17 that the building was very old and it might catch18 a fire.	We had to call the Police because we19 were scared.20 A little while after that a new21 owner appeared.	The only contact we had with him22 was in the envelopes that he sent us in the mail23 asking for rent.	He never came to visit the24 building or to see the conditions we were living25 under.	So we decided to take care of the2 
2 situation in the building by providing for the3 maintenance services, paying for the heat and the4 electrical service.5 A few months later we got another6 letter, this time from Ohio Savings Bank.	They7 said they were the new owners but they didn't8 take any responsibility for the conditions in the9 building either.10 Even now though there are a lot of11 children in our building.	It seems like the only12 thing everyone is interested in is for us to13 leave.14 They tried to fix up the apartments15 and rent them for three times more than what16 we're paying now.	We are decent working people17 and we've been living stable for so long, but18 during the last four years the only thing that19 seems to come to us are owners serving their own20 personal interests.21 We came here today so that you can22 hear our voice.	We demand justice and no23 increase24 (Audience participation.)25 MS. VIOLETA DELEON:	We cannot2 
2 just work solely to pay rent, we have other3 necessities and we have children.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to5	wrap up.6	MS. VIOLETA DELEON:	We don' t want7 to be a public charge but we want decency.8 Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 Sit down.12 A VOICE:	Don't talk to them like13 that.	Don't talk to them like that.	Speak to14 them with respect.15 (Audience participation.)16 A VOICE:	I heard about who you17 threw - - you tried to throw out a lawyer.	I18 heard about how you lost it a few weeks ago where19 you almost tried to throw out a lawyer who was20 giving testimony and told him to get the F'out.21 I heard about that.22 (Audience participation.)2 3	A VOICE:	This is the kind of24 Chairperson25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next24 
2	speaker - -3	A VOICE:	This is the kind of4 Chairperson we have here.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma' am, ma' am,6 ma' am.	Wait until your turn is called, just7 wait.8 The next speaker is Jeanie Dubnau;9 Followed by Reverend John Powis;10 Followed by Ruth Williams.11 Go ahead, Ms. Dubnau.12 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	Okay.	My name13 is Jeanie Dubnau.	I'm with RENA, Riverside14 Edgecombe Neighbhood Association and Nos Quedamos15 (In Spanish)16 Now, I'm addressing my remarks to17 the Public Members on - - and I really would like18 you to listen.19 First I have a question I'd like to20 have you think about in your hearts, which was21 asked by one of the people from the Union de22 Communal who forget to ask.23 Are any of you renters, yourselves?24 I know this is a rhetorical question that you25 don't have to answer.	In your hearts, are any of4 
1	1422	you renters?	Think about that.	I'm talking to3 the Public Members.4 In your hearts, do any of you pay5 thirty to fifty percent of your income for your6 rent, you, yourselves?7 (Audience participation.)8 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	Think about it.9 That's an important point because this RGB is10 supposed to maintain affordable rents for New11 Yorkers .	You are supposed to do that.	That's12 the purpose of RGB.13 Now, I hope that you have all read14 the article in The New York Times that appeared15 Friday .	Friday there was an article in The New16 York Times.	I just want to bring out the most17 important points.18 Okay.	So-called affordable income19 for what they call moderate income people,20 plunged by seventeen percent between 2002 and21 2005.	What do they mean by moderate, police22 Officers would earn $25,000 a year.	That's what23 they call moderate.	And those people are paying24 a huge income.25 Thirty two thousand - - the number of5 
2 affordable housing - - and what' s considered3 affordable is a third of your income which, if4 you're getting anything that' s lower than 32,0005 is an incredible, incredible burden.	Thirty two6 percent is not cheap, okay.	That' s what they7 call affordable - - dropped by 205,000 in just8 three years.9 There' s been a twenty percent10 increase in the last three years in affordable11 housing.	In the cost of housing, twenty percent12 already in the last three years increase in13 housing, the cost.14 Now, what' s happening now? I'm not15 going to read this whole article, I don't have16 time.17 Some housing experts say escalating18 rents pose a threat to the City' s well-being.19 Workers needed for crucial jobs will move away20 but most of them can't move away.	You can't lose21 your jobs so what are you going to do? Double or22 triple up in your apartments which is illegal,23 but it forced on the people.24 Look in your hearts Members of the25 Public.	Look in hearts.	Are you paying those2 
2 kinds of rents for your buildings, for your3 apartments?	Where do you live?	Are you living4 in affordable housing and do you vote so that5 people in this City who are represented here will6 have affordable housing, or will you vote for an7 eight - - six percent, seven percent, eight8	percent increase in their rents when their9	incomes are going down.10 I'm not going to read from the11 article, you all know that.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap13 up.14 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	I'm wrapping15 up.16 So we all know - - I have 33 more17 seconds and you're interrupting me, Marvin18 Markus.19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma' am, you need21 to wrap up.22 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	And the people23 who spoke in Spanish only had three minutes with24 an English and a Spanish translation, which is25 not fair.10 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	They got more3 time and you're speaking in English.4	MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	No, they did5	not .6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And you're done.7	MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	And I still8	have time.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You're done.10 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	The time is not11 done.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let' s go, you're1314 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	You are	you15 absolutely have no respect for the tenants in16 this City, Marvin Markus.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you done - -18 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	And you have no19 business being the Chairperson of this - - of this20 group.21 (Audience participation.)22 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	You should be23 out.24 And the Public Members, think about25 it Public Members, we're relying on you.	We're14 
2 relying on you to think about it and to vote with3 your conscience.	Do the right thing.4 (Audience participation.)5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker6 will be Reverend John Powis;7 Followed by Ruth Williams;8 Followed by Eugenie White.9 Hilda, are you close?10 A VOICE:	Yes.11 (Audience participation.)12 MR. JOHN POWIS:	I am a priest of13 the Diocese of Brooklyn, but I'm also the14 Executive Director of an organization known as15 the Bushwick Housing Independence Project.	We16 have 42 people here tonight with us.17 Give them a nice big round of18 applause, they deserve it.19 (Applause.)2 0	MR. JOHN POWIS:	We work mostly in21 rent stabilized buildings.22 We have two categories of Bushwick,23 just about 36 of them are large buildings and24 about 700 are six- family buildings.25 I maintain that this whole business21 
2	of having hearings is just, it's just - - it's3	just an incredible sham because here we are all4	of the people here who are with us here today are5	families living - - you know, when you can read in6 The New York Times in the Magazine Section how7 Bushwick's becoming the new housing place, so the8 place for all the rich people are moving to.9	Every factories have been made into10 lofts.	And what we have now, we have a situation11 where number one, the large buildings - - let me12 give you an example.13 There's one landlord, his name is14 Hillie Porgis (phonetic.)	He is the manager,15 he' s not the owner, he' s the manager of four16 large buildings, okay.	I'll tell you the17 addresses of them:	940, 946 Bushwick.	107518 Green and 1298 DeKalb.19 He manages these for unknown people.20 And no one can find out who the real owners are.21 And the word, who' s his great gift that he has,22 is getting rid of rent stabilized people.	He23 goes in there and he does nothing for any of the24 apartments.	He has an old man super doing the25 repairs, but as soon as he gets a family out10 
2	because they haven' t been paying rent, then3	immediately he brings in a whole management	he4 brings in a whole department and they do the5 apartment over without even getting any kind of6 permits from the City.7 So you have the City' s Building8 Department, you have HPD, you have the State, you9 have this committee here, all - - somehow or10 another instead of helping the situation they' re11 hurting it.12 With the small buildings, HPD keeps13 giving rooms to landlords who have run out of the14 people.	There' s a lot of good landlords in15 Bushwick and they should be subsidized so that16 they don't move their buildings.	Because when17 there' s foreclosures that's where the problem18 comes.	And you know because you vote on this19 stuff, you have to know these facts.	You have to20 know that foreclosures cause all the suffering21 that these folks are going through.22 (Audience participatio n.)23 MR. JOHN POWIS:	And if you don' t24 know it, we have now 32 buildings that we've25 organized to keep people saving their rents so4 
2 that when the foreclosure comes and the new3 landlord shows up and he says well, I have an4 assignment of rents and you have to pay two years5 back rent.	And then we all get thrown out and6 then what happens?	Then developer comes, does7 the whole place over and then the rents are 2,5008	or 2,300.9	It is absolutely incredible that we10 sit here tonight talking about rent increases for11 folks living in places like Bushwick and at our12 office we get families from Bedford Stuy.	We get13 from Brownsville.	We've saved 600 families by14 going to court.	One of us goes to court every15 single day and most days we have between four and16 seven cases.17 We not only go to Brooklyn Housing18 Court, we go to Queens Housing Court because a19 number of people have been coming in from20 Ridgewood and also from the other part of21 Bushwick there called Glendale.22 So I just say to this group here23 tonight I say, look it, look at what you do.24 But besides looking and what you and whatever25 increase you make or don't make, you shouldn' t10 
2 make any increase, certainly for areas like3 Bushwick.4 (Audience participation.)5	MR. JOHN POWIS:	I think - - I think6 if you're going to be realistic you have to look7 at different sections of the City and deal with8 them differently.9 If you're dealing with Lexington or10 Park Avenue, that' s one thing, but if you're11 dealing with areas like Bushwick you've got to12 deal with it differently.	And you can't stand up13 there and say we' re going to make eight and a14 half percent for everybody.	It doesn' t work.15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 MR. JOHN POWIS:	More than that I18 can't tell you.	But I have prepared a statement19 for each and every member of the Board.	I will20 them leave here and you can - -21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have the staff22 right next to you.23 MR. JOHN POWIS:	We' ll make sure24 that he gets them and I hope that you read it.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We will.6 
2 MR. JOHN POWIS:	I hope that you3 read it and you understand that we' re not doing4 this because we're making money or anything,5 we' re doing this because we have wonderful, good6 tenants who don't have a place to live.	And more7 and more people are moving out of New York City8 'cause they can't pay their rents.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 DIRECTOR PAGAN:	Mr. Chairman. Mr.12 Chairman.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.14 Reverend, question.15 (Audience participation.)16 DIRECTOR PAGAN:	Can you give me a17 second, please.18 Father Powis.19 MR. JOHN POWIS:	Yes, sir.20 DIRECTOR PAGAN:	First let me21 thank you for bringing the people from Brooklyn.22 I'm from Williamsburg myself and - -23 MR. JOHN POWIS:	You saw what24 happened to Williamsburg, hah?25 DIRECTOR PAGAN:	Yes.	And I've2 
2 known for years.3 Could you tell us what affect the4 long-term residents in your Santa Barbara5 catchment area has been in the last ten, fifteen6 years?7 MR . JOHN POWIS :	What has happened8 in the last ten years?9 DIRECTOR PAGAN:	Yes .10 MR . JOHN POWIS:	Everybody is11 afraid.	Everybody sees the fact that all these12 folks are walking around the neighborhood asking13 can I buy this property?	Can I buy this14 property?	And then when they buy the property15 they bring in a developer and they get the16 people, little by little they get them out.17 It's devastating what 's happening .18 The people who were living there19 before are no longer living there .	And what we20 kept saying is Williamsburg is one place.	Now21 it 's Bushwick .	Then it's Bed Stuy.	Then it's22 Brownsville.	Where are your working poor people23 going to live?	Where are all the people who work24 in this City, where are they going to live?25 (Audience participation.)2 
2	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I have a question.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Another4 question.5 Go ahead, Adriene.6 (Audience participation .)7	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you, thank8 you, Reverend.	Thank you so much for coming and9 bringing - -10 MR. JOHN POWIS:	No.	They brought11 themselves because those folks here, these are12 fighters and they insisted that there be no big13 increase - - no increases in rents, no increases,14 not in Bushwick.15 (Audience participation.)16 MR. JOHN POWIS:	No increases in17 Bushwick.	If you have to change the law, if you18 to change the law, well then get a hold of Pataki19 and Bloomberg and tell them we've got to change20 the law.21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. JOHN POWIS:	I'm sorry.	Go23 ahead.2 4	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	When you think25	about some of the buildings in Bushwick and some
2 of the surrounding areas that were abandoned or3 where there are no known owners, what is the4 reason for that, what happened to those5 buildings?6 MR. JOHN POWIS:	They're7 foreclosures.	They' re foreclosures because8 there' s all kinds of fraud going on with the9 flipping of the mortgages.	People like Joe10 Paradello had sixty buildings.	HPD has a case on11 him that' s like sixty rooms would fill it, but12 nothing' s happened.	The guy's walking the street13 and still collecting rents.14 What kind of City is this?	If you15 all have some power, use it.	Don't just raise16 rents or lower, do something, do something.17 (Audience participation.)18 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Reverend?19 MR. JOHN POWIS:	What' s that?20 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And while21 litigation is going on, what is happening to the22 tenants in those buildings?2 3	MR. JOHN POWIS:	What' s been24 happening to the tenants in Joe Paradello' s25 buildings?	They still are living under the same24 
2 mess.	He still goes into 319 Harman and collects3 rents as if he's done nothing wrong.	They know4 that he' s done all kinds of things wrong and he5 just goes on and on and on.6 So I'm not down on landlords, I'm7 simply	I'm more down on the City, HPD, on the8 Mayor, on the Governor, on all the people who are9 letting this kind of stuff go on.10 (Audience participation.)11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker12 will be Ruth Williams.	Ruth Williams?13 Hold on a second.14 Followed by Eugenie White;15 Followed by Councilman Miguel16 Martinez.17 Ms. Williams.18 MR. RUTH WILLIAMS:	I'm Ruth19 Williams.	I live in the Bronx.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. Excuse21 me?22 MS. RUTH WILLIAMS:	I live in the23 Bronx - -24	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to speak25	to the microphone.
2	MS. RUTH WILLIAMS:	- - on the west3	side	on the West side of the Bronx.	And I've4 been in that building for quite some time.5 And it was a lovely building.	We6 had a good owner and he did what he was supposed7 to do.	As soon as he decided to sell the8 building after being there for several years, we9 happened to get a very good super and everything10 and the building was kept up very nice.11 For some reason they decided to sell12 the building again.	And that' s when the problems13 started.	Right away they came in.	We had three14 porters, kept the building excellent.	They cut15 the porter's salary.	They were making like $13.16 They cut it down to eight.	And that's when our17 trouble started.18 And ever since then the building19 have gone down.	The floors are filthy.	We don't20 get our extermination.	Even so that the owner21 came in, we had a nice community room where we22 used to have our meeting and some affairs during23 the holidays.	Holiday	for Halloween, a party24 for the children.	All of this was cut out.	We25 were there.	We were never told a word what was4 
2 going on.3 He came in and all we know was that4 we heard banging and tearing down the walls.5 Our community room, he came right in and took our6 community room .	Never discussed a word with not7 one tenant.8 We wondering what' s going on.	Took9 the community room made it into many apartments10 where you could hardly get a bed into.	And now11 he' s charging high rent.	With the - - even came12 around asking tenants to move out of their13 apartments so he can take it over because he's14 only interested money no matter what, that' s his15 big desire is to get the money.16 And after that we had no security.17 We always had security in our building .	He got18 rid of all of the security.	Laid off all of our19 staff.	Brought in new staff who didn 't know what20 was going on, couldn't speak a word of English.21 And that' s where we are right now .22 The ceiling on the - - the building23 ceiling was leaking.	He didn't bother to get it24 repaired.	I had to constantly call HPD and HPD25 waste a lot of the City's money too because they2 
2 come in and you tell them the problem and they3 say they going to write it down.	It's like you4 feel that the owner is giving him payola or5 something because when you get your report, it's6 not even on the report.7 And take for an example, I had mold8 in my apartment.	A whole year I called and I9	called.	I called management.	I put it in black10 and white.	Certified it.	Sent it to management.11 You think I got a response, no.	Not one word.12 So finally I just kept calling BOCES13 to see if I could get some action.	A whole year14 I must have received at least - -15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap16 up.17 MS. RUTH WILLIAMS:	- - fifteen or18 twenty violations	I mean reports from Housing19 and no action.	And I think it's a crime to have20 to live under the conditions that we put up with.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 (Applause.)23 MS. RUTH WILLIAMS:	Thank you.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Eugenie White;25 Councilman Miguel Martinez;10 
1	1592	Followed by Alejandro Hernandez.3	MS. EUGENIE WHITE:	I happen to be4 a tenant and residing in the same building as the5 previous speaker spoke about it so I'm not going6 to embark on that.7 However, I will tell you today8 landlords are growing richer and richer but9 tenants are increasingly becoming poorer and10 poorer and find themselves at the mercy of the11 powerful landlords who push rent forever upward.12 The never cease to complain about their financial13 losses, but by the same token they never reveal14 their actual profits.15 The un empowered tenants are forever16 left to struggle with the increases in rent17 payments each year passed on by the Rent18 Guidelines Board.19 Landlords claim that the Rent20 Guideline increases are inadequate and they fail21 to meet their expenses.	I will give you a little22 history of the passed-along increases to the23 tenants over the four years.24 In 2003 the Rent Guidelines Board25 voted a 4.5 percent increase for a one-year lease4 
2 and a 7.5 percent for a two-year lease renewal.3 It was the highest percentage allowed for4 stabilization apartments.5 In the year 2004 the Rent Guidelines6 Board passed another increase, a 2.75 percent for7 a one-year lease and a 5.5 percent rent increase8 for a two-year renewal.9	Now we come to the year 2005.	The10 Rent Guidelines Board voted for a increase of11 2.75 percent for a one-year lease renewal and a12 5.5 percent for a two-year lease renewal with no13 adequate basis whatsoever.14 Now we are in the year 2006 and the15 word is out this that Rent Guidelines Board16 preliminary vote is to be three percent to 6.517 percent for a one-year lease and a five percent18 to 8.5 percent for a two-year lease renewal.19 The Rent Guidelines Board alleges20 that the increases for the last three years have21 been totally inadequate.	I disagree with that22 citing that heating, oil costs increase, real23 estate taxes they blame that on, and insurance24 premiums warrant these increases.25 This has to stop.	We have been10 
2	going on an3	(Audience participation.)4	MS. EUGENIE WHITE:	upward5 spiral.	We cannot go this direction.6 The social economic situation will7 not permit this.	We are in a terrible crisis8 these days.	The economy has gone on a downward9	spiral.	And we certain - - where is this coming10 from? If the landlords don't have the money,11 where does the tenant get the money?12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap13 up.14 MS. EUGENIE WHITE:	Yes. I've15 wrapped up.	I rest my case.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Councilmember19 Martinez;20 Followed by Alejandro Hernandez;21 Followed by Sid Miller.22 Councilmember.23 COUNCILMEMBER MARTINEZ:	Thank24 you, Mr. Chair and Members of Board.25 What you see here, and when we lose10 
2 sometimes our patience with the tenant is just a3 demonstration of frustration, a demonstration of4 fear that many of our communities are living in.5 The fear of being displaced.	The fear of not6 knowing that tomorrow we're going to wake up with7 shelter.	A fear of how am I going to pay my rent8 on a daily basis.9 But, you know, the Board has a10 tremendous opportunity not just to look at11 increasing rent, but a tremendous opportunity to12 do good service for the citizens and residents of13 the City of New York by partnering up with14 tenants, partnering up with the City Council so15 that we could do some real changes in terms of16 policy that have to deal with our rents.17 (Audience participation.)18 COUNCILMEMBER MARTINEZ:	We have19 policies that do not make sense.20 I think that this Board has a21 tremendous opportunity to partner up and go to22 Albany and ensure that the solution to our rent23 crisis is not to increase our rent, but to change24 these policies, policies such as the MCis that25 are never-ending.2 
3	COUNCILMEMBER MARTINEZ:	Policies4 such as - - policies such as the ones that do not5 allow the City to have control of its - - that do6 not allow the City to have control of its destiny7 by not having jurisdiction over the rent laws.8 Getting rid of the Urstadt Law should be what we9 should be discussion	here.10 (Audience participation.)11 COUNCILMEMBER MARTINEZ:	We have a12 tremendous opportunity to do right.	We have a13 tremendous opportunity to do right while Albany14 has wronged.	It is outrageous that we get rid of15 the preferential rent and then landlords go out16 there and will increase the rent to tenants while17 we lost ten or twenty years.18 (Audience participation.)19 COUNCILMEMBER MARTINEZ:	I think20 that if we, as a City, had control of our destiny21 of our rent laws, the discussion here would be22 different and not all the time you conduct these23 hearing tenants scream at you because the only24 solution you bring forward is increasing the25 rents .4 
3	COUNCILMEMBER MARTINEZ:	d I4 think that we have a tremendous opportunity.	We5 have a tremendous opportunity to change policy6 and have real control of our destiny because what7 you offer, it's not hope.	You offer desperation.8 You offer sadness and you offer a great amount of9 fear of communities being displaced.10 So, Mr. Chair - -11 (Audience participation.)12 COUNCILMEMBER MARTINEZ:	So13 Mr. Chair, I will tell you that I represent the14 community of Washington Heights;15 d I will tell you that if you go16 to Housing Court, you will find a large number of17 eviction notices and disposition notices in the18 court coming from my community;19 I will tell you that if you walk my20 community, tenants are fearful;21 I will tell you that people have22 three and four jobs to be able to pay their23 rents;24 d I will also tell you that I am25 also a renter in Washington Heights and I'm
2 fearful that I may have to pay $1,500 for my3 rent.4 So it is something that we're living5 with.	And we must partner up for a real solution6 and change these policies that do not make any7 sense for our City.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I have a question.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.12 Go ahead. Adriene.13 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you,14 Councilmember.	I appreciate all the work that15 you do in Northern Manhattan.	You've been a real16 leader on these issues, as well as other issues17 regarding poverty, and thank you for coming here18 today.19 (Applause.)20 COUNCILMEMBER MARTINEZ:	Thank you.21 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I'd like to talk22 a little bit about your neighborhood.23 Right now what are vacant apartments24 going for in Washington Heights?25 COUNCILMEMBER MARTINEZ:	Well, I
2 will tell you that a one-bedroom apartment in3 Washington Heights is easily going for $1,100,4 easily.	And if we' re looking at a studio you're5 looking at paying a good $900.6 And I will tell you that as a City,7 don't be fooled by the articles you read in the8 papers.	We don't have a housing boom because the9 construction of affordable housing in the City of10 New York, after they've changed the AMI, they're11 not affordable for communities in the City of New12 York.13 (Audience participation.)14 COUNCILMEMBER MARTINEZ:	I will15 also tell you - - I will also tell you not to be16 fooled that the administration - and we give the17 Mayor some credit for addressing the issue for18 constructing more houses - but we're not going to19 see these houses in a couple, five ten years.20 What happens to these tenants now?	And are those21 houses going to be affordable for these tenants.22 So I will tell you that we have a23 housing crisis.	And the solution is not to24 increase the percentage, the solution is to25 change these policies that do not make sense for2 
2 the City.	And as New Yorkers, as you are, all3 you are serving here, you are serving here4 because you care for our City.	And if we really5 care for our City, we've got to change these6 policies in Albany.7 (Audience participation.)8	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	If this Board9 were to propose an advisory resolution on the10 repeal of Urstadt or for restoration of Horne11 Rule - -12 (Audience participation .)13 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	- - as a Member of14 the City Council, can you tell me what that would15 that do corning from this Board for the City?16 COUNCILMEMBER MARTINEZ:	It will17 give us tremendous power to send a Horne Rule18 message to Albany that we need to get rid of19 these laws.	It will also move the Mayor that a20 Board - - a Board that has majority appointees by21 the Mayor, send a message to the Mayor that he22 needs to partner up with the City Council in23 sending a Horne Rule message that we need to get24 rid of the Urstadt Law.25 (Audience participation .)
2 COUNCILMEMBER MARTINEZ :	It will be3 tremendous, tremendous, tremendous for our4	community.5 (Audience participation .)6 DIRECTOR HOLDER :	And we all know7 that costs have gone up and expenses have gone8	up .9	What has the City Council been doing10 to try and address some of those issues for11 owners?12 COUNCILMEMBER MARTINEZ :	Well, the13 Council has done a lot.	I'm the author, by the14 way, of a bill specifically to try to address the15 issue of MCI costs with the removal of lead paint16 in apartments, where I propose that landlords get17 a subsidy, a tax subsidy, a tax break whenever18 they do the entire lead abatement rather than19 charging that onto tenants for the removal of the20 lead .21 The Council has, through HPD, the22 community consultant grants that groups get to23 work with landlords to work on issues with24 disputes between tenants and landlords and also25 to advocate on behalf of landlords when there 's a
1	1692 dispute between tenants and landlords.3 The Council is looking to do more.4 They're working with the landlords on a program5 - - a successful program we just did in my6 district called the Roof-to-Basement Inspection7 where we do inspections of the building.	We8 identify the violations to the owner.	Tenants9 owner, elected officials working to address the10 issues and getting the repair done.11 We' re also questioning how HPD can12 be efficient in doing emergency repair and13 working with tenants.	I mean we're doing a lot.14 We understand that if you own a house, if you own15 a building, let's be clear, this is a business16 and they're there to make money.	Landlords are17 there to make money.	Then there's nothing wrong18 with making money, but we need to have policies19 that protect average citizens of the City of New20 York.	And in this case it's fine to make money,21 but what' s going on with the citizenship when we22 have policies that do protect the citizens.23 (Applause.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 Appreciate it.
2 COUNCILMEMBER MARTINEZ:	Thank3 you, Mr. Chair.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5	(Audience participation.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker7 is Alejandro Hernandez who I think is going to8 need a translator; is that right?	Yes.9 Followed by Sid Miller;10 Followed by Hilda Chavez, okay?11	MR. ALEJANDRO HERNANDEZ:	(Through12 interpreter) Good evening.	My name is Alejandro13 Hernandez.14 I come on behalf of all my community15 and the poor condition that we're living in.16 As a worker I have to work four17 weeks to make up the money to pay the rent and18 buy the food.	When my wife gets sick I can't19 afford to buy her medicine.	I can't afford to20 pay for the hospital.	And with the rent increase21 is going to be harder for me.22 (Audience participation.)23 MR. ALEJANDRO HERNANDEZ:	I have24 to - - I have to send money back home.	This25 City' s built by immigrant and we' re all
2 immigrants and we cannot be thrown out this way.3 (Audience participation.)4	MR. ALEJANDRO HERNANDEZ:	We can't5 afford the rent increase because as immigrants,6 we're poor and we can't afford the rent increase.7 I want you to consider the Spanish8 as immigrants, not as a race, as an inferior race9 but a race that has helped New York City.10 (Applause.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 MR. ALEJANDRO HERNANDEZ:	Thank13 you.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 Gracias.16 Sid Miller.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Excuse me.19 Mr. Miller is next;20 Followed by Hilda Chavez.21 Go ahead.22 And followed by - - Mr. Miller, hold23 on one second.24 Mr. Miller will be followed by Hilda25 Chavez;5 
2	Followed by Ramona Santana.3 Okay. Go ahead.4 MR. SID MILLER:	My dear friends we5 are gathered here today, as we do every year, to6 mourn the loss of the rock of the economic7 system.8 Let us bow our heads in reverence9 and try to remember the decades ago when10 competition in the housing market was with us.11 In those days we could live anywhere we wanted,12 in the five boroughs, in our choice of vibrant13 neighborhoods but only if we were ready, willing14 and able to pay the free market rent.15 But for the past 6 5   years we have16 given our politicians the following marching17 orders: Keep my rent low even if the rest of the18 City burns down around me or you will not be19 reelected.20 In the mid 1940s Albany did not care21 about the long term health of our City, did not22 care if tenants suffered in future years.	The23 only thing the hacks cared about was avoiding the24 unemployment line.25 So Albany sold us down the River but5 
2 if Albany allowed national rent control to sunset3 in the mid 1940s, today there would be4 competition in housing, lower rents and we5 tenants would have a wide choice of fine6 neighborhoods in which to live.7 Examination of the facts proves that8 the narrow- minded, shortsighted, the9 what' s-in-it- for-me politicians, delivered10 exactly what you tenants ordered, a housing11 crisis that is beyond repair.12 The cancer of rent regulations has13 poisoned our great City.	You tenants make me14 sick.15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hilda Chavez;17 Followed by - - take the mike down,18 take the mike off.19 Followed by Ramona Santana;20 Followed by Tim Collins .21 (Audience participation.)22 MS. HILDA CHAVEZ:	Allow me to23 express my appreciation for the first opportunity24 to be able to address this Board in the borough25 in which in live .2 
2	(Applause.)3	MS. HILDA CHAVEZ:	I'm Hilda4 Chavez.	I'm a Board Member of the Northwest5 Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition .6 (Audience participation.)7 MS. HILDA CHAVEZ:	I am a member of8 Tenants and Neighbors, a member of Housing Here9 and Now and a Board Member of the Met Council.10 Today in The Daily News I read this11 statement made by the Rent Stabilization12 Association that the average rent in the Bronx13 was $674 a month, which is considerably lower14 than the New York City average.15 Well, I admit I don't have all the16 studies behind me, but my time spent in the17 neighborhood in which - - Morris Heights,18 indicated to me that most, if not all, of the19 tenants are paying considerably higher rent than20 that.21 (Audience participatio n.)22 MS. HILDA CHAVEZ:	Rents that are23 near that either slightly above or below that,24 are due to the fact that the State Board has25 ordered reduced rents because of the failure of4 
2the landlordto provide essential services and/or34repairs.Current rents are already5unaffordablefor thousands, if not tens of6thousands oftenants throughout the Northwest7	throughout the City.	Many tenants - right now do8 not receive essential services and/or repairs,9 have to live in crowded quarters or have to live10 with the constant threat of eviction resulting in11 the Bronx experiencing the highest rate of12 nonpayment evictions in the City.13 Annual rent increases places a14 financial burden and/or hardship on thousands of15 tenants.	Affordability should be inclusive, not16 exclusive.	Affordable should mean affordable to17 all tenants18 (Audience participation.)19 MS. HILDA CHAVEZ:	without20 creating displacement, homelessness,21 overcrowding, or substandard living conditions.22 Annual rent increases erode the23 meaning of affordability when wages are not a24 prominent factor in the calculation and/or25 determination processes.8 
2 The time has come to freeze rents3 especially in light of the fact that this same4 article told us that last year we lost 7,3875 units, stabilized units in the year 2005.6	The time is right.	It has arrived.7	Freeze the rents.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question, Hilda.11 There' s a question.	Question, question.	Leon.12 Go ahead . Adriene.13 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you for14 corning and testifying.	And I thank all of the15 members of the Northern Bronx16 MS. HILDA CHAVEZ:	Community Clergy17 Coalition.18 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	- - for corning.19 I love the shirts.20 So thinking about the neighborhoods21 that you serve, can you tell us what the rents22 are for the available apartments in those23 neighborhoods?24 MS. HILDA CHAVEZ:	You mean25 available, meaning vacant?10 
2	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Vacant, yes.3 MS. HILDA CHAVEZ:	Okay.	Easily,4 as the Reverend mentioned earlier, in the	for5 Brooklyn, easily $1,100 for the apartment if not6 higher.	And in some - -7 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Is that a8 one-bedroom? How many bedrooms?9	MS. HILDA CHAVEZ:	$1,100 for a10 one-bedroom apartment.	And in some parts of the11 City, in the Bronx it has even higher than that.12 It depends on how much he thinks he can squeeze13 out of us.14 Yes?15 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	What about16 conditions in some of these units?17 MS. HILDA CHAVEZ:	Oh, well, I18 think that when tenants and neighbors gave the19 testimony that there are over two million20 violations in the City, I think that speaks for21 itself.22 Recently, I understand, members of23 the Rent Guidelines Board took a tour of some of24 the, at least a couple of the locations in the25 Bronx.	And what they saw wasn' t something that10 
2 was unique, it is commonplace in the Bronx .	It3 is what I would say typifies the Bronx .4	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And with those5 conditions what is it that tenants can to try to6 improve the conditions or get them somehow7 reported?8	MS. HILDA CHAVEZ:	You mean what9	measures do they take - -10	DIRECTOR HOLDER :	Yes .11	MS . HILDA CHAVEZ :	- - to get the12 conditions corrected?	The standard measures, the13 form tenants associations .	They appeal to HPD.14 They go to court.	We have also been in15 partnership with the banks.	We have tried to16 deal with DHCR.	And DHCR recently granted a17 rent reduction, but we failed and they refused to18 tell the tenants what that rent reduction now19 meant.	And we're working on that one also.2 0	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	When you think21 about all of the different things that folks are22 still trying to do, looking at those buildings23 with conditions and those buildings that you're24 advocating for, do the landlords still take25 increases in those buildings?21 
2	MS. HILDA CHAVEZ:	Of course they3	do.	And let me tell you something else, if it4 wasn' t for organizations like the Northwest Bronx5 and several organizations that are here right at6 the moment, CASA for one, if we weren' t helping7 the tenants watch their leases, he would take8 more than what is legally allowed.	They have9 done it in many cases.10 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 MS. HILDA CHAVEZ:	You' re welcome.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Adams has15 some questions.16 MS. HILDA CHAVEZ:	Yes.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hilda?18 MS. HILDA CHAVEZ:	Yes.19 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	One question.20 In terms of some of the conditions21 in the units and the violations that are there.22 MS. HILDA CHAVEZ:	Yeah.23 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	What have you done24 in terms of dealing with the agencies that25 supposedly have a responsibility for enforcement?
2 MS . HILDA CHAVEZ:	Well, we - - we3 actually meet with them.	We form, if you will,4 groups, coalitions to meet with them and to5 discuss the problem, not on a unit level, but on6 a City level.7 We have complied, through Housing8 Here and Now, a list of the hundred, hundred9 worst landlords in the City covering all five10 boroughs.11 Right now we've published earlier in12 the year, the ten most horrible landlords in this13 City.	And as I speak we are continually working14 down that list to reach an agreement with the15 landlords and with the banks to get these16 conditions corrected or remedied.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Thank you very19 much.20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker22 is Ramona Santana.2 3	A VOICE:	I need somebody translate.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And she needs an25 interpreter .

And I'm representing the7 tenants at 443 Cyrus Place .8 I belong to the Northwest Bronx9 Coalition .	I've been living at this building for10 24 years .11 And nine months ago there was a fire12 at this building .	Until May 22nd - - on May 22nd13 last month is when they started fixing the14 damages.	Two months - - two weeks ago they15 stopped working on it and another fire started .16 The manager of the building told her17 that she must - - she must evict the apartment18 because he was losing money.19 I ask you .20 (Audience participation .)21 MS. RAMONA SANTANA: - - I ask you if22 the landlords are not fixing and our salaries are23 not going up, why should we pay a rent increase?24 If we allow this increase to happen,25 the poor people would have to leave the City . We5 
2	came to this country called the country of3	opportunities.	With this rent increases the4	rent of the poor people will come to $2,000 a5	month.	We would have to leave because we're6	being pushed out.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	She needs to8 wrap up.9 MS. RAMONA SANTANA:	We have to10 unite - -11 (Audience participation.)12 MS. RAMONA SANTANA:	- - we have to13 unite to have control of the laws and we have to14 unite to say no to 8.5 percent increase, zero15 percent.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 MS. RAMONA SANTANA:	Thank you.18 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Marvin, you have19 to allow more time for translation.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	She translated21 it.22 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I know, but if23 she needs more time, we can't keep using the same24 clock for the translation.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I didn't I gave10 
2themforty,fifty seconds more.3Tim Collins;4Followed by Jose Rodriguez;5Followed by Ernst Endrich .6Mr .Collins .7MR .TIM COLLINS:Thank you, Mr .8Chairman, Membersof the Board.9	There is nobody more important to10 the tenant community in New York City then the11 issue of Home Rule.	The Chairman has asserted12 that you have no jurisdiction over the matter and13 so you have no business in this debate .14 If the normal mechanism of15 democratic representation were operating fairly,16 even in a rough way, the Chairman would be17 correct .	But when it comes to City' s rent and18 eviction protections, the Democratic process is19 broken, it does not work.20 (Audience participation .)21 MR . TIM COLLINS:	It used to be22 said that the politics of rent regulation were23 simple, the landlords have the money, the tenants24 have the votes, the results were balanced and25 fair rent laws .	That isn't true anymore .	The10 
2 landlords do have the money and they spend it3 prodigiously on favored politicians, but the4 votes - - but the votes that control the City' s5 rent regulation system do not come from the City.6 The votes that control our rent laws come from7 Rochester and Plattsburgh and Monticello and8 Binghamton and scores of other Upstate cities and9 towns.10 (Audience participation.)11	MR. TIM COLLINS:	And frankly the12 voters in these upstate communities don't give a13 damn about the City's struggling tenants and14 neither do their elected officials.15 But those same legislators know that16 if they don't hurry favor with a large landlord17 organizations in the City they will lose massive18 financial support at election time.19 The result of this seedy alliance is20 the deliberate dismantling of the City' s rent and21 evictions protections and the consequence of22 abandoning tenant protections is the City's23 deepest housing affordability crisis since the24 Great Depression.25 The numbers are clear, the highest12 
2 rent burdens ever recorded.	Record homeless3 levels.	Severe overcrowding and a massive loss4 of affordable apartment.5 On June 1st the Chairman suggested6 that those who want Home Rule are free to go to7 Albany on their own and fight for it.	But the8 process in Albany has been fundamentally9 corrupted, the doors are closed.10 (Audience participation.)11 MR. TIM COLLINS:	Telling us to go12 to Albany - - telling us to go to Albany is like13 telling the Patriots of Boston in 1773 that they14 should simply petition the King and not do15 something so messy like dump tea in Boston16 Harbor;17 Telling us to go to Albany is like18 telling Rosa Parks to lobby the Governor of19 Alabama about desegregating public20 transportation - -21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. TIM COLLINS:	rather than23 take a seat at the front of the bus.	Neither24 the Boston Patriots nor Rosa Parks had any real25 way of influencing the corrupt systems that they2 
2 confronted except to resist with the limit tools3 available.4	In Boston they dumped tea in the5 Harbor;6 In Montgomery, Alabama Ms. Parks7 moved to the front of the bus;8 In the City of New York aggrieved9 tenants have these hearings.10 This is our Boston harbor.	This is11 our segregated bus.	This is our chosen field of12 battle.13 (Audience participation.)14 MR. TIM COLLINS:	There is a thick15 and threatening wall between the citizens of this16 City and fair housing laws.	We are now boxed in17 losing battle after battle with forces far more18 powerful than we are.	This wall was built with19 massive amounts of real estate money and it is20 guarded by politicians who have no accountability21 to us.22 I ask each of you in the most urgent23 and respectful terms, help us tear down that24 wall.25 Thank you.10 
2.(Audience participation.)3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.	Mr.4Collins,question.5Adriene.6DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Yes.7If this Board were to pass an8advisoryresolution on the repeal of Urstadt or9 recommending the repeal of Urstadt, what would10 that do in the City New York?11	MR. TIM COLLINS:	This Board is like12 a canary in a coal mine.	This Board is the first13 to see what's happening in the housing system.14 You have the most informed staff.	You do the15 most work.	You gather the most information and16 you're in the best position to see the17 consequences of three decades of State control18 over rent regulation.19 Your voice is influential.	It's20 meaningful.	The first Rent Guidelines21 Board was appointed by Mayor Lindsay to pass on22 the issue on whether or not we should have a23 stabilization system altogether.	If this Board24 were to speak, to speak firmly, clearly and25 loudly that three decades of State control are
2 destroying tenant protection s in the City, that3 three decades of State correctly have lead to an4 incredibly abnormal and arbitrary system of rent5 regulations where poor owners get very little6 assistance, where very wealthy owners are getting7 everything from the State, I think that the State8 would start to listen.9 I'm deeply disappointed.	And the10 Mayor, who I actually admire and support, that he11 has stayed in City Hall, he' s refused to come out12 and speak on this issue.	And I think that if he13 were to come out and speak on this issue he would14 have no other choice but to support his15 constituents and say of course we need Home Rule16 over rent regulation.17 And I think this Board can help in18 the process by saying every source of data that19 we look at shows that state control has lead to20 very poor housing problems.	We can do better if21 we control them ourselves.	The data says that22 and we support it.23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. TIM COLLINS:	Thank you.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.
2	The next speaker is Jose Rodriguez;3 Followed by Ernst Endrich;4 Followed by Father Robert Arce.5 MR. JOSE RODRIGUEZ:	My name is6 Jose Rodriguez .7 And why can't I pay an increase, I8 live on a fixed income .	The Social Security is9 not going to give me more money for rent .	The10 landlords, they say they need more money but11 where it goes?	They don't fix anything .12 Right now we got a leaky radiators,13 leaky pipes, peeling paint.	The wiring on the14 apartments are so old it's the same age as the15 building, about eighty-something years old.16 The other day there was a - - three17 months ago it was a fire in one of the apartment18 and the super tried to blame the tenant and say19 you're going to have to pay for this.	And the20 fireman had to say don' t worry about it because21 that' s the landlord' s fault because this wiring22 is too old.	We' re ready to have a major fire in23 our building.24 The roof leak, everything is so bad25 that you can't do nothing about it now.
2 The other day my wife and I needed3 some medicine because she had to get an eye4 operation.	She couldn't buy it because we had to5 pay the bills.	We had to pay the rent.	And6 that - - that money came off the food bill.	We7 had - - we had to cut on the food bill to get that8 medication for my wife.9 And this is - - a lot of people like10 us are going through the same thing.	It's not11 only me, it's a lot of people going through this12 same thing that they cannot afford the rent13 anymore.14 Another increase we going - - we're15 going to have to go to the subway.	We're going16 to have to go outside to live because we can't17 afford it anymore.18 And I'm pleading to you to vote for19 us.	Give us a break because the landlords, they20 making so much money that they don't know what to21 do with it.	There' s no major improvement in the22 buildings anymore, no major improvement.23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. JOSE RODRIGUEZ:	So I beg you,25 vote for us, please vote for us.
2	Thank you.3	MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Thank you.4 The next speaker is Ernst Endrich;5 Followed by Robert - - Father Robert6 Arce;7 Followed by Jose Polino.8 MS. ERNST ENDRICH:	Good evening,9 ladies and gentlemen.10 In the last six years, like natural11 gas prices went up from 58 cents a term to $2.98.12 As you know, for driving cars, number of gasoline13 six years ago compared to now, $3.14 My insurance went up from $15,000 to15 $25,000.	My	not health care cost insurance16 - - my property tax gone up over fifty percent and17 now it goes up on a ten percent on the 1st of18 July.	So the increase you're asking is not to19 get more out of the tenants, it's to pay the City20 who increase our expenses.21 Now, my taxes went up from $15,00022 to 24,000 alone.	The boiler, taxes, insurance,23 the heating conditions.	And it's for all four24 items, for three items belong to the City.	So25 whatever they get increases they're paying it4 
2 back to the City.	So you guys go back to your3 bosses and tell them, to Bloomberg and ask him4 don't raise, refuse the taxes, lose the taxes.5 Go to Con Edison, reduce or go to Bush, whoever6 you want to go to, right, reduce our term from $37 down to $1.8 So it's not the landlord's fault,9 it's politician s fault, the hungry politicians in10 Washington who want more money.	As if the money11 goes to us, it goes to Iraq so blame them, don't12 blame the landlords.13 (Audience participation.)14 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Thank you.15 Father Robert Arce;16 And then Jose Polino.17 (Audience participation.)18 MR. ROBERT ARCE:	I've been19 baptized with a couple of different names20 tonight.21 My name is Father Robert Arce.22 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Sorry.23 MR. ROBERT ARCE:	It's okay.24 I've served in the South Bronx from25 Bronx of 1967 until the present time with the
2 exception of three years of service in the East3 Bronx.4 As you know, the South Bronx is one5 of the poorest, if not the poorest, Congressional6 Districts in the entire United States.7 The Bronx is coming back, but for8 the wealthy.	South of 138th Street is now called9 SoBro.10 (Audience participation .)11 MR. ROBERT ARCE:	We need only to12 look and see new developments everywhere.	About13 fifteen to twenty blocks away from here we're14 supposed to get a new neighborhood and a new15 Yankee Stadium.16 Until recently I was receiving three17 or four requests per month from developers asking18 if the Churches' property was for sale .	The19 developers even went to the trouble of finding20 out the block and lot number of the churches'21 property.22 Yet in spite of all the promised23 improvements, our people are still paying rent to24 live in substandard housing.	How would you like25 to live in an apartment where your teenage
2 daughter is apprehensive about taking a bath3 because she can hear the rats crawling through4 the walls.5 Their rent increase is one of the6 lowest.	If that was meant as a warning to the7 landlords to improve and clean up their property,8 it did not have much success because the9 buildings in our neighborhood are in as poor10 condition as ever .11 No entrance security.	Elevators12 that work sporadically.	Inoperable windows.13 Stairs with rotting risers.	Leaks from other14 apartments ruining furniture and weakening the15 structure of the building itself.	And lest we16 forget, rats, mice and roaches everywhere.17 Send out the message that more needs18 to be done before there are any more rent19 increases .20 As some of you know, last year we21 issued an invitation to the members of the Board22 to come for a tour of the South Bronx.23 Mr. Martin Zellneck, who was a24 Member of the Board and his term has since25 expired, accepted that invitation and was given a2 
2	walking tour.3	We, again, issued the same4 invitation, come to the South Bronx and see what5 life is like for so many of our residents .	In6 order to arrive at an informed decision, I invite7 you to come walk through our streets .	Don 't just8 listen. Don't just talk with someone who tells9 you about the South Bronx.	Don't fly over it or10 drive through it, or look at photographs .	I mean11 walk through our streets .12 (Audience participatio n.)13 MR. ROBERT ARCE:	If you don't walk14 through them you cannot know the South Bronx.15 See that good that has been achieved through the16 work of our residents and our local organizations17 and the bad that is still a daily fact of life18 for our residents .19 Could there be some kind of a merit20 system, those landlords who are responsible get21 an increase, the landlords who are not22 responsible do not get an increase or a loan from23 a bank?	The power to improve the lives of24 thousands of people is in your hands. Send out25 the message that there must be improvements .4 
2 Help make it possible for our people to live with3 safety and dignity in their homes.	Use your4 power wisely.5 Thank you very much.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 (Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker9	is Jose Polino who needs an interpreter.10 A VOICE:	He wants me to speak for11 him, may I?	My name is John Flynn.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right, we' ll13 move - -14 A VOICE:	I'm on the list anyway.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, you're on16 the list.17 We' ll move to Father Flynn, is it?18 John Flynn is up.19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Father Flynn,21 hold on one second.22 MR. JOHN FLYNN:	Sure.2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And we're then24 going to take a five-minute break for the25 stenographer.24 
2 We' ll be back at 8:00 and we' re3 going to go to two and a half minutes because4 we've got a lot of speakers still signed up and5 we're going to try to make sure everyone can6 speak.7 Father Flynn, go ahead.8 MR. JOHN FLYNN:	I have been in the9 Bronx since 1958.	And we've really done some10 tremendous things through the churches and the11 government working very hard together to bring12 back the Bronx.13 We had the fires in the 70s.	People14 were living in shelters in the 80s.	And it was a15 tremendous - - Koch was the Mayor at the time I16 believe and the churches all got together and the17 government and we built - - rebuilt the Bronx for18 the people who are now living in it to the folks19 that are not with very high incomes.20 And I just was looking around my21 parish, which is 182nd Street and Crotona.	And a22 block away they're putting up a building that23 it's - - they call it a condominium apartment,24 it's going to $310, 000 for a three-bedroom and25 $290,000 for one-bedroom.	This is not really for2 
2 most of our people.3 There's another building that' s just4 down the block away from us, it's four hundred5 and forty five brought by the owner.	And it's6 ninety for the - - one of the persons, and7 three-bedroom is seventy.	And I understand from8 people in my parish there's a lot of buildings9 now are 90 for the rent every month and a $1,00010 for rent every month.	I have seen a lot of my11 people go away so it's breaking up the parishes.12 I want to talk a little bit about13 some - - a system which I thought was a great,14 great system was the Section 8 system.	When it15 was community- based it worked.	And then it got16 weakened by this voucher system that came out.17 And in the voucher system when a18 vacant apartment came up, the landlord could just19 get rid of it and then he could put it at market20 price and raise his price.	In fact, in some21 cases he would work so that that man or woman or22 whoever was in that apartment would get out of23 the apartment then he could use it the way he24 wanted to.25 What I think is we should get back2 
2 to the cooperative business that we were in with3 the City and with all of the political people and4 all of our churches are still with our5 organizations.	And we need to work with you.	We6 worked with you once .	It worked.	It is not7 working now.	Our people are being moved out.8 And I really think that one of the things that we9 should look into is really a project based10 Section 8 building was the best thing we had,11 kept it fair.12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 Okay.	We're going to take a recess.15 We' ll be back at 8:00.16 It's ten to eight.17 Thank you .18 (At 7:48 p.m. the hearing was19 temporarily recessed.20 (At  8:01 p.m. the hearing was21 resumed.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hello?	All23 right.	We're going to get started again.24 We're going to have Jesse Davidson.25 Jesse Davidson;2

2 Jesse Davidson, thank you, from the Bronx.	I'm3 from the Bronx in the Tremont area of the Bronx45 VOICES:	Can't hear.6 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Turn the mike7 on.8 MR. JESSE DAVIDSON:	Hello, hello,9 hello.10 (There was an interruption in the11 hearing.)12 MR. JESSE DAVIDSON:	Can everybody13 hear me?	All right.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Got to talk15 louder.16 MR. JESSE DAVIDSON:	All right.17 I'll try my other voice.18 All right.	I'm Jesse Davidson.	I'm19 from the Bronx, from the Tremont area of the20 Bronx.	I've been living there most of my life,21 pretty much all of my life.	I go all the way22 back to World War II.23 And I've been looking at a24 neighborhood and neighborhoods.	I'm very well25 known in the Bronx.	I know the Bronx very well.5 
2 I would like - - I heard some of the3 commentary here tonight and I'd like to encourage4 the Board Members to take a more personal5 interest in what' s happening here.6 We have been looking at the7 deterioration of some very good neighborhoods,8 some very solid neighborhoods.	There' s no sense9 in watching buildings, residential buildings in10 the Bronx and watching the residential buildings11 in the Bronx gradually, and as a matter fact,12 it's accelerating, to continue to deteriorate.13 People do pay their rents.	People14 do take care of neighborhoods.	And we do15 cooperate together in all those neighborhoods to16 maintain a good neighborhood, a standard of17 living, a quality of life that could be18 considered normal under ordinary circumstances.19 When you continue to increase rents20 every single year and we watch the buildings21 deteriorate slowly - - and noticeably you asked22 the question - - correct questions before as to23 what do we do when things go wrong in our24 buildings, the home sites and the homes that we25 live in, and there' s very little we can do except2 
2 go to landlord/Tenant Court or whatever steps we3 have is not adequate.	The landlords do not take4 that money and put it back into maintaining those5 buildings and keeping them at a certain level.6 (Audience participation.)7 MR. JESSE DAVIDSON:	There's8 absolutely not justification, at least in the9 Bronx, there' s no justification for rent10 increases at this particular time as long as the11 buildings are continually deteriorating for a12 lack of maintenance.	And I'm talking about now13 not the emergency things like a fire and things14 like that, I'm talking about normal wear and tear15 is not being taken care of in these buildings and16 that's where we're losing our neighborhoods.17 And it's going to be up to this18 Board to stop the continual increases in rent,19 presumably on the extended cost, until such time20 that landlords can take the money, take their21 rent money and maintain the properties; simply22 that they have to maintain the properties before23 they can get rent increases regardless of outside24 costs to everyday living.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 
I17 interpreter) I don't want the rent to go up.18 It's too, much eight percent.19 MR. FABIO RIPAS:	(In English) you20 know why, because for three reasons:	The first21 reason is the landlord never repair the problem22 when it broken or something inside the room or in23 the room because the building is new one and24 nobody repair it.	Because the super no coming,25 no coming .	It almost, it disappear .	He not17 
2 coming and the rent high .3 The second reason is the people4 inside the building is to sell the blood,5 cigarette, nobody control .	The super  is looking6 for him.	Nobody control.7 MR. FABIO RIPAS:	(Through8 interpreter) we're hoping for the landlord to9 come - - to come and have a meeting with  everybody10 in the building so that we can change the living11 conditions in the building because we can't live12 like this anymore.13 We' re also hoping to have a new14 super at the building .	The building is new and15 we have a drug problem and the landlord 's not16 doing anything about it.17 (Audience participation.)18 MR . FABIO RIPAS:	Maybe you can19 pay two, three thousand dollar rent because20 you're rich, but we're the poor and we can't pay21 that amount .22 You give us - - you give us the steak23 and we get the bone.	We can't live like this.24 Have compassion and dignity towards us.25 (Audience participation.)2 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3	Elizabeth Hay;4	Followed by Gajendra Parasram;5	Followed by Jamie Johnson.6 Elizabeth, go ahead.7 MS. ELIZABETH HAY:	Good evening.8	My name is Elizabeth Hay.	I'm the9 attorney in charge of the Harlem Community Law10 Office of the Legal Aid Society.	I'm also a11 renter.12 And my remarks tonight are informed13 both by my own experience and my experience14 representing poor tenants in Upper Manhattan, as15 well as other areas of the City because I have16 worked also in Brooklyn in a past career.17 I won't repeat the remarks that a18 lot of people have already made except to observe19 that the real estate industry is not losing money20 in New York City.	I think that is fairly21 obvious.	And the reasons given for the proposed22 increases I think do not outweigh the need to23 protect affordable housing for people of low and24 modest means.25 As many speakers have pointed out,9 
2	rents that are going to $1,100, $1,200, $1,3003 for one and two-bedroom apartments, are not4 affordable apartments.	They are not affordable5 apartments for my clients.	They are not6 affordable apartments for the people who take7 care of your children.	They are not affordable8 apartments for the people who drive cabs, who9 sweep the streets, who take care of you in the10 hospital .	They' re not affordable people - -11 affordable apartments for public servants.12 They' re not affordable apartments for the workers13 of this City.14 And do you really want a City where15 everybody who works to keep the City going has to16 live outside the City?	I don' t.	I don' t want to17 be forced out.	I don't want my clients to be18 forced out and that's exactly what' s happening.19 Rents are going up because of Major20 Capital Improvements.	Landlords are deferring21 repairs and instead are doing things that are22 improvements that they then get to raise the23 rents for that.24 There are, as other speakers have25 noted, so-called renovations of vacant apartments3 
1	2082 that result in huge increases.	Landlords are3 taking more and more housing stock out of the4 rental market through co- op and condo conversions5 and increases in rents of the type that have been6 proposed, contribute to that momentum.7 Because the rents become8 unaffordable and whether or not people buy their9 co-op apartments, they can no longer afford the10 rents and they're forced out of the City.11 I urge you to consider some of the12 proposals that have been made to pass an advisory13 opinion urging restoration of Home Rule, repeal14 of the Urstadt Law.	And I urge you to vote no to15 increases and zero increases at this time.16 Neither my clients nor the workers17 of this City can afford the rents that are now18prevalenttoday.19CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20MS. ELIZABETH HAY:	Thank you.21(Audience participation.)22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Gajendra23Parasram;24Followed by Jamie Johnson;25Followed Xiomara Mejias.
2	Go ahead.3	MR. GAJENDRA PARASRAM:	Good4 evening, everybody.5 I'm not a good public speaker so I6 just write something up.7 I'm an owner of a seventeen-family8 unit located in the Soundview area of the Bronx.9 I'm here today on behalf of many landlords who10 are struggling to maintain their building.11 Maintaining a seventeen-unit12 building involve many expenses that tenant and13 other people do not realize.14 For example, mortgages, water,15 sewer, taxes, building maintenance, and other16 costs.	Contractor fees are always increasing and17 expensive.18 My increasing expenses is much19 higher than my income.	Unfortunately many20 landlord, include myself, have very low income. I21 have many apartment with legal rent as low as22 $582.	I struggle to make ends meet and cannot23 maintain this building without help of - -24 (Audience participation.)25 MR. GAJENDRA PARASRAM:	another4 
2 job .3 When an apartment becomes vacant,4	there is a loss of income which makes the5 situation more worse.	Sometimes an apartment is6 unrented for a few months and will cause7 many things to backup.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Can we have order,9 please.10 MR. GAJENDRA PARASRAM:	I'm11 ordering the Guideline Board to vote for higher12 rent increases.13 The past two years' renewals14 guidelines were very displeasing and barely help15 apartment with low incomes.	The vacancy and16 Capital Improvement guidelines are insufficient17 to help cover the loss of income during this18 turnover period.19 It is impossible to turn the20 building expense in order to increase the rent to21 steady and low levels.	I'm asking this Board to22 carefully examine the situation of landlords and23 please vote for higher rent increase to help24 cover our never-ending expenses.25 Thank you very much for you time.5 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3 (Audience participation.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jamie Johnson5 please.	Jamie Johnson;6 Followed by Xiomara Mejias;7 Followed by Carl Miller.8 Jamie Johnson.9 MR. JAMIE JOHNSON:	Hello.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hi.11 MR. JAMIE JOHNSON:	My name is Jamie12 Johnson.	And trust me, it's a name you're going13 to be hearing again.14 I'm just an average person.	Like a15 lot of these people here, we' re average people.16 A lot of you are average people.	We want the17 same thing as everyone else wants.	We want to18 live in good conditions.	We want for our19 children to be raised up in good neighborhoods.20 Some of you people on the Board was21 invited to my building to look at the conditions22 in my building and you see the deplorable23 conditions.	I mean we live subhumanly.	None of24 these people in the - - on this Board right here25 would want to live in my building.10 
2 And to say that landlord should get3 some increases in rent, he has done nothing with4 the money that he's gotten already.	One of the5 people on the Board actually there was a mortgage6 on the building, 2.8 million.	What did he do7 with the 2.8 million, nothing.	From what I8 understand he built condos out in Long Island9 somewhere or City Island, you know.10 We have children also.	Our children11 live in these buildings.	Our children are being12 lead poisoned because of the condition in the13 buildings.	I heard some landlords talk about14 what they' re going through and what they're15 paying.	Well, if they were keeping up the16 buildings correctly the way it's supposed to, it17 would have cured so many of the costs that they18 have.19 The landlords just let the buildings20 go.	They don't do anything but they get21 increases every single year.	With the increases22 that you're imposing this year that' s - - from23 2004 up until now, it's like a twenty percent24 increase in rent for a hundred percent of25 nothing. And we can't live like that anymore.2 
2 I'm not saying all landlords are3 bad, but the ones that we live with are bad.4 There has to be a separate, some type of way,5 some way how you have to have a list of the bad6 landlords that are making people live in subhuman7 conditions and still getting increased rents and8 saying that they need more money to improve the9 conditions, but doing nothing with the money that10 they're getting.	This is not fair.	This is not11 right and this is not humane.12 We can't continue with this13 practice.	There has to be some way that the14 common person can live the American dream just a15 little bit.16 I had a condition in my apartment17 were the window guards were too high.	My18 daughter was halfway out the window one day when19 I seen her.	It took eight months to - - excuse20 me, ten months for them to fix that.	That's21 stupid, but then, again, I still have to pay him22 more.23 The rats are increasing, the roaches2 4	are increasing.	We have no, you know, security25	in our buildings or in our block or anything, but
2	you're telling me they deserve more rent, or3	increasing the rent, I think not.	I don't get an4	increase in pay, but every year they get an5	increase in rent.	It makes it harder for me6 (Audience participation.)7 MR. JAMIE JOHNSON:	- - it makes it8	harder for me to provide for my family.9 (Audience participation.)10 MR. JAMIE JOHNSON:	And for me to11	have to move out of that building at that rent to12 move someone else - - somewhere else for a lower13 rent, what type of building would that be for me14 and my children?	You're making us go down the15 hill and you're putting our children in more16 danger.	The landlords that we live in - - the one17 building that we live deserve no rent increase.18 They don't deserve it.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap20 up.21 MR. JAMIE JOHNSON:	Okay.	I'm22 going to wrap it up like this, zero percent23 increase!24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good wrap up.12 
2 Xiomara Mejias, are you here?	Yes,3 is that you?4 Carl Miller - - followed by Carl5 Miller;6 Followed by Carmen Johnson.7 Xiomara.8	MS. XIOMARA MEJIAS:	Yes.	My name9 is Xiomara Mejias.	And I'm member of the10 Northwest Bronx Community Coalition and a member11	of Housing Here and Now.	I am also the tenant12 leader at 2654 Valentine Avenue.13 My feelings towards these issues are14 it is ridiculous.	You have lots of peoples that15 are on some kind of assistance, whether it's16 Public Assistance or SSI.	Then you have those17 that are hardworking whether it's two- family18 income.	You have single parents, whether they're19 single parent males or single parent female, but20 they're single. You have people like myself that21 are self-employed.	We cannot afford it.	It's22 not in our budget.	I'm sorry.23 We	you want to increase our rents24 but we're living in conditions like these25 (indicating.) It is ridiculous to increase rents,
1	2162 if you could see, to increase our rents just to3 live in these conditions.	We have roach4 infestation, rat infestation.	We have leaky5 roofs.	We have ceilings fallings.	It's - - in6 the winter time insufficient heating and hot7 water, but yet the landlords want more money.8 Our programs are not going to9 increase our funds.	Our employers are not going10 to give us a pay raise to accommodate these rent11 increases.	And I would just have to work that12 much harder just to make - - come up with the13 money to pay my rent for the month.	It is not14 right and I believe everybody agrees with me.15 (Audience participation.)16 MS. XIOMARA MEJIAS:	You need to17 take a look at the living conditions that we are18 enduring and basically, straight to the point,19 give them no rent increase.	It's not fair to us.20 We're human, we' re not animals.21 Thank you.22 (Audience participation.)2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 Carl Miller.	Carl Miller, is that25 you?
1	2172	MR. CARL MILLER:	Yes, it is .3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Followed by4 Carmen Johnson;5 Followed by Judd Kessler.6 MR. CARL MILLER :	Good evening .7 Why I'm here tonight is to show you8whatyouneedto see, documentation .And I urge9thatyouheedthis information .10 I live in a 25-unit building owned11 by Jacob Slecknic (phonetic.)	He didn' t make the12 top- ten list.	I have the top-ten list if you13 want to see it.	I was there to see that14 building .	It was the worst building in City15 history .	The worst building in City history .16 The place was on the verge of collapse.17 I live in a 25-unit building .	I18 work vigorously to evict drug dealers.	We had a19 Marshall evict a tenant from the fifth floor20 apartment which is next to mine.	They didn' t21 seal the apartment .	I had a leak on the roof.	I22 have pictures here to show you.23 Jacob Slecknic owns another24 building.	He's the owner of 364 Incorporated,25 780 Incorporated, Rental Master, all of those10 
2 buildings are in deteriorating conditions. None3 of those building - - my fiancee lives at 7804 Garden Street.	There' s over 125 units on that5	block.	She is currently living in my apartment6 because there is no security on the doors.7 There are 19 drug dealers in those8 buildings.	There are people living in the front9 of the buildings.	They actually dug up the floor10 through the east - - east - - east half of the11 building and they give out to tenants with12 families and children, they gave hot plates, two13 single cylinders no matter who you had in your14 apartment.	Did Bertha get one?	No.	They left15 gaping holes in the floors.	They took the stones16 and put them in the hallway.17 They took the kitchen cabinets and18 sinks down and left that in the hallway for over19 two months.	You look like what' s going on.20 You're going to give eight percent to Jacob21 Slecknic?	I don't think so.22 I'm a truck driver and I live in one23 of these buildings with no repair.	The pictures,24 I don't know, I dropped them.	They're here.	And25 let me tell you something, I have a six-foot6 
2 cylinder in the ceiling, I can almost see3 sunshine.	HPD has been there inspecting.4	Another thing I can also tell you, I5 went on-line and I fought and I got information6 on the building.	There's over 125 violations in7 the 25-unit building, go figure.	Do you know8 when the last time he fixed anything in that9 building, 1996.	And the violations are still10 outstanding.	Do you know how much money he owes11 the City?	$1.5 million.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap13 up.14 MR. CARL MILLER:	A 25-unit15 building.	You want to give him eight percent,16 what is he going to do, pay a lawyer to stop17 paying 1.5 million and I still will get a hole in18 the floor.19 Zero.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 MR. CARL MILLER:	Zero.22 (Audience participation.)2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Carmen Johnson.24 MS. CARMEN JOHNSON:	Right here.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on one24 
2	second.3 Followed by Judd Kessler;4 Followed by Carlos Buscar; is that5	right?6	Okay. Carmen.7	MS. CARMEN JOHNSON:	Hi.8	Jamie Johnson was just here a few9 minutes ago and talking about conditions in his10 building.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to12 speak up.13 MS. CARMEN JOHNSON:	Jamie Johnson14 was here a few minutes ago talking about the15 condition in his building.16 We live in the same building so the17 only thing I can say is just speak a little bit18 more about our conditions because his condition19 is my condition.20 I have pictures here of tenants that21 they brought in from their building that looks22 exactly like my building, okay.	I have been2 3	living in the neighborhood for over thirty years.24 I've lived in my building for 28 years.	The25 building was a beautiful building, but once it24 
2	was taken over by the newer landlord, the older3 landlord kept it up pretty good but the new4 landlord didn't do any repairs and is not doing5 any repairs.6 Our walls are cracking.	There's7 lead paint in a lot of the apartments.	Our8 elevators don't work all the time.	We don't have9 any kind of security in the building.	We have10 doors that are open.	It's like a railroad, Grand11 Central where I live, people come in and out.12 He keeps talking about the fact that13 he needs more money to make repairs.	He gets the14 money, he gets the increases, he gets the loans,15 but we are still living in the same conditions.16 Where is the money going?	Why are17 we still living in those conditions?	Why are we18 still paying the increases when we're not getting19 the repairs?	I can't say anything else.	I'm,20 you know, I'm just, you know, very nervous and21 tired and frustrated by this whole thing.22 People say why do you stay where you23 are, because I love this neighborhood because I24 love the Bronx.	I raised my children in the25 Bronx.
1	2222	(Audience participation.)3	MS. CARMEN JOHNSON:	Why should I4	have to move?	Why should I have to leave the5	Bronx because my landlord is not meeting up his6	end of the deal.	Every month I pay my rent.7 Every month he gets it on time.	Why do I have8 to wait for months for repairs in my building9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10	MS. CARMEN JOHNSON:	or in my11	apartment?12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 MS.

1	2232	Jacqueline, is that you?3	MS. JACQUELINE CHRISTIAN:	Yes.4 Let me say I'm glad you are finally5 here in the Bronx.6 My name is Jacqueline Christian.	I7 live at 917 Sheridan Avenue and I've been in my8 building for - - since 1978.9 And I'm just calling - - trying to10 let everybody know that there a lot of disabled11 people, a lot of sick people, a lot of people who12 work hard and have become disabled and have paid13 their rent every year, all the increases and14 everything.	And we are fighting and we are15 afraid that we will be out in the street .16 Our income doesn't match the incomes17 of these landlords.	And every year, or every two18 years they want an increase.	And it's not right.19 And it's not fair, not for all these hard-working20 people.21 We have our medications.	They22 charge us for having air-conditioners which is23 not fair especially when we pay our own gas and24 light.	It has nothing to do with the landlord25 but we have to pay him from 5 to $8 for having an4 
2 air-conditioner or a washing machine or a3 dishwasher, things that you take for granted.4 These are luxuries for us and they are sometimes5 necessities when we can't depend on other people6	to do it for us.	It's not fair and it's not7 right.8 We say the squeaky oil - - the9 squeaky wheels gets the most of oil.	Well, we10 are squeaking loud.	I hope we get the oil.11	Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 (Applause.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'm going to15 call the rest of the names to see who's here.16 Just raise your hand.

We' re15 going to have Joyce Culler and then because she's16 got her bus to catch we're going to do Bridget.17 And then we'll go back to the list.18 Joyce, go ahead.19 MS. JOYCE CULLER:	Welcome to the20 outer borough and the forgotten borough, I should21 say.22 I'm Joyce Culler, a native-born23 resident of the Hunts Point/Longwood Community in24 which I still reside.25 I serve on Community Board #2 as10 
2 Vice Chair and Land Use Housing Committee Chair3 and also Executive Member of Mothers On the Move.4 (Audience participation.)5 MS. JOYCE CULLER:	I'm here this6 evening as a resident of project-based Section 87 housing.8 As you all know, the rehabbing of9 the South Bronx back in the late 70s have done10 justice to many of our communities bringing them11 back from the fires and you got the station.12 What we' re concerned about in the13 Hunts Point/Longwood community is this, our14 landlord, PRC Management is selling nine of the15 buildings.	And we all - - we heard that there are16 many more that are going to be on the market.17 Our community is made up primarily18 of clusters of project-based Section 8 housing.19 If we lose these then we lose our lifelines20 because we can't afford to live anyplace else.21 As you know, the Southeast Bronx is22 one of poorest districts in the nation and Hunts23 Point/Longwood is one of the poorest in the Bronx24 and it would be a travesty to our families.25 I've been living there my lifetime.2 
2 We are five generations entrenched in there.	We3 love our homes.	We love where we're at.	We've4 stayed.	We suffered.	We have stayed through all5 urban blight, through the gangs.	It's unfair now6 that PRC can sell those buildings and meantime7 they have milked the properties.8 They have not used the HUD subsidies9 to maintain them like so many of the other ones10 have and they make enough profit.	Now they're11 ripping off the people of New York City and12 State.13 Once again, they rip our salaries,14 the rip the subsidies.	How much longer is that15 going to go on?	How much longer are you going to16 allow it?	Once they sell those buildings if the17 next landlord do not stay in the program, then18 those buildings are lost from that market19 forever.20 So what happens to the families21entrenchedin thoseneighborhoods where they live22at and putin theirtime as decent human beings?23 What happens to us?	It's easy for you guys to24 sit up and ladies up, on that stage tonight and25 just hear us one after another with the plead,23 
2	but the compassion should go so much deeper.3	Remember, your parents came from4 somewhere.	They settled somewhere and they made5 a life.	We want that opportunity for our6 children too.7 Be a - - be a kindering spirit of8	kindness and love for humanity and not sit there9 and just worry about the dollars and the cents10 for those landlords who are most undeserving.11 What happens to our future generation where12 there' s no longer affordable housing?13 The new construction that came up in14 our neighborhood is under a fair market program15 with the Mayor and that is lousy.	I can tell,16 you I sit in that Chair seat and I know what17 those rents are, where our residents make between18 eleven and 17,000.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap2 0	up.21 MS. JOYCE CULLER:	The idea is we22 can't afford to do it.	Do put pull those levies,23 this is not Louisiana.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 (Audience participation. )21 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We're going to3 do one more speaker than we're going to have to4 change the mike.5 Bridget.6 MS. BRIDGET ESCOLASTICOS:	Hi.7 I'm here with the North Bronx8 Community Care Coalition.9 I live in the building that I lived10 since 1988.	Our landlord keep increasing	in11	my building and only in my apartment we have	I12 have forty violation, only in my apartment.13 And I live there, my mom, four kids,14 cousins, nieces and nephew, about twelve people.15 I can't afford to move out.16 I have Section 8 and I lose Section17 8 because each and everyplace that I was going to18 get an apartment, they was offering - - they was19 offering me an apartment for eighteen - - eight20 seventeen hundred dollars, but my voucher was21 going for a thousand and sixteen.22 So right now every time that we call23 411 when we complain against our landlord, he24 retaliate against us by saying that he's going to25 take us to court, by saying that we have12 
2 violation.3 When my mom rent that apartment4 nineteen years, they rent that apartment to us as5 a two-bedroom apartment and legally it's supposed6 to be only one-bedroom apartment.	So we have a7 partition in the living room that he claim if we8 take it out he going to take us out of the9 apartment.10 And when I went to court he said if11 I don't take that partition out or if I keep12 complaining against him, he going to get us13 evicted.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 MS. BRIDGET ESCOLASTICOS:	So the16 main thing, we cannot keep paying rent when we17 have violation, rat and we live in a very, very18 poor condition, with rat and mices.	We cannot19 pay increase.20 Zero percent.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 (Audience participation.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Catch that bus.24 Lauree Anderson?25 Marina Metalios will be after Lauree2 
2	Anderson.3	Are you here, Marina? Okay.	Go4	ahead, Lauree.5	Oh, sorry.	We're going to fix the6	mike first.7	A VOICE:	Yes.	Give us a few8	minutes.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, a minute.10 Sorry. We're in the home stretch11 here.12 (There was a pause in the13 proceedings. )14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	That's15 good.	Thank you.16 Lauree.17 MS. LAUREE ANDERSON:	Okay. I won't18 be long.19 Good evening to everyone.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good evening to21 you.22 MS. LAUREE ANDERSON:	I'm here on23 behalf of myself and my community.24 I live at 155 West 162nd Street in25 the Highbridge area.
2 I'm here because there shouldn't be3 a rent increase, not that the landlords shouldn't4 get a rent increase, I'm saying this because5 there's a lot of people on fixed incomes.	They6 have no other ways of getting more money to add7 on to their rents.8 For instance, my sister, she is on a9 fixed income.	There' s a lot of elderly and sick10 older people that lives in my building.11 The elevator is more sort of out of12 service than it is in service.	The landlord13 does send someone to fix it, but it hasn' t been14 serviced where whenever someone come to service15 the elevator and you write the date, that hasn' t16 been done in years.17 Everyday that I come from work18 no, I won' t say everyday, but at least three19 times out of the week the elevator is not working20 in the morning or at night when I come home and21 it's a problem.22 And I think as human beings we all23 - - we all are equal.	There's no one no better24 than the other.	We should all live and let live25 because all - - the economy continually to go up
2 and the salaries is staying the same.	I think3 there should not be an increase.	And I'm asking4 if it's any way in you guy's heart that you can5 use your power and explain to the Mayor and the6 Governor that we are human, we are entitled to7 live according - - accordingly to our standard.8 Have I good night and thank you.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10	(Applause.)11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And you have a12 good night.13 Marina Metalios;14 Followed by Glenda Poe;15 Mira Goggins is after Glenda Poe.16 Go ahead, Marina17 MS. MARINA METALLIOS:	RGB, thank18 you for being here.19 I'm Marina Metallios.	I'm a20 rent-regulated tenant.	I live in Stuyvesant21 Town.	And I appreciate the existence of the22 institution of the RGB even if I often don't23 agree with your product.	And the reason I do is24 because in New York City the RGB is the only25 entity, governmental, quasi- governmental that has12 
2·	any substantive power over the rent- regulated3	housing stock, period.	And the Mayor and the4 City council can do what they want, but you're5 the man.6 So under the shadow of the Urstadt7 Law, the only place that a rent-regulated tenant8 like me can come to for discourse and dialogue9	and perhaps remedy, is before you.	So I thank10	you for being here.11	As I mentioned, I live in Stuyvesant12 Town.	And since the rent laws renewed in '97 in13 Albany, every single vacancy in Stuy Town has14 gone to market.	This is every single unit.15 I understand that New York has lost16 200,000 units to the so-called luxury, high rent17 decontrol.	And to me this is a tragedy because18 these - - the units are lost permanently and I see19 two entities' actions creating the loss of these 20	200, 000 units.21 It is the legislature in '97 in22 Albany that passed the law with weakening23 amendments, and it's you, the New York City Rent24 Guidelines Board who has been an accomplice.25 And I think the fact that Albany and
2 the New York City Rent Guidelines Board works3 together in cahoots like this is unacceptable.4 I want to share one other thing that5 very much moves and disturbs me.6 The Stuyvesant Town that I live in7 was built and filled in the 1940s to house8 returning World War II Vets.	They were people9	who chose to serve the United States.	They came10 back.	Many remained public servants.	They had11 kids, they were working people.12 The same people who back then were13 the reasons Stuyvesant Town was built, could not14 move into Stuyvesant right now.	There is no15 2006, analogous of the Word War II Vet, any Vet,16 Iraqi War, et cetera, who could afford to live in17 Stuy Town.18 Your actions are very serious.	They19 have serious implications.	I ask you to take20 them seriously and also join in the effort to21 repeal the Urstadt Law and return Home Rule to22 New York City.23 Thank you for your time.24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Glenda Poe.
2	Myra Goggins;3 Glenda, are you here?	That' s you.4 Myra, are you here?	Okay.5 Followed by Emelio Olen.6 Glenda.7 MS. GLENDA POE:	Yes.	I'm sorry.8 I'm kind of short.9	I'm - - my name is Glenda Poe.	I10 work with CASA, Community Association for Safe11 Apartments in the Bronx.	We' re trying to make a12 safe neighborhood.13 I live in a building, I've live14 there five years.	My ceiling have collapsed15 three times.	I was mugged in the building16 because the super left the door open.	We have17 fake cameras.	A guy walked in behind me, held me18 up with a knife on the elevator.19 This is a landlord who wants more20 rent.	He wants more rent each year even though21 he has 269 violations, housing code and about22 three fire violations.23 But I'm not here just to talk about24 me.	I have people who the - - I know they say the25 fuel prices have gone up.	These people have not10 
2 had any heat in their apartments during the3 winter for a whole week.	No hot water for many a4 month.	And these landlords say, oh, the fuel5 prices have gone up.	I know young couples who6 would like to move into an apartment, they can't.7 We have a young girl live with her8 mom and a young father live with his mother.9 Because their rents have gone from - - a10 one-bedroom from 700, 600 where maybe they can11 afford it, in my neighborhood the Grand12 Concourse, it's now over a thousand dollars.13 They can't afford it.14 So, you know, they say, oh, we have15 this family initiative where we want people to16 marry and have the apartments and that' s a17 Republican agenda, they can't do it because you18 can't live together, how?	They can't afford it.19 And the buildings are falling down.20 My ceiling has mold.	There are - - oh, God I21 don't even want to talk about everything that's22goingoninthat building.The elevators hardly23work.24 Yesterday, Farther' s Day I was going25 to visit my ex-husband with my step kids,24 
2 couldn't, all the lights in the middle of the3 hallway were out, no lights.4 Right downstairs the door again,5 wide open.	And these are the landlords who are6 saying we deserve a rent increase because we've7 been doing good things .8 There are good landlords .	I had a9 great landlord when I was growing up .	I live on10 the Lower East Side growing up. I had a great11 landlord.12 He got a shield.	He changed13 boilers.	He was good.	And that' s a neighborhood14 that was strong because the landlords cared about15 keeping that neighborhood strong before or they16 died.	Now we got landlords who don't even come17 into the community .	I met my landlord once,18 once .	And nobody else knew who the landlord is.19 Half the people in this community don't even know20 their landlord because he won 't even bother to21 come to see you .	And these are the landlords who22 say I'm doing a great job and I deserve a23 increase, no.24 We need to make certain that people25 who are young and starting out can have an2 
1	2402	apartment of their own.	And people who are older3 can live in their apartment safely and a clean4 safe, building.	And people who pay their rent5 every month so they don't have to go all winter6 or half the winter with no heat and hot water7 when the landlord says the fuel has gone up so8 I've got to pay more when they're not getting any9	heat.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap11	up.12 MS. MARINA METALLIOS:	It's just13 some landlords - - we take it on a  case-by-case14 basis.	And this across- the-board thing is crazy.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Myra Goggins.18 MS. MYRA GOGGINS:	Good evening.19 I'm here as a life- long resident of20 the Bronx.	And I would like to just give a21 little different slant on what you have been22 hearing tonight.23 I live in a neighborhood which is24 Pelham Parkway South east of the Zoo and the25 Botanical Gardens, very lovely area, where we12 
2 have many, many senior citizens in our3 neighborhood who are being forced out of their4 homes.	They cannot continue to live in the5 buildings where they have spent most of their6 adult lives.7 Landlords are getting increases8 right and left.	DHCR has seen their way clear to9 grant MCI increases at the drop of a hat.	They10 rubber-stamp whatever the landlord tells them.11 Our landlord brought the building12 fifteen years ago.	He immediately started to do13 what needed to be done, windows, boiler,14 mailboxes, a door that was replaced that didn' t15 have to be put.	We've got an MCI, huge MCI.16 A couple of years after that he put17 in a fraudulent MCI for a new roof that was never18 put in.	We fought it.	We won, which is unheard.19 He parted.	And by the way, while we were20 winning, he got DCHR to deny our part so that we21 still have to pay.22 We won the first MCI.	Then he put23 in for an MCI for the same work.	While they were24 still hearing the par by the landlord of the25 first one, they gave him the second one.	We2 
2 parred it.	We still have a par.	It 's still out3 there, but the landlord is getting his increase4	because it has not come to a conclusion.	It5 never will because the landlord is getting his6 money. He has cut back on the services.	The7 building is not maintained they way it was.8 And to get to the point, seniors are9 living on a fixed incomes, myself included.	We10 don't get increases.	You get a cost of living11 from Medicare that goes for your part B.	And if12 you have the drug plan, it's gone.	We cannot13 afford any increase whatsoever.14 I know some of you came to the15 Bronx.	When the gentleman came last, he voted16 for no increase.	We hope you would realize that17 when the landlords' expenses go up with18 inflation, so do the tenants.	We cannot afford19 the increase.20 And I thank you for coming and for21 listening tonight.	And I hope you would not22 rewards landlords who are just gouging tenants23 right and left.	There is no landlord in New York24 City who does not make a profit.	There is a25 hardship application so keep that in mind.5 
2 I know a lot of landlords and3 they're all making a healthy profit.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 MS.

Come down and we'll get you after23 everybody else.24 Go ahead,	Mr. Hawkins25 MR. ELJEER HAWKINS:	Yes.	My name12 
 2 is Eljeer Hawkins.	And I primarily want to speak3 to those still in this room.	Because those4 tenants who live in the South Bronx have the true5 power, not this Board.	So I want to make that6 very clear.7 I'm from Harlem.	I was born and8 raised in Harlem.	And I want to give you a9 snapshot of what' s going on in Harlem.10 On 145th Street, condominiums are11 being built that' s worth six hundred and twenty12 five hundred thousand dollars.	Here in the South13 Bronx we've already seen the development of14 condominiums and co-ops that' s worth between 15	200,000 and $400,000.16 I'm part of an organization called17 Safe our Parks.	And we've been organizing in the18 South Bronx against the new proposed Yankee19 Stadium - -20 (Audience participation.)21 MR. ELJEER HAWKINS:	That will22 take vital parkland from the residents of the23 South Bronx.	And that the key goal of this new24 Yankee Stadium is to broaden out the scope of25 gentrification and that means to push out working16 
2 class and poor people out of the community.3 And it's not about so much color,4 but about who could pay the rents in the South5 Bronx, who can pay the rents for the condominiums6 and the co-ops.7 So today this is a very volatile8 meeting because I think what we have to come away9 with is that we have to organize.	And the only10 way that we're going to fight back and demand,11 not only no - - no increases to our rents, but, in12 fact, to stop the gentrification going all around13 this City.14 (Audience participatio n.)15 MR. ELJEER HAWKINS:	We need real16 development.	We need schools in this community.17 We need hospitals and clinics.	Will this Board18 go back to its real estate friends, will it go19 back to the Mayor?	Will it go back to the20 various politicians like Adolfo Carrion, your21 Borough President who is pushing the Yankee22 project, who is pushing the gentrification in23 this community while we continue to support the24 Democrats and Republicans who continue to pass25 anti-working class agendas and policies.2 
2 We've come to the point now where we3 have to defend our own interests.4 So in my viewpoint we need to come5 away from this meeting saying that we must6 organize in our communities, organize in our7 buildings.	And if they want to propose a rent8 if they want to propose a rent increase, well, I9 think we need to propose a rent strike on the10 landlords.	That's the way you stop a rent11 increase.	It was done in the 60s.	It was done12 in the 70s and that's how we were able to demand13 affordable housing.14 We must return back to that type of15 strategy of organizing.	So I want the Board to16 go back with that recommendation.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ed Clarke, Ed20 Clarke.21 MR. ED CLARKE:	Good evening.22 I want to thank the RGB for23 appearing in the Bronx.24 From what I - - the way I understand,25 this is your first time in the borough so I'm2 
2	greatly appreciative that you're here.3	A few things I want to discuss.	I4 come from a Mitchell-Lama complex that recently5 went through the dissolution.	And on top of the6 increases that you propose, we are stuck with the7 threat of unique and peculiar circumstances.8 Now, if you're granting, I don' t9 know what the percentage are of what the10 estimates will be, but if you're granting an11 increase on top of the proposed increases that12 are being sent through to the landlord through13 unique and peculiar circumstances, that' s going14 to escalate and accelerate the process of15 eliminating affordable housing.16 So right now I do not know how you17 come up with your evaluations and how do you, you18 know, what case studies you're using in your19 analysis that' s done, but I hope it's done with20 the consideration that this is considered home to21 a lot of people and effectively people don't have22 that feeling anymore.23 That's all.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 (Audience participation.)4 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Reina Santos.3 Reina Santos.4	MS. REINA SANTOS:	Hello.	Good5 evening.6 First I'd like to start off by7 saying that before this happened, this situation8 has been going on for quite awhile already.	It's9 not the first time.	The rent increase is not10 in other words, it didn't happen overnight.11 What I'm saying is the rent increase12 has been happening for quite some time now, time13 after time and now is resulting in this situation14 right here.15 I'm here to tell you that you16 Board, you the Board Members, and the politicians17 and other individuals, help make the decisions18 for tenants.	In other words, what you decide19 and what the politicians decide effect all the20 tenants right here that you see right here today.21 I want you to keep that in mind right now.22 I also want - - also want to point23 out to you that your decisions you make today and24 the people that make it for us, do effect us in25 many ways, in ways you can never even - - you5 
2	don't even know how, but it does effect us.3	I will tell you this also.	I'd also4 like to make another point to you.	The cost of5 living, I'll tell you why people don't want to6 live here anymore, the cost of living exceeds our7 income.	You know what that means, you have a8 rent that' s over 1000 and a person's salary is9	only $800 a month.	How do you expect a person10 to pay a rent so high when - -11 (Audience participation.)12 MS. REINA SANTOS:	Now, when you13 have to pay for medicine, you've got to pay rent,14 you got to pay for insurance, you know.	I know15 you people are just like us, you're up there but16 understand this, I know you have bills.	But17 these people here, I tell you right now, the18 bottom line is that' s the bottom line, the cost19 of living does exceed their income.20 This is why in other states they21 don't have this problem.	In other states people22 are living a good life, a better life because the23 money that they make balances out with their cost24 of living.25 I don't know if you understand that10 
2 but I hope and really pray you do understand that3 right now.4 Another thing I want to mention to5 you about the landlords, these landlords, they6 keep asking for money and they justify it by7 this, this and all the reasons they give you.8 Maybe it's time you make them liable, accountable9 for how they budget out their money.	Because if10 you're going to take it out of the people over11 here, the tenants, but where are the people?	I12 don't see anyone asking tenants how do you spend13 your money.	Where you put the money at.	Do you14 put it in to fix the building?	Do you put the15 money to make the repairs?	I don' t see anyone16 asking the landlords that, but yet everyone jumps17 on the tenants right away, don't they.18 Everyone has bills.	I think19 someone who was saying over here, everything20 goes up, everything goes up on us too.	We have21 things that go higher and higher every year.22 Not only are the landlords affected, we the23 tenants, are affected too.24 The bottom line is you people must25 start learning to understand, recognize the2 
2 tenants because without the tenants' money the3 landlords would have no money.4 And that' s the bottom line.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 (Audience participation.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have no more8 registered speakers.	Somebody wanted to speak?9 When you come up, sir, give us your10 name and spell it, please so we can have it for11 the record.12 Is there anybody else besides this13 gentleman?14 One other.	Okay.15 Go ahead, sir.	Give us your name16 and spell it.17 MR. DARRYL ALLEN:	My first name is18 Darrly.	And I spell it D-A double R Y-L.	The19 last name is A-L- L-E-N.20 I am currently the President of the21 Bruckner Tower Tenants Association.	I'm also a22 member of TAX which stands for the Tenant23 Association Coalition which is organized out of24 the 18th district under Councilperson Annabel25 Palma.2 
2 I, like Ed Clarke, my building has3 gone through a disillusion in Mitchell- Lama.	We4 are also facing a unique and peculiar5 circumstances increase request from our current6 owner.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Which8 Mitchell-Lama is this?9 MR. DARRYL ALLEN:	Bruckner Tower.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And what was the11 name of it?12 MR. DARRYL ALLEN:	Boulevard Tower13 1, all in the same area.14 We' re both facing a unique and15 peculiar circumstance increase.	If the unique16 and peculiar circumstance increase is granted by17 DCHR and if your increase goes through, we are18 being hit doubly and we can't afford either one.19 I'd also like to say this, is that20 the real estate industry as a whole, according to21 the 2004 Income and Expense data, the most recent22 data that's available showed net operating23 incomes increased from 37.8 percent to 3824 percent.	This gain occurred despite the Price25 Index surge of 16.98 percent that year.2 
2 This year the Price Index of 7.83 percent is half of what it was in 2004.	Owners4 have continued to benefit from a good lending5 environment despite an interest rate increase of6 .79 percent.7 Mortgage lenders have reported to8 the RGB that they had - - that they had9 experienced virtually, and I emphasize the word10 ''virtually" no non-performing loans or11 foreclosures.	Where is it justified that these12 landlords need an increase?13 Also I would like to point out being14 a Bronx Resident the median income of renters in15 the Bronx is the lowest in the City, $22,000 a16 year.	The Bronx also has the highest percentage17 of households living below the poverty line, that18 is 26.6 percent.	Renters in the Bronx as19 compared to renters in other boroughs spend the20 largest portion of their income, an average of21 twenty eight four percent on rent.	Thirty point22 six percent of rent stabilized tenants in the23 Bronx are paying over fifty percent of their24 income on rent.	This is the highest percentage25 of any borough.2 
2	I would also like to go on and state3 this, that when Governor Pataki came into office,4 there was a confidential transition memo that was5 circulated.	And it's published right here in the6 Pratt Report and that that memo stated that7 stated this, the administration' s goal must be to8	dismantle a system that does not work by adopting9 decontrol of all rent regulated apartments upon10 vacancy.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap12 up.13 MR. DARRYL ALLEN:	I'm going to14 wrap up by saying this, greed is the number one15 force that is forcing all of this.16 (Audience participation.)17 MR. DARRYL ALLEN:	Greed happens to18 be a highly-developed sense of want.	And every19 landlord that's looking for his increase, they20 have developed that want.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 (Audience participation.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you state24 your name for the record and spell it.25 THE INTERPRETER:	I think you called12 
2 her name.	Her name is Ana Lugo.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ana.	Okay.4 We'll find her.5 Go ahead.6 Ana Santos.7 A VOICE:	Lugo.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Lugo? Okay.	Oh,9	we got it.	Thank you.10	We understood that, I think.11	MS. ANA LUGO:	(Through interpreter)12 okay.	She had lived at 1770 Townsend Avenue for13 over 28 years.14 And the tenants found out that the15 landlord hasn't been paying his taxes since 1995.16 He owes over a million dollars.17 Okay.	So the tenants have been18 suffering because they want to raise the rent to19 pay the taxes, but the taxes hasn't - -  they20 haven' t been paid.21 They're suffering a lot.	Most of22 the tenants of the building are elderly people23 and they don't even have any electricity in the24 hallways.	They make complaints but nobody has25 listened to them.12 
2CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Okay.	More?3THE INTERPRETER:That's it.4CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Thank you.	Thank5you very much.6	(Audience participation.)7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Does anybody8	else wish to speak?	Yes, one more.9	State your name for the record,10	please.	Spell it too.11	MS. DAWN JONES:	Good evening.12 My name is Dawn Jones.	I'm here13 every year since 1997.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What's your first15 name?16 MS. DAWN JONES:	Dawn, D-A-W-N.17 Last name Jones, J-0-N- E-S.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jones, okay.19 MS. DAWN JONES:	I'm a rent2 0	stabilized tenant from Lenox Terrace in Harlem.21 And I'm just here to say this is the first year22 where I had to take a pension loan in order to2 3	pay my rent.	I do Fair Hearings for the City.	I24 listen to people everyday and I can barely pay my25 rent.	I just pray there' s no rent increase24 
2 because I have nowhere to go.3 It is not justified.	We get4 continuous MCis.	We have a new lobby, roof,5 elevator, just everything is just piled on us.6 And last year they just eliminated all the people7 that are secondary tenants.	And it's just8 it's getting ridiculous.9 I mean the rents - - to come into10 Lenox Terrace now, 1,900 a month.	People just11 cannot afford, regular working people cannot12 afford to be there.	I can barely buy food.	I13 have no one to help me.14 So I just ask this year that we15 really freeze the rents because I'm struggling16 and I've got to listen to people everyday that17 are struggling.	I can barely help anyone because18 I can't barely pay myself.19 Thank you.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 (Audience participation.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 The meeting is adjourned.24 We have another hearing, so25 everybody knows, on the 22nd, beginning at 102
