STATEMENT OF BASIS AND PURPOSE.The Rent Guidelines Board is
 5 authorized to promulgate rent guidelines governing6 apartment units subject to the Rent  Stabilization7 Law of 1969 , as amended, and the Emergency Tenant8 Protection Act of 1974 , as amended.9 The purpose of these guidelines is10 to implement the public policy set forth  in11 Findings and Declaration of Emergency of the  Rent12 Stabilization Law of 1969 (§ 26 - 501 of the N. Y. C.13 Administrative Code) and in the Legislative  Finding14 contained in the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 15	1974 ( L. 1974 c. 576 , § 4 [§ 2 ])16 The Rent Guidelines Board is  also17 authorized to promulgate rent guidelines for  loft18 units subject to Section 286 subdivision 7 of  the19 Multiple Dwelling Law.20 The purpose of the loft guidelines21 is to implement the public policy set forth in  the22 Legislative Findings of Article 7 - C of the Multiple23 Dwelling Law ( Section 280 ).24 Dated June 20 th, 2013 , Jonathan L.25 Kimmel, Chair, New York City Rent Guidelines  Board.16 
2 As we maintain the practice  we3 have done in the past, I will turn to the   tenants4 for a proposal.5 Mr. Epstein.6 MR. EPSTEIN:	Thank you. Chair.7 Once again, we' re here to8 determine what rent increases, if any, will be  for9 over a million rent regulated apartments.	Let' s10 figure out what we' ve learned over the past few11 months.12 Fist, tenants are struggling.	As13 borne out of the studies this year, the  current14 recession, even though we think we' re at the end of15 the recession, has hurt all stratas of New  Yorkers,16 except for property owners.17 The Income and Affordability Study18 shows that wages continue to fall. Unemployment  and19 Housing Court evictions continue to rise.	That' s20 in direct contrast to the Income and Expense  Study,21 which shows that owners' net operating  income22 continues to grow.23 In addition, Housing and Community24 Renewal told us that not one, not one  property25 owner applied for a hardship increase in 2012 .2 
2 While we acknowledge that process3 is time consuming, it allows owners to get  rent4 increases. In fact, any owner who needed  an5 increase could apply.6 Let' s just juxtapose that to tens7 of thousands of tenants who apply for one- shot8 deals, apply for Section 8 , SCRIE and DRIE.	Those9 are complicated processes as well.	But tens of10 thousands of tenants do it every year because  they11 need to.12 Let' s also remember the testimony13 of people like Anita Romm, June Mac Millan and14 dozens of other tenants who told us that  rent15 increases would be forcing them to choose  between16 paying their rent and paying basic  expenses.17 Let' s remember Fitzroy Christian,18 who said while he was retired, he can' t enjoy his19 retirement because he pays 67 percent of his  income20 towards rent.	These tenants testified that these21 proposed increases would hurt them and maybe  result22 in eviction.23 Brian and I also heard from  over24 200 tenants who, on June 5 th, came to the People' s25 Rent Guidelines Board hearing in the Bronx.	Over2 
2 50 of them testified about how the rent  increases3 might result in losing their home. These are  real4 stories of real people who are  suffering.5 We also heard from owners, like6 Roger Melzer, who told us that most large  property7 owners are doing fine and don' t need the increase.8 We heard how New York City landlords  are9 predominantly large landlords.	We heard stories of10 large, private equity companies, like Chestnut11 Holdings, who are using a variety of tactics  to12 evict their low income tenants.	And we should not13 be a part of that.14 If anything, we should look for15 carve- outs for small property owners, the little16 guy, people with less than 20 units.	We need to17 figure out a targeted solution  for them.	And I18 don' t think we have that today.19 Therefore, I say, we need a  rent20 freeze now.21 We must adopt --22 ( Audience participation.)23 MR. EPSTEIN:	-- I make -- I  make24 a motion that we adopt a zero percent increase  for25 a one- year lease;2

11 to the owner members of the board, Mr.  Schleider,12 will that be you.13 ( Audience participation.)14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you, Mr.15 Chairman.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.16 Thank you to the members of  the17 board and to those citizens attending this  meeting.18 First, I' d like to take this19 moment to remind the board members and  interested20 parties that the findings of the City Council  in21 enacting the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 and  the22 State Legislature adopting the Emergency Tenant23 Protection Act of 1974 , clearly establish that fair24 and generally affordable rents are a  primary25 objective of these laws - generally  affordable.11 
2 We all know from testimony,3 printed reports and generally available information4 that right now thousands of affordable units  are5 being built in the City with a mix of public   and6 private funding.7 ( Audience participation.)8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Various rezoning9 initiatives alone will produce more than 3 , 30010 affordable homes.	These are all good things.	More11 affordable housing is needed.12 However, Mr. Chairman, the13 affordability issue is but a single piece of  the14 puzzle we' re tasked to solve.15 Testimony from tenants and16 tenants' groups, cite the low incomes of tenants  as17 reason to cancel discussion on a rent  increase.18 The low incomes are the clarion call to the  rally19 point that rent increases are not  affordable.20 Tenant subsidies are available as SCRIE and  DRIE,21 Section 8 vouchers and supplemental  income22 enhancers from local, state and federal  programs.23 Yet, those levels of support do not seem to  be24 enough.25 No board member denies there are2 
2 tenants one paycheck away from hardship.	No board3 member denies there are tenants in desperate  need4 of assistance to merely make ends  meet.5 ( Audience participation.)6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No board member7 denies that there are tenants who simply  cannot8 afford their current rent let alone any  increase.9 And we' ve heard testimony that10 these tenants are not the poorest of the  poor11 tenants.	We' ve heard testimony that the poorest of12 the poor are in housing in last resort and  that13 will be addressed by the vote for hotel  apartments,14 not by this vote.15 No one on this board denies  that16 there are rent stabilized tenants in dire need  of17 income support.	No one on this board denies  that18 rent affordability is an issue.	This is of concern19 to the board but we are powerless to address  it.20 ( Audience participation.)21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Furthermore,22 elected officials do not want to give those  tenants23 at risk any support.	No direct tenant subsidies24 from the City.	They offer no direct rent support25 to tenants to help manage a rent  burden.2 
2 This was brought out in  testimony3 before this board last week.	Elected officials4 say, no direct rent support for the most needy  of5 tenants.	None.	That is not a solution  when6 elected officials rush to increase City  spending7 each year by billions of dollars and yet won' t  give8 a tiny fraction of one percent of increased  City9 spending to help City tenants as direct  rent10 support.11 ( Audience participation.)12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	They won' t give up13 their spending to redistribute a tiny faction  of14 City money to our tenants in dire need of  rent15 support.	The solution they say is to simply deny  a16 rent increase for all tenants instead of  providing17 direct rent assistance to the most at- risk tenants.18 They simply say, freeze rents.	No direct rent19 support to our tenants.20 This forces the landlords to21 subsidize the tenants. This shifts the22 responsibility from elected public officials to  the23 private sector.24 ( Audience participation.)25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	This is not how2 
2 this system was developed.3 Elected officials rush to say4 landlords make enough. Elected officials are5 saying, we only want you, landlords, to eek out  a6 living, if you can, providing affordable housing  to7 your tenants.8 This is not the answer.	This is9 not a solution.	This is not how to make a  fair10 determination of what rent increases are  necessary11 to continue to operate rental properties.12 That was worth repeating:	This is13 not how to make a fair determination on what  rent14 increases are necessary to continue to  operate15 rental properties.16 We had testimony from government17 agencies, management companies and numerous18 landlords of small apartment buildings, all  showing19 proof the cost of operating affordable  rent20 stabilized housing keep going up year after  year.21 ( Audience participation.)22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m going to speak23 the board' s data showing that operating costs24 increased again.	We had testimony that the25 operating cost data that board uses is wrong  on2 

2	some counts.3
We had testimony that shows the
4 operating costs are understated.5 We know that the City records  used6 by the staff do not account for almost 30 , 0007 apartment buildings containing less than 11  units.8 Those 30 , 000 small apartment buildings containing9 less than 11 units provide most of the  affordable10 rental housing.	And that expense data for 30 , 00011 small apartment buildings is not counted.12 We had testimony that those13 building are more expensive to operate and  those14 owners struggle to make ends meet.	Those landlords15 are heroes of the City.	They keep their building16 clean.	They live in those buildings --17 ( Audience participation.)18 ( Applause.)19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- they live in20 those buildings.	They care for their tenants.21 In addition, their property tax22 and water and sewer payments support police,  fire,23 education, parks, library, sanitation and  other24 City services.	This is the one industry that  both25 City and State can always count on even in  bad4 

2	economic times.34
( Audience participation.)MR. SCHLEIDER:	These are the vast
5 majority of the landlords.	This large number of6 landlords who own these 30 , 000 small buildings,7 about 40 percent of the rent regulated  housing8 stock is in small apartment buildings of less  than9 11 units and they struggle to keep their  property10 from deteriorating.11 These are the gatekeepers of  the12 existing affordable housing stock. These13 gatekeepers are the private citizens that the  City14 has forced to shoulder a public cost with high  real15 estate taxes, water and sewer charges and dozens  of16 administrative fees and a constant stream  of17 unfunded public policy mandates without18 commensurate rent increases.19 ( Audience participation.)20 MR. SCHLEIDER: I' m not going to21 use my time to speak to the numerous  indications22 that operating expenses are continuing to  escalate23 higher.24 I' m not going to speak to the fact25 that the number of distressed properties is  still5 
2 problematic, clearly low interest rates and  prior3 rent increases have not been sufficient to  lessen4 the burden.5 ( Audience participation.)6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No one on this7 board denies not all landlords are in need of  a8 large increase.9 No one on this board denies  there10 are landlords in such dire economic condition  that11 a mere rent increase will not help their  plight.12 I will speak loudly that the  vast13 majority of landlords need and count on the  rent14 increases passed by this board.15 I will speak and I will  speak16 loudly that the vast majority of landlords rely  on17 the rent increases passed by the board to  maintain18 their rental properties for the good of  their19 communities.20 I will speak about how you make  it21 work so it' s equitable and generally affordable.22 ( Applause.)23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Four out of five24 tenants can afford to share the burden.	I will25 speak that four out of five tenants can pay  their2 

2	fair share.345
( Audience participation.) ( Applause.)MR. SCHLEIDER:	I will speak that
6 the board' s data doesn' t show the real increase in7 building operating costs.8 I will speak that the board' s data9 understates major cost increases in real  estate10 taxes and it doesn' t even consider many important11 cost or cost increases.12 ( Audience participation.)13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I will speak again14 that the landlord' s position is worse off than the15 data shows.16 ( Audience participation.)17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Now, Mr. Chair, as18 such, the Owner members move for the greater of  a19 6 . 25 percent or $ 62 . 50 per month increase on a20 one- year renewal lease and the greater of a21 nine- and- a- half percent or $ 95 per month increase22 on a two- year renewal lease.23 Same for lofts.24 ( Applause.)25 ( Audience participation.)6

10 proposal where we think it' s fair.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	Thank12 you, Mr. Schleider.13 ( Applause.)14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I will now15 offer up a proposal.16 Before that I have a  brief17 statement to make.18 In advance of offering a  motion19 with respect to this year' s apartment guidelines,20 I' d like to make a brief statement.21 The Rent Guidelines Board sets22 annual renewal lease adjustments for nearly  one23 million rent stabilized apartment, loft and  hotel24 units in New York City.	This is a difficult task25 that impacts a very diverse group of  households10 
2 scattered throughout the City, in buildings  that3 range in size from six units to several  hundred.4 Because the annual decisions made5 by this board affect such a large segment of  the6 City' s rental housing, there will always be tenants7 and owners who feel as though this board has  failed8 them.	And, in truth, we cannot compensate  owners9 for every expense and we cannot  guarantee10 affordability for every tenant.11 ( Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Therefore, our13 decision this evening is not one that I  take14 lightly.15 With this in mind, I' d like to16 thank the members of this board for  their17 commitment to the task at hand and to commend  them18 for all their hard work.19 I' d also like to thank the RGB20 staff for the data provided to this board, which  is21 an integral component to our decision  making22 process.23 ( Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	In addition to25 the staff research, we rely on relevant  testimony2 
2 and data from housing professionals, tenant  and3 owner advocates and government agencies.	And the4 process would not be complete without  the5 meaningful and poignant testimony we heard at  our6 public hearing.7 ( Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I thank all9 those who took the time to participate in  the10 process and encourage your participation in  the11 future.12 Over my tenure as a member of  this13 board, the issues that are made abundantly clear  to14 me year after year, are the struggles of  the15 marginal owner and the poor tenant.	I recognize16 their concerns and wish that this board could  make17 every owner whole and provide an affordable  place18 to live for every New Yorker. But we can' t.19 ( Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Our decision is21 a blunt instrument and cannot be used to  solve22 these issues, issues that need more  precise23 solutions.24 At our public hearing, we  heard25 from several State, City and State  elected2 
2 officials, in person or through  their3 representatives, urging this board to keep  rents4 affordable.5 However, real solutions lie with6 the Legislature.	They have the power to fix  these7 problems.8 ( Applause.)9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	But instead,10 they place the fault at our  feet.11 ( Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	As I have done13 numerous times in the past, I urge, yet again,  that14 government provide more rent subsidies for  those15 tenants in need.16 I also urge the City to  consider17 reducing the cost to owners for doing business  in18 New York City.19 ( Applause.)20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Steady increases21 in real estate taxes and water and sewer  charges,22 as well as new costs associated with  regulatory23 legislation that directly impacts owners' wallets,24 have helped to place an enormous burden on  small25 owners to keep their buildings afloat.2 
 2 ( Applause.)3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Reducing these4 costs will benefit not only owners but tenants  as5 well, in that any potential increases in their  rent6 will be less onerous.7 It is my sincere hope that8 progress is made on both these fronts in the  coming9 year.10 Regardless of the languishing11 issues, this board still is mandated to  promulgate12 lease adjustments for one and two- year renewal13 leases for the coming guidelines period.14 The Rent Guidelines Board, in15 particular, the public members, try to balance  the16 escalating costs of running these buildings  with17 the tenants' ability to pay their  rents.18 Data from both the Income and19 Expense Study and the Price Index of  Operating20 Costs, reveals that owners' costs have,  indeed,21 increased since the board last set adjustments in 22	2012 .23 ( Applause.)24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yet tenants'25 ability to afford their apartments, continues to  be23 
2 an issue, one that is exacerbated by the  slow3 recovery from the recent economic recession.4 ( Audience participation.)5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: The RGB' s Income6 and Affordability Study reports that  unemployment7 remains high, wages are stagnant, and a third  of8 rental households pay 50 percent or more of  their9 income in gross rent.10 ( Audience participation.)11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	However, in New12 York City, employment levels are on the rise  for13 the third straight year and the City' s economy has14 continued to grow.15 After considering the commensurate16 rent adjustments calculated by the RGB staff  and17 balancing these calculations with relevant data18 regarding housing affordability, owner income and19 the ever- changing housing supply, as well as20 listening to testimony of advocates on both  sides,21 I now propose the following rental  adjustments:22 ( Audience participation.)23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I move to adopt24 the language of Apartment and Loft Order 45 as  read25 into the record at this  meeting.2 
2 And I further move to adopt  the3 Explanatory Statement and Findings for Order  No.4 45 , substantially in the form submitted by staff to5 the board as of June 20 th, 2013 , and to be modified6 by the RGB staff after this meeting to reflect  the7 adopted rental adjustments, as well as to  include8 the memos which are in the members' folders  at9 tonight' s meeting.10 And, finally, I move to adopt  the11 following rental adjustments for rent  stabilized12 apartments and lofts:13 Apartments.	One- year renewal14 lease, 4 percent.15 ( Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Two- year17 renewal lease, 7 . 75 percent.18 ( Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Sublet20 allowance, 10 percent.21 ( Audience participation.)22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: No vacancy23 allowance permitted except as provided under24 Sections 19 and 20 of the Rent Regulation  Reform25 Act of 1997 .2 
2 Lofts.	One- year increase period,3 4 percent.	Two- year increase period, 7 . 75 percent.4 Vacant loft units, no vacancy5 allowances permitted under this Order.	Therefore,6 except as otherwise provided in Section 286 ,7 subdivision 6 of the Multiple Dwelling Law,  the8 rent charged to any tenant for a vacancy --  for9 vacancy tenancy, commencing on or after October 1 ,10 2013 and on or before September 30 th, 2014 , may not11 exceed the base rent referenced above, plus  the12 level of adjustment permitted for increased13 periods.14 Special guidelines.	30 percent15 above the maximum base rent or the fair market  rent16 for existing housing as established by the  United17 States Department of Housing and Urban  Development18 ( HUD), for the New York City primary metropolitan19 statistical area, pursuant to Section 8 C 1 of the20 United States Housing Act of 1937 , 42 US. C Section21 1437 ( f) subsection C, subsection 1 and 24 CFR part22 888 , with such fair market rents to be adjusted23 based upon whether the tenant pays his or her  own24 gas and/ or electric charges as part of his or  her25 rent, as such gas and/ or electric charges are2 
2 accrued -- are accounted for by the New York  City3 Housing Authority.4 Such HUD determined, fair- market5 rents will be published in the Federal Register  to6 take effect on October 1 , 2013 .7 To summarize in accordance with my8 motion, you are voting on the adjustments I  have9 just proposed and the language of this  Order.10 ( Audience participation.)11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is there a12 second?13 MS. SHINE:	Second.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Shine15 seconds.16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes, Mr.18 Schleider.19 MR.

SCHLEIDER:	In addition, I' d24 like to have the one- year -- if I accept your  425 percent, I' d like the minimum of $ 40 on the one2 
2 year.	On the two year, in addition to your 7 . 753 percent increase, I' d like to have a minimum rent4 of $ 77 . 50 per month.5 ( Applause.)6 ( Audience participation.)7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.8 Schleider.9 I, however, do not accept  it.10 ( Audience participation.)11 MR.

2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: To Mr. Schleider,3 I did not accept it.4 MR. CHEIGH:	Okay.5 ( Audience participation.)6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Epstein.7 MR. EPSTEIN:	I really want to8 speak to my fellow board members here.	Because I9 feel like I want to be clear what we' ve heard and  I10 want to be clear what we  see.11 A 4 percent and a 7 . 75 percent12 increase in one and two- year leases is well beyond13 most rent stabilized tenants' ability.14 ( Audience participation.)15 MR. EPSTEIN:	I want to be clear,16 based on the information we' ve seen and based on17 what you said, Chair, that tenants are  struggling.18 I mean, unemployment is still19 about 9 percent.	People are struggling out there20 in these rent stabilized units.	They' re making 36 ,21 $ 37 , 000 a year.	So are we going -- if we' re going22 to have increases like this, we' re going to23 acknowledge that it' s our job to help evict low24 income tenants.25 ( Audience participation.)2 
2 MR. EPSTEIN:	And I want to be3 clear that if you -- if we vote for this, which  I' m4 not going to, that we' re saying to the community,5 that even though the taxes only went up 2   percent,6 2 . 6 percent and water and sewer went up, that7 owners should be entitled to a larger  increase.8 And we' re going to say to the9 community out there, that even though  tenants,10 hundreds of tenants came and testified that  their11 voices can' t be heard.	So I would implore the12 people here, I implore the public members here  to13 think about voting no on this  resolution.14 Rents are way too high already.15 This is just going to make  it unaffordable.	Please16 vote no.17 ( Audience participation.)18 ( Applause.)19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.20 Epstein.21 No further comment.

We have never22 heard testimonies at our -- invited  testimonies23 from the SRO owners and we have all agreed  last24 year for a zero percent and I hope we can   continue25 that this year again.4

CRUZ:	But I' d like -- I' d21 like to have the board  --22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And now Ms.23 Cruz.24 MS. CRUZ:	-- consider my motion,25 please.2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.3 MS. CRUZ:	And the reason I --  I4 think it' s important is that I feel very strongly5 that we abrogate our responsibility when we  have6 evidence before us which indicates that the  hotel7 price index this year has significantly  increased8 by 7 . 4 percent, based in part, on the real estate9 taxes and utility costs rising at a much  greater10 rate for stabilized hotel buildings than they  did11 for apartment buildings.12 I also note that for the past  ten13 years there has only been three times  when14 increases have been enacted for this type  of15 housing.	And yet we hear many, many SRO  tenants16 come and talk about how the -- the apartments  --17 the buildings in these types of -- of the --   the18 vacancies in these types of buildings  are19 increasing.	Owners are allegedly keeping20 apartments off the market.	The conditions in these21 apartments are not being maintained.	There' s22 absolutely no incentive for owners to  maintain23 these types of properties.24 And by our vote, I submit to  the25 board, we are acting in having this type of  housing2 
2 eventually disappear from the New York  City3 landscape.4 And for that reason, I propose a  35 percent increase for Residential Class A  hotels,6 lodging houses, rooming houses, Class B hotels  and7 SRO buildings.8 In addition, I propose a  109 percent vacancy allowance provided that the10 dwelling unit in such stabilized hotel building  has11 been voluntarily vacated, such that there should  be12 a vacancy lease at a minimum of a 10   percent13 increase over the prior lawful  rent.14 And, lastly, I do not include  a15 proviso in my motion.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Ms.17 Cruz.18 Is there a second?19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Second.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider21 seconds.22 Mr. Cheigh.23 ( Audience participation.)24 MR. CHEIGH:	Mr. Chairman -- Mr.25 Chairman, I -- I appreciate Magda' s statement for2 
2 speaking on behalf of SRO and hotel owners who  seem3 to never show up to make their  case.4 We understand that maybe their5 expenses are increasing.	We understand that they6 are not filling their units and keeping  them7 vacant.	But we know that there are a  substantial8 number of non- profit SRO operators who operate9 their buildings properly in accordance with  the10 law.11 We know that there are increases12 being taken by SRO and hotel owners.	We' ve seen13 the data.	They are taking increases where we  voted14 for zero percent increases in years  past.15 We know that people -- the  median16 rents that people are paying according to the  data17 that the RGB has, the rents are $ 1 , 000 or more for18 rooms where people have shared facilities.19 And, lastly, to propose a  vacancy20 increase in situations where we have tenants  who21 are under threat, under extreme pressure to  vacate22 their units with these SRO operators whose  vast23 interest is to fill them with tourists where  they24 can make substantial amounts of money, not  in25 compliance with the law, puts more pressure on  a2 
2 very vulnerable population who can little afford  to3 secure legal assistance or advocacy for  their4 situation.5 These are very low income  tenants,6 some who are our most vulnerable populations and  we7 have an industry that seems to flaunt the SRO  laws8 for extreme profit and through unscrupulous  methods9 of warehousing so that they could cash out as  soon10 as they can.11 Therefore, I do appreciate that12 Magda is providing the reality that there  are13 increases to expenses but the other side of  the14 coin is that, this -- this is an industry  that15 should not get an increase this year.	And until we16 hear otherwise from the industry, until we  hear17 that they will actually show themselves at  our18 invited hearings, this board should not  consider19any increasesforSROs.20Thank you.21CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Any other22comment?23( Applause.)24CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Epstein.25MR. EPSTEIN:	Just quickly.	I
2 just want to support what Brian  says.3 What we heard was SRO  tenants4 talking about where they live.	They' re talking5 about what they struggle -- an increase is  not6 going to improve their living conditions  or7 landlords are not going to make repairs now  that8 they get a 1 , 2 or 3 percent  increase.9 The reality is, they' re making10 money off the hotel rooms.	The SRO tenants are the11 ones they' re trying to evict.12 I urge the board to vote  against13 any increases here.	It' s clearly not going to help14 the landlords who never show up.	And we know it is15 -- it' s going to hurt the SRO tenants.16 Thank you.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.18 Epstein.19 Call for a vote, if there is  no20 further discussion.21 Any further discussion?22 Mr. Schleider.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I -- I just  find24 the rhetoric that because a particular class  of25 property owner does not avail themselves of  the2 
2 meetings that they are erased from  consideration.3 We have many instances in this4 country where -- where voters are -- are --  are5 blocked from exercising their right.	I don' t want6 to equate you with blocking anybody' s right to --7 to a fair process here just because they choose  not8 to show up or don' t show up because they' re too9 busy managing their properties.	All right.10 Because we have a small cadre  of11 these owners, because you don' t see enough of them12 or a representative sample to your liking, to --  to13 just merely dismiss the whole project and the  whole14 asset class as -- as -- as not worth your time   to15 consider their -- their operating expense  profile16 and what they are doing for those good  landlords17 that are providing housing of last resort, I  just18 thought you' d be better than that.19 It' s -- it' s -- I wish you would20 stop that rhetoric.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.22 Schleider.23 Call for a vote on Ms. Cruz' s24 proposal.25 Mr. Cheigh.2
