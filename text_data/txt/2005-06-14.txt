TYRONE ANTHONY:	My name is5 Tyrone Anthony and I'm a tenant chairman at   3006 West 46th Street in Lower  Manhattan.7 There' s one problem that it8 seems that - -9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	300 West?10 MR. TYRONE ANTHONY:	300 West11 46th Street.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	In Lower13 Manhattan?14 MR. TYRONE ANTHONY:	Yeah.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What 's your16 definition of Lower?17 MR. TYRONE ANTHONY:	Well , I18 would just say down in the Chelsea  area.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. That 's20 not quite Lower.21 MR. TYRONE ANTHONY:	Okay.22 But the problem here is that  we23 tenants have a problem with the landlords  who24 constantly,  who  can get  - -  in other words, can25 harass tenants, not make repairs. These   areROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2112 landlords that seem to, can get away with  all3 kind of harassment with  tenants.4	Tenants file to the State. I  had5 to take this landlord to the Human  Rights6 Division for discrimination, which  I won.7 Now there' s something wrong when8 these owners can continue to get their  increases.9 And you have people here, including  myself ,10 that 's been telling you they are not making11 repairs, reduction of service,  discrimination,12 constantly taking them to court. Even if they   try13 to organize a tenants' association, the  owner14 constantly tries to destroy the  tenants'15 association.16 These are all violations.  They17 are supposed to be violations.18 So what this Board Member  should19 take back to Bloomberg, that there are  serious20 problems with owners who are not following   the21 laws and constantly doing the same thing over   and22 over and over again.23 Another thing that I want  to24 point out. Okay? This Board might not have   the25 power to do everything, but we, as human beings   -ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2122 - you got to remember, we are all under  the3 principle of God, we are all human beings   under4 God.5	So when you find owners that are6 not doing the right thing, then this  problem7 should be  brought  to the Bloomberg	- - I mean8 Mayor Bloomberg' s Administration or his9 what ever the City Hall has. It should be  brought10 to him and this owner should be penalized or   this11 owner should be brought up on some charges or12 certain owners - - I'm not saying all owners,  but13 these owners are just running amuck on these14 tenants.15 We cannot afford some of  these16 increases. Every other year the owner decides to17 do an improvement to get an increase which he   has18 done no services.19 I mean you ought to go and  check20 these letters that have been sent to the   Division21 of Housing, to our Councilmen, to our22 Assemblymen.  They need to investigate and  find23 out that these letters are being sent ; that  they24 don' t want  - - when a tenant  calls, don' t pick up25 the phone. They do not pick up the phone, do   notROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2132 hear from the tenants. The only time they  hear3 from the tenants is when they want us to  vote.4 We' re supposed to be democratic.5 If this is a democratic society and it 's true6 democratic, then how come you don' t hear from7 these tenants who vote?8	Me myself , I 'm a registered9 voter. I'm a belief , true Democrat. But how  long10 can I be a Democrat when you're not hearing   from11 the tenants?12 Go and investigate these  letters13 that have been sent. And they are good  letters.14 And I done talk to everybody,  my15 Congressman.  I done talk to everybody about these16 certain landlords.17 I have human rights cases  that18 I 've just had a settlement with.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 MR. TYRONE ANTHONY:	Thank you.21 (Audience participation. )22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me read23 the names and see if people are still  here.24 Mr. Rader, Matthew Rader?  Are25 you here? Right. He' s here. All right. We  skippedROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167

Are you here,  Mr.11 Preston?12 (No response.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We'll call you14 again.15 Peter Koehler?16 MR. PETER KOEHLER:	Here.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.18 We' re going to move on here.19 Go ahead, Mr. Rader.20 MR. MATTHEW RADER:	Yes. Thank21 you.22 My name is Matthew Rader and  I23 am lucky enough to have a rent  stabilized24 apartment and a landlord who waits patiently   for25 me or the rent regulation laws to pass,   whicheverROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2152 comes first.3 Actually, the law that  created4 this Board is a scam to begin with. It  guarantees5 yearly increases for  landlords.6 How many working people get  that7 same guarantee?8 (Audience participation.)9	MR. MATTHEW RADER:	What year10 do you anticipate it will be when you  guys11 actually vote for a decrease?12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. MATTHEW RADER:	I believe14 there is a clause in the State Constitution  that15 requires all citizens to be housed. Is the  spirit16 of that law in compliance? I think  not.17 I also don't see anyone looking18 to sell. They never stop building, buying  and19 renovating. The equity alone renders rent  an20 irrelevant pittance. It 's just a crime of21 opportunity. If we can get more, why  not?22 Furthermore, and of deep  concern23 to me, what is the government plan for  affordable24 housing? What is the plan for poor people?  Where25 do they intend to put us?ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2162 What happened to so- called3 accounting transparency?4 Does the Constitution  include5 the right to be rich and to exploit anyone   you6 can?7	The City government is run8 primarily by the real estate industry. I kind   of9 feel bad for these small landlords who  think10 their one building gives them admittance to   the11 club.12 But nobody forced them to  buy13 and these laws have been in effect since  before14 they bought. So they say ignorance is no  excuse15 for the law.16 It is a white male boys club  and17 they all know each other on a first name  basis.18 If Donald and Michael are your idols, you are   in19 the right place.20 This audience is great.  But21 let 's face it. Our passive, unconcerned, non-22 voting neighbors have allowed all of this   and23 seven million of us could stop it cold  this24 November.25 Why haven' t we?ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2172 Nobody woke up one day  and3 passed these laws. Greed and constant  abuse4 created all this.5 Thank you.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,7 Mr. Rader.8 (Audience participation.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Again, I'm10 going to read some names.11 Enoch Yisrail? Yes, you are12 here. Come on down.13 Harry Preston? Yes?14 Okay. Peter Koehler, you're15 here.16 Followed by Edrie Cote.  Okay.17 Go ahead.18 MR. ENOCH YISRAIL:	Good19 evening to the Board.20 I have a message directed  to21 your appointer, Mayor Bloomberg.22 I'm very disgusted with  the23 outcome of the housing situation in New York. And24 I have experienced  some very bad discrepancies25 within the confines of the agency of   housing.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2182 As you know, just three years3 ago, I had lost out in housing. I was supposed   to4 have received an apartment inside of New York.   I5 had to go through a lot of trouble and a lot   of6 hardship with the professionals who were  very7 passive, they were very neglectful of the   case,8 and they were not doing what they were   supposed9 to do.10 And I was going through a lot  of11 runarounds within the confines of  housing.12 I had a voucher that I was13 holding for about a year and  two months.	I lost14 out there, and then I had to go and get  a15 transfer to Boston. And when I got a transfer   to16 Boston, I pretty much went through the   same17 drama.18 And, you know, this country is19 supposed to be about democracy. From what I   can20 see with the housing situation and the  cutbacks21 with housing, I think it is a  disgrace.22 That we talk about democracy  -23 right? - which is supposed to be about the   rule24 and governance of people, but yet you have   a25 president , you have a mayor, who doesn' t evenROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	219  2 have a conscience or has any type of logic  and3 who press buttons and make all kinds  of4 unnecessary policies that will affect the  very5 civilians that are under their  means.6 I think it 's a disgrace that7 this mayor here is annihilat ing housing. I  think8 he should be spending more time worrying  about9 the citizens here in this City, and the  President10 should be more concerned about the citizens   in11 this country than something that has nothing   to12 do with housing and the pursuit of happiness   and13 liberty and life that it says on  the14 Constitution.15 I'm speaking from the16 Const itution because all of the Constitution,  it17 was made and it was written to be   substantiated18 by the government to  follow.19 From what I can see right now,  I20 see a contradict ion inside of the government.21 Okay? I see nothing more than criminals  and22 crooks who take advantage and use money,  use23 money for nonsense. But when it comes to doing -  2425	(Audience participation.)ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2202 MR. ENOCH YISRAIL:	- - when it3 comes to doing  for citizens  - all right?  -  when4 it comes to doing for ones like me - -5	I'm poor. I'm a poor black  man.6	I live in Bedford Stuyvesant. Okay? Bedford7	Stuyvesant is one of the neighborhoods that's8 being gentrified. Okay? I see predators.  I  see9 predation, gentrification, rent stabilization10 taking place in Bed Stuy. I live there.  Okay?11	So I'm saying in effect that I'm12 appalled with the situation and I vow not to   see13 that the rent , that they raise rents.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 MR. ENOCH YISRAIL:	You're16 welcome.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Peter19	Koehler.20 Following Mr. Koehler,  Edrie21 Cote.22 And then Lamonte Poe?

1	2212 Okay. Let' s go. Thanks.3 MR. PETER KOEHLER:	Good4 evening, Commissioner and Board  Members.5 I'm hungry and I want to get  out6 of here and I'm sure you too want to get out   of7 here.8 I'm a little ill-prepared to9 speak to you because I just registered upon  my10 arrival. So please excuse the stuttering  and11 whathaveyou.12 Approximately  five years ago I13 suffered a divorce decree against me. It   forced14 me to go from a furnished room to room to room   to15 room.16 Last year I became homeless  due17 to an alcoholic burning down the building that   I18 was living in. I spent 127 days on the  street.19 I am now in a private  shelter20 after spending that time on the street. I've21 suffered four heart attacks since my  divorce.22 I have various  health  - - you23 name it , it 's high, cholesterol , blood  pressure,24 it 's all there. I'm a cancer survivor. I  survived25 rectum- colon cancer.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2222 The bottomline  is this. I'm3 going to be on pension soon. I'm going to be   out4 of the shelter on my own  power.5 But my pension is only going  to6 be $800 a month. I served my City for  twenty-7 five years in civil service. This is all  I'm8 getting after twenty- five years.9 The bottomline  is all this. My10 pension is not going to go up. The rents are11 going to continue to go up.12 Earlier in my life I was  a13 groupie, that' s following a rock band from  city14 to city to city. Well, I feel like I'm a  RGB15 groupie. I don' t want to follow your tour16 anymore.17 A couple of weeks ago  the18 Chairman was wearing the same shirt at   Cooper19 Union. Now, if my poor memory can remember  that ,20I'm gettingtooclose to you guys.21(Laughter.)22MR.

I6 stand corrected.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It just looks8 the same.9 (Audience participation. )10 MR. PETER KOEHLER:	Okay.11 But , you know, if you keep12 raising the rents, I'm going to be on the streets13 again. After serving twenty- five years in City14 service, this isn't  fair.15 My great grandfather  rented16 apartments in the City of New York. We've always17been in theCity ofNew York.My whole family has18been in theCity ofNew York.We've always rented19apartments.I'm thefirst onein my family to20have lived on the streets.21I can't even be in touch with  my22family withmykids because  I'm homeless in a23shelter.24CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25MR.

PETER KOEHLER:	Get me off8 the tour.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 MR. PETER KOEHLER:	Have a good12 day. Thank you for your time.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Cote. Ms.14 I'm sorry.15 MS. EDRIE COTE:	Good evening.16 As President of the  London17 Terrace Tenants Association,	I represent tenants18 living in the one thousand apartments at   London19 Terrace Gardens in West Chelsea, Manhattan.20 London Terrace Gardens has a mix21 of rent stabilized, rent controlled and the   ever-22 increasing number of decontrolled  apartments.23 Virtually all apartments in the complex that   have24 been vacated in recent years have been25 decontrolled,  and the landlord is vigorouslyROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2252 pursuing  decontrol of occupied apartments  when3 the rent reaches $2000 a  month.4 I have lived in Chelsea for  over5 thirty years and as long as I remember  Chelsea6 has been  a mixed - income neighborhood , something7 that was very attractive to  me.8 In recent years many residents9 have been dealt blows to their earnings   either10 through layoffs, givebacks or lack of raises,   not11 to mention seniors on fixed incomes. Tenants find12 it increasingly difficult to afford to stay   in13 their homes, and the availability of  alternative14 housing, alternative affordable housing, in our15 community is scarce if not non- existent.16 The result is the  rapid17 disappearance of housing options in West   Chelsea18 for all but the affluent.19 Meanwhile,  the Rent Guidelines20 Board has authorized exorbitant increases for21 rent stabilized apartments in the last two   years.22 This windfall has enabled the owners of   London23 Terrace Gardens to embark on a project to spruce24 up the common hallways with niceties such as25 crown moldings, chair rails and wallpaper, whichROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2262 is certainly no sign of hardship on their  part.3 I urge you to stop driving4 tenants out of our homes, out of our  community,5 by authorizing zero percent  increases for  rent6 stabilized apartments this year.7 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.9 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you, Ms.10 Cote.11 At London Terrace Gardens  what12 percentage	- -  as the President , what percentage13 of the apartments actually have  been14 decontrolled?15 MS. EDRIE COTE:	I have no16 access to that  information.17 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.18 MS. EDRIE COTE:	But it 's19 signif icant. And, as I say, virtually every20apartment thatis vacated  becomes decontrolled.21MS. HOLDER:	Okay. Thank you.22CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Just - - why23did you chooseto come here as opposed to in24Manhattan?25MS. EDRIE COTE:	Because I'm aROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2272 working person and I could get here in  the3 evening.4 And  I appreciate the opportunity5 to come.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 Okay.8 (Audience participation.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Lamonte Poe10	I'll call again. I don't think he's  here.11	Richard Watts. Mr. Watts?12 Paulette Crowe? Paulette,  are13 you here?14 (No response.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' ll call it16 again.17 Gilda Jacobs? Are you here?18 (No response.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' ll call it20 again.21 Hold on a second.22 Walter McQueen? Yes.  Okay.23 Mr. Watts.24 MR.

1	2282 My name is Mr. Richard  Watts.3 I'm currently a tenant at 200 Colzine,  Fairfield4 Towers in Brooklyn.5 And I'm down here on my  behalf6 really as well as for some of my tenants.  We've7 been having terrible situations with  the8 elevators. The elevators are never  working.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Isn't10	Fairfield a Mitchell - Lama?11	MR. RICHARD WATTS:	No, not to12 my knowledge.13 Some of the apartments are  rent14 stabilized. I think they' re supposed to be  trying15 to go condominium or they went condominium.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.17 MR. RICHARD WATTS:	The18 elevators are constantly out . We have a lot of19 elders in the building who have to keep  their20 appointments  for their dialysis. They can't get21 up and down. They're stuck. People go  shopping,22 they can't get up because of the floors that  they23 live on.24 The other thing is during  the25 winter months the heating  is horrendous.  TheROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2292 apartments are pretty much always cold.  We' re3 having problems with the leaking  situations,4 ruining carpets and everything  like that.5 And nothing is ever done.  Yet6 still they're constantly adding  - -  in fact , we7 just received a circular that went around to   the8 tenants in the apartments, that now they  are9 going to do these repairs with this MCI   thing.10 Increases are going to be going  up.11 Once upon a time we didn't  have12 to pay light and gas. Now they implemented   the13 electricity that we have to pay  now.14 So everything  is like15 skyrocketing and basically, you know, the16 increases and our pay is  not.17 So I'm just here on behalf of ,18 like I said, myself and some of my tenants   who19 are elders to speak on their behalf , to  please20 vote down this increase. I would  greatly21 appreciate that.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.25 Sure.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167

RICHARD WATTS:	East New20 York section of Brooklyn.  I'm sorry.21 MS. HOLDER:	And has your22 landlord taken advantage of the increases  that23werevoted by the Rent Guidelines Board in  the24lasttwo years?25MR. RICHARD WATTS:	Yes, theyROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2312	have.3	MS. HOLDER:	Okay.4 And  so - - and you're telling  us5 that you have conditions in both buildings?6 MR. RICHARD WATTS:	Absolutely.7 MS. HOLDER:	Okay. 8 And now you've been told  that 9 there is going to be an MCI increase. For what 1011 MR. RICHARD WATTS:	Well , we12 actually haven' t been told , but they are doing,13 performing  these services on the grounds. And  I'm14 sure that they are going to be increased  because15 that is how they usually do  it.16 MS. HOLDER:	And when did the17 buildings go to a metered system for  your18 ut ilit ies?19 MR. RICHARD WATTS:	It 's been20 about maybe two years  now.21 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you very much22 for coming to testify  today.23 MR.

HOLDER:	When you say14 " some," are you saying that the remaining15 apartments  are rent controlled?16 MR.

WALTER McQUEEN:	Good6evening.7 I am here representing the  558 East 21st Street  Tenants Association.	I'm also9 the East 21st Street from Church Avenue  to10 Woodruff Avenue,  I'm also the Block Association11 President.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That 's in13 Brooklyn?14 MR. WALTER McQUEEN:	That 's in15 Brooklyn.16 MS. HOLDER:	Which neighborhood17 in Brooklyn?18 MR. WALTER McQUEEN:	The19 Flatbush section of Brooklyn.20 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.21 MR. WALTER McQUEEN:	I came22 here tonight to speak to you about balance,   you23 know. Free enterprise is the backbone of  this24 nation. So I'm not saying everybody is  not25 entitled to have a fair  profit.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2352 But the ridiculous nature of  the3 fact that some landlords  are benefitting	from,4 quote, from breaking the rules is  just5 ridiculous.6 I'm going to show you  something.7 This is a printout  from HPD which represents just8 my building. This is over a hundred pages of   six9 hundred violations from HPD in my  building.10 In January of 2004 The Daily11 News printed a list of the top ten slumlords   in12 New York City. My landlord was number nine.  Okay?13 I recently went through a14 horrendous  last summer of having a personal  fight15 with my landlord, back and forth to court , which16 he called me into court about seven times in   an17 effort to put me out of the building  for18 organizing the tenants to reverse the  situation19 in my building.20 Well , he lost and I won and my21 building  is slowly - -22 (Audience participation.)23 MR. WALTER McQUEEN:	- - slowly24 beginning to turn into a type of building that   I25 don't have to hold my head down anymore when  IROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2362 walk in my building.3 You know, at one particular4 point	- -  I have  a grown daughter who had to come5 in from New Jersey to stay with me. And I was   so6 embarrassed that I didn't even want her to   come.7 You know what I'm  saying?8	So what we are talking about is9	just balance. You know what I'm  saying?10 Free enterprise is the  backbone11 of this nation and everybody is entitled to   a12 fair increase if it's merit ed. But here' s a13 situation where, I'm a City employee. I  haven' t14 had a raise in three years. Everything around   me15 is going up including my  rent.16 I just signed a two-year  lease17 which  - - my  lease has  increased my  rent starting18 January - - July 1st to $45 a month. You know  what19 I'm saying? It 's just ridiculous because this  guy20 is a crook. I so much called him a crook in   a21 court of law. Thanks to Larry Jason and  the22 Brooklyn Family Services we were able to  pull23 this guy into court and reverse some of  the24 situations in my building.25 But I speak on behalf of some  ofROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2372 the elders in my building who are stuck in  a3 situation on a fixed income and can't fight  this4 fight by themselves.5 So I ask you to, please -  you6 know what I'm saying? - think about those  people.7 Thank you.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Dauogbeu11 Toyali.12 MR. DAUOGBEU TOYALI:	I say13 good evening.14 My name is Dauogbeu Toyali. I  am15 a rent stabilized SRO tenant and I am living  at16 564 West 16lst Street since  1999.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	In what18 borough?19 MR. DAUOGBEU TOYALI:20 Manhattan.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Manhattan.22 Okay.23 MR. DAUOGBEU TOYALI:	My24 building was part of the 203 K scandal a  few25 years ago. Since then, things have not  gottenROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2382 better.3 The 564 West  161st Street owner4 is not taking care of our building like  he5 should. We do not get the service we  deserve.6 Here are just a few  examples.7 The facility has not  been8 painted  since 1999. The windows need to be9 repaired. No longer exterminator service in the10 premise. The building roof is very damaged.   It11 leaks. The rain water drops inside the top12 apartments. Some water run into the walls. So13 ceiling and walls are cracking  down.14 The heat system is not  working.15 We suffered through another winter without   heat16 and hot water.17 Nowadays we have to deal with18 speculators who often come into our home without19 lett ing us know in advance. Et cetera, et  cetera.20 We should not get a  rent21 increase when we do not have the basic   service22 that we deserve.23 Therefore, the only fair24 decision would be for you, to repeat the   zero25 percent increase from last year.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167

ANGUS KIRKLAND:	How' s5	everybody doing?6	My name is Angus Kirkland  from7 Brownsville, Brooklyn, apartment resident.8 Really what I've come up to  say9 is this increase will cause more homelessness   in10 our neighborhoods really.11 And the City of New York  is12 trying to prevent homelessness.	So we feel you13 all should definitely say no to a rent   increase.14 You know, as long as we got  a15 place to stay, whether it 's bad or whatever,  if16 we could stay there, we can make it better   with17 the work of our people around  us.18 But what you are all trying  to19 do is force us out of our community and it 's  not20 right. And I've been in Brownsville too long   to21 be ready to move out. And I'm speaking   for22 everybody in Brooklyn, Crown Heights, wherever,23 who love where they live. And I live there   and24 I'm not ready to move.25 So zero would be better for  meROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2412	and my friends.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 MR. ANGUS KIRKLAND:	All right?5	God bless, everybody.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 (Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Again, Sharon9	Smith? I don' t think she's here.10 Sylvia Kaplan.11 And Adriana Martinez,  not here;12 right?13 Sylvia Kaplan, and then  we'll14 take whoever else in the audience wants to speak.15 MS. SYLVIA KAPLAN:	Thank you16 for giving me the opportunity to  speak.17 I've been listening to many  of18 the speakers, the tenants, most of them, and   some19 of the landlords. And I have a question. I  don' t20 know what the criteria are by which you decide21 whether a rent increase should be granted or   not.22 Maybe if we all knew  the23 criteria, then it would be easier to address   the24 issues. But it's not. People are speaking   from25 personal experiences on both sides of the   issue.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2422 One thing that comes to mind  is3 that the agencies have a list of all  the4 landlords and their violations.  I don' t know5 whet her or not they use that in deciding whether6 or not the landlords merit  increases.7 But , you know, it would be best ,8 it would be best if they were more  objective.9 Anyway,  I guess I can speak for10 my particular landlord. I live in Brooklyn.   I11	live in the Midwood section of Brooklyn. My12 landlord , J. C. Dwight , owns a number of13 buildings  in Manhattan, owns our building  and has14 for a very, very long time. Actually the  mortgage15 is all paid out.16 One thing, the landlords have17 many methods by which they can show that   they18 don' t have  - - they're not earning enough	as19 much as they should. My landlord  warehouses20 apartments. He doesn' t rent them when it  suits21 him; he rents them when it does. They get a   great22 amount  once the apartment	- - they get a good23increase oncethe apartments are re- rented,24especially ifthey fix them up.25Sometimes the landlord rents toROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2432 very undesirable  tenants. We've had a prostitute3 in our building which he was forced to remove  but4 to his advantage because the turnover was  that5 much quicker.6 So we had an MCI recently.  And7 what 's interesting about the MCI is in getting8 the records from the Department of Buildings,  he9 said that  increase  - -  that the work would cost10 him $120,000. He was pointing the building.  And11 then he advised DHCR that the work cost $320 , 000.12 That was a big difference.13 I don't how that happened.  But14 it so - - you know, I don' t know what  criteria  you15 use by which you judge who is more needy or who16 is telling the truth or who is  whatever.17 Middle class and poor  tenants18 are being squeezed. Of course, costs are going   up19 for everyone. But I guess you have to decide, you20 know, who has the greater need here, who  is21 suffering the most.22 I don' t know. But I guess these23 are just my points.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 If you call our staff  tomorrow,ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2442 they would be happy to tell you what our statute3 is and what governs our decisionmaking  process.4 MS. SYLVIA KAPLAN:	Thank you.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.6	Yes. Question.7	MS. HOLDER:	I just want to add8 that these public hearings come after a series   of9 meetings  at which we receive reports on  various10 economic conditions such as the housing  market ,11 the housing supply. So this is one part of   a12 larger process that include a lot of   information.13 MS. SYLVIA KAPLAN:	From the14 tenants' side as well?15 MS. HOLDER:	I'm sorry. What?16 MS. SYLVIA KAPLAN:	From the17 tenants' side as well?18 MS. HOLDER:	Yes. These are19 objective reports that get compiled by staff ,  but20 there' s also testimony from tenant21 representatives, landlord representatives and so22 on, sort of the professional  groups that23 represent  - -  come and give testimony.24 And then we have the  public25 hearings at which anybody can come and   testifyROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2452	because that 's part of the process.3	MS. SYLVIA KAPLAN:	Okay. Thank4	you.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma' am, either  6 one of you.7 You' re together. You' re going to8 talk together? One' s going to say one word and9 the other the next? Okay.10 Why don't you introduce11 yourselves?12 MS. ALICE MITCHELL:	We're from13 Tivoli Towers.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	From?15 MS. ALICE MITCHELL:	My name is16 Alice Mitchell.17 Tivoli Towers in Brooklyn.18 MS. STEPHANIE FULSON:	My name19 is Stephanie  Fulson. And  we  come from Tivoli  2 O	Towers.21 And we are in desperate need  of22 no increase in our building.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where is24 Tivoli Towers?25 MS. STEPHANIE FULSON:	FranklinROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167

STEPHANIE FULSON:	Our11 landlord does not service us with anything.  We12 are being increased constantly. Our building' s13 elevators are not working properly. We have   three14 elevators and we have three hundred and  twenty15 apartments in our building.16 And he doesn't service  the17 elevators properly. He doesn' t give us any18 maintenance	in our apartments. I had mold  coming19 out of my bathroom. I had to go to court  all20 summer last summer.21 People who had water  damage22 still have water damage throughout the  building.23 We have to wait until we go to court to  get24 things fixed.25 And every time we have  anROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2472 inspection from HPD or HUD, he cleans up  the3 building, the outside and they go to  certain4 people' s apartments and then the other  apartments5 he will leave them go so that he can get  the6 increase.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Tivoli is a8	rent stabilized building?9	MS. STEPHANIE FULSON:	Yes.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes or no?11 MS. ALICE MITCHELL:	Yes, it is.12 It 's a Mitchell - Lama building.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It 's14 Mitchell - Lama.  It 's not under rent stabilization.15 No. It 's under - - unless - - did16 he buy out from the Mitchell - Lama program?17 MS. ALICE MITCHELL:	He has18 opted to buy out.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	But he hasn't20 bought out yet?21 MS. ALICE MITCHELL:	He posted a22 not ice in April , April ,  I think, 26th,23 MS. STEPHANIE FULSON:	26th.24 MS. ALICE MITCHELL:	- - saying25 that he wants to come out of all the  programs.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2482 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And when did3 the building open?4	MS. ALICE MITCHELL:	This is5	what we're doing research  now.6	MS. STEPHANIE FULSON:	In June,7	I 74.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	June '74. So9 he may or may not be under  stabilization10 depending on where it comes  in.11	Okay.12 MS. ALICE MITCHELL:	We have a13 lot of problems as Ms. Fulson stated. In  the14 winter it 's very cold. We are constantly calling15 311 to have someone come and expect to give  us16 hot and hot water.17 The conditions of the  building18 are deplorable. It's unlivable at this point.   I19 guess because the landlord has decided to  opt20 out , the maintenance men are not doing any work.21 And I found out something  that22 there is a conflict of interest. I found out   that23 there are several men who live in the  building,24 work for the landlord, they're maintenance  men,25 and they are not doing any work. Nothing goes   onROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2492 here.3 The garbage isn't picked  up.4 MS. STEPHANIE FULSON:	Security.5 MS. ALICE MITCHELL:	There's no6	security. The doors are open.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	This is a8	State or City Mitchell - Lama?9	MS. ALICE MITCHELL:	This is10	City.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	State of New12 York.13 MS. ALICE MITCHELL:	City. HPD14 and HUD govern.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Then it 's a16 City. It's HPD.17 MS. ALICE MITCHELL:	So what18 we' re asking is that we need someone to19 investigate and we would like to see that   this20 landlord , Donald Letnick	(phonetic) does not get21 any increase because he doesn' t deserve it.22 As someone mentioned before,  we23 have elder people. We have a little boy who   is24 disabled who has to go to school. He  cannot25 he' s in a wheelchair. He cannot leave theROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2502 building if there is no elevator service.  And3 this is a constant thing with no  elevator.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We don't set5	the rents for that building.6 MS. ALICE MITCHELL:	Okay.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	If you call8 us, someone on the staff will inquire of  HPD9 about Tivoli and we'll give you the same  answer10 you are getting from HPD. But we' ll take a  look11 at it.12 But we don' t control that13 situation because he's not under  rent14 stabilization and is probably going to say,  if15 it 's  '74, that even when he comes out , if he  buys16 out , that he is not going to be under17 stabilization18 MS. ALICE MITCHELL:	Okay.19 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	- - at all.20 MS. ALICE MITCHELL:	So21 basically  I missed something.22 So this hearing is just  for23 buildings that are just under rent  stabilization?24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Correct. This25 is the Rent Guidelines Board. We govern  theROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
12512allowable leaseincreases in rent stabilized3apartments, theannual allowable lease  increases.4This is not for the Mitchell -5Lama. But we' rehappy to hear from you.6MS. ALICE MITCHELL:	Thank you7for listening.8CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9MS. STEPHANIE FULSON:	Thank10you.11 (Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Anybody else13 wish to speak?14 Anybody else? Okay. Go  ahead.15 MARIA:	Good evening.16 My name is Maria. I live  in17 Manhattan.	I'm glad that you all came out to  have18 a hearing out here in  Brooklyn.19 But at the same time we  need20 hearings in the Bronx, Queens. And we should  have21 one next year again.22 Because I have two kids and it 's23 going to affect them too because maybe  like24 another eighteen years from now the rent is  going25 to be really skyrocketing for  them.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	2522 So it 's good that you have an3 RGB meeting out in Brooklyn and in  Manhattan.4 But at the same t ime you should5 have it every year. And it does affect  everybody6 actually.7 Thank you.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Anybody else11 like to speak?12 (No response.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.14 To repeat , just for the Board15 Members, you have in your packets the updated16 Income and Expense Study and you have a memo   from17 Andy. You' ll be receiving the draft  explanatory18 statements tomorrow.19 And we will see everybody  ten20 a.m. at Cooper Union on Thursday morning,  yes,21 Thursday, the 16th.22 Thanks, everybody, for coming.23 Thank you.24 (At 8:54 o'clock p.m. the25 proceedings  were concluded.)ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
