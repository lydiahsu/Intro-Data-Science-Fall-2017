2motion.3Mr. Pagan. Motion by Mr.  Pagan.4(Audience part icipation.)5MR. PAGAN:	I just want to6 bring up the issue of the special guideline  at7 this time. Are we talking about  that?8 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Yes. We - -9 MR. PAGAN:	I want to eliminat e10 paragraph 2 in the special  guidelines.11 (Audience part icipat ion.)12 MR. PAGAN:	I move to that.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That 's the14 only motion you want to make? Do you want to - -15 MR. PAGAN:	At this time, just16 as we are going through the language, I just  want17 to make sure that certain items I just want  to18 deal with.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Just to be20clear, part ofyour motion is to  eliminate21paragraph two,the Fair Market Rent.22MR. PAGAN:	Fair Market Rent at23this t ime.24CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.25MR. PAGAN:	And then we' ll
2 discuss the numbers.3 (Audience part icipation. )4	MR. PAGAN:	And let me explain.5	On the Special Guidel ine, it6 says " 50% above the maximum base rent. " That   will7 be established by a motion later  on.8 But the second paragraph  talks9 about the Fair Market Rent established by  HUD.10 Now, we had discussions from  a11 representat ive of NYJAC where they said that the12 HUD rent guideline was higher, that they used  to13 take a lower number. And to that extent , for that14 reason I believe that we should eliminate  that15 paragraph.16 (Audience part icipat ion. )17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is that the18 only motion you want to make?19 MR. PAGAN:	I want to make a20 separate mot ion in reference to the apartment21 guidelines after we deal with this  one.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do we have a23 second on that mot ion?24 MS. HOLDER:	I second the25 mot ion.
1	192 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Section on3 the motion.4 Is there any debate on  the5 motion? Any debate on the mot ion?6	MS. HOLDER:	Well , like - - yes.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.8 MS. HOLDER:	In regard to the9 special guideline, we want ed to make sure that10 it 's understood that right now we are talking11 about classification of housing, rent  controlled12 housing, that 's affect ed by this. It 's about13 50,000 units that are left in that  universe.14 And we feel that in the  last15 several years this body, the Rent  Guidelines16 Board , began to inflate the special guideline,17 first raising it from forty percent , then to18 eighty percent.19 And what we are finding  is20 that  - - and now it 's fifty percent , but applying21 the maximum base rent rather than the  maximum22 collectible rent , which has the effect of23 inflating it even further.24 The maximum base rent is  the25 supposed ideal rent the landlord should  be
1202collectingandthe maximum collect ible rent is3the amountthetenant actually pays.4(Audience participat ion .)56landlord caMS. HOLDER:	Right now then raise the MCR or the maximum7collectiblerent by 7.5 percent per year until  it8reaches theMBR, which is adjusted upwards  every9two years.10 What we are seeing is that11 effect ively these increases, and setting the12 special guideline as high as it is and  including13 the second paragraph that includes the  language14 about  the Fair Market  Rent ,  effectively takes15 these apartments straight out of any type of  rent16 law .17 So these apartments are not  only18 taken out of rent control , but they are taken to19 the point  of being  - - not being  eligible to20 remain as rent stabilized  stock.21 It has a lot of impact  towards22 the tenants who live there. We all know that  the23 maturity of tenants who live in these  apartments24 are senior citizen, often t imes disabled ,  with25 the  lowest  incomes of  any rent regulated - -

HOLDER:	- - they are10harassed- -11(Audience participation.)12MS. HOLDER:	- - they are13 incredibly harassed and are being forced out  of14 these apartments.15 We think that we should ,  and16 this Board can, correct this language in  the17 special guideline to prot ect these apartments  and18 stem the t ide of losing these units into	out19 of the rent protect ion that we have here in New20 York City.21 (Audience participat ion.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 Mr. Schleider. Mr.  Schleider24 would like to discuss this  motion.25 Go ahead. Mr. Schleider.
2MR. SCHLEIDER:Thank you, Mr.3Chair.45First ,  it doesn' t remove theseunits from the rent  stabilization.6(Audience participat ion.)7MR.  SCHLEIDER:	We don' t have -89(Audience participation. )10MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - HUD high11enough togetpast the high rent  threshold.12(Audience participat ion.)13MR. SCHLEIDER:	It doesn' t do14it.15Secondly, these units are16typically- -17(Audience part icipation. )18MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - the lowest19 rent units within a building	in neighborhoods. We20 still don' t bring them up to a level that 's21 broadly  affordable, generally affordable,22 (Audience part icipation. )23 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - to the24 broader market tenancies in these  communities.25 The special guideline  - -
1	232 (Audience participat ion. )3 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - has to4	remain in.5	And , in fact , the adjustment6 over the MBR should be higher.7 (Audience participation.)8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Pagan has9	a counter.10 MR. PAGAN:	I know it 1    s highly11 unusual  for us to - -  for me to begin with  a12 motion in reference to special guidelines.  We13 usually start with all the other  increases.14 But I felt that - -15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Nothing is16 out of the ordinary here. It 1   s okay .17 (Audience participat ion.)18 MR. PAGAN:	I believe we need a19 little bit of discussion on this issue because   it20 has been going on for a while. And we seem  to21 just get to it at one point and just vote for   an22 increase and forget that there are  other23 paragraphs there that we have never  addressed ,24 especially that second paragraph,25 (Audience participat ion.)
2 MR. PAGAN:	- - where we feel3 strongly that it should be deleted .4 (Audience participat ion.)5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me just6 clarify so that everybody  understands.7 This special guideline does  not8 affect any tenant in any occupancy. It  affects9 the turnover - -10 (Audience participation .)11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	amount12 that is permitted to an owner so  that13 (Audience participation .)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	when the15 talk is about 50, 000 units, there are no 50, 00016 units that are affected.17 (Audience participation. )18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The argument19 was also made that these units would be lost   to20 rent stabilization, which  is not , in fact ,  the21 case because the Fair Market Rent - I don't  know22 the exact number - but it is in the vicinity  of23 $800 to $1100 per apartment in the City of  New24 York, which does not even get close to the   $200025 vacancy decontrol number.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC .521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167

SCHLEIDER:	Last year we12 had 706 units converted from rent control to  rent13 stabilization.14 If you have a pool of  50,00015 rent controlled tenants, that 's going to take16 seventy years to extinguish that  stock.17 (Audience participat ion.)18 MR.

Call the question.
2 The mot ion before the house is3 to eliminate the second paragraph presumably  in4 bot h places that it appears under special5 guideline of decontrolled units, which  would6 eliminate7 (Audience participat ion.)8	CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	- - the Fair9	Market Rent reference.10 MS.

PAGAN:	Good evening,15 fellow Board Members, residents, owners, as  well16 as those interest ed part ies that are in the17 audience today.18 I make the mot ion for zero19 percent  for one year,20 (Audience part icipation.)21 MR. PAGAN:	- -  zero percent for22 two years,23 (Audience participation. )24 MR. PAGAN:	- - no supplemental25 adjustment , no  sublease  allowance , no
2 equalizat ion allowance.3 I'm sure that our efforts  to4 bring a fair action tonight will be rewarded  by5 eight months of peace, until we  begin6 deliberat ing for next year' s guidelines.7 (Audience participat ion.)8	MR. PAGAN:	Most of you will be  9 happy that the process is over and that we can  go10 back to our families, work and to our  businesses.11 The time that you, fellow  Board12 Members, give to this cause is important.  I'm13 also sure that the Rent Guidelines Members  are14 vot ing on their conscience.15 (Audience part icipation. )16 MR. PAGAN:	Some or all of you17 that are affected by our decision tonight may  not18 be happy with the Board' s final action.19 The tenant representatives'  job20 tonight is to do our best for the people  we21 represent .22 (Audience participation. )23 MR. PAGAN:	We do hope that the 2425	(Audience participat ion. )
2	MR. PAGAN:	We do hope that the3 outcome recognizes the income problems of  the4 residents of our City.5 (Audience participat ion.)6	MR. PAGAN:	I have missed very7 few meet ings while being a member of this Board.8 Listening to the tapes of the meeting that  I9 missed of June 2nd , I found the discussion to  be10 enlight ening, to sit back and review prior11 meetings and reflect on the bigger  picture.12 At the June 2nd meet ing a13 quest ion was asked by one of the Board Members:14 " How many  of the rent stabilized  apartments  are15 affordable? "16 Our Chairman, Mr. Markus,17 answered that it depends on the definition  of18 affordability.19 (Audience participat ion .)20 MR. PAGAN:	Most definitions21 are set to the guidelines of the City' s HPD22 program or any other agency.23 He also said something that  was24 very insightful  and tenant representatives25 understand.  If we use eighty percent of medium
2	income, few apartments will be  affordable.3	My fellow Board Members, that  is4 the issue we are bringing here tonight. Very   few5 apartments  are , in fact , affordable  to New6 Yorkers.7 (Audience participat ion. )8	MR. PAGAN:	Those individuals9 at or below eighty percent of medium income  are10 finding no affordability  in their living11 accommodat ions, and the lower you are in the12 income pyramid , the worse the problem, and our13 actions tonight will make the problem  worse.14 In the past we have been part  of15 the problem. Let 's be part of the solution.16 (Audience participation.)17 MR. PAGAN:	We may complain18 about services and rising cost . For that reason19 we need to take a close look at the residents   of20 the apartments.21 This is a no-win situation.  If22 the rent rises above what people can pay, and  we23 are at that point , the tenants will have a24 hardship leading to a greater number  of25 homelessness or increasing the number of   families
2 residing at the apartment in order to afford  the3 rents, double up.4 (Audience participation.)5	MR. PAGAN:	I am sure many of6 you are aware of such situations, even if  you7 have not seen them yourself . There have been a8 number of articles in the newspapers where  people9 sleep by turns in an  apartment.10 (Audience participat ion .)11	MR . PAGAN:	There is also the12 experience that I 'm having in my community, Los13 Sures . We have a pantry . For many years our usage14 never went over seventy- five grocery bags per15 mont h. We are now giving out a minimum of 27016 bags of groceries per month to needy  families .17 Our families are desperate  and18 we don' t see an improvement in the near future.19 (Audience participation.)20 MR. PAGAN:	We may talk about21 diff erent data that is presented to us during  the22 course of our meeting, but it was pointed out   to23 me that when we deliberate, we overlook all  the24 data and give all the weight to the  building' s25 income, expense and net  income.
1	402 There is no formula or3 mat hematical computation to quant ify or qualify4 the plight of the tenants' difficulty in  meeting5 their ever- increasing rent.6 (Audience participation. )7	MR. PAGAN:	The problem is that8 the additional burden on the apartment  services9 leads to further10 (Audience participat ion.)11	MR. PAGAN:	- - deteriorat ion of12 the buildings,13 (Audience participat ion.)14 MR. PAGAN:	increasing the15 cost of maintaining	the housing as well as16 leading to mult iple violat ions of housing codes17 and complaints from neighbors, a vicious   cycle18 that culminates in the need of higher  rent19 increase for owners.20 We need to break this  cycle.21 I'm also asking tonight that  the22 owners' members act as advocates for the   small23 homeowners by acting as go- between between  the24 large owner' s organizations, such as the Real25 Estate Board , and the small owners, like  SPONY,
1	412 to develop loan funds and training programs  for3 the small owners.4	From where I sit , I see  the5 benefit that the large owners have by having  the6 issue of rent increases being brought up by  the7 small owners - -8 (Audience participation.)9 MR. PAGAN:	- - that are in10 bigger need of cash and improvements in  their11 systems.12 Instead of taking advantage  of13 these small owners, large owners should  be14 helping  them out .15 (Audience participat ion.)16 MR. PAGAN:	We are also17 requesting that we look at the apartment  proviso,18 not such a new idea since it was once adopted   in19 1995. Both Larry Wood and Martin Zelnik have  made20 recommendations. The t ime has come to make sure21that we retainaffordabl e units.22(Audience participation. )23MR. PAGAN:	Finally, I'm asking24you to keep anopen mind. Tonight should  be25historic if wecan keep af fordability as a veryROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167

SCHLEIDER:	Tenants and20 landlords need more programs like SCRIE  to21 provide assistance to our elderly tenants at   risk22 of falling behind in their  rent.23 (Audience participat ion. )24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	We need more25 programs like SCRIE to finally recognize  and
2 provide rent increase relief to our non- senior3 cit izen disabl ed tenants on fixed incomes.4 (Audience part icipation. )5	MR. SCHLEIDER:	The legislators6 need to expand SCRIE program eligibility  by7 increasing - -8 (Audience participation. )9	MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - income10 thresholds to include a larger percentage of  our11 at - risk families.12 (Audience participat ion.)13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	There' s really14 little difference between a $24,000 income and  a15 $26, 000 income except when a household needs the16 relief  from SCRIE - -17 (Audience participat ion. )18 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - to make ends19 meet and they miss the eligibility cutoff by  a20 couple of dollars.21 (Audience participat ion.)22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	It 1   s not fair23 and our legislators have the ability to fix  this.24 (Audience participat ion.)25 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	In fact , why
2 not expand the SCRIE programs to recognize  a3 broader tenant base to provide relief to  more4 tenants from rent increases?5 (Audience participat ion.)6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Our legislators7 provide  subsidy programs	- -8 (Audience participation. )9 MR.

SCHLEIDER:	Why not help14 those at - risk households who have spent many15 years in their old neighborhoods where  their16 friends and roots are?17 (Audience participation.)18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Maybe the19 elected off icials can also work toward expanding20 SCRIE and create workable rent increase   exemption21 programs  for tenants in place.22 (Audience participat ion.)23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	We need24 programs  to provide  rent  increase relief .25 (Audience participation.)
2	MR. SCHLEIDER:	To preserve the3 rent stabil ized housing stock we need long- term4 government programs, not a one- shot deal passed5 here at the owners' expense.6 (Audience participat ion.)7	MR. SCHLEIDER:	And the elected8 officials won' t do anything to help those tenants9 at risk if a zero or a low increase is  passed10 because then our elected officials are off  the11 hook for another year.12 (Audience participation. )13 MR. SCHLEIDER :	The elected14 off icials shift their responsibility to the15 landlords and the elected off icials don't hear16 the message.17 (Audience participation.)18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Stop the battle19 between the landlord and tenant .20 (Audience participation.)21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Stop the battle22 by helping the tenant meet the  rent.23 (Audience participat ion. )24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Tenants and25 landlords together need long - term programs, not a
2 one- shot deal.3 (Audience participat ion.)4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The message to5 the elected off icials is clear: create the6 necessary rent increase exemption subsidies   to7 allow our tenants to stay in place, in  their8 homes.9 (Audience participation.)10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	This Board can11 help bring the message to the elected  officials12 that owners and tenants need their help ,13 (Audience participation.)14 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - that owners15 and tenants need long- term assistance, not a one -16 shot deal.17 (Audience participation.)18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Although the19 Board' s data suggests that double- digit rent20 increases are warrant ed, we won' t ask for them.21 (Audience participat ion. )22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Although the23 Board' s data shows that rent increases above the24 preliminary range won' t be sufficient to meet25 rising expenses this year, we won' t ask for  them.
2(Audience participation. )3MR. SCHLEIDER:	In the spirit4of sharingtheburden we call for  increases5(Audience participation. )6MR . SCHLEIDER:	- - merely7limited tothetop end of the preliminary  range.8(Audience participation.)9MR. SCHLEIDER:	By this Board10 approving increases at the upper end of  the11 preliminary range, we can bring the message  to12 the elected officials, that owners and  tenants13 need their help,14 (Audience part icipation. )15 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - that owners16 and tenants need long - term assistance, not a one-17 shot deal .18 (Audience part icipation. )19 MR.

  2 required to be provided to a dwelling unit by   an3 owner from a central or individual system at  no4 charge to the tenant , the adjustments are as5 follows:6 For a one -year renewal year,7 commencing on or after October 1, 2005 and on   or8 before September 30, 2006, the renewal lease,  if9 heat is provided, will be 2 1/4 percent. For   a10 two-year renewal lease commencing on or after11 October 1, 2005 and on or before September  30,12 2006, it will be 4.5  percent.13 Where heat is neither provided14 nor required to be provided to a dwelling unit   by15 an owner from a central or individual system,   the16 adjustments are as  follows:17 (Audience part icipation.)18 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	- - on this19 vote the numbers in the first one are the same, 2  20	3/4 and 5 1/2.21 The numbers where heat  is22 neither provided nor required for a dwelling  unit23 by an owner from a central or individual   system,24 the adjustment for a one -year lease will be 2  1/425 and for a two-year lease will be 4  1/2.

ZELNIK:	- - apartments  in a22 building with twenty- five percent or more23 deregulated apartments.24 (Audience participation. )25 MR. ZELNIK:	And it reads as
2 follows:3 In the event that a building  or4 multiple dwelling has reached the threshold  that5 twenty- five percent of all its apartments have6 become deregulated , there should be a two percent7 rent increase for a one-year lease and a  rent8 increase of 3 .5 percent for a two-year lease.9 (Audience participat ion.)10 MR. ZELNIK:	It is intended that11 the Rent Guidelines Board neither freeze  the12 rents at this t ime for those types of buildings.13 We are considering a number far less than that  of14 buildings that have not reached that  threshold.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What was the16 numbers again?17 MR.

2 it clear that over the last week or so there  has3 been this discussion about the so-called  proviso.4	And let me	I will say, and I5 will quote Mr. Schleider, that this is, in  my6 opinion, the most misguided guidel ine proposal7 that has ever come forward.8 (Audience part icipation.)9	CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Let ' s talk10 about the mat h here . Let 's talk about the math.11 I see that we have distinguished12 Councilman Jackson in the audience. Let me  ask13 rhetorically, Mr. Jackson, what do you think of   a14 guideline that says to your community where  it 's15 not very likely that anybody has  been16 decontrolled at over $2000 per apartment , this17 guidel ine says that those that are rent ing in18 neighborhoods where the rental is above   $2000,19 upon vacancy, get a lower increase than those   in20 neighborhoods  that , in fact , are in poorer21 neighborhoods where market rents are, in  fact ,22 lower?23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	This is, to25 quote unquote, to quote the tenant movement ,  in
2 general , a poor tax, an outrageous attempt to3 make a differentiation to make sure that those   in4 this audience who represent the tenants pay  more5 - - yes, more  than those that happen to be  in  the6 bet ter neighborhoods of the City of New York .7 So I think it 's misguided and I8 do not accept it as a friendly  amendment.9 (Audience participation. )10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.11 Mr. Zelnik has a second  friendly12 amendment .13 MR.

ZELNIK:	Thesecond5 amendment relates to small property owners  and6 special consideration.7	And  just as background , we had a8 lot of discussion  in the last years  - -9 (Audience part icipation.)10 MR. ZELNIK :	- - about the fact11 that small property owners have  greater12 di fficulty ,  specifically owner- occupied13 buildings,  than people who own hundreds or14 thousands of units .15 (Audience participation.)16 MR. ZELNIK :	So this is17 addressed at this point to the needs of  owner-18 occupied small property owners and a  special19 consideration.20 Whereas it has been  determined21 that many small residential properties are  owner-22 occupi ed ; and2 3	Whereas it has been  determined24 that the owners of these small properties do  not25 have the buying power of owners of  largeROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 propert ies; and3 Whereas it has been determined4 that the buildings with fewer dwelling units  may5	suffer disproportionately  by having a larger6	percentage of the units with lower rents;  and7	Whereas, there has been8 testimony that owners of these smaller propert ies9 may be suffering greater economic hardships  than10 owners of larger or multipl e properties;11	The owners of any owner- occupied12 property that contains ten or fewer units,  that13 any apartment renting for $400 or less shall   be14 ent itled to a supplemental adjustment of one15 percent above the Rent Guidelines Board for  all16 rent stabilized apartments.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	This	just19 to be clear, is an amendment to provide  for20 great er increases for owner- occupied apartments.21 It is an additional , as22 indicated by the motion provider, Mr. Zelnik,  a23 supplemental adjustment which has  been24 characterized  by  some, not myself ,  as the poor2 5	tax.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212)  840-1167
2 I do not accept it as a  friendly3 amendment and, therefore, the amendment as   read4 is the one that stands.5 Any debate on that  amendment?6 (Audience participation. )7	MS. HOLDER:	Debate on the8	amendment?9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What?10 MS. HOLDER:	Debate on the11 amendment?12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	On the13 motion. You want to debat e the motion?14 What would you like to  do?15 MS. HOLDER:	Well , I think16 that , in terms of the motion, you are talking17 about a motion that 's been - -18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The motion19 that I made and was  seconded.20 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.21 In terms of the motion that22 you've made and has been seconded , again,  looking23 at what has happened, from 1989 through 2003 ,24 landlords have had unprecedented  increases.25 They have seen their netROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
4	MS. HOLDER:	- - income5	increase.6	Even in 2002 when there  actually7 was a dip in the PIOC, the PIOC was a  negative8 number, there still was compounded increases of   29 and 4 percent on one and two- year leases.10 Two years ago, this Board  voted11 in increases of 4.5 and 7.5 percent , and last12 year voted in increases of 3 .5 and 6.5 percent.13 The three point spread14 (Audience participation. )15 MS. HOLDER:	The three point16 spread has acted as a backdoor longevity  tax.17 And what we are seeing now  is,18 despite the fact that New Yorkers, working  New19 Yorkers, the majority of them, people who live  in20 rent stabilized apartments have not seen  an21 increase in their income, that , in fact ,   there22 has been a wage erosion.23 (Audience participation.)24 MS. HOLDER:	Expenses have gone25 up for owners, but expenses have continued to  go
4	MS. HOLDER:	There has not been5 any record abandonment . In my organization, the6 Legal Aid Society, we see increasingly more  and7 more people at our door request ing our services,8 people formerly being working class tenants,   now9 el igible for our services. And for every one that10 we are able to represent , we turn six away.11 And this year when we say  it12 should be about affordability, this year when  we13 see increased costs for all New Yorkers, but  it 's14 part icularly burdensome	for tenants, who have15 median incomes of $30,000, there is a  proposal16 for 2 3 .4 percent on one-year and 5 1/2 on two17 years, and then not even taking  into18 considerat ion energy costs, which the landlords19 have made a very good case for that says  that20 energy costs are high, but there doesn' t seem  to21 anywhere reflected in this motion for those  units22 where the tenant has been responsible for  their23 energy, that they' re getting any type of break  on24 the increase.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We've made
2that motion.3(Audience participat ion. )4CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That is5	exactly what we made. We made a reduct ion.6MS. HOLDER:	But not a7significantenough reduct ion given the - -8CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Well , you9said " any. "You didn' t  say significant .10(Audience participation.)11MS. HOLDER:	Signif icant12amount.13	(Audience part icipation.)14MS. HOLDER:	The fact that we15had testimonythis whole season about  energy16costs, and itseems to be an issue that  owners17 considered , when the landlords stated as being a18 cost to them and a burden to them, and not  one19 for tenants who have to pay for their own  energy.20 I think that this proposal  or21 this motion is an inflated motion and I would   ask22 that the other members on this Board vote  this23 mot ion down.24 (Audience participat ion.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.
2	Schleider.3	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chairman,4	if you will ,  a friendly amendment.5	(Audience participat ion.)6	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Keeping in the7 spirit of the tenant members, for  those8 properties where the landlord pays electric,  we9 have master- met ered buildings, we would call for10 an additional	- -11 (Audience participat ion. )12 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - half percent13 for one- year and two-year lease increases.14 (Audience participat ion. )15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	As the tenant16 member - -17 (Audience part icipation. )18 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	- - mentioned,19 energy costs are rising, and where the  landlord20 pays, instead of the tenant , the landlord  should21 be compensat ed.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I reject the23 friendly amendment.24 (Audience part icipation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	More friendly
2amendments?3Mr. Lubell. Talk into the  mike.4MR. LUBELL:	I'll try.5CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. You6can do it .7MR. LUBELL:	I think, before8you cut thebaby in half , that you need to bear9in mind10(Audience participat ion.)11MR. LUBELL:	- - some of the12 facts, not hypothetical  and pandering comments,13 but some of the facts like operating  costs14 increased by 12.5 percent.15 (Audience participat ion.)16 MR. LUBELL:	Net operating17 income declined by 8.7  percent.18 (Audience participation. )19 MR. LUBELL:	And rental income20 only increased by 3 .6 percent.21 These are facts.22 (Audience participation. )23 MR. LUBELL:	Oil today is about24 $59 - -  closer to $59 a barrel.  So that oil , this25 spike is going to go on for a long, long   time.
2	(Audience part icipat ion.)3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.4 Let me reiterate. I think  5 everybody knows the motion, but I need  to6 summarize.7 In accordance with the motion,8 everybody here is vot ing not only on the motion,9 but the language of the Order and  explanatory10 statements and findings for this part icular11 Order.12 If - - let me also say that  Mr.13 Lubell indicated before we've cut the baby  in14 half. The job of this Board is not to cut  any15 baby in any particular kind of segment. The job - 1617 (Audience part icipat ion. )18 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	- - of this19 Board , and I hope the Board moves to adopt the20 motion that I made, is to make an  informed21 judgment balancing the needs of both  landlords22 and t enants and ultimately the rental housing23 stock.24 (Audience participat ion.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	With that I
2 would like to call for a vote on this  motion.3 Okay.4 Ms. Adams? Ms. Adams?5	MS. ADAMS :	Mr. Chairman,6	(Audience part icipat ion .)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.8 MS. ADAMS :	at this time9 there is a housing crisis, which everyone,  even10 the extreme members on this Board  have11 acknowledged , and we also have a responsibility12 for housing stock that is  livable.13 And we are not the only  agency14 who is responsible for this  crisis.15 We have heard tenants  from16 public  housing,  from Section 8 ,  from Mitchell -17 Lama' s and across the board.18 I think that is for two reasons.19 One, there is a housing  crisis,20 so anywhere that you can have people  acknowledge21 it and act on it , you want to be there.22 The second is, I believe that23 the Rent Guidelines Board, if not the only,  is24 one of the very few places where people can  even25 express their opinions other than the  Federal
2 Register and that sort of  thing.3 (Audience participat ion. )4	MS. ADAMS:	So we thank the5 tenants who have shared their testimony with  us .6 I think that it has moved  this7 Board undeniably. We've got everybody on  board8 now who talks about the housing crisis and  what9 we can do about it .10 And everybody' s got their little11 list of things that we need to study next year  so12 that we can do a bett er job.13 That does not solve the14 immediate problem, but it is progress and I  am15 for that.16 And  I vote , yes, Mr. Chairman.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Adams19 votes yes.20 Ms. Holder?21 MS. HOLDER:	I vote no.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder23 votes no.24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Kaufman?ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 MS. KAUFMAN:	I just wanted to3 say as a public member, my charge is to   consider4 the interests of both the tenants and the  owners.5 And the informat ion - -6 (Audience participat ion.)7 MS.  KAUFMAN:	- - we have8 reviewed and the testimony that we've  heard9 clearly documents the need for more  affordable10 housing for New Yorkers.11 Real wages have declined and  the12 City' s economic performance, although bett er than13 last year, remains below where it was in 2001.14 As to the buildings, the  owners15 continue to face a cont inued increase in the16 Price Index of Operating Costs and lower  net17 operating income.18 (Audience participation.)19 MS. KAUFMAN:	We are seeing20 more distressed buildings  in Manhattan in each  of21 the past three years. And to echo Mr.  Zelnik's22comments,I'mparticularly	concerned about the23plight ofthesmall building owner.24I, therefore, support the mot ion25to reducetheguideline from where it was  lastROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 year but to a level that recognizes that  owners'3 costs have increased.4 Yes.5 (Audience participation.)6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Kaufman7 votes yes.8 Mr. Lubell?9	MR. LUBELL:	I pass.10 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Mr. Lubell11 passes .12 Ms. Lusskin?13 MS. LUSSKIN:	Mr. Chairman,14 Members of the Committee and the  audience.15 Many important things have  been16 said by my colleagues.17 But I just want to add , we have ,18 obviously, a weighty responsibility to  provide19 sufficient income to maintain a housing stock  of20 roughly a mill ion units while21 (Audience participat ion.)22 MS. LUSSKIN:	- - maintaining	a23 community in the face of a continued  housing24 emergency.25 (Audience participation. )ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 MS. LUSSKIN:	In light of that ,3 I support these numbers.4 (Audience participat ion. )5	MS. LUSSKIN:	However, where6 owners are clearly not doing their part  to7 preserve the stock, what public policy is   served8 by giving those owners an  increase?9	(Audience participation.)10 MS. LUSSKIN:	I believe it is11 time to revisit whether we can condit ion rent12 stabilized increases in the same way that  rent13 controlled increases are conditioned on the   lack14 of , quot e, rent impairing violations, those15 serious and continuing  violations.16 And I ask that our  extremely17 able research staff analyze what the impact  of18 such a change would be, in other  words,19 (Audience part icipation.)20 MS.  LUSSKIN:	- - for those who21 (inaudible),22 (Audience participat ion.)23 MS.  LUSSKIN:	- - if we took the24 same rules that are applied on rent  controlled25 apartments, where an owner who has  serious
2 outstanding violations according to a whol e3 system that has been worked out , that owner does4 not get a rent increase.5 (Audience participation. )6 MS. LUSSKIN:	If we applied7 that same system to the rent stabilized  stock,8 what would be the impact?9 I would l ike that studied apart10 from, but in addition to the question of  whether11 or not we have the authority to make such  a12 change .13 I think that the information,14 even if the conclusion is that we do not  have15 that authority, that information   - -16 (Audience participation.)17 MS. LUSSKIN:	- - would help18 inform the debate on one of the serious  issues19 that is brought before us year after year,  which20 is buildings where there  - -21 (Audience participation. )22 MS. LUSSKIN:	- - are really23 extreme conditions and it is clear that the  rent24 increases that we provide in order to  help25 maintain the stock are not being used in any  way
2 to improve the building.3 I vote yes.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Lusskin5 vot es yes.6	(Audience participat ion.)7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And as Chair,8 I will direct the staff to undertake  this9 analysis on the violation status of  rent10 stabilized apartments .11 Mr. Pagan?12 MR. PAGAN:	No.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Pagan14 votes no.15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.17 Schleider?18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I'll pass.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr . Schleider20 passes.21 Mr . Zelnik?22 MR. ZELNIK:	Mr. Chairman, we23 have heard a tremendous amount about  the24 obligations that the landlords have to meet  all25 the t ime. And I think there is no dispute about
(2 the increase in real estate taxes and  the3 increase  in fuel oil , electrical , maintenance  and4 so on.5 (Audience participation.)6	MR. ZELNIK:	At the same time7 we have heard very, very little about the  issues8 that face the tenants.9 (Audience part icipation. )10 MR. ZELNIK:	And we do not11 quant ify those issues the way I think we  should.12 (Audience participation. )13 MR. ZELNIK:	We do not talk14 about the MTA fares going up , which affects15 everybody' s quality of life.16 (Audience part icipation. )17 MR. ZELNIK:	We do not talk18 about the fact that SUNY and CUNY tuitions  have19 gone  up fifty percent	- -20 (Audience participation.)21 MR.  ZELNIK:	- - because that 's22 not within our province to talk  about.23 And we don' t talk about the24 buying power of tenants because that is  not25 produced to talk about  it.
2 And we don' t really talk about3 overcrowding of apartments because that 's not4 something we are supposed to really talk  about.5 What we are basically  talking6 about is the increase in costs to the  property7 owners. And they are real.8 But at the same time - -9 (Audience participation. )10 MR. ZELNIK:	- - we have to11 balance that out with the quality of  life12 (Audience part icipation. )13 MR. ZELNIK:	- - not just the14 fact that there' s an affordable housing crisis15 here in New York City, but there is a quality  of16 life crisis here in New York City for  the17 tenants.18 (Audience participation.)19 MR. ZELNIK:	And I think the20 Board must look at that more carefully in  the21 future.22 (Audience participation. )2 3	MR. ZELNIK:	We have24 discussed  - - we have discussed  what  could be the25 best possible scenario in terms of rent  increase .
2 I would much pref er to see this signif icantly3 lower, but based on the realities of this  whole4 discussion, I must reluctantly support  this5 mot ion.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Zelnik7 votes yes.8 The Chair votes yes.9 Mr. Lubell?10 MR. LUBELL:	I vote no.11 (Audience part icipation.)12 MR. LUBELL:	And I also would13 like to note that the explanatory statement  that14 has been presented	to us does not justify  this15 final vote.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And Mr.17 Lubell votes no.18 Mr. Schleider?19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chairman?20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, Mr.21 Schleider.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The explanatory23 statement is troubling. I have to voice  my24 objection to it.25 However, in the spirit of  yourROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2	motion, I'm going to go  yes.3 (Audience part icipation.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' re going5	to vote yes?6 MR. SCHLEIDER :	Yes.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Motion8 passes, 6- 3 .9 We stand adjourned for  fifteen10 minutes.11 We w i l l be discussing the hotel12 guidelines after that .13 Thank you.14 (At 7:15 o'clock p.m. there was15 a recess in the proceedings.)16 (At 7:40 o'clock p.m. the17 proceedings were resumed.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. We are19 going to get started  again.20 We are going to deal with  the21 hotel guidel ine.22 I'm going to read it into  the23 record.24 This is the New York City  Rent25 Guidelines Board 2005 Hotel Order  #35.

No additional charges may   be15 made to a tenant for such services, however   such16 charges may be called or identif ied.17 " Statement  of basis  and purpose.18 " The Rent Guidelines  Board is19 authorized to promulgat e rent guidelines20 governing hotel units subject to the  Rent21 Stabilizat ion Law of  1969 , as amended , and the22 Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974,  as23 amended. The purpose of these guidelines is  to24 implement the public policy set forth in  Findings25 and Declarat ion of Emergency of the Rent
2 Stabilizat ion Law of 1969, Section 26- 501 of the3 New York City Administrative	Code and in the4 Legislat ive Findings contained in the Emergency5 Tenant Protect ion Act of 1974, Laws of 1974,6 Chapter 576, Section 4, subsection 2. 117 Do we have a motion?8 Ms. Lusskin, go ahead .9 MS. LUSSKIN:	As I stated last10 year, it ' s clear from test imony received and  also11 looking at the one year when you did offer  an12 increase, that I don' t believe that there is an13 increase that we can offer that would offset  or14 would abate the overwhel ming and illegal15 conversion of hotel units to other  uses.16 But at the same time it is  clear17 that if we offer an increase, what we can do   is18 cause unint ended harm to those tenants who are19 still in place in the legal  units.20 And for that reason, I  would21 offer a motion:22 Zero percent increase.23 But I want to note that in  the24 explanatory statement we put in last year and   it25 is again in there this year, that the  proviso,
2 which has been adopted in the past by the  Board3 when we did have an increase , would still be4 preserved  in the record.5 And while we cannot direct  the6 actions of future boards, we in the  explanatory7 statement , when  I make  this proposal , I include8 that section that would urge future boards   in9 such t imes as there ever is an increase granted ,10 to cont inue - - to reinstate the proviso  into  the11 order as adopted.12 And so that 's my motion.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any second?14 MS. ADAMS:	Second.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right .16 Just  so I understand , your17 motion is to adopt the language of Hotel  Order18 #35 as read into the record at this  meeting;19 And further adopt the20 explanatory statement and findings for Order   No.21 35 substant ially in the form submitted by the22 staff to the Board as of June 21, 2005, and to   be23 modif ied by the Rent Guidelines Board staff  after24 this meet ing to reflect the adopted rental25 adjustment s.
1	1152 Is that correct?3 MS. LUSSKIN:	Right.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5	Any debate?6 Mr. Zelnik.7 MR. ZELNIK:	I would l ike to8	set forth an amendment to this  motion.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	A friendly10	amendment?11	MR. ZELNIK:	Not a friendly12 amendment ,  an amendment.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What does14 that mean?15 MR. ZELNIK:	That means the16 amendment must be taken up independently of  the17 motion and voted on, seconded and then voted  on.18 And we can see if it 's added.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Fine. Go20 ahead.21 I think that 's in order with22 Robert 's Rul es. I don't remember, but it sounds 23	good.24 Go ahead.25 MR. ZELNIK:	If we think weROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 have a housing crisis in New York for the   general3 populat ion, then if we start to look at what 's4 happening with this housing, SROs and hotels   and5 single room occupancies, it is  absolutely6 terrible what has been going on in terms of  the7 illegal conversions and harassments and  other8 things.9	I think we , as a Board , can do10 something in terms of at least making  the11 situation somewhat better for those tenants  who12 are still remaining in place and are  being13 subjected to or living in buildings that do  not14 conform with either zoning or do not conform  with15 building codes.16 So in that regard I offer  this17 following amendment which I hope it will  be18 seconded and I hope there will be  discussion.19 If it can be determined  and20 established  that rooms or legal dwelling  units21 that have been designated as permanently  rent22 stabilized or rent controll ed have been rented23 and/or leased to one or more persons contrary   to24 the Certificate of Occupancy of that  building25 and/or space;
2And/or if it can be  determined3and establishedthat rooms or legal dwelling4units that havebeen designated as permanently5rent stabilizedor rent controlled have been6 rented and/or leased to one or more  persons7 contrary to or in violation of existing New  York8 City  zoning ;9 And/or if it can be determined10 and established that rooms or legal  dwelling11 units that have been designated as  permanently12 rent stabilized or rent controlled have  been13 rented and/or leased to one or more  persons14 contrary to its existing use as an SRO,  rooming15 house, lodging room, Class B hotel or Class  A16 residential  hotel ;17 Then rent stabilized  tenants18 residing in that building shall be entitl ed to19 receive a ten percent reduct ion of the exist ing20 establ ished legal rental effective October, 2005.21 (Audience part icipation.)22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there a23second?24MR. PAGAN:	Second.25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay .
2 Do you have a quest ion on the3 mot ion?4 MS. ADAMS:	Determined by whom?5 MR. ZELNIK:	The Building Code6 and the zoning speaks for itself in terms  of7 whether somebody is in violation or a building   is8 in violation of either an exist ing Certificat e of9 Occupancy or having a motel in a  residential10 district .11 So normally these are  determined12 by DOB , Department  of Buildings.13 MR. LUBELL:	Who makes that14 determinat ion?15 MR. ZELNIK:	I just answered16 that question.17 MR. LUBELL:	Who makes that18 determinat ion?19 MR. ZELNIK:	The Department of20 Buildings.21 MR. LUBELL:	So that before22 there is an increase, the Department of  Buildings23 has to - -24 MR. ZELNIK:	It would have to25 be determined that that building is in  violation
2 of zoning or building code. One woul d have to3 have the Building Department look at the  zoning4 maps5	MR. LUBELL:	We have never6 discussed this and I can't without knowing  what7 HPD would do and without having had  any8 discussion about this, I think that we just  are9 not in a position to proceed even  intelligently10 wi th respect to this amendment.11 I don't know if it 's workable. I12 don' t know if it ' s plausible .13 That 's without regard to my14 views as to whether it 's good or bad.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Ms.16 Lusskin.17 MS. LUSSKIN:	While I share the18 reluctance to vote on this at this point , given19 there are a lot of things that we would have  to20 understand,	I do think that the spirit of it  and21 the issues that it 's trying to address are22 extremely val id and ones that should inform part23 of our debate.24 And while at this point I  would25 not be comfortable voting for that without  more
2 information on the mechanics and so on and  so3 forth, I do very much agree that it is  something4 that we should be looking at consistent with  what5 I was saying with apartments, that there is  a6 point  at which  - - you know, there' s a public7 policy we are supposed to be serving here  by8 offering increases to the rent , that they  should9 be used to preserve the housing stock, and   for10 the SRO and hotel rooms, to preserve those  SRO11 and hotel rooms.12 And if the policy is, in fact ,13 not producing a preservation,  and in these  cases14 it ' s so severe and  it 's such an overwhelming15 t ide , the issue of conditions and also something16 perhaps more proactive	in terms of dealing with17 people who are converting illegally is   something18 that , along the lines of what  he has  suggested ,19wouldbeworthlooking into next year.20So be prepared for next  year's21vote.22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any23addit ionaldebate on this motion?24(No response. )25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:I call the

Mr. Lubell? Mr.  Schleider?23 MR. LUBELL:	I think something24 has to be done to create housing for people  who25 currently live in SROs and for people who  may
2 want to l ive in an SRO type house.3 I think we need to get across  a4 message to the City to do something  about5 delaying the elimination of SROs, or in  the6 alternat ive, for the first time that I've been7 sitting on this Board, I don' t think a new SRO8 has been created in twenty  years.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Anyone for10 discussion?11 Mr. Zelnik.12 MR. ZELNIK:	Just to follow up13 on Mr. Lubell 's comments in terms of gett ing out14 messages.15 I think we need to get a message16 out to the City and particularly the  government17 agencies that they should do something  about18 illegal conversions and illegal occupancies  and19 enforce the law.20 (Audience part icipation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hearing no22 others  for debate , I call the  question.23 The question is zero rent24 increase for the hot el sector.25 Ms. Adams?
