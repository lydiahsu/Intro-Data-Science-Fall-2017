HOLDER:   Yes.  Thank you,Chair.Good evening to my colleagues onthe Rent Guidelines Board. Good evening, New York. (Audience participation.)             MS. HOLDER: The Rent Guidelines Board’s proposal to impose an annual adjustment of 3 percent to 5.75 percent for one-year leases and 6 to 9 percent on two-year leases along with the proposed additional one percent fuel surcharge for apartments and buildings heated by fuel oil, is inconsistent with the Board’s stated goal, which is to protect public health, safety and welfare and to prevent exactions of unjust, unreasonable andROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242510             The permissible increase for decontrolled units as referenced in Order 3a whichbecome decontrolled after September 30, 2011, shall be 	.CREDITS PROPOSAL.                  Rentals charged and paid in excess of the levels of rent increase established by this Order shall be fully credited against the next month’s rent.STATEMENT OF BASIS AND PURPOSE.	             The Rent Guidelines Board is authorized to promulgate rent guidelines governing apartment units subject to the Rent StabilizationLaw of 1969, as amended, and the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974, as amended.                  The purpose of these guidelines is to implement the public policy set forth inFindings and Declaration of Emergency of the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 (§26-501 of the N.Y.C. Administrative Code) and in the Legislative Findings contained in the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974 (L.1974c. 576, §4[§2])             The Rent Guidelines Board is also authorized to promulgate rent guidelines for loftROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242512oppressive rents and rental agreements.(Applause.)             MS. HOLDER: The guidelines proposed are much higher than rent stabilized tenants can afford and will exacerbate an already desperate housing situation in New York City.             Tenants in rent stabilized housing  face extreme financial hardships while the Rent Guidelines Board data show that owners' profits have increased in the current economy. Landlords do not need the adjustments approved, in the preliminary of these range of adjustments, as approved in the preliminary vote by this board.             The tenants impacted by our decisions today continue to live in great economic crisis. Our own Rent Guidelines Board reports in studies indicate as much.             In addition, the testimony that  we’ve heard from the public has borne witness tothis crisis. And I have been moved by much of the testimony that I have heard, as well as seeing the increased need for homelessness prevention and housing preservation services in my offices throughout the City of the Legal Aid Society.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

HOLDER: Our job –- our job as board members is to determine whether an increase is necessary and, if so, what increase would be fair. According to the law we must consider:             The economic condition of the residential real estate industry in the affected area, including such factors as the prevailing and projected real estate taxes and sewer and waterrates, gross operating maintenance costs, including insurance rates, government fees, cost of fuel and labor costs, costs and availability of financing, including effective rates of interest, overallsupply of housing accommodation and overall vacancy rates; and             2, Relevant data from the current and projected cost of living indices for the affected area; and             3, Such other data as may be made available to us.             The fuel surcharge is unnecessary because it compensates owners twice for the increasing cost of fuel oil.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242515concerned with the impact of Rent Guidelines Board rent increases on low income New Yorkers. The number of homeless families in New York City has reached record numbers in the face of a low vacancy rate for apartments and the continuing decline in affordable rent stabilized units as well as other sources of housing within the reach of low income New Yorkers.             According to the New York City Department of Homeless Services, DHS, in June 2011, a total of 3,413 homeless individuals, adults and children, slept in the City’s shelter system, the country’s largest.  That figure includes 8,015families with children.             In addition, DHS estimates that 3,755 individuals sleep unsheltered in streets,parks and subways. Almost 80 percent of homeless New Yorkers in the City are women and their children.             Against this background of high levels of homelessness, the key factors that are driving the increasing needs for housingpreservation and homeless prevention assistance in all five boroughs of this City, include a criticalROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242514(Applause.)MS. HOLDER:   The fuel surchargeis an additional rent increase to owners for a cost already calculated in the proposed commensurate rent adjustments which account for the increasing cost of heating buildings with oil among other goods and services required to maintain a rent stabilized building.             Owners are also unnecessarily compensated, because owners who use fuel oil and have environmentally inefficient buildings should not be rewarded with a rent increase.(Applause.)             MS. HOLDER: Tenants should not be held responsible for owners who refuse to heat their buildings efficiently and waste expensive  oil.Finally, landlords have noincentive to make necessary energy efficiency and conservation upgrades to their buildings.More than any other segment ofthis population, low income New Yorkers bear the brunt of the economic turn down –- downturn.In 2011, more than ever, we areROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242516shortage of affordable housing combined with increasing poverty, joblessness, under employment, domestic violence, high rental costs and various problems in receiving public benefits in healthcare, inadequacies in the City’s administration of Federal Section 8 rental assistance and public housing, and various methods that unscrupulous landlords employ to increase their income such as the use of apartments as rooming houses, the illegal conversion of basements into apartments, rent overcharges and the insistence on side deals as under-the-table money to supplement rents that they agree to accept from DHS.I see this in our caseloads daily.The unemployment rate in New York City remains devastatingly high at almost nine percent. New York City has a higher rate of unemployment than any other area in the State. The Bronx at 11.5 percent, Brooklyn at 9.1 percent, have some of the highest rates of unemployment of any counties in the State.             Unemployment rates among persons of color made much higher. In March of this year,the unemployment rate among African Americans was aROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

That gain haslargely been erased as utilization rates climb back up to over 353,000 this past April.            Meanwhile, food stamp usage continues to climb steadily. The number of food stamp recipients, 1.645 million at the close of 2009, is currently at an all-time high of 1.823 million as of April 2011.In addition to financialhardships, many are experiencing worsening housing conditions as landlords fail to put increasedprofits back into their buildings. The City’sDepartment of Housing Preservation and Development,HPD, reported a significant increase in the numberof complaints concerning housing conditions between fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2010, with totalROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242519public assistance;            Seven percent of stabilized housing units receive SSI.            Four percent receive temporary assistance for needy families, another form of public assistance;            Thirty-seven percent of rent stabilized tenants pay more than 40 percent of their low income towards rent and 49 percent ofrent stabilized tenants pay more than 30 percent of their low income towards rent;            Seventy-seven percent of renters with incomes below the federal poverty line livingin rent regulated apartments pay more –- pay rent that is more than 50 percent of their income, a drastic increase from 64 percent in 2005 and on par with such tenants in unregulated apartments.            Twenty-two percent of rent stabilized tenants are black.Thirty-two percent are Latino. And nine percent are Asian.            And, finally, 53 percent of rent stabilized households are headed by immigrants or someone born in Puerto Rico.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242518complaints rising by almost 4 percent, emergency complaints rising by 3.3 percent and heat and hot water complaints rising over 2 percent.            We know who these tenants are that live in rent regulated housing. Just to remind ourselves, the median household income for rent stabilized tenants is $36,000 a year compared to over $50,000 for unregulated tenants and over$70,000 for homeowners.            Thirty-nine percent of households with incomes below the federal poverty line live in rent regulated housing as do 40 percent ofhouseholds with incomes from 100 to 200 percent of the federal poverty line. Overall, 435,000 low income families live in rent regulated housing, 435,000 low income families.Fifty-three percent of rentstabilized tenants have household incomes below the New York City median income;            Sixteen percent of households live in stabilized housing making less than $10,000 a year;            Fifteen percent of households living in stabilized housing receive some sort ofROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242520            Lastly, and I want to make sure that we are all clear, I don’t believe that we, asa board, can vote this year without acknowledging a grave error on the part of this board that tookplace three years ago and which only came to light this year.(Audience participation.)            MS. HOLDER: This was –- this was easily an honest error at the time, but it will not remain an honest error if the board now chooses to ignore the error and its known consequences and we should correct it.In the spring of 2008, the boardstaff projected that operating costs would rise 7.3 percent over the coming year. By the spring of 2009, it was discovered that the projection was high. Operating costs, as measured by the price index, were said to increase by four percent.            Given the lag of information from the Department of Finance, which collectsinformation about income and expenses through tax filings, we have only recently learned that boththe projection of 2008 and the price index of 2009 were way off.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

The following year rents went up again by three percent and six percent, again with a supplemental rent increase of $30 and $60.             So in the middle of the deepest recession that this country has experienced since the 1930's, rents were going up dramatically where operating costs were basically flat.(Audience participation.)             MS.

This will hurt all the tenants of the building if operations cannot be continued.(Audience  participation.)            MR. SCHLEIDER:  Landlords are feeling a financial punch thanks to major issues impacting costs and availability of housing, real estate taxes and water and sewer costs have skyrocketed, in addition to expenses not covered in the PIOC report, such as expensive City mandates that owners must comply with, like discontinuing use of Nos. 4 and 6 heating oils, which can have anup-front cost upwards of $100,000 per average-sized building.(Audience  participation.)            MR.

SCHLEIDER:  Last month I reminded the board that our staff report showed changes in average monthly rent per dwelling rose a mere 1.4 percent or about half of the last yearone-year allowable rent increase the board voted to approve.(Audience  participation.)            MR. SCHLEIDER: In the Bronx, this averages about $11 per month for apartments, hardly an amount to cover rising operating costs. Even though Citywide rent stabilized apartment building operating income rose 5.8 percent since the prior year’s report, for an average-sized 45-unitapartment building, that means the owner got less than $20 per month per apartment. That’s hardly an increase to subsidize building costs and not enough to make upgrades or emergency repairs.(Audience  participation.)            MR. SCHLEIDER: Although large buildings may carry the impact from rent loss toROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242532not covered in the PIOC.(Audience  participation.)            MR. SCHLEIDER: So solely looking to the PIOC as a proxy for rent increases, even with this year’s PIOC increase of 6.1 percent doesn’t fully recapture the operating expense burden of owning multi-family rent-stabilized property. Next year’s projected PIOC is 7.4 percent. This rate of increase is consistent with typical rates of PIOC year-over-year increase.(Audience  participation.)MR. SCHLEIDER: In the prior 23years of PIOC reporting, the index only showed more negative growth in core operating expenses, and that was a mere 1.6 percent. And that was in the wake of the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center 10 years ago. That obviously was reflecting a disruption in data as the following year PIOCshowed a 16.9 percent increase for apartment properties. Clearly long-term trends and averages are instructive.(Audience  participation.)            MR.

SCHLEIDER: Looking at the2011 Income and Expense Study, the same long-term view illustrates that over the past 19 years ofdata, the average rate of Cost Growth is 4.5 percent per year, with the average NOI growth less than one percent higher.(Audience participation.)            MR. SCHLEIDER: The past ten years tell a more chilling fact that costs have risen 6 percent on average even with the correction of 2008, with NOI growing at only 3.5 percent. With dwelling unit costs growing 41 percent faster than NOI, you don’t need a degree in mathematics to figure out what will happen.(Audience participation.)            MR. SCHLEIDER: Much as been made of the statistic that NOI growth has been exceptional based on the percentage growth of NOI for the outer boroughs. But when looked at the stats realistically, in whole dollars, the pictureis painfully clear that an owner in the Bronx of aROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242535driven up by the chronic housing shortage and that’s a good thing. But consideration for abnormal cost increases must also be allowed to play, and certainly last year’s increase was insufficient to play fair and share the burden.(Audience participation.)MR. SCHLEIDER: As I’ve saidbefore, public members in the past have referred to the need for balancing the interest of owners and tenants in explaining their votes. But as tenant representative David Pagan noted years ago, thereis no mathematical formula to determine tenant need for affordability.(Audience participation.)            MR. SCHLEIDER:   There still isn’t a formula today, mathematical or otherwise, todetermine need or affordability. And no amount of wishful determination of the demographic data will provide such a formula.(Audience participation.)            MR.

SCHLEIDER: An owner of a similar sized building in Brooklyn, Queens andNorthern Manhattan, would make about $44,000, from which the landlord makes mortgage payments, pays income taxes and pays for emergency repairs. Thisis not big business and many small landlords makes less than most of their tenants.(Audience participation.)            MR. SCHLEIDER: The finding of the City Council in enacting the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969, and the State Legislature in adopting Emergency Tenant Protection after 1974, clearly establish that fair and generally affordable rents are a primary objective of these laws. The intent is clearly not to guarantee an affordable rent for every tenant. It can’t be done.(Audience participation.)            MR. SCHLEIDER: Rather, it’s to protect tenants against abnormal rent increasesROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242536almost the lowest possible rent increases despite clear evidence that the economics of rental housing have deteriorated to the worst position recorded in the last 15 years.(Audience participation.)            MR. SCHLEIDER: The staff report focusing on the rent increase formulae noted that the rise in core expenses was 6.1 percent and that next year’s core increase will be 7.4 percent.These suggest modest one and two-year guideline increases will be necessary to protect theviability of our regulated housing stock.(Audience participation.)            MR.

So I do want to recognize them for welcoming me onto this board and listening to some of the arguments that I’ve made on the board.             In early June, the tenant members provided to our community members, several provisos where we were going to reflect the need foradditional considerations of different categories of buildings.

There was a proviso ona minimum increase cap on rents over $1,000. There was a proviso where, if they were less than 80 percent of the units where the rents were not stabilized, that there should be no increases and where there were 80 percent of the building where the rents were not registered with DHCR, therewould be no increases.             We also had a proviso wherein a building unit that had more than one vacancy within the last four years, there would be no increase.             And the final proviso that we presented was in regards to buildings withimmediately hazardous violations where the building owner had not corrected the hazardous violation that requires the statutory time frame.So considering that, the publicROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

And, you know, the only reason that we are doing this, that I am doing this, proposing an increase, is because we understand that the public members are trying to balance between the two extremes that you have in front of you, between the owner members and the landlord members.So considering that, even thoughwe provided many provisos that –- a proviso that is front of us is regarding the one regarding encountering violations on hazardous conditions in buildings that have not been rectified would be set for the statutory time frame.            So with that, my motion is that I am proposing rent increases to try to recognizeROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242551Is there a second?MS.

I’m saying that at a time when we take into consideration and our reports assume that 15 percent of the owners’ operating costs are spent on maintenance and another 11.4 percent are spent on labor, but when that is actually not happening because the increases are not being put back into theROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242550that the public members are going to vote for an increase this year, but I would hope that they consider the proviso that if there are violations of hazardous conditions that have not beenrectified within the required statutory time frame.So my specific motion for theboard is for a one-year renewal lease commencing on or after October 1st, 2011 or on or beforeSeptember 30, 2012, an increase for one-year leases will be 1.75 percent.                 For a two-year renewal leases commencing on or after October 1st, 2011 and on or before September 30th, 2012, the increase will be3.25 percent.(Audience  participation.)            MR.

And I have used this as a basis to say, if we were at a negotiating table, then I would be will to considering a starting point of around 2 and 4 percent for increases as a basis.                 Unfortunately we're starting at a high level at three percent to –- three percent as a minimum, and three percent minimum and six percent minimum for one and two-year leases.             So considering that, I asked the public members to consider starting from the twoROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242558Mr. Wenk.MR.

There was additional regulations where NOI increases have to be 1/60th for 35 units or more and 1/40th for buildings with less units.             Those are very modest concessions and the $2,000 limit was there for 18 years. So the increases that we're proposing this year, three percent and 5.75 percent, we're in one of the worst recessions that we will face this generation during this economic crisis.(Audience participation.)             MR.

I increasingly see that these families have no place to turn to. Section 8 is not available to these individuals. We all know that the shelter system is very hard for our clients to get into.            The Legal Aid Society right now is fighting in a lawsuit to try to keep the Advantage subsidy going. This is a very difficult situation that Brian and I are put into because we understand. We understand that these types of increases are extremely detrimental to our –- our tenants, to our constituents.            However, I am so concerned because this board does not want to consider enabling and strengthening provisos as to what will happen.We’re trying to understand why it is that we cannot get –- why we cannot secure increases that will be much lower, what we think is deserved given the economic realities and given the correction that should be made because of increases that this board has been voting in since 2008.(Audience  participation.)ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242575MR.

It is a difficulttask that is taken seriously by each member of this board and I want to publicly thank my fellow board members for their dedication to this process.I also want to publicly thank theRGB staff whose efforts are greatly appreciated and whose research we all value in aiding us to  establish the annual guidelines.Thank you.             The data presented to us by our staff, board members, government officials andother housing professionals, is a key component in helping this board come to its decision.  However,  I can’t stress enough the importance of the compelling and relevant testimony from tenants,ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242578don’t think I’m mis-characterizing this, but I don’t think anybody on this board condones any illegal activity perpetrated by landlords or by tenants.

I recognize that expenses for owners have increased, in particular, the costs for heating oil and water and sewer rates.             I also realize that tenants’ ability to pay their rent is hampered by thecontinued economic recovery and rising costs for consumer goods. Subsidies are available for many and I can only encourage those who may be eligible to apply for them.(Audience participation.)             CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: It is with these factors in mind that the board adopted a preliminary range of increases of 3 to 5.75 percent for one-year lease renewals and 6 to 9 percent forROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

As such, although it may be warranted, I will not be proposing a fuel adjustment in my final proposal.(Audience participation.)CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: A recentdecision by the New York State Board of Appeals upheld the right of this board to establish different classes of housing accommodations affected by our guidelines.             The board upheld minimum rent increases previously adopted by this board.

I appreciate everyone’s willingness to consider the additional data that has been submitted, but I’d like to see if we couldn’t have it be part of the regular process starting thisfall to get our staff ample time to review what we propose.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:   Ms. Holder,absolutely.
