2 building I live in is deplorable conditions.3 Nothing is getting done and so and so forth . And4 there is no place else for people in Queens or5 anywhere in the City to go.6 As far as most seniors go and people7 that are on disabilities, they also have a lot of8 medical expenses and none of that is taken into9 consideration . Do any of you people go shopping?10 I walk out of the supermarket and my head spins.11 Every little thing is going up. I'm getting ripped12 off along with everybody else left and right.13 Every time I go to buy something it's going up and14 up and up, but at least instead of meat maybe I15 can adjust to spaghetti or a vegetab le .	But when16 it comes to the rent, that is it .17One of myneighbors is paying$1,00018rent.She's lived therefor many years. Andshe19 has not been working for many, many months. She's20 an attractive, intelligent well-bred woman, can't21 get work and she's out there living off her22 savings .23 This is very, very scary. So then if24 she gets another increase in her rent - - she is25 not 65.	She doesn 't - - or she's not 60, doesn't19 
2 qualify for any of the benefit. You 1 re not rich3 enough, you 1 re not poor enough, not that being4 poor is great, but something has really5 desperately got to be done.6 And one other question I have.  There7 were like 8,000 people on May 23rd marching around8 between 14th Street.	I think from 14th Street up9	to - - up to Central Park.	Why were there 8,00010 people out there marching?	Who are they?	Are11 they out there for a nice day? Why were they out12 there?	Because we 1 re desperate and we cannot13 afford - - many of us cannot afford to keep paying14 increase upon increase and upon increase because15 there 1 s no other place to go.16 Don1  t tell us to go to Florida17 because that's getting expensive.	The only place18 maybe an average person may be able to move19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap20 up.21 MS. ADELE BENDER:	is to like in22 Podunk and we don 1 t want to live in Podunk23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 MS. ADELE BENDER:	- - we want to25 stay in New York.10 
1	2032	Thank you.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 (Applause.)5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Allen Weinstein;6 Followed by Matt Shotkin;7 Followed by William Stanford, Jr .;8 Followed by Lynn Vaag, V-a-a-g.9 MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	Hi .10 My name is Allen Weinstein.	I own a11 couple of properties here in Manhattan in the East12 Village and I'd just like to say a couple of13 things.14 No. 1, a lot of these15 VOICES:	Louder.16 MR . ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	A lot of17 these people are talking about landlords that18 don't fix problems, leaks, whatever, whatever.19 Those are bad landlords. Those are bad apples . We20 own apartment buildings here in Manhattan and21 whether you're rent controlled, rent stabilized,22 or free market, if there is one problem, it gets23 fixed the next day.24 The problem I have with rent25 stabilization is in the apartments that are below10 
1	2042 $900. I have a two-bedroom that I can get $3,0003 for and the tenants are paying $850 . They don't4 sign one-year renewals, they sign two-year5 renewals year after year because my rent6 stabilized tenants do not move.	If they want a7 new stove, a new something, I get it right away. I8 have no problem.9 But there has to be fair market10 rents. Because I have tenants that are paying $73611 and have a house in the Hamptons.	How is that12 right? Most of my tenants are not like these old13 people, the elderly people over here, okay.14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	Yes. They16 talk about entitlement . Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,17 you guys.	My tenants - - I do not have many old18 tenants like this. A lot of my tenants are young19 professionals that are in rent stabilized that can20 afford to pay higher rents, yet they are21 benefiting from what was put into place after22 World War II.23 I feel sorry for these individuals24 that are getting put out of Manhattan. But if you25 want to talk about entitlement, they should have2 
1	2052 bought apartments many, many years.	When you own3 an apartment, you are entitled.4 (Audience participation.)5 MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN :	You are6 entitled when you own .	So what I feel - - what I7 feel is that you need to focus on these lower8 rents in the two-bedrooms and you need to have a9 ceiling.10 Let's say an apartment, you base it11 off of -- let's say it's $1,000 and they're paying12 $600, I should be able to $400 times twelve and13 get it off my real estate taxes.14 Now, I realize if that happened, my15 real estate taxes would be zero. However, I'm16 saying that I should be able to have a third17 deduction on my real estate taxes for it which is18 similar to SCRIE.	And I have tenants with SCRIE19 and my tenants in SCRIE gets treated the same as20 my tenant who's paying $81 from rent control.21 Don 't even get my started about that.22 So I think you seriously have to23 look at apartments that are paying below that $85024 and do something there. Because there are people25 - - I have two tenants that own houses in the2 
1	2062 Hamptons that are paying $636. Why is that right?3 I have another tenant paying $700 who's paying4 $400 a month for a storage facility in Manhattan.5 This is what we need to focus on.6 There are problems out there and I7 do believe that you need to have guidelines. For8 example, I have a free market apartment . His rent9 was $2,500, came up for renewal. This year I10 raised it to $2,525.	That's less than two11 percent. That's probably a one-percent increase.12 So I understand that there are landlords out there13 gouging and you have to protect against that, but14 you also have to pick up those low rents.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN .	Questions?17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 Any questions?19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Sure.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. Mr.21 Schleider has a question.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you, Mr.23 Weinstein.24 How many buildings do you own?25 MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	Three.2 
12072MS . HOLDER:	How manyunits?3MR. SCHLEIDER:	Areyou enjoying4them?5MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN:Yes.	It's6fine.Look, the buildings have beenin the7 property for a long time and I do make a profit8 because there's no debt on the property.	But I'm9 entitled to make a profit. No one tells a trader10 at Goldman Sachs he's making $100 million, that's11 too much money. This is a capitalistic society and12 that's what you guys need to understand. This is a13 free market supply and demand issue.14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	What would you say16 for your type of buildings - - and how many units17 are in these three buildings on average,  each18 building?19 MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	I have one 30,20 16s, I have about 65 apartments.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Amongst three22 buildings.23 MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	Right .24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Given the profile25 of your buildings and your operating expenses - -7 
1	2082 and they're proximate to each other so you have3 some sort of efficiencies of operation ?4 MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	Right.5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	What would you say6 would be a commensurate rent increase for your7 properties given that you had some deregulated8 units and we can't touch the rent controlled?9	MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	It's not the10 percentage number, whether it's four-and-a-half or11 seven-and-a-half, seven-and-a-quarter, it's the12 issue with the low -- the really low at below13 $850. You need to have a special bump-up14 especially if the tenant's been living there over15 ten years. That's my real issue. That is my issue.16 If I have a rent stabilized17 apartment and they're paying $1,400, and I get a18 three-percent increase, that's fine. I can deal19 with that. That's not the issue. It's those20 apartments that are way, way below market value21 and that's what you guys need to focus on.22 (Audience participation.)23 MS. HOLDER:	So your argument24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. Ms.25 Wright.10 
  2 MS . HOLDER:	Oh. I'm sorry.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Leslie wanted to4 ask.5 MS . WRIGHT:	I missed the first6 part of your testimony. I apologize. But I just7 wanted to understand.8 For those apartments that have9 tenants that have lived there for ten or more10 years that have these low rents - -11 MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	My rent12 stabilized tenants do not move, nor would I,13 because I'm a great landlord. I fix everything and14 they have great living conditions and their rents15 are nothing.16 MS. WRIGHT:	Okay. May I ask my17 question now, please?18 MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	Yes.19 MS. WRIGHT:	The question is for20 those tenants that have been there for ten or more21 years, do you charge them the maximum legal rent22 or do they receive preferential rents?23 MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	Some of them24 get preferential rent which, if their is rent $836 252 
2 MS. WRIGHT:	Could you tell me how3 many apartments receive preferential rents or pay4 preferential rents?5 MR . ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	Probably -- I6 had a fire about 15 years so I gave some tenants a7 preferential rate 15 years ago .	So if their legal8 rent is $936, their preferential rate may be like9 $906. It's not a big deal to me and I still keep10 it at the preferential rate when I raise by the11 new increases .12 So the preferential rate issue to me13 is a non-factor. I don't understand your question14 about preferential rate. Why is that important?15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, the16 question is whether - - or the reason it's17 important is we only can do a certain thing.	If18 you can't get the preferential rate, and what19 you 1 re testifying to is you probably could for the20 $30, but it's only $30 and you're keeping it21 there.22 MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	Right.	So I23 don't argue.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So that's - - but25 that's the relevance of the questions.	Because2 
2 there are areas where we're not the issue even3 though --4	MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	No, that's5	not - - the preferential rate is not an issue.6	MS . HOLDER:	I'm sorry.	I just7 want to understand your testimony.8 So you're telling us -- and I9 appreciate you coming in today and talking about10 your buildings.	So you have 65 units in three11 buildings in the East Village and you're saying12 that you do make money because you're a good13 businessman and you keep your buildings going.14 MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	Whether I15 make good money or not is not the issue.	The16 issue --17 (Audience participation.)18 MR . ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	That's not19 the issue.	That's not - - I'm entitled to make a20 profit. I am not the government.	I am not21 providing local income housing and subsidizing the22 Welfare system in this country.	Why should I have23 a tenant that lives on food stamps. Why should I24 be subsidizing that?	I own the property, not the25 government . Let the government deal with those7 
2 people.3 My books, my issues, yes because I4 have no debt on the property.	Ido make money.5 But that's not the issue.	So your question to me6 is stupid.7 MS. HOLDER:	I'm just trying to8 figure out - - I'm just trying to figure where9 you're coming from .10 So you're saying that you want - -11 MR . ALLEN WEINSTEIN :	What I am12 saying - and listen clearly - Iam saying that the13 low rents below $800, below $1,000 for a14 two-bedroom, there needs to be a fair and market15 rent set.	And I want a special bump-up for those16 rents.	I am not saying to get rid of rent17 stabilized apartments . But you need to look at18 these apartments that are going for $2,500 and19 these tenants are paying $700 and living at houses20 in the Hamptons for the summer. That is not right.21 MS. HOLDER:	But they would argue22 that the same benefit that they're getting23 MR . ALLEN WEINSTEIN :	No.	They24 wouldn't argue25 MS. HOLDER :	They would argue that2 
2 the same benefits that they're getting is what3 they've been able to command because they got into4 the market and got into a rent regulated apartment5 and so that's their little --6	MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	Right. Then7 I can make an argument why rent stabilization8 shouldn't even occur.	The reason it was designed9 was after World War II.	I don't even want to go10 there, but we get to deal with the cards we are11 dealt and we've got to address the situations12 right.13 MS. HOLDER:	So your issue with14 apartments is that rents over $800 is that you15 don't need an increase on those apartments?16 MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	No, I do need17 an increase.	But when you get over $1,00018 look, if I have an apartment that's $1,200 and on19 rent stabilization, and it's a studio and I can20 get $1,400 or $1,500, I'm not going to sweat the21 $300 a month. My issue is the apartments that are22 $850 that are two-bedrooms. You need to23 differentiate the apartments.24 You're talking about studios,25 one-bedrooms or two-bedrooms. I'm talking about7 
2 two-bedroom apartments that are going for $8503 that could fetch up in excess of $3,000. That's a4 lot. You want to talk about property taxes have5 doubled in the last ten years. Water taxes6 water has just gone up eleven and change, water7 and sewer.8 You know, I agree that there needs9 to be guidelines set so landlords cannot gouge but10 there has to be a fair and reasonable rate.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You're12 advocating what - - just to be clear, what the13 owners have said which is, I think it's called a14 low rent adjustment or something like that.15 MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	That is what16 you guys you need to look at this year and the low17 rent increases.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Just a quick20 question on this.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure. Mr .22 Schleider.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Would you consider24 then this spread from these - - let's call it what25 they are, subsidized rent stabilized rents, the2 
2 market rents.	Would you consider that spread a3 phantom income to these tenants that may  be4 subject to income tax?5 MR. ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	Yes.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Just asking.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No.	Let's go.8 There's a new one.	There's a new issue .	I'd9 never thought there would be a new issue. Now10 there is a new issue, phantom income.11 MS . HOLDER:	Phantom income.12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank you.14 Matt Shotkin;15 Followed by William Stanford, Jr.16 Followed by Lynn Vaag, V-a-a- g; and17 Then followed by Sid Miller.18 Mr . Shotkin.	Thank you.19 MR . MATT SHOTKIN:	Thank you .20 Good afternoon, ladies and21 gentlemen.	My name's Matt Shotkin and I live in22 an 18-story building that has 180 units which is23 located at 307 East 44th Street24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	A little slower.25 A little slower .8 
2	MS. ADAMS:	And louder.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And louder .4 MR. MATT SHOTKIN:	between First5 and Second Avenues.6 And I'm a little tired of having to7 come before Marvin Markup Markus and the Chairman8 of the Rent Guidelines Board.9 (Audience participation.)10 MR. MATT SHOTKIN:	And just11 thinking that my -- my apartment is  rent12 controlled.	And I live right around the edge of13 Stuyvesant Town here in Manhattan. I think that14 Stuyvesant is not too affordable.	The rent for15 certain people is too high. We need code16 enforcements .17 Also, landlords are exploiting18 loopholes .	This shouldn 't be happening. Also19 certain provisions need to put into place in order20 to prevent people from losing their homes.21 The reason why I was late was that I22 was just at an expansion of parity with SCRIE,23 with DRIE press conference on the steps of City24 Hall which was just scheduled at the end of  last25 week. And I didn't actually speak at the press4 
2 conference, but Oliver Koppell gave some very3 enlightening words about the fact that the Mayor4 shouldn't actually be blocking DRIE or SCRIE.5 Also, rent freezes have to be6 prevented and co-op and condo prices are way too7 high. This also isn't right. People who are8 homeless need homes.9	I'd appreciate both the City and the10 Mayor's cooperation in this matter.11 Thank you very much.12 Questions?13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 Any questions?15 MS. HOLDER:	No.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No questions.17 Thank you, Mr. Shotkin.18 Mr. Stanford, how are you doing this19 year?20 MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:	What happened21 here on May 7th was despicable.	You forced us to22 go for a damn metal	a five-point security23 check. I thought I was at 347 Madison Avenue. Is24 this some kind of joke?	These idiot told us we25 brought noisemakers here in 2000, I don't recall10 
2 that.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, then you4 must not have been here.5	MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:	I recall6 I recall what you did. I recall you treating7 Adriene like an ex-girlfriend. I recall that. I8 blasted you about your behavior . That's what I9 recall. I recall you and her - - you got into a10 cuss fight with a former executive director at 2211 Reade Street.12 I also heard Michelle Bloomberg was13 looking to drop you for that reason and you're14 still here, which is outrageous.	It's time for15 you to go. And I believe - - I'm going tell the16 same thing I told you in 2006, you're worse than17 Peter Kalikow, okay. You're a bigger pimp than18 Peter Kalikow.19 (Audience participation .)20 MR. WILLIAM STANFORD :	You got to21 go, okay . I'm going to tell you the same thing I22 told Peter Kalikow, good-bye and good riddance and23 it's time for you to get the hell out of there.24 You and Peter Kalikow should join25 forces together . You can pass for the odd couple.6 
2 The odd ball couple I should say.3 I'm also glad we didn't have to go4 through a damn five-point security check here today5 because I honestly thought we had to go through6 another today and I sure as hell hope we don't7 have to go through another two weeks from today.8 Because there's no need for a five-point security9 check.	That wasn't necessary.10 And as far as rent increase go, you11 don't need a rent increase. After that	all12 these problems that are going on here, we don't13 need more rent increases. It's ridiculous, okay.14 This nonsense has to stop.15 Tenants are paying -- shelling more16 out for rent, but they're not - - they're not17 getting repairs, necessary repairs they need, no.18 These landlords need to open their books,  I'm19 sorry.20 If they want a rent increase,  they21 need to open their books. We told the MTA22 officials the same thing, you need to open your23 books before you ask us to pay you	pay extra24 money for transportation is ridiculous, okay.25 And Andy McLaughlin, okay -- oh, the2 
2 first meeting, I didn't attend the first meeting3 which you had on March 27th. I put my name, my4 information on your 2000 mailing list and yet  you5 never told me, never mentioned the March 27th6 forum to	me. There's no excuse for that.7 And when I spoke to Andy McLaughlin,8 who is out there, he said you don't have a mailing9 list. Is there any particular reason why you don't10 have a mailing list? I don't understand it. You11 should have a mailing list. I should have been12 informed about that forum. There's no excuse for13 that. There really isn't. I sure hope you - - I14 hope you inform us about all the forums, all the15 2008 forums because I gave my information again16 this year. There's no excuse for that. There17 really isn't.	Every year I'm the mailing list and18 if he can't do it, then he needs to go too . It's19 getting ridiculous.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .21 MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:	And Marvin,22 I'm getting fed up with your childish behavior,23 your sloppy character and you're off-the-wall mood24 swings.	It's getting ridiculous.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 
1	2212	Lynn Vaag, please;3 Followed by Sid Miller;4 Followed by Richard Barr.5 MS. ADAMS:	What number is that?6		CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Lynn Vaag is No. 7	25.8	MS. LYNN VAAG:	Hi. I'm not a9	tenant advocate really.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That's okay.11	MS. LYNN VAAG:	I'm not really a12 tenant -- can you hear me? What do we do here? Can13 you hear me?14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.15 MS. LYNN VAAG:	I'm not really a16 tenant advocate, I'm more of a gardener.17 The last seven weeks I - -18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You're more of a19 what?20 MS. HOLDER:	A what?21 MS. LYNN VAAG:	I'm a gardener.22 I've been digging, making a garden for my23 community like really working very hard the last24 seven weeks. I'm a New Yorker. I'm rent25 stabilized. I'm one of those awful rent stabilized12 
2 tenants. But a lot of us do care a lot about our3 City. And a lot of us - - I mean I wonder what the4 future vision you have for New York City is. You5 want to make it into another Paris. You want it to6 be just a city of the rich and it will be a city7 of the rich and the homeless.8 I think you really need the middle9 class in New York City. Usually I do work as an10 advocate for disabled people and I've noticed with11 elderly people a lot there's quite a problem with12 landlords harassing them .13 I have two elderly people who lived14 in my apartment building for years and I really15 think that their deaths were hastened by the16 constant stress they lived under . It's a17 non-eviction co-op which basically means, you18 know, like 18 -- like having 18 landlords  ganging19 up on you, having it be part of their business20 plan to harass you out of the apartment.21 I was offered a buyout, a buyout of22 $5,000 for my apartment in SoHo, with the bathtub23 in the kitchen. Five thousand dollars is a way of24 saying we're going to harass you out of this25 apartment. I became so ill from the harassment I2 
2 developed a thyroid ailment and went down to 1023 pounds.4 But as you can see I'm back at my5 fighting weight now, you know. I'm not -- but I6 see that the most vulnerable people, the elderly7 people and the disabled people that there are laws8 against harassing them, but those laws have9 absolutely no teeth. And I mean I'm honest about10 it.11 I wish people -- I wish people who12 testified here -- I find the whole hearing so13 bizarre. People who testify here, I wish they had14 to take an oath . Because I've been listening all15 morning to all of these people who own real estate16 who talk about what a horrible thing it is and how17 terrible it is about rent stabilization.18 If you're going to invest money in a19 business, you should research it thoroughly.20 (Audience participation.)21 MS. LYNN VAAG:	I mean maybe, you22 know, find out.	There are these laws in New York23 City and people will be living in the apartment.24 That guy's talking about how he can make money.25 Oh, there's a little problem, there are people2 
2 living in those apartment.	What are we going to3 do with them, exterminate them, you know?4 I mean real estate is like the5 cornerstone of the New York City economy, isn't6 it? And because of that people like me are7 second-class citizens .8 Oh, you're so lucky to live in a9 rent stabilized apartment. Am I? Am I lucky to10 really damage my health, lose a half inch of my11 height, suffer bone loss, go down to 102 pounds,12 almost die.	I mean the only thing that kept me13 from getting evicted was my father came through14 and paid the back rent. I was too ill to work.15 And I think it's the people who are16 the most vulnerable that the landlords are17 targeting and are succeeding in making homeless. I18 grew up in this City. I'm a fifth generation New19 Yorker.	I mean there were no homeless people in20 the horrible 70's when I grew up, only Bowery21 Bums.	Now there's homeless people all over.	More22 and more middle class people are becoming23 homeless.24 And since I've been working on the25 garden, a lot of - - I've become aware of2 
2 something. I lot of people that I've seen around3 the neighborhood that I haven't spoken to say to4 me, oh, I'll give you some money -- I've started5 from seed and now I have plants.	But they'll say6 to me I'll give you some money when I get my7 check.	And I had no idea that all these seemingly8 respectable, prosperous people were living9	hand-to-mouth like that .10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 MS. HOLDER:	Yes.	I have a12 question .13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.14 MS. HOLDER:	Excuse me. I'm sorry. I15 have a question.16 Hi.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	There's a18 question.	Stay near the mike.19 MS . LYNN VAAG:	Speak into the20 microphone, okay.21 MS. HOLDER:	How many units in your22 building?23 MS. LYNN VAAG:	Twenty-one.24 MS . HOLDER :	And how many of those25 are rent regulated, do you know?10 
2	MS. LYNN VAAG:	Two.3	MS. HOLDER:	Two?4	MS. LYNN VAAG:	Yes, two.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The rest are6 owned by the7	MS. LYNN VAAG:	Yes, they are .
89	condo .
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	the co-op or
10	MS. LYNN VAAG:	Yes.	And these are11	like nice, respectable people like, you know,12 college professors.	Professor Kearns was standing13 outside my friend Felecia Morgasi's	(phonetic)14 apartment watching the sewage pump up out of her15 sink, you know, being that she had a heart attack16 and a crippled shoulder, having sewage come out of17 the sink was very stressful.	But this person is18 so sick that they have to stand there and watch19 the show.20 I mean my friend Ed Murphy would get21 so agitated about his collapsing ceiling, he'd22 already had a triple bypass. I mean we're talking23 about harassing people.	Stress can really damage24 people's health and especially the more vulnerable25 people. And the laws against harassing people,12 
2 particularly the elderly disabled, don 1 t have3 enough teeth.	And I think that, you know, you4 should do everything you can.5 I do not believe -- I'm sorry.	I6 don 1  t believe most of the testimony I1 ve heard7 here today about how hard it is to run a building8 or I1 m making enough money.	Oh, those people are9 in the way. I mean maybe they 1  re incompetent10 business people, maybe they didn't do proper11 research before they purchased their units.12 There has been rent stabilization in13 New York City since 1945. They didn 1 t bother to14 find - - look, oh, I1 m going in there and making a15 killing?	Sorry.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	This is a co-op,17 right?18 MS. LYNN VAAG:	Yes, non-eviction19 co-op so I1 m still rent stabilized.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So the other 1921 individuals are your landlords.22 MS. LYNN VAAG:	Yes, and would23 profit by getting me out.	So it sounds paranoid24 to say they 1  re ganging up on me.	But if there are25 19 people who are business partners who could turn2 
2 a large profit from harassing someone nonstop,3 they can go into years of tag-team harassment4 ringing your bell at 3 in the morning,  destroying5 your property.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Who owns the7	shares in the two units, the - -8	MS. LYNN VAAG:	It's owned by the9 co-op board itself.	No one ever purchased the10 share.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I see.12 MS. LYNN VAAG:	So I have, you13 know, 20 people ganging up on me.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Does the  sponsor15 still own it or the - -16 MS. LYNN VAAG:	No, no.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	- -  the co-op18 board owns it.19 MS. LYNN VAAG:	The co-op board20 owns it.21 MS. HOLDER:	I really appreciate22 you coming in and telling your story.23 Thank you so much.24 MS. LYNN VAAG :	Thanks.	I really25 like you too.9

SID MILLER:	Ladies and9 gentlemen, it's about time we tell the truth. The10 truth is the high rents that the tenants are11 paying and the lack affordable apartments and  the12 lack of viable neighborhoods is a self-fulfilling13 prophecy.14 In the mid 1940s when rent control15 went from the National OPA to each state16 legislature, the state legislators up in Albany17 had a tough, tough, tough political decision to18 make . Should they do what is in the best , long19 term interest of the health of the City and state20 of New York or should they prostitute  themselves21 and do what will guarantee their own  re-election.22 Being politicians, they did what23 guaranteed their own re-election. They allowed24 national rent regulations to be passed on a state25 level .	Sixty-five years later they still haven' t9 
2 decided whether they need World War II rent3 regulations, because no politician has the guts to4 speak up and say the cause of our  housing5 problems, the cause of many of our social6 problems, the cause of our high rents was those7 legislators in the mid 1940s that first said we8 can't make a decision, we'll study the problem .9 Had they had the guts to say the10 right thing to do was to let national rent11 regulations sunset and let competition take over,12 they should have encouraged the private landlord13 to build, to develop, to put money into housing.14 If the legislature had the guts to do that, we15 would not have a housing shortage today. We would16 have many millions and millions and millions of17 low cost housing units available at all price18 levels in all neighborhoods for all people . We19 don't have that today because many of the20 neighborhoods outside of New York are not21 liveable. People don't want to live there.22 Before rent regulations, anybody23 could live anywhere in the five boroughs if they24 were willing to pay the price. If they wanted to25 live in Manhattan, they could but it would cost2 
2 more money. Those that couldn't afford it, got on3 the subway and went to Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens or4 Staten Island, lived in five-story walkups .	But5 when they got some more money, they moved to6 Pelham Parkway or Ocean Parkway in a elevator7 building . When they got more money, they bought a8 home in suburbia and achieved the American dream.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 MR . SID MILLER:	Thank you.11 (Applause. )12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Here's where13 are:	We're going to hear from Mr. Barr, No. 27 on14 the tenant side. Then we're going to hear from15 Mr. Fine, an owner rep.	And then we're going to16 hear from Anne Cunningham who's 28. And then we're17 going to go to a break for 15 .	It should be about 18	2 :00 then .19 Mr. Barr. Mr. Barr?20 A VOICE :	Here.21 (Audience participation.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is he here?	You23 are?24 A VOICE :	Twenty-nine .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Soon.19 
2 A VOICE:	I have a bus going right3 now .4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'm sorry.	No5 out of order this year.	We're not taking any6 passes, nothing.7 Mr. Barr's not here?8	(No response.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Fine .	Mr.10 Fine.11 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	My name is Arnold12 Fine.13 I have two buildings in Brooklyn.14 One, thank God I'm selling it this minute, but the15 other one --16 MS . ADAMS :	I'm sorry. You have two17 what?18 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	Two buildings in19 Brooklyn.20 A VOICE:	Could he speaker louder,21 please?22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You've got to23 speak.24 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	Hello.25 Two buildings in Brooklyn. One I'm10 
  2 selling at the moment.	The other one I still3 have, which I'll probably sell by next year.4 The rent roll in my building right5 now this year with the increases on three6 apartments of $64 on a two-year lease, $45 on a7 one-year lease, and $42 on a one-year lease which8 brings the total for this year in increase of $9699 for the year. To that $969, my taxes went from10 $5,976 last year to $6,380 this year, an increase 11	of 4.04 .12 My water and sewer bill went from13 $2,848 last year to $3,175 this year, an increase 14	of $327.15 My insurance went from $2,537 last16 year to $2,762 this year, an increase of $22517 bringing that to $956 which is almost a wash of18 the rent increases I'm getting this year. So any19 other increases that I get or any other problems20 that I have in the building comes out of my21 pocket.22 This is the increases that I'm23 getting this year and you're talking about24 granting us lower rent increases for next year.25 This is ridiculous. We can't run six-family15 
2 buildings on increases like this .	These buildings3 shouldn't even be in the rent control system. A4 ten-family building maybe, 20-family, okay, but5 not-six family, not eight-family. You cannot run a6 building with increases like this. It is7 impossible.8 I have a boiler that's 28 years old.9 It started to leak this year. Now, the guy said he10 could fix it for maybe $2,000, but if it's cracked11 on the top, he will have to replace the boiler  at12 a cost of approximately $6,000. That doesn't come13 out of the rents, that comes out of my  pocket.14 Painting, $950 for an apartment,15 okay. But if the apartment is rented and you got16 to get a painter in there, he don't want to touch17 it for under $1,200 or $1,300 because he's got to18 move the furniture, put everything back.	He don't19 want to be bothered with that. Most painters don't20 even touch it. So you either paint it yourself or21 work with the tenant to paint it or get a painter22 in there.23 This is all expenses that come out24 of my pocket.	On a six-family house, rent25 regulation is a joke. You can't run a building2 
2 like that and that is why I am finally getting rid3 of them. It does not pay anymore.4 Thank you.5 (Audience participation.)6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 Ann Cunningham.8 After the break it's going to be Avi9 Siev;10 Then Paul Podhizer;11 Then Walter Gabin.12 Those will be the first three people13 after the break.14 Go ahead.	Anne Cunningham.15 MS. ANNE CUNNINGHAM:	Good16 afternoon. Good afternoon, Mr . Chairman, members17 of the Rent Guidelines Board and all those18 present.	I'm going to skip some of this.	I19 waited awhile.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet, please .21 MS. ANNE CUNNINGHAM:	I've testified22 - - I've testified -- can you hear me all?23 VOICES:	Yes.24	MS. ANNE CUNNINGHAM:	I've testified25	before this Board since 1979. Since you have heard
2 it all from me, today's testimony will be3 relatively short .4 Residential Class A and SRO's.5 The majority of the buildings in6 this category an now classified as illegal hotels .7 Four newspaper articles and three additional8 testimonies are attached to this testimony which9 outline alarmingly unsafe living conditions,10 harassment, criminal activities, non-compliance of11 housing codes and rent regulation laws, and sadly12 the loss of affordable housing.13 At the Tempo Hotel where I reside,14 an older couple who spent thirteen months living15 in the hotel, renting from WooGoo, informed me16 that they had paid over $120,000 for a single17 furnished room without hotel amenities. Their18 unregulated rates changed daily .	They were moved19 frequently from room to room and they experienced20 loss of essential services in conjunction with the21 tenants that also live there.	Therefore, I feel22 that a vote of no increase for Hotel and SRO23 tenants is very fair.24 Rent Control and Rent Stabilized25 Tenants.2 
2 Currently it appears that Rent3 Control tenants pay higher rents .	These tenants4 are older, reside in older buildings, and are5 beset with increases for MCis, MBR's - - MCRs,6 MBRs, MCis, fuel pass-along, and surcharges for7 roommates . In fact, many of these tenants are8 grossly overcharged and pay the fuel bill for the9 entire building.10 Rent stabilized rents have escalated11 beyond affordability. While many of us appreciate12 the work, presentations, data gathering, surveys,13 and much more, of the Rent Guidelines Board, I14 feel the system is not working.15 The Board needs to develop a system16 of checks and balances, force landlords to be more17 honest and accountable for their actions, and18 gather more accurate information overall .19 Vacancy decontrol statistics are not20 reported.	And in closing, there should be a21 moratorium on all rent increases until the22 millions of dollars in fines owed to the City of23 New York are paid and the thousands of violations24 are cured.25 Thank you for the pleasure of2

2 MR. AVINADAV SIEV:	Yes.3 MR . MCLAUGHLIN:	Okay.	You're up4 now and Paul you're next.5 Mr. Siev.6 MR. AVINADAV SIEV:	Okay.	My name7 is Avi - -8	MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Can you speak into9	the mike and lift it up.10 MR . AVINADAV SIEV:	Can you hear11 me now?12 Okay. My name is Avi Siev and I'm a13 partner in a building in Brooklyn, Crown Park14 Realty.15 And good afternoon, ladies and16 gentlemen.17 What I want to talk about is that18 every year you make a study.	You know what our19 expenses, you know maybe better than me what is20 the average increase in cost of running a21 building.	But, you know, one year, let's say it's22 six percent, okay.	We allow four percent so23 somehow our increases are ratcheted down if one24 year we have a good year you forgot that last year25 you didn' t give us everything, which is owed to10 
2 us, but you give us again a little less.	And it3 accumulates.	And during few years suddenly we are4 much behind.5 And this reminds me of a joke about6 a farmer who tried to have his horse learn how to7 eat less and less and become a better dog8 better horse.	And finally when the horse learned9 how not to eat, then suddenly he died and the10 farmer said, oh, such a good horse.	Now that he11 became such good, he died.12 So that's the situation with us. And13 what happens is that you are creating a system14 where there are two tiers of rent. There is the15 high rent and the low rent. And this abnormality16 is creating incentives for cheating and for fraud .17 Tenants, if they are old, they don't18 need anymore the big apartment. They still stay19 there.	If somebody dies, they hide it from the20 owner and they bring somebody else and they don't21 tell the owner.22 Everybody thinks that the owner has23 incentive to harass the tenants. If not, he's24 stupid, what he can get so much money for the25 apartment and he doesn 't do it.2 
1	2412 The judges have the conception that3 if somebody has an apartment, he has a bargain.4 You cannot evict even if he commits the worst5 crimes in the world and I had some cases like6 this.7 So what - - and this is not even a8 just system because the people who pay less are9 not necessarily the poor. The people who pay high10 rent are not necessarily rich. And it's just11 somehow keeping -- keeping two tiers and without12 any justification .13 The main problem which I wanted to14 mention here is the problem with the courts of15 this abnormality.	And we have a lot of problems16 because judges, whatever happens, they will not17 evict tenant. This cost us money and this cause us18 problems and causes problems also to other  tenants19 because sometimes there is a tenant who doesn1 t20 behave and then the whole building is suffering21 and nothing can be done.22 Okay.23 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Okay.	Thank you24 very much.25 Any questions?
12422(Noresponse.)3MR.AVINADVA SIEV:Finished in4time.5MR.MCLAUGHLIN:No questions?6Okay.7Mr.Paul Podhizer.8	(Audience participation.)9	MR. PAUL PODHIZER:	My name is Paul10 Podhizer.	I'm Chairman of the Bright Water Towers11 Tenants Council, as well as representing over 90012 renters living in 2940 and 3000 Ocean Parkway,13 formerly owned by Trump and sold realizing a14 multi-million dollar profit.15 Today I will not bore you with16 income and expenses statistics.	I am more17 concerned with the fact that New York City is18 facing serious safety problems that are the  result19 of lack of affordable housing.20 The World Trade Center destruction,21 9/11, and the recent foiled plot to bomb Kennedy22 Airport illustrates that New York City is a23 terrorist prime target. The individuals who24 responded to these emergencies were the Police,25 Firemen, EMS, transit workers, teachers, health10 
2 care workers, and the other average New Yorkers -3 all have one characteristic in common, they are4 the middle income renter's class, the solid5 backbone of New York City, the only element New6 York City cannot afford to lose.7 The past years overstated Rent8 Guidelines Board increases have resulted in the9 loss of thousands of apartments that were occupied10 by and could have been available to these11 essential individuals who provide New York City12 with the quality of life we deserve. Remember,13 these people are not only numbers, they are your14 neighbors, your friends, baby sitters, et cetera,15 and give us the personal security.16 Therefore, you as Board members have17 the civic responsibility and obligation at this18 vital time to ensure the continuous availability19 of affordable housing. I am hoping that you will20 do all you can so that the essential work, as21 cited above, as well as other civil servants, are22 not forced to leave New York City.	This could23 result in dangerous potential consequences that24 will destroy property and harm people.25 Let me add, a Cooper Union college2 
2 professor advised me that New York City is losing3 our graduate engineers, architects, scientists,4 due to the lack of affordable housing. The City5 cannot afford this loss. I remind you that you are6 a body, public body. Your decision should reflect7 what is best for the future of New York City.8 You have to decide, an increase for9 the landlords that they can live without or saving10 affordable housing.	Which is more important.11 One other thing I'd like to point12 out.13 My building alone, which was formed14 with the first building that went out of15 Mitchell -Lama, rent stabilized, formerly 73616 apartments.	We only have 180 rent stabilized17 tenants left.	So you can imagine what's going on18 throughout the City and what has to be considered.19 Thank you very much for your time.20 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question .21 (Applau se.)22 MS. HOLDER:	I appreciate your23 testimony and thank you.24 I know that you have - - your folks25 who had to leave.2 
1	2452	MR. PAUL PODHIZER:	That's right.3	MS. HOLDER:	I see you, Paul every4 year and you come and you testify before the Board5 and I also understand how despondent so many of6 the folks that you work with are about this whole7 process.8 Why is it that you continue and9 folks continue to come every year to testify10 before this Board?11 MR. PAUL PODHIZER:	Well, I think12 I'm a realist, Ms. Holder.	And there's pressure13 that comes across in this country.	We are14 fighting - - you know, Marty Markowitz, our Borough15 President, once remarked that if the tenants would16 form their own club instead of Democrats and17 Republicans and have a tenants association, we18 wouldn't be sitting here like this. The19 legislators would take care of us.20 Unfortunately, the tenants  fight21 money. You people sit up there. I admire you for22 taking this job.	It's a public service.	No23 matter what you do you're going to be wrong either24 way, because its a very, very difficult situation25 that you're in.4 
2 If we don't stay organized, and we3 don't plead to you and bring up points to you,4 tell you what our condition is, it may be less5 pressure on you, less realization of what's going6 on.  We get frustrated.	Mr. Markus' best7 girlfriend that invited him for dinner doesn't8 want to come anymore because she's frustrated.9 She comes and figures that it's hopeless.10 Everything is prescribed. You've made a decision11 what you're going to do.12 What's the use of coming over here.13 But some of us are fighters. Some of us don 't give14 up. Some of us represent some people who need the15 help that a guy like me can give them. I'm willing16 to give the help. I was brought up that way. And I17 will continue to do as much as I can. But I know I18 live in a realistic world. We're fighting money.19 We're fighting everything that goes along so we20 will do our little bit in the hope that you people21 see two sides of the coin and do the best you can22 that your body is prescribed to do.23 Legislatively I know that you cannot24 do a lot of things but in consideration of in the25 past, the rent increases that were given should2 
2 not have been that high.3 So I thank you for your time and4 this is my reason.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'm a little6 confused about, you said there were almost 8007 units and now it's 176 .8	MR. PAUL PODHIZER:	That's right .9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The rest of them10 have been destabilized or they've condo or co-op?11 MR . PAUL PODHIZER :	No.	What12 happened was as the first building out of13 Mitchell-Lama  was 736 rent stabilized apartments .14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.15 MR. PAUL PODHIZER:	It became a16 condo, a non-eviction condo . There's 180 still17 left that either didn't have the bucks or weren't18 smart enough to buy. It's as simple as that.19 But as long as - -20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I just wanted to21 make it clear, it 's not because they've been22 destabilized because of the $2,000.23 MR . PAUL PODHIZER:	No .24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It's a condo.25 MR . PAUL PODHIZER :	We're hoping10 
1	2482 that thing doesn't happen.	This is what we hope3 getting from you to lift the vacancy decontrol,  to4 take that into consideration, to keep more5 apartments in rent stabilization.6 I'm concerned with safety.	I have a7 family.	I have children and everything. And you8 should be concerned with the same thing because a9 bomb doesn't know the difference between a10 landlord and a tenant so that -- let me leave.11 And I thank you for your time .12 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you so much.13 (Applause.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .15 Walter Gambin.16 MR. HERBERT ROCK:	Can I speak?17 Look, I have to go home. Can I just say one thing?18 I just want to say a prayer for you people.19 I'm a Jewish boy and I want to say20 Kaddish, Kaddish because when everybody come in,21 it speaks for the dead. I think you people are22 speaking to dead people.	Get up alive, get alive.23 Give the tenants the break. And that's all I have24 to say. I have one more prayer. I have another25 Jewish word that says, Chub Rachmones, have  pity2 
2 on the tenants of New York.3 Thank you very much.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you.5 (Applause.)6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You're from7 Bright Water also, right?	Yes.8 Go ahead.	Mr. Gambin, hold on one9	second. You're going to go.10 Followed by Ellen Davidson;11 Followed by Tina Berte;12 Followed by Jose Jorge.13 Go ahead, Mr. Gambin .14 MR. WALTER GAMBIN:	Hello.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hi. How you16 doing?17 MR. WALTER GAMBIN:	My name is18 Walter Gambin.	I live at the Dexter House, a19 Class A section 248 at 345 West 86th Street,20 Manhattan, with about 250 rooms.21 Management there is illegally trying22 to change the building to a tourist hotel and also23 is now renting to students at rents which are24 more, by far, than the legal rates for their25 rooms.10 
2 For these reasons I say my landlord3 deserves no rent increase.	And I'd also say keep4 the 80 percent rent stabilized tenant's proviso in5 place.6 I am designated as disabled with a7 serious heart condition and live on the8 combination of Social Security retirement benefits9 and SSI.	Increasing my rent would make10 necessities harder to afford.11	Now, I want to say something about a12 larger picture. And I do believe that this13 probably applies somewhat more to the larger14 landlords in one of whose building I live and15 perhaps a little less to some of the smaller16 landlords, because they make a little better17 impression on me and I refuse to be categorical18 and biased against all landlords .19 Although I have to say that I think20 a lot of landlords, a pretty high percentage in my21 view, based on what I've learned, who do too many22 dirty things. I know it's like ramming my head23 into a concrete wall to try to get something24 meaningful across to landlords and real estate25 investors who are striving for wealth .12 
  2 Their activities competing - - I'm3 sorry. Their activities competing for wealth,4 often immoral and often illegal, are  destructive5 to the social makeup of our City and our country.6 And I am still an American actually even though7 I've had some difficult feelings about that  at8 times.9 So let me ask then, can't you just10 take your profits at this point, enjoy them and11 let the low and middle income people have what12 they need while you finally discontinue what is13 nearly an economic warfare against them. Don't you14 have enough?15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me ask you.16 (Applause.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	On the - - if I18 recall correctly, where you live is subject to the19 proviso therefore your rent does not go up;  is20 that correct?21 MR. WALTER GAMBIN:	I'm sorry.	I 2223 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is your building24 subject to the proviso?25 MR. WALTER GAMBIN:	That's right.23 
2 Eighty percent have to be occupied by rent3 stabilized tenants for the landlord to be eligible4 for any rent increase.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So that this6 Board has been responsive to your concerns over7	the last five years?8	MR. WALTER GAMBIN:	In that9	respect keeping a proviso, yes, in that respect.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Has your rent11 gone up because - - your rent has not gone up12 because of the proviso; is that  correct?13 MR. WALTER GAMBIN:	I think it was14 - - maybe it was 2003 that the rent last went up.15 I'm not clear on that.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That was one or17 two percent.18 MR. WALTER GAMBIN:	It was not quite19 five years ago. I think it was more like three or20 four.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank you.22 Okay. Thank you.23 MR. WALTER GAMBIN:	Okay. Thank you.24 MR.

We represent10 people who are making minimum wage, if that, and11 for whom any increase means that they cannot12 afford to pay for necessities, they cannot afford13 to pay for things that they need for their14 families and their children .15 I urge this Board to not have an16 increase this year in these rents.	We are facing17 an affordability crisis in New York.	We are18 losing more and more Mitchell-Lamas. We are losing19 project-based Section 8.	We are losing vouchers.20 Recently, the New York City Housing21 Authority opened up its waiting list for vouchers.22 They have about 22,000 and over 4,000 families23 applied for vouchers because they cannot afford to24 live where they live.25 We -- increasingly, people have no2 
1	2552 other options. If they live in rent stabilized3 housing, that's as safe and secure as they can be.4 They have no - - there's no other affordable5 housing in New York.	While it is true that New6 York City has been building what they term7 "affordable housing," there has certainly been8 testimony by the Commissioner that that means two9 people who earn over $100,000.	That's what this10 affordable is targeted for.11 There was an article in The Times12 recently that talked about how New York City  is13 building all this affordable housing yet noted14 that they cannot even begin to replace the amount15 of affordable housing we have lost over the last16 number of years.17 And I	this crisis is real. And18 there is nowhere for my clients to go. They have19 no options. They are already doubled up. They are20 already overcrowded.	They are already families of21 four and five living in studios. And with this22 increase they will have very little options left23 for them.24 And so I urge this Board to take25 into consideration for the clients of the Legal2 
2 Aid and the Legal Services of New York when making3 your decision this year .4 Thank you.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6	Any questions?7	MS. HOLDER :	Yes .	I have a8 question.9 In the interest of full disclosure,10 Ellen Davidson works for me.11	MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	I do.12 MS. HOLDER:	So but I1  m going to13 ask you, Ellen, I know you14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Have you15 enjoyed working with her or what?16 (Laughter.)17 MR . SCHLEIDER:	You're under18 oath.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You don't have to20 comment.21 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	It is the22 greatest joy in my - - it is the greatest joy in my23 life to work with Adriene Holder.24 MS. HOLDER :	I'm a good boss,25 Marvin .12 
2	MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	She is.3	MS. HOLDER:	So Ellen, you started4 your career with us in the Bronx Neighborhood5 office and now Ellen works in our Law Reform Unit6 at the Legal Aid Society which is a citywide unit7 working on affirmative litigation.8 Ellen, when you were up in the Bronx9 - - because of a lot of the testimony that we hear10 from the landlord, the landlords and the landlord11 associations, usually goes to the idea that12 outside of core Manhattan is where you actually13 have much lower rents and where you actually have14 much more affordable apartments for people to go15 into and that the issue really has to do with16 affordability in core Manhattan.17 Could you tell us based off of your18 practice in the Bronx, through Housing Court and19 through tenant organizing, what it is that you see20 are the going rents for available apartments in21 the Bronx, and also what the tension was in22 Housing Court on issues about affordability with23 tenants.24 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	Right.25 I worked as a landlord/tenant4 
2 attorney representing tenants in Housing Court3 from 2001 through 2006 . And it's not that when I4 started in 2001 that rents were affordable to poor5 people, but it was a struggle for them.6 But in the time that I was in the7 Bronx, the rents increased exponentially .	A lot8 of it had to do with the fact that people couldn't9 afford their housing . There was a lot of moving10 around . People were becoming homeless. And then11 there was the 20 percent increases, vacancy12 increases that the landlords were able to take13 each and every time.14 While it was very - - in the15 beginning if you had a client that had to move16 that was unable to stay for one reason or another,17 there was an opportunity that they might be able18 to find an apartment they could afford. By the19 time I left in 2006 in there was probably no20 neighborhoods in the Bronx that were affordable to21 poor people at all.22 MS . HOLDER:	And you're saying in23 terms of vacant apartments that people can move24 into?25 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	Yeah. There2 
2 were no - - yes. There were no vacant apartments3 that were affordable.	The Bronx -- I think people4 in the other boroughs seem to think that the Bronx5 is the place where you can send poor people to6 find affordable apartments and it's just not true .7 There's no longer affordable8 apartments anywhere in New York. And even the9 rent stabilized stock was, I don't know, $1,200,10 $1,400 for a one-bedroom. And that was - - that was11 not unusual at all.12 MS. HOLDER:	In the Bronx.13 MS . ELLEN DAVIDSON:	In the Bronx.14 MS. HOLDER:	And when you think15 about all the initiatives and things that we work16 on as advocates for tenants here in New York City17 I know there's been a lot of conversation from18 folks on this Board as well as people who we come19 into contact with during this season - - people20 always wonder what it is that the housing21 advocates or the tenant advocates and the22 organizers are actually doing to try to stave  off23 this crisis and to perhaps maintain or preserve24 the affordable housing stock.25 Can you go into some of the things2 
2 that you work on in coalition, as well as some of3 the other things that you know are going on in the4 City and in the state.5 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	Sure.6	I work - - I'm in the Law Reform Unit7 now.	And one of the things I'm tasked with is8 working on the Mitchell- Lama buyouts, the9 project-based Section 8, both buyouts and what we10 call bailouts, buildings that are in such bad11 condition that HUD will no longer deal with them12 and also dealing with people who have Section 813 vouchers and are having problems with that.14 And certainly in fighting the loss15 of the subsidized housing stock, I work very16 closely with both community based organization,17 LSNY, obviously, as well some citywide18 organizations such as Tenants & Neighbors and19 UHAV, as we fight each and every one of the20 potential buyouts that go across the City .21 We do that through legal means and22 we do that through trying to use  political23 pressure and other sorts of - - trying to find24 preservation purchasers for these buildings so25 that the owners can take their money and go and7 
2 yet the buildings can be preserved as affordable3 housing.4 And we work - - and we try to find5 a lot of the times what we're trying to do is6 trying to get the owners to actually play by the7 rules .	I mean a lot of these people, especially8 when you're talking about the affordable housing9 and the Mitchell-Lama buildings, the owners got10 their property in which they built the buildings11 through Urban Renewal plans.	And a lot of them12 signed agreements, land disposition agreements13 saying that for a certain amount of time 30, 40,14 50 years, these buildings would be maintained as15 affordable. And then years went by and they  hoped16 that no one would notice that these - - that these17 LDA's had been signed.18 And we've lost some buildings19 because we were not able to find out early enough20 where the owners were not allowed to opt out.  And21 the City, who signed the agreement, was supposed22 to keep these buildings in and yet the owners took23 them out anyway.24 So we are trying to get as much25 information to go out early enough to work with2 
2 organizing tenants early enough so that we can3 save this housing. But it's not easy. And there's4 not a lot of -- we have to be very creative with5 the tools that we have out there to save this type6 of housing.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Has there been8 any lawsuits on the LDAs?9 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	Yes .10 Actually --11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And what has12 happened in the case?13 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	The - - well,14 the buildings that prepaid their mortgage that15 weren't allowed to, there's not much you can do16 once the genie is out of the bottle you can't put17 it back in.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.19 MS . ELLEN DAVIDSON:	But in a20 building in Brooklyn called Tivoli Towers, HPD21 actually figured out that there was this LDA and22 brought a lawsuit.	I'm sorry, said that the owner23 could not -- the owner brought a lawsuit against24 HPD saying that they should be allowed to buy out25 because it's a Mitchell-L ama and forget any12 
2 agreement they signed way back when.3 And as of this date there was a4 decision from the judge saying that LDA  holds.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The supreme6 Court.7 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON :	Supreme8 Court. And the owner's appealing.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The owners have10 appealed or not?11 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	The owner is12 appealing.13 But I'll say that that LDA was the14 same LDA that was in, I think Bruckner Towers in15 the Bronx and that building bought out, as well  as16 another building in the Bronx that bought out.17 So we try to cover the City in18 looking to see any opportunities we have to19 preserve affordable housing. I actually think it20 costs less money to preserve the affordable21 housing we have now than to build all this new22 housing that the City is building - again,  there's23 the argument about whether or not it's actually24 affordable.25 But putting that aside, they are6 
2 building housing and there are all these3 opportunities.	Some opportunities have been lost4 but we are trying to get in there and fight. But5 the truth of the matter is there's very little6 place for my clients to live in New York City7 anymore and there's nowhere for them to go because8 the suburbs aren't any easier.9 MS. CRUZ:	When the buildings are10 bought out of the Mitchell-Lama program, do they11 become condominiums in your experience or do they12 go into market rate apartments?	What is it13 exactly that you mean by the consequences of a14 buyout ?15 MS . ELLEN DAVIDSON:	Well, I mean16 let's -- their consequences depend on what type of17 Mitchell-Lama you're talking about . If it's a18 co-op, a Mitchell-Lama co-op, it's going to go to19 a market rate co-op.20 If - -21 MS. CRUZ:	Only if it was built22 though after 1974; is that correct?23 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	If it's a24 Mitchell-Lama co-op, it's going	when they buy25 out, they remain a co-op but at market rate.2 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	But there3 haven't been very many of those at all.4 MS . ELLEN DAVIDSON:	Actually5 they're starting to increase.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right .7 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	There are at8 least - - I think Cadman Plaza, which is hundreds9	and hundreds of units which is looking into buying10 out. There are a number - - hundreds - - a lot of11 buildings with hundreds and hundreds of units that12 are Mitchell-Lama coop are starting to go into  the13 process of buying out .14 Up until now there hasn't been as15 much, but we're about to have an avalanche.16 MS . CRUZ:	However, however, is it17 true that the tenants in occupancy would be able18 to purchase their apartments at a preferential - -19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No, no. In the20 coop they just say coop and the limitation on21 sales proceeds is eliminated and they can sell it.22	MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON :	The problem23 is with a lot of those buildings, the ones that24 have gone to co-op, what has been found is  yes,25 they get to continue to own their buildings, but23 
2 they can't afford the maintenance so they lose3 their homes.4 They're able to sell it, but they no5 longer have their home that they've lived in for6 many years. And we've lost an affordable housing7 - - we've lost affordable housing in New York so8 anybody who comes into New York who was like these9 tenants to begin with, can no longer find that10 housing. That housing isn't there .11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well , let's just12 be clear. The reason they can't afford the13 maintenance is it goes to full taxes and other14 things. It's not because that the building was15 necessarily under-maintained. It's just that they16 now have certain subsidies that have been removed.17 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON :	Right.18 As to the rentals , there's the19 pre- '74 and the post- '74.	The pre-' 74 are rent20 regulated. Each and every owner applies for  Unique21 and Peculiar increases and claims that they have22 the right to get increases of two to 300 percent23 under the rent regulations. Those buildings, with24 200 to 300 percent increase, not affordable.25 MS. CRUZ:	But let me just stop2 
2 you right there.3 Is DHCR granting 200 and 300 percent4 increases in peculiar applications?5 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	At this6 moment DHCR has no policy.	What has been7 happening is that there has been a lot of	as I8 understand it from people who are in tenant9 associations, there have been a lot of "you better10 make an agreement with your owner or you're going11 to end up with 200 to 300 rent increases ."12 Conversation coming from people who work with13 for DHCR .14 MS. CRUZ:	But, in fact, DHCR has15 not issued those kinds of orders; is that  true?16 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	Yes.	You're17 right, they have not issued those orders. But when18 DHCR themselves is saying to you we will issue19 those orders if you do not make an agreement with20 your owner, I don't know what you would - - how you21 can advise a tenant association not to make an22 agreement.23 You're right, there's a difference24 between a DHCR - - someone high up at DHCR  coming25 and saying to a tenant association we will make8 
2 these increases even though there's no policy in3 place versus actually having a policy in place . I4 mean it's the same result .5 When a - - and there are - - there are6 requests in DHCR at the moment .	They haven't made7 any decisions recently, for huge increases.8 For the post- '74's, those - - there's9 - - I mean it's a post-'74 building in New York10 City, for those tenants they have no right. They11 have no right to remain . They have no right to --12 they have no right to remain . They have no right13 at all and they have to go.14 And again	I mean yes, it's great15 when we're talking about the current tenants in16 place, but the question was are we losing17 affordable housing? When these buildings leave the18 affordable housing programs, we lose the amount  of19 affordable housing we have in New York City.20 MS. CRUZ:	Let me ask you a21 question about the preferential rent issue.22 There's been some testimony here of23 property owners that are not collecting the24 maximum legal rents because the communities in25 which their housing is located, don't have the2 
2 tenants that can afford to pay the maximum legal3 rent.4 So somehow the market is in a way5 creating a loosening of that tension of high rents6 versus the inability to pay those high rents7 because the property owners are testifying here8 that they're not even able to collect the maximum9 legal rent in some instances.10 (Audience participation.)11	MS. CRUZ:	In the Bronx, I want to12 go back to the Bronx, for example, where you13 noted, you know, the very difficult problem of low14 income tenants being able to afford the rents.15 In many of those communities, is it16 your experience that some of those tenants, maybe17 a large percentage of them were actually18 beneficiaries of preferential rents?19 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	The only20 tenants that I represented that had preferential21 rents, the only times that they were able to keep22 the preferential rents is when they had a clause23 in the beginning of the lease that said that they24 had it for the life of their tenancy.25 Other than that, every client I had12 
2 with a preferential rent lost it. I did not - - I3 do not represent any clients that had a4 preferential rent that continued while I was5 representing them.	As soon as the - -  as soon the6 change in the law happened in 2003 and before7 that, I had seen people who had preferential rents8 and those increases were based on that. But I9 didn't see -- I did not see tenants living in10 communities where there was pressure to have them11 remain as preferential rents.12 MS. CRUZ:	And my last question,13 and I don't know if you have experience in this,14 but are you familiar with the Till Program and15 HDFCs?16 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	Somewhat.17 MS. CRUZ:	How - - do you ever deal18 with that type affordable housing where tenants19 themselves have been able to acquire housing and20 then become the managers in their - - landlords of21 their buildings and how they're dealing with these22 issues?23 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	I dealt with24 quite a fuel Till buildings.	And I mean - -25 MS. CRUZ:	In terms of being able6 
2 to maintain and operating their buildings without3 increases in rent and maintaining low rents, they4 feel those struggles as well, correct?5 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	I never saw6 any difference honestly between the7 non-for-profits, the tenant-owned -- the Till8	buildings and the for-profits in terms of which9 were able to maintain their buildings in better10 conditions versus - - there was - - I didn 1  t see a11 difference in that I didn 1  t hear	and I spend a12 lot of time in Housing Court and when you spend a13 lot of time in Housing Court, you spend a lot of14 time talking to your adversaries, the tenant - -15 the landlord attorney.16 And quite frankly, I don 1 t remember17 spending a lot of time talking to the Till18 programs explaining how they had a special19 pressure on them because they couldn 1 t take20 increases.	That just was not something I21 experienced.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Quick question.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.	Mr.24 Schleider.25 MR . SCHLEIDER:	You 1  re highly9 
2 articulate and I see why you work well with3 Adriene.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Give her some5 lessons.	You 're public speaking.	We're going6 (Laughter.)7 MS. HOLDER:	No, that's not it.8 The Legal Aid Society is a formidable institution9 and just great training.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes, it is. And11 it's doing - -12 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	We're all13 raised like this.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Just a quick15 question though about the housing.	And you made16 something -- you made some comments about17 affordability.18 Could you give me your definition of19 what an affordable unit is, what affordable rent20 is.21 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	Well, I know22 that it's defined by the Federal Government as an23 affordable apartment is one where someone pays  3024 percent of their income.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Because the Bronx2 
2 has - - well, again, according the Furman3 Institute, just under half a million housing4 units, and we have about oh, a 2.6 percent vacancy5 rate which is essentially a nominal vacancy rate.6 And we have about 22 percent of the units are7 subsidized units.	And we have about 60 percent of8 the units as rent stabilized units .9 Of those units, 60 percent of10 500,000, about 300,000 units, we have a median11 rent of $775 a month, which is lower than the12 average rents that we've seen from the  Board13 material by quite a bit .	We have a median14 household income of about $27,500, all right .15 What am I missing from you argument?16 I mean yet 50 percent of the rents are less than17 the $775 a month on about 150,000 apartments.18 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	I can speak to19 what I saw as a Legal Aid attorney when people20 came to me in Housing Court .	I can't tell you why21 it is that you seem to think or you're	that22 study seems to show that the rents are so low in23 the Bronx.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Because they are.25 MS . ELLEN DAVIDSON:	I - -	all I2 
2	can say is that in Housing Court day after  day3	after day people are getting evicted because they4 can't afford their apartments.5 And the Legal Aid Society was there6 day after day.	We represented about ten percent7 of the people in Housing Court or between us and8 LSNY.	Ninety percent of the people were9	unrepresented and people got evicted because rents10 were unaffordable.11 That's what's showing up in Housing12 Court.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	It's just with14 that low a monthly median rent15 (Audience participation.)16 MS. HOLDER:	I think part of - -17 Oh. I'm sorry.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Betty.19 MS . ADAMS:	Excuse me.20 Just my rough math is that if the21 average income is $25,000 a year and the average22 rent - -23	MR. SCHLEIDER:	$27,500.24 MS. ADAMS:	is $750, by the time25 you take out taxes, Social Security and all that24 
2 other stuff , you are spending 50 percent of your3 income for a $700 place, right? Am I4 misunderstanding?5 (Audience participation.)6	MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	Then that's the7	answer.8	MS. ADAMS :	It's roughly 50 percent9	if you can get it; is that right?10 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	It sounds - -11 yes, that sounds right.12 MS. CRUZ:	But isn't it also the13 case that there are many, many tenants that have14 - - of the low income community that you represent15 that have many other problems besides the16 inability to pay or afford their housing?	It17 could be factors besides the rent.18 For all - - in many cases the rents19 are actually not that high in the buildings where20 these types of tenants are living but they HAVE21 other issues that are causing them to lose their22 homes.23 (Audience participation.)24 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	No.	I mean if25 you're talking about people who are coming to10 
2 someone like me with nonpayment of rent, the first3 thing you look at is how much income is coming in4 and what their rent is.5 In our experience, what their income6 was would not cover their rent or when it would,7 it would cover their rent, but there would be no8 emergencies in their family that would - - that9	they'd have to spend a little bit on this or that.10 They could not budget for that because so much of11 their income was going to rent.12 And sure, lots of my clients have13 other issues as well. But I've got to tell you14 that when there - - that people who are housed and15 have stabilized housing, end up having a lot less16 problems than the other problems they have than17 the people who end up being homeless. Because18 there are studies that show19 MS. HOLDER:	There are studies that20 show --21 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	their health22 issues, they're very able to deal with them when23 they have stable housing.	Children do better in24 school when they know that they're going to be25 going to the same school every day because they're10 
2 living in stable housing.3 So in my experience, which is all I4 can really talk about, the problem that my clients5 have with not being able to afford their rents was6 they couldn't afford their rents.7 MS. HOLDER:	And with all due8 respect, to just to add on that, I mean the9 unfortunate reality is that the people who10 actually make it to a Legal Services or a Legal11 Aid office unfortunately, you know, when you think12 about the population of needy New Yorkers or low13 income New Yorkers, sometimes they are still some14 of the most capable of the low income people15 because they were able to find the office, they16 were able to access the help, they were actually17 able to, you know, to tenaciously go after the18 appointment to try to get to our place.19 So you're still not necessarily20 talking about, you know, the people who truly are21 the most needy.	We often see them in the shelter22 system.	And we have another unit in the Legal Aid23 Society called the Homeless Rights Unit that then24 has to help those folks through the shelter system25 and try to make sure that they are being treated2 
2 fairly through the City shelter system.3 I mean so in all fairness, a lot of4 times we still have a level of client that has5 another sophistication to be able to have even6 been able to access - - to know about our services7 and then have the tenacity to be able to access8 them. Because we don't have as many attorneys and9 paralegals doing this work as I would like.	And10 I'm hoping that the City Council will hear that11 and they will continue to try to fund us at12 increased levels at LSNY and Legal Aid.13 The other thing that I want to ask14 you, I'm sorry, Magda, but I just wanted to get to15 because I know there's a lot of questions for16 Ellen.17 But when you think about the - - oh,18 and one last thing I will say that we do see at19 Legal Aid, because they do train us this way, that20 we also believe that a lot of times low income21 people have the same problems that anybody else22 has. It's just that a lot of middle class and23 wealthier people actually have the means in which24 to deal with them.25 (Applause.)2 
1	2792 MS. HOLDER:	And so we're all3 neighbors, we're all the same folks for the most4 part.	But support systems and financial resources5 do make a difference for a lot of people and a lot6 of us who are up on this table know that and7 that's why we're here.8 So when we look at legislative9 actions, things that are happening at the City or10 the state level of things, we'd like to see the11 Federal Government do, what are some of the things12 that housing advocates and organizers are working13 on to try to deal with the affordability crisis or14 with the preservati on issues?15 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	Sure.16 At the City Council level there's an17 Intra 61 which is a law which would - - it's a18 source of - - it's a bill outlawing source of19 discrimination - discrimination such as refusing20 people because they have Section 8 vouchers.21 There's been studies that have been showing that22 people with Section 8 vouchers have a tremendous23 trouble finding landlords willing to accept them.24 On the state level in terms of25 preservation, there are a number of initiatives at2 
2 the state at the moment.3 There is Assembly Bill 352 which was4 sponsored by Assembly Member Bing and also5 introduced by Senator Padavan into the Senate,6 which would do away with the Unique and Peculiar7 clause in the law and would close that loophole8 for pre- '73 buildings leaving the Mitchell- Lama9 program.10 There is 795 which would extend rent11 regulations to Mitchell-Lamas that are post- '7412 that are leaving the subsidized housing program.13 And I'm sure there are other that I'm  forgetting14 about . But those are the two - - the three15 initiatives that we're working on most closely.16 MS. HOLDER:	And so when you think17 about the Rent Guidelines Board, how do you think18 that we factor into the whole fabric of the things19 that are going around housing issues in New York20 City?21 MS . ELLEN DAVIDSON:	I don't think22 there's a real recognition on - - what I see in23 terms of the increases that are coming out year  by24 year, don't really show a recognition that we're25 in this affordability crisis.	The rents go up.2 
2	It seems - - they go up and they seem to get bigger3	each year.	And it's making it -- so I guess I4 don't - - I wish you would take sort of an5 acknowledgment that there's this problem and  that6 I think you are tasked with considering this7 issue. I haven 't seen that in output so.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any other9	questions?10 (No response.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 And I'm going to recommend that your13 boss give you a raise.14 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Big raise.15 (Applause.)16 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	Thank you.17 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Plus the budget.18 (Laughter & Applause.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Tina Berte,20 please.	Tina Berte, you here?	Yes, great.21 Followed by Jose Jorge; and22 Joyce Goodman.23 Go ahead .24 MS. TINA BERTE:	The Rent25 Guidelines in the City of New York are too law --10 
 2 are too low for the small landlords.3 I own a small building in the City.4 I have six tenants.	My rent roll is $3,200 a5 month.6 One -- one month during the winter I7 had a bill for heat for over $2,000.	With the8 escalating cost of water and sewer and the real9 estate taxes - which I pay $14,000 which is10 absurd.	I mean it's ridiculous.	But, you know,11 you listen to all these tenants here and oh, whoa,12 these landlords are really knocking it to them,13 really.	Why don't you come and see	why don't14 you really come and look at the other side and see15 what's going on.	The small landlords have to make16 -- have to make -- try and make it too.17 Last year my income for the year was 18	$40,000 .	My expenses were $42,000.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where's your20 building?21 MS . TINA BERTE:	3 5    Charles Street.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Charles Street?23 MS . TINA BERTE:	Right.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	In the Village?25 MS. TINA BERTE:	In the Village.19 
1	2 832 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.3 MS. TINA BERTE:	And I tried to get4 my real estate taxes lowered.	Somebody had all5 the paperwork.	I was denied because they told me6 the assessment of my building.	And then they have7 the nerve to it put down and they refused to8 correct it, and all you have to do is write9	letters. They won't let you go down and talk to10 anyone.11 And they don't - - they're telling me12 that they have - - that my income in the building13 was $76,000. $76,000? I'll show them all the14 income taxes they want.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do you live in16 the building?17 MS. TINA BERTE:	No, I don't.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Any19 additional -- thank you. 2O		(Applause.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jose Jorge;22 Joyce Goodman;23 Followed by Grace Hovey.24 Good to see you again, Mr. Jorge.25 MR. JOSE JORGE:	Thank you.21 
2	MY name is Jose Jorge.	I am - -3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Pick up the mike.4 MR. JOSE JORGE:	I am SRO hotel5 tenant.	I live in the Midway Hotel at 216 West6 lOOth Street.7 I came here today to testify against8 any rent increases, because I believe my landlord9 doesn't need it . The reason is that the building10 where I live is where working class permanent11 tenant is.12 Now, my landlord had changed the13 tenancy.	Now they convert into apartment, studio14 and only rent that to tourist and student.	And15 the - - his clientele is changing, like I says,16 tourists and a student.	No more permanent tenant .17 No more lease.	They don't need the rental law to18 do something . The rental laws doing nothing.	The19 landlord do whatever they want.20 If you call any city or state agency21 to do something, they will do nothing.	If you22 need to study harassment and everything, you need23 a lawyer . If you need a lawyer, you said lawyer,24 okay, I'm here, give me $5,000 to start a case25 against any harassment, any violations or they say5 
2 you have support it.3 And not only the tenants say that4 they have a big income, but the landlord coming5 into the area where I live every year and6 available make two, three building.	Every time it7 available building a high rise apartment is more8 harassment for us to get out, because every room9 that are available build in my neighborhood cost10 to live, one million.	One room, one million.11 And we have been tenant for 27 year.12 The tenant that I am, I working here for nothing.13 I work in the 60's. 70's. I had a work  accident14 and I am disabled.	And if you give your rent15 increase to the hotel, SRO tenant, it's a crime .16 You know that the Rent Guideline17 Board was created to protect the landlord and  the18 tenant. But now I don't think the Rent Guideline19 Board need to protect the tenant with the increase20 of the rent and they want to put everybody out.21 They only want people that came from outside to22 bring few million dollar, buy an apartment and23 that's where it go now. Only professional with24 money come to the City and the City don't build25 affordable housing for low income people.2 
2	We are trapped, and elderly and3 where I live, only five percent of all tenant - -4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap5	up, Mr. Jorge.6	MR. JOSE JORGE:	- - like myself get7 a low income.	We get only Social Security. That's8 nothing. The cost of living there is  increased,9	you understand? Not only the landlords, it's the10 cost of living here. Because the new people that11 come here and they are needy and they - - the12 services cost too much.	For it was about us that13 we were year 40 year ago.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Now, if I15 recall, you live in an apartment, in an SRO that16 is covered by the proviso?17 MR. JOSE JORGE:	No.	Ilive in18 single SRO room.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I know, but is20 your -- you said that the building has tourists21 and students.22 MR. JOSE JORGE:	Yes.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It has more than24 20 percent or less than25 Have you been paying the increase?10 
2 Has there been an increase?3 MR . JOSE JORGE:	No, I have been a4 special increase, because time for rent5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.6	MR. JOSE JORGE:	Thank you .7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 (Applause.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Joyce Goodman;10 Followed by Grace Hovey;11 Followed by Tom Church.12 And Joyce Goodman represents13 Assembly Member Daniel O'Donnell from?14 MS. JOYCE GOODMAN:	From the Upper15 West Side and16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The Upper West17 Side .	Oh, yes, Daniel O'Donnell.18 MS . JOYCE GOODMAN:	69th Assembly19 District to be exact.20 He's sorry he can't be here . He's in21 Albany.22 I'll read his statement.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Great.24 MS . JOYCE GOODMAN:	Good afternoon.25 My name is Daniel O'Donnell and I am10 
2 a member of the New York State Assembly3 representing residents of Manhattan Valley,4 Morningside Heights, the Upper West Side of5 Manhattan and Southern Harlem .6 Thank you for the opportunity to7 discuss rent adjustments for renewal leases for8 rent-stabilized apartments.9 The proposed rent increases, if10 passed, will have a dramatically negative effect11 on the lives of tenants who live in my assembly12 district and for tenants across the City of New13 York.14 One of the most striking realities15 of the 69th Assembly District is its diverse16 population .	My constituents cover the entire17 socioeconomic spectrum and I believe people are18 drawn to my district because of this very fact:19 They like the vitality that comes from a mix of20 people.21 It is without a doubt, however, that22 this wonderful diversity is dependent on our23 system of rent regulation.	Without it, thousands24 of families would be displaced and the character25 of our community would be radically changed.2 
1	2892 There are unmistakable signs that3 this is already happening.	I know this because my4 constituents confide in me on a regular basis that5 with the next rent increase they will no longer be6 able to afford to keep their apartments.7 Obviously many of those living on fixed incomes8 are already stretched to the limit.9 Something is wrong when a system of10 rent regulation designed to protect tenants from11 being forced out of their apartments, fails to12 account for the fact that incomes are not keeping13 pace with rent increases, forcing people to make14 impossible choices in order to make their monthly15 rent payments .16 We cannot continue to overlook the17 housing needs of our working families, or our most18 vulnerable residents: Our seniors, immigrants, the19 disabled and homeless populations.20 First and foremost I would like21 first and foremost I ask the Board to consider the22 fact that issues pertaining to housing are by far23 the most common issues that my constituents bring24 to my attention.25 Over the course of the last twelve2 
2 months, my community office has assisted a3 countless number of households who fell into rent4 arrears and sought legal and financial assistance5 to prevent them from losing their rent regulated6 apartments.7 Each one of these constituents8 required an average of four follow-up meetings9 and/or comprehensive legal services or an advocate10 in Housing Court to prevent their eviction.11 It is important to note that the12 majority of these cases involve tenants who pay13 between $650 and $950 per month for rent . The14 difficulties my constituents face paying these15 rents goes a long way in dispelling the idea that16 they should simply relocate to other neighborhoods17 to find housing elsewhere.18 Affordability is an issue across19 this City. Furthermore, a majority of these20 tenants have lived in their apartments for more21 than a decade and they occupy apartments that are22 at capacity.23 For example, most of these single24 renters currently live in one-bedroom apartments25 and the majority of those who occupy an apartment2 
2 larger than one-bedroom, more often than not, have3 boarders or third parties who are paying a4 percentage of the rental expenses.5 Additionally, many of those who have6 sought assistance from my office are those who are7 approaching 65  but do not qualify for SCRIE. Some8 are those who are permanently disabled but do not9 qualify for DRIE.	A great many are low income10 working families whose salaries over the years11 have not increased anywhere near the rent12 increases that have been instituted by this body.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap14 up.15 MS . JOYCE GOODMAN:	Based on these16 facts alone, I am adamantly opposed to yet another17 rent increase that will cause a major hardship for18 thousands of New Yorkers who are already19 struggling to make ends meet.	If we continue to20 increase rents based solely on the "burdens"21 claimed by landlords without considering the22 increasing burdens of tenants, then we will23 inevitably be forcing more and more people out of24 their homes.25 It is time for the RGB to take the2 
2	dramatic step of enacting a rent freeze .3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4	MS. JOYCE GOODMAN:	The Board should5 pass guidelines that prohibit landlords from6 collecting the guideline increases in cases where7 there are five or more hazardous violations of8 record per unit or where 20 percent or more of the9 units in a building are already unregulated.10 (Audience participation. )11 MS. JOYCE GOODMAN:	Thank you for12 your time.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 We have a question.15 MS . LEVINE:	I actually have a16 couple of questions for you.17 MS . JOYCE GOODMAN:	Sure .18 MS . LEVINE:	We have heard an19 enormous amount of testimony from both sides today20 about the pain that the tenants are experiencing21 and the increased burdens on the landlords .22 The one thing that I think everybody23 can agree on is that the -- that we don't want  to24 lose our public servants, the Policemen, the25 Firemen, the librarian, the teachers, the5 
2 emergency medical workers.3 Has Assembly Member O'Donnell4 considered introducing legislation with regard to5	housing credits for that list of people that we6 all agree are intrinsic to the value in our safety7 in New York City?8 And my second question - I'll give9 you both and you can answer them or at least just10 take them along to him - is we've also heard a lot11 of testimony about building violations and whether12 those landlords that are not maintaining their13 buildings should be entitled to rent increases,14 which is outside of our jurisdiction.15 Again, we would - - I'm sure the16 tenants would like to have all those building17 violations cured, but the landlord groups also18 have interests in not having a couple of bad19 landlords ruin their reputation and deny them20 their say.21 Is there anything pending or is22 there anything that you're working on in your23 office with regard to that?24 MS . JOYCE GOODMAN:	Personally I am25 - - I'm not working on the legislative end.6 
2	MS. LEVINE:	Okay.3	MS. JOYCE GOODMAN:	I deal with - -4 I'm inundated .	All I do is help people stay in5 their apartments. All day, every day, five or six6 days a week, eight or nine hours a day I'm flooded7 with people who are just scraping by or in Housing8 Court in nonpayment. That's all I do.9	MR. LANGUEDOC:	Can I ask10	something just to ask - -11	MS . JOYCE GOODMAN :	Yes. I'm glad to12 take that back to - -13 MS . LEVINE:	Please do. We hope14 that you will.15 MS . JOYCE GOODMAN:	The housing16 credits and - -17 MS. LEVINE:	And housing credits18 for public servants and building violations and19 going after the "bad landlords."20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, I think21 what's being said on housing credits is some sort22 of supplement for public servants at the least so23 that they can24 MS. JOYCE GOODMAN:	Well, that would25 be great.12 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So that they can3 afford it.4 It could be credits or cash.5 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I just wanted to6 know that since you seem to be working primarily7 in constituent services, do you encounter public8 servants who are having difficulty with their9 rent, people such as school teachers, police,10 librarians, people that work for the City of New11 York in some capacity or another, bureaucrats,12 clerical workers?13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have somebody14 from DC37.	Unfortunately they didn't sign up15 earlier, but I don't know if they're still there.16 MS. JOYCE GOODMAN:	The truth is17 I'm thinking through my head what the jobs are18 that people I represent.	Librarians and Policemen19 don't come	don't - - I haven 't met any20 librarians or Policemen, I don't think.21 MS. LEVINE:	Well, the testimony22 that we've heard is that they no longer can afford23 to live in the City and that - -24 MS. JOYCE GOODMAN:	Well, I know25 that on rent, for instance, you know, I'm in a2 
2	rent stabilized unit.3	MS. HOLDER:	And you are a public4	servant?5 MS . JOYCE GOODMAN:	And I'm a6 public servant.	I make $37,000 a year and my rent7 is $1,475. And it's a preferential rent so I8 expect that I won't be able - - the legal rent is 9	$2,300 .10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do you live in the11 district?12 MS . JOYCE GOODMAN:	I live in the13 district in a five-story walk-up on the fifth14 floor. My landlord says he can get $2,300 for it.15 And so I'll be out and I don't know if I'll be16 able to keep my job.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Because it's18 right. So he's legally entitled to go to the 19	$2,300 .20 MS. JOYCE GOODMAN:	Yes.	And so I21 expect that he - - if you know about preferential22 rents, he'll be asking for that.23 But in my own building it's a24 five-story walk-up . Every new unit that becomes25 available is destabilized.20 
12972MR. LANGUEDOC:Well, if I may,3Mr. Chairman.4CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Sure.5MR. LANGUEDOC:You - - in the6 written testimony you talked about working people.7 MS. JOYCE GOODMAN:	Right.8	MR. LANGUEDOC:	And you said you9 work with a lot of people with rent issues.	So10 what type of work do these people do, do you know?11	MS. JOYCE GOODMAN:	I know they12 have jobs.	A lot of them are home health aids13 making minimum14 MR. LANGUEDOC:	How much do they15 make?16 MS. JOYCE GOODMAN:	The make $10 an17 hour, let's say. They can't afford it. They18 absolutely can't afford the $800 a month that they19 pay. And those are people -- you know, those are20 people that have been there for ten, 15 years and21 they can't afford their rent. So it's not  only22 that nobody can afford to move in - - and there's23 no such thing as moving into a rent stabilized24 unit anymore in my - - my neighborhood.25 But the fact is that people who have12 
2 been there contributing to the community for years3 and years, making $10 an hour, can't afford to4 stay in their units . And that's really - - and5 there's nowhere for them to go. I was inundated6 with Section 8 applicants. It's unrealistic to7 think that they'll all quality - - I mean that8	there's enough for them.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Speaker 51, I'm10 not sure we 'll get there or that she's still here,11 is a DC37 member. I mean we'll get there. I don't12 know if she's still here .13 MS . HOLDER:	Thank you.14 MR . LANGUEDOC:	Thank you very15 much.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 (Applause.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Grace Hovey;19 Tom Church; and20 Then Melvin Trepper;21 Followed by Kaytrue Ting.22 Go ahead.23 MS. GRACE HOVEY:	Hello.24 I live in an SRO building and I'm25 here to speak out that the landlords do not10 
2	deserve a rent increase .3	And we	in the building that we4 live in, we did, even though 75 percent of the5 people who live in the building are paying market6 rate, the Rent Guidelines Board last year, what7 you put out really it would make it so that we8 shouldn 't get a rent increase.	Yet last month9 even, we received a retroactive rent increase from10 last October through May even though 75 percent of11 the building is market rate.12 Now, that doesn't mean that 7513 percent of the building is destabilized because I14 live in an SRO. These are rooms. They 1  re not15 apartments. That means that somebody is paying for16 a room that is so small that if you 1 re laying in17 your bed, you could reach into the refrigerator18 and pull something out of it. That 1   s how small the19 rooms are.20 Yet they 1  re getting like $1,500.21 That means that they've been able to quadruple22 their rents.	Not only that, but a very expensive23 restaurant has gone into what used to be our24 lobby, which we did not receive a rent reduction25 even though we applied for it for the reduction of4 
1	3002 the size of our lobby and our landlord tells us3 that we can't meet their for tenant  meetings.4 And you can see that it's imperative5 that we have a place to meet considering that6 we're getting these illegal rent increase . I mean7 we got a rent increase even though we received a8 reduction, a rent reduction from the DHCR because9 our - -10 I live in a 16-story building. The11 fire escape is rusted to the bone.	We received a12 rent reduction for that, but regardless of  the13 rent reduction, even though it says in the order14 that you can receive no rent increase after the15 effective date of that order, he gave it to us.16 Now we're going to have to turn around and fight17 for him not only to - - because, of course, he18 filed an appeal saying that the fire escape wasn't19 rusty even though it's plainly rusted. He's lying20 clearly through his teeth.21 And now we've got to get together to22 fight not only to file a notice to, you know, put23 up our side that the - - the fire escape is rusted,24 but also to fight for this rent increase.25 And so I ask the Rent Control Board2 
1	3012 to put out a more clear guideline. If you say3 something is rent stabilized even though the4 landlord is able to put it quadruple, it doesn't5 mean that it's not market rate.6 We have some of the units in my7 building where they've been able to join rooms. I8 mean the landlord is really happy when he's to do9 that, right? Then he can charge over $2,000  so10 that it's no	so then it's no longer11 destabilized.12 But, you know, right now we're13 caught like in between a rock and a hard place14 because we don't even understand, you know, what15 it means if it's 80 percent rent stabilized even16 though the landlord is making a windfall profit17 by, you know, being able to quadruple the rents on18 75 percent of the units.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Which building20 is this?21 MS. GRACE HOVEY:	166 West 75th22 Street. It's called the Park Lincoln. The owner is23 Eric Margolis.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The Lincoln?25 MS . ADAMS:	West what?2 
2	MS. GRACE HOVEY:	166 West 75th3	Street.	It's called the Park Lincoln Hotel .4	MS. LEVINE:	And what's the5	restaurant?6	MS. GRACE HOVEY:	Cesca.	A very7 famous restaurant.	Now that I just saw Larry King8 coming out of it the other day. It's - - he must be9 making a killing on the rent down there, which10 also took up our lobby where we're not allowed to11 meet anymore.12 MS . HOLDER:	Who's the owner?13 MS. GRACE HOVEY:	Eric Margolis.14 MR . LANGUEDOC:	And you're an SRO15 tenant?16 MS. GRACE HOVEY:	That's right,17 sir.18 MR . LANGUEDOC:	And how long have19 you lived there?20 MS. GRACE HOVEY:	Twenty years.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And you're not22 subject to the proviso or you are and he's23 ignoring it?24 MS. GRACE HOVEY:	He's given us a25 rent increase.	Now, we have two sets of tenants7 
2	in this place because not everybody won the Rent3	Reduction order.4 The Rent Reduction order clearly5 states that you're not allowed to give any rent6	increase.	Regardless of that I received a rent7	increase even though I got the rent reduction.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right. You9	received the notice, but you - -10 MS. GRACE HOVEY:	No, it's on my11 bill.	What do you mean a notice?12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, of course.	I13 mean it's on your bill, but it's not necessarily14 legal.15 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Have you - -16 MS. GRACE HOVEY:	It's not legal17 but I have to fight for it to have it taken off.18 And I don't have anyplace to meet at our tenants19 association and I don't get a rent discount for20 that.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You also22 understand that we can't deal with  illegality.23 MS . GRACE HOVEY:	No, I'm just24 asking you to issue a clear guidelines. You say25 "rent stabilized" when you should be saying10 
2	"market rate. "3	If it's 75 percent market rate or 804 percent market rate, whatever you're - - well,5 look, the guy's able to make a windfall profit.6 You can see that.	He's quadrupled the rents.7 We're talking about small rooms where he's able to8 charge $1,500.	I'm telling you, you can lay in9 bed and get a soda out of the refrigerator it's so10 small and you're paying $1,500.11 MR . LANGUEDOC:	It sounds like12 you're being overcharged, ma'am.13 MS. GRACE HOVEY:	Well, most of the14 people probably	I don't even think that's legal15 construction in there. Iheard that you're16 supposed to put a kitchen into an enclave or17 enclave.	None of them are.18 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Why don't you go19 talk to --20 MS . GRACE HOVEY:	You know, these21 are the people who are market rate tenants. I've22 lived in the building 20 years. So all the people23 who are currently moving are talking about what24 this lady before me was speaking about, the25 dynamics of the neighborhood changing.4 
2 Everybody's young, under 20, all white. All of3 them are, you know, affluent and so the whole4 dynamics of the neighborhood.5 These people probably can afford6 lawyers unlike us.	We go up to the SRO Law7 Project and we're thankful for Columbia providing8 that. But nonetheless, you know, we're going to9 have to fight. The rest of the tenants, like a10 woman is going to speak after me, who did not get11 the rent decrease but she did receive last month a12 rent increase retroactive from October through13 May.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me just15 clarify what I think you're saying.16 You're saying that because our17 guideline on the proviso says rent stabilized18 MS. GRACE HOVEY:	That's right.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	- - then, in20 fact, even though it hasn't become destabilized,21 he 1 s renting these apartments, these SRO units,22 taking his allowable lease increases, still keeps23 them under $2,000 so he still has stabilized and24 you suggest that we change it to "market. "25 MS. GRACE HOVEY:	Market.2 
1	3062	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The reason the3 proviso does not effect you or does or doesn't,4 I'm not clear, is that he's getting "market" but5 they're still stabilized; is that what you're6 saying?7	MS. GRACE HOVEY:	Right. I'm saying8 that we're going to have to go fight for that now9 because it wasn't clearly laid out by the Rent10 Guidelines Board.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, I'm not12 sure we have the power to say market, if you will.13 But I understand your point.14 MS. HOLDER:	Just for purposes15 thank you for your testimony and thank you for16 telling us your story that's so personal.17 Just to clarify for people in the18 audience who may not understand, when we talk19 about the higher rents in the SROs, we're talking20 about people who often times pay their rent on a21 weekly basis, correct?22	MS. GRACE HOVEY:	Many people do.23 MS . HOLDER:	Right.	And so24 consequently a lot of times the rent is very, very25 high and there are people who may be listening to23 
2 you in the audience who don't understand why3 someone would stay in an SRO and pay $1,500.	But4 they don't also understand that people often times5 can't accumulate that lump sum . They can only pay6 like gradually during the course of a month,7 correct?8	MS. GRACE HOVEY:	Well, most of the9 new people that move - - I mean all the new people10 that move into my building have a lease. So I11 don't even know why they fall under rent12 stabilized.	They're not like us who are under the13 Rent Guidelines Board SRO, you know, we don't  have14 a written lease.15 We have the DHCR or whoever16 established it, the guidelines for the SRO17 tenants. They're completely different from us .18 They're paying quadruple rent. They have a lease,19 not like us, not like the basic SRO, the old20 school, the one that will be eliminated after a21 number of years.22 How many years is it going to take23 before there is no longer any SRO tenants left in24 the entire city because every time someone moves25 out, they go up quadruple.	They go and the do9 
2 renovation and they quadruple the rent .3 So effectively what, in like ten,4 fifteen, there's not going to be a single SRO5 tenant left in the City, right?6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 MS . HOLDER:	Thank you.8 MS. GRACE HOVEY:	Thank you.9 (Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Tom Church.	Mr.11 Church, are you here?	Tom Church?	No.12 (No response.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Melvin Trepper?14 Mr. Trepper.	Okay.15 Hold on a second.	You can come to16 the mike.17 Followed by Kaytrue Ting; and18 Then Eleyana Kaiser.19 Mr. Trepper.20 MR. MELVIN TREPPER:	Yes. Thank21 you.22 I own several small walk-up23 buildings, one in Manhattan and three in - -24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Talk into the25 mike.10 
1	3092	MR. MELVIN TREPPER:	- - and three in3 Brooklyn in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.4 And I'd like to speak how expenses5 disproportionately effect small owners and6 particularly small owners in walk-up buildings . I7 want to cite a few examples.8 I have a superintendent for all the9 buildings .	They're part time superintendents .10 They go to the building two or three times a week.11 They clean the hall, they take care of the12 garbage .	They check on various things in the13 boiler and then they leave .14 I get DEP violations on a regular15 basis which large owners don't get because they16 have a doorman, they have porters, they have17 people that are watching out for them. And all18 small owners get these violations.19 I just want to give you one example20 which happened a few weeks ago.21 I got a violation which stated that22 the inspector saw lids on the garbage cans that23 were not on them properly and so there was the24 potential for the garbage to fall out onto the25 sidewalk.	So there wasn't even trash on the3 
2 sidewalk, just the potential for it to fall out on3 the sidewalk.	I got a $100 violation for that.4 So that's one example where small5 owners are disproportionately impacted by these6 kind of regulations.7 Another - - and that goes across the8 Board in a certain respect is that when you talk9 about heat, it cost more to heat a small building10 on a per unit basis, that is a per square foot11 basis or a per room basis, than it does a large12 building because the boilers are less efficient.13 It's an older building typically. The same thing14 applies to insurance, repairs, and you can go on15 with every single item.16 So what you have then is you have a17 squeeze. You get lower rents in a walk-up building18 and you have higher per unit expenses. So when you19 give us a four percent or a whatever increase, on20 a $500 or $600 rent, it doesn't compensate for it21 particularly when you have announced increases of22 eleven-and-a-half percent for water, taxes go up23 on a regular basis, fuel, you know what happens to24 it, refrigerators, whatever it is, impacts the25 small owner more than it does the large owners. So2 
2 there's got to be some type of correction, some3 type of correction for this inconsistency I4 believe.5 The second thing and the last thing6 I guess I want to talk about is the difference in7 cost in the outer boroughs versus Manhattan.8 I have a building in Manhattan.9 Mostly the tenants work. Mostly they're single or10 couples . The cost for water there is $356 per11 apartment per year. The Bushwick apartments, also12 walk-up similar type buildings, the cost there for13 water is $537 per apartment per year, 51 percent14 higher than the New York apartment. And the other15 one is $584 per apartment per year, 64 percent16 higher on a per unit basis than the New York17 apartment.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And that's19 because there's more children and more20 MR. MELVIN TREPPER:	Exactly.21 There's more children and there's people who are22 at home more often.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Go ahead.24 Adriene.25 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you for your2 
2 testimony and thanks for coming in and telling3 your story.4 How would you define a small5 landlord?	What criteria would you use?6	MR. MELVIN TREPPER:	Well, I would  7 say anywhere from four to 15, 18, 20  apartments.8 Walk-up building typically.9 MS. CRUZ:	How do you cover your10 shortfall?11 MR. MELVIN TREPPER:	I take it from12 one building to the other building or I take it13 from home sometimes or I borrow it. That's how I14 do it .15 MR . SCHLEIDER :	And your average16 rent, sir, is about what for the Bushwick17 properties?18 MR. MELVIN TREPPER:	I didn't19 figure it out.	But I would guess it's around - -20 because I have rent controlled apartments there21 too, three rent controlled apartments .	It's 22	probably around $600, $625, $650.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How long have24 you owned these buildings?25 MR. MELVIN TREPPER:	Well, yes.23 
2 I'm a long-term owner . I'm an investor and holder .3 The New York building I've had for4 over 25 years and the Bushwick building I've had5 for - - since 1986, one building, and the other6 building I've had since 1996.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So Speaker Quinn's8 $300 per tenant household rebate or rent credit9 would give you your $25, right?	312 divided10 yeah, about $25 a month which would be about four11 percent on a $600 a month rent.12 MR. MELVIN TREPPER:	Whatever it13 comes out to I'm sure, yeah.14 MR. SCHLEIDER.	So you're in favor15 of Quinn's proposal, at least making it easier for16 your tenants17 MR. MELVIN TREPPER:	I'm not sure. I18 don't --19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	She didn't say20 he was going to get it, did she?	It's going to go21 to the tenant.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes, I understand23 that, but it helps the tenant pay the fee.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	But it does help25 the tenant.2 
2	MR. MELVIN TREPPER:	I don't know3 all the details about it.4 (Audience participation.)5	MR. SCHLEIDER:	It should be a6	higher rent rebate.7	MS. HOLDER:	It should be higher8	and it should be means tested.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank you,10 sir.11 (Applause.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Kaytrue Ting,13 are you here?14 MS . KAYTRUE TING:	Yes.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Ting is16 representing Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal?17 MS. KAYTRUE TING:	Yes.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Followed by19 Eleyana Kaiser, representing Assembly Member20 Richard Gottfried;21 Followed by Priscilla Durant of the22 Riverside and Edgecombe Neighborhood Association.23 Go ahead .24 MS. KAYTRUE TING:	Good afternoon.25 Thank you for having me.10 
2 I'm here, as you said, to represent3 Assemblymember Linda B . Rosenthal who represents4 the 67th Assembly District in Manhattan. And that5 includes the Upper West Side and parts of Clinton.6 So just below Assemblymember O'Donnell's district.7 As you may know, the Upper West Side8 is home to thousands of rent-stabilized tenants9 for whom this issue is vitally important.	And the10 Assemblymember urges you in the strongest possible11 terms to reject the rent increase proposals this12 year.13 Year after year, the Rent Guidelines14 Board has determined in favor of landlords,15 granting them higher and higher rents on16 stabilized apartments.	Even if the increases are17 small or the increases are large, there seems18 always to be an increase.19 No one denies that operating costs20 for landlords have risen and these are important21 to take into account when determining whether  or22 not a rent increase is justified .	However, it23 seems that every year landlords are afforded24 increases to offset their rising costs and  every25 year the ability of tenants to afford their homes2 
2 and the robust and healthy profits of landlords3 are ignored.4 The data reported in the 2007 Income5 and Affordability study, you know, generated by6 your staff, reveals a bleak picture on New7 Yorkers' ability to afford their homes.	And as8 Joyce mentioned when she was up here, we deal with9 constituents everyday who are walking into our10 office and they're primarily there for housing11 reasons.12 And, you know, some of them are13 public servants but some of them aren 't. Some of14 them are painters. Some of them are dancers. Some15 of them are security guards . And I think those16 people contribute as much to the neighborhood17 fabric as a public servant does.18 But to go to your numbers, income19 levels for tenants in rent-stabilized apartments20 dropped by 8.6 percent between '01 and '04. During21 nearly the same time period the median rent for a22 rent stabilized apartment has risen to $844, an23 increase of over 8.2 from 2002 to 2005.24 The ratio of gross rent, which25 includes the fuel and utilities, to income in 20052 
2 was a dangerously high 31.2 percent which, if you3 apply it to a relatively low income, can really4 leave not too much money for necessities like food5 and clothing.6 And nearly 23 percent of all renter7 households earning incomes - - are earning incomes8 below the poverty line, placing these New Yorkers9 on the brink of homelessness.10 I think the most shocking and11 disturbing thing I read from your report was that12 29 percent of rental households spend more than13 half of their household income on rent.14 And finally, the report cited15 another indicator on the rising lack of16 affordability which was that in 2006, the17 proportion of non-payment proceedings that18 resulted in an eviction was the highest in nine19 years.20 So as you can see, rents are21 climbing reliably higher every year, but tenants'22 incomes are not keeping pace.23 And I didn't get to the end, but the24 written testimony will be submitted.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.	You'll2 
2	submit the formal testimony?3 MS. KAYTRUE TING:	Sure.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any questions?5 (No response.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We appreciate it7 for hanging out for so long.8 (Applause.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Eleyana Kaiser?10 Hello? Is she here?11 (No response.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Priscilla Durant,13 is that you with that sign back there?	Are you14 Priscilla Durant?15 MS . PRISCILLA DURANT:	Yes, I am.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Great.17 Ayesha McDuffie.18 A VOICE:	McDuffie.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. But it says20 McDuffy here, but McDuffie; and21 Steve Herrick.22 Okay . Priscilla, go ahead .23 MS. PRISCILLA DURANT :	Good evening,24 ladies and gentlemen of the Rent Guidelines Board.25 Each time I come I come to beg for10 
2 our low rent increase. It seems that Washington3 Height low income families, single family and  the4 elderly is been put out of their home in5 Washington Heights .6 We cannot get any services, as  the7 lady was speaking before, the lawyer. We do not8 have any rights in Washington Height. We have9 lived there for many, many years. We have paid our10 taxes.	We have raised our children. Each time11 rent came up we paid it.	We fought a little bit12 but we paid it.13 Now it seems like it's going back14 during the time I came to New York when I was a15 young girl.	When you start renovation, you push16 your old people and the middle class people back17 in the old building that's no good and put the18 upper class in the good buildings .19 If we can pay the taxes and work20 hard and do our duties, like we always have done21 - - because most of the low income people is paying22 the taxes, okay, and we are the ones that are23 voting you in every year.24 It seems that there is a break for a25 the middle class.	The landlords, you're going to2 
2	have to help them and you're going to have to have3 someone to guidelines them and watch what they do4 with the money, because a lot of the landlords are5 not spending the money on their building when they6 get it. When they get these loans, they're not7 spending it on their buildings.8 Our next thing is, we have a lot of9 homeless and we don't have affordable houses.	A10 lot of the affordable houses, which I'm in one now11 at 537 West 156th Street, my house has been12 renovated, okay. We took out a loan. We come in at13 HDFC so we can run our own building.14 Now we are hit with a rent15 reconstruction and we in a stabilized building.16 Each time we look around it's more money, more17 money every year. I have been in this town now for18 a long, long time . I worked for 27 years in New19 York City. I raised my children here. I'm 61 years20 old and I'm proud to still be moving and working21 like I'm doing .22 Now, I have a problem in my house23 which I know my income is going to be lower. My24 son has developed a mental illness which I'm25 taking care of now.	And I also have a heart3 
2	problem with blood clogging and what they call3	PAD, and high blood pressure so I'm sick myself.4 I cannot hold a job right now. So5 I'm living on my SSI which is nothing and my6 husband's retirement which he worked for Teacher's7 College for 33 years. I think that the low income8 people should have a break this year.9	No rent increase.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Now, you say your11 building is owned by HDFC?12 MS. PRISCILLA DURANT :	Yes. We just13 started with UHAP. We had to go in the third party14 transfer.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is it a co-op?16 MS. PRISCILLA DURANT :	We are17 waiting for the AG to give us the okay to become a18 co-op .19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.20 MS. PRISCILLA DURANT :	And we are21 getting a low rent -- a high rent reconstruction.22 They told us when we started it would be $850 per23 unit of a two-family and $660 for one-bedroom24 unit.	Now all of that has changed. It has went up25 again.10 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I see.	I3 understand.4 Okay.	Thank you.5 MS . PRISCILLA DURANT:	Okay.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ayesha McDuffie .7	(Applause.)8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Followed by Steve9	Herrick;10	Followed by Sadie Foy.11	MS. AYESHA MCDUFFIE:	Good12 afternoon.13 My name is Ayesha McDuffie .	I'm14 here today because I want you to reconsider what15 could possibly put a lot of people out of their16 homes .17 While it is that I have been in18 situations where I have been on both sides of the19 fence where I have actually been a homeowner and20 have charged rent, I understand the growing cost21 of potential property values, taxes, water. This22 is an understandable thing.23 But on the same note, as a tenant, I24 also understand where it is that you are afraid25 from day to day that you cannot afford where12 
2 you 're living.	At the current moment,3 unfortunately because of my situation, I'm not4 able to work at the moment.	So therefore at a5 constant - - there's constant problems with me6 worrying about where my income is going to come7 from to pay my rent.8 And on top of this, that's why I9 say, I empathize with landlords but they have to10 empathize too.	Because on the same note, yes,11 you're not getting what you want for what you want12 for rent.	But on the same note you're getting13 something.	Because what is - - the bottom line is14 if you raise rents, you're not going to have15 anyone in your apartment  to get any kind of income16 in the first place. So I would think something is17 better than nothing.	There are a lot of people18 I live in Washington Heights. Ms. Durant and I19 live in the same building.20 At the current moment, as she says,21 we have just signed on with UHAP and the third22 party transfer situation.	We were stated one23 price for rent and now through sudden24 circumstances, UHAP is telling us that they now25 have to reconstruct the rent due to problems that2 
2 were not our fault.	And I don't think that's very3 fair that people are allowed to do that to people4 who are supposed to be low income .5 And at the current time I have6	watched many, many people move out of New York7 because they could no longer afford living in8 affordable housing.	And in the neighborhood that9 I have come from, I lived there all my life and I10 have seen rents go up to a ridiculous price . And I11 don't think that's very fair. And I would really12 like for you to reconsider actually the increase13 for the sake of people who are having problems14 with their rent.15 Thank you.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Question.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question. Go19 ahead.20 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Hello, ma'am.21 Thank you very much for coming in.22 Have you looked around your23 neighborhood to see how much a vacant rent24 stabilized apartment would be?25 MS . AYESHA MCDUFFIE:	At the7 
1	3252 current moment - - because I have looked around for3 many years, like I said, I've been in the same4 area all my life. I do keep up with the actual5 rent increase and things.6 And at the current moment I live by7 Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. And a lot of the8 area Columbia has taken over.9	MR . LANGUEDOC:	Right.10 MS. AYESHA MCDUFFIE:	So at the11 current moment what is considered affordable12 housing, there are studio apartments in my area13 that go for like maybe $2,000 and that's14 affordable housing in Washington Heights.15 At the moment, like I said, I don't16 want to leave my home because not - - you know, we17 do not want the rent increase that we're about to18 have that UHAP is supposed to impose on it. But on19 the same note I do feel lucky because I've lived20 where Ilived and it could be a lot worse.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me just22 understand .23 UHAP is saying that they have to24 restructure the rents at a higher level than25 originally anticipated because construction costs10 
2 are higher.	I mean what's the reason they're3 giving?4 MS. AYESHA MCDUFFIE:	Well,5 actually they told us that after doing all6 construction, that they didn't anticipate  the7 how much it was going to cost over. And8 unfortunately because of the construction company9 that they picked up, they made a lot of errors. So10 now UHAP is basically trying to pin the price off11 on us because of their errors.12 So they're basically, before even13 before they - - they set a price with us a couple14 of years ago, told us what the rent was going to15 be and now all of a sudden they turned and they16 changed their mind and they said before we even17 get into the first price that they promised us,18 now they're telling us before that we have to have19 a rent increase.20CHAIRMAN MARKUS:I got it.21Okay, thank you.22MR. LANGUEDOC:Thank you very23much .24CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Steve Herrick,25CooperSquare .

BYUNG KIM:	I don't know what I15 have to tell you before I explain that the16 situation of the problem.17 The New York City has been increase18 all things higher, higher, sky high.	But we don't19 have nothing to get as according to percentage of20 New York City increase.	But we need to get21 something, similar rate.	That - - that all I can22 tell.	It's include everything. New York City  has23 to increase a lot in few years time.24 But we don't get nothing and that's25 according to the rate they increasing.	So I need12 
2 to get something we can get at least, but I cannot3 force it .4 New York City has to listen to the5	poor people, small number of building owner.	They6 got terribly taken care of and that very, very7 hard.	So horrible. It is horrible.8	But all I can tell you that we can9 have a something for that.	That I can only say.10 Appreciate, appreciate that .	That's all I can11 say.12 Thanks a lot.13 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Thank you.14 Any questions?15 (No response.)16 MR . MCLAUGHLIN:	Thank you, Mr.17 Kim.18 Our next speaker is Steve Seltzer;19 Followed by Maxine Zeifman.20 MR. STEVE SELTZER:	Good afternoon.21 My name is Steve Seltzer.22 Just the other day I received in the23 mail an 18-page booklet entitled, "New York City24 2006 Drinking Water Supply and Quality report"  put25 out by the New York City Department of9 
2	Environmental Protection.3	While it describes itself as an4 annual report, I have never seen one before in the5 50 years I've been living on the Lower East Side.6 And I wonder whether it's being more widely7 distributed this year to help justify to the8 public the eleven-and-a-half percent increase in9 water rates being proposed by the New York City10 Water Board.	11.5 percent for this year and11 probably each of the next three years, which will12 add to landlord's costs and will likely be passed13 onto tenants.	This will add a new sinister14 meaning to the word water boarding.15 More seriously, I note that when a16 tenant's income rises beyond a certain point, that17 tenant 's apartment can be removed from rent18 regulation. But tenant's incomes are often19 volatile.	And while one's income may rise above a20 certain point for a number of years it may then21 fall below that point for the next years.22 When that happens, there should be a23 procedure for restoring the apartment to rent24 regulation. I hope it is not too late for you to25 devise a procedure for that in this year's4 
2	guidelines.3	Finally, if tenant income is a4 factor in determining rent regulation, why not5 landlord income?	Maybe landlords making over a6 certain amount could not raise rents.	Of course,7 that would require opening landlords' books and we8 know that --9 (Audience participation. )10 MR . STEVE SELTZER:	-- we know that11 is sacrosanct.12 Thank you.13 (Applause.)14 MR . MCLAUGHLIN:	Thank you, Mr.15 Seltzer.16 Maxine Zeifman?17 MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	My name is18 Maxine Zeifman.19 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Zeifman, sorry.20 MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	Yes.21 You know, I was at the meeting a few22 weeks ago and I was very distressed because you23 were giving figures on increases in affordable24 housing.25 Now, I'm a member of the New York4 
2 State Tenants and Neighbor s, a very big3 organization with some 18,000 tenants in this - -4 in New York State.	Not only in New York City, but5 in Albany.6 We believe we have lost in the last7 decade 300,000 apartments with vacancy decontrol8 and we believe - - and so you give figures that9 that there has been an increase in 3,000 units of10 affordable housing without taking into account11 that .12 Now, Ms . Adams asked or somebody13 asked does the DHCR keep track of what happens14 when the apartment is decontrolled, is -- when15 somebody - - when somebody leaves, dies and leaves16 an apartment, when there is vacancy decontrol do17 they keep it? Do they try to keep - - do they keep18 track of whether there was really renovations or19 not?	No, there is no track, in effect. So  the20 enormous, enormous loss over this last ten decades21 and you report a 3,000 unit gain.22 So there is a feeling	it 1 s so sad23 for me because there 1  s a feeling when Icame to24 New York City in the late 50 1 s, in 19	in the25 beginning of the 60's, I - - I had a -- I moved2 
2 into an apartment.	There was no renovation. That3 apartment stayed - - it was controlled, stay4 controlled.	I couldn't get the lease in '725 because somebody else, the person who moved out6 still had the lease so mine was '74. Conditions7 remained the same .	It stayed .8 Now, '74, Rockefeller took rent laws9 up and through Albany with the Urstadt. And10 because - - because real estate is a private11 interest.	Real estate in New York is what oil is12 to Texas.	He didn't take it up because it wasn't13 profitable.	He took it up because it was14 profitable.15 Tenants have been fighting ever16 since to get Home Rule back to New York City17 because it's	only the tenants know how18 important it is and how important that affordable19 housing is.20 New York City is great because I21 know young medical researchers at Columbia22 Presbyterian working on a DNA level on why heart23 transplants don't take and they earn $33,000 a24 year.	Same in Rockefeller Institute.	You know,25 and this City is not great because of the2 
2 landlords.3 The landlords who are in these4 buildings, in my building -- I'm in a rent5 stabilized apartment and I pay two bedrooms,6 $2,073.	I do not pay $400. I don't know where7 these apartments are on the Upper East Side that8 get $400 rent. I've been there for 30 --  whatever9 years, five years.10 You know, it's - - we - - the11 important thing in this City is a city stays12 great.	It isn't the landlords. I've said that13 before . The landlords in my building -- they're 6414 apartments. Iown three buildings per the15 comparable they have.	We have seven renters . The16 apartments are selling for two million. My17 apartment is renting for five.	So if these poor18 rent guys, yes, maybe a couple of - - I can't even19 believe these small landlords.	They must have20 violations for 30 years. My rent gets raised every21 year. How come theirs doesn't that they're still22 after 30 years, and I mean that's nonsense.23 MR . MCLAUGHLIN:	You need to wrap24 up, please.25 MS . MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	The Upper East2 
2 Side and the Lower East side, you can get a rent3 stabilized apartment . These tenants are there for4 40 years paying $400. The landlords are making a5 fortune. New York City is one of the only places6 in this country where property is going up.7 Everywhere else it's going down.8 So if there are a couple of rent9 stabilized apartments for some crazy reason, which10 I don 't believe that are $400 two-bedrooms that11 they keep talking about, you know, the rest of the12 - - the rest of the landlord is making a killing.13 MR . MCLAUGHLIN:	Thank you very14 much.15 Any questions?16 (No response.)17 (Applause .)18 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Our next speaker19 is Marolyn Charles;20 Followed by Bob Jordan;21 And then Paulette Petion.22 Marolyn Charles?2 3	MS. MAROLYN CHARLES:	Good24 afternoon.25 My name is Marolyn Charles. I work24 
2 in DC37 Political Action, Political Legislative3 Political Action and legislative analyst.4 I'm here representing Executive5 Director Lillian Roberts and Wanda Williams, my6 Director of Political Action, was unable to come7 so I'm here again for the second time.8 I was here last year and I did speak9 about what is happening to our members .10 I'm here testifying on behalf of11 Lillian Roberts, Executive Director of District12 Council 37.13 We represent 121,000 members and14 58,000 retirees. Our members serve in over 1,00015 titles in Mayoral and nonmayoral agencies. They're16 blue collar, white collar, professional, school,17 hospitals , clerical workers.18 They are:19 Patient care associates;20 Janitors;21 Highway repairers;22 911 operations;23 Park workers;24 Lifeguards;25 School lunch aids;2 
2 Crossing guards;3 Clerical workers in hospitals,4 schools;5 The Police Department;6 College assistant;7 Housing Authority employees;8 Librarians;9 Social workers;10 Architects;11 Engineers;12 Food stamps and Medicaid eligibility13 specialists;14 Security guards;15 Gardeners, and many more who work16 everyday to give the citizens of New York the17 highest quality of service.18 As a condition of employment, 8019 percent of our members live in New York City. Over20 50 percent, that's 15,000 DC37 member, live in21 public housing and 4,500 members of DC37 work for22 the New York City Housing Authority.23 Of those that live in subsidized24 public housing or rent controlled or stabilized25 apartments, on average our workers make $31,000 a2 
2 year. The average years of service for most of our3 members is 30 years. Many of these members will4 retire with a pension of less than $12,000 a year .5 The average pension for our members6 is $11,000 to $17,000 a year . Trying to make ends7 meet for most of our members is a daily struggle .8 Going to work everyday, many times working9 overtime, some by choice, others mandated to do10 so, does not provide a cushion but serve as a11 disincentive because these additional funds are12 taxed and spent before they're received .13 For some time and particularly over14 the last six years, we have seen a disturbing15 trend.	Many of our members have become homeless16 because of the inability to pay the escalating17 cost of their rents.18 As we speak there are 300 municipal19 workers, DC37 members who are homeless and go to20 work everyday . This is a reality we would like21 resolved.22 Many members are seeking the union's23 assistance in legal proceedings to avoid eviction.24 Many members are requesting cash assistance to pay25 their rent . A significant portion of our members2 
2 are gravely concerned about the impending sunset3 of Mitchell-Lama.	And most disturbing to me is4 the fact that we have seen our members, who have5 worked all of their life, who have reached the age6 of 60 and is seeking or has a fellow colleague as7 a roommate because singularly they cannot afford8 to pay the rent and it's simply too high.9 So instead of preparing for the10 twilight of life and retirement, they are looking11 at continuing work for the foreseeable future,12 with retirement not being an option for many.13 It is our belief that all New14 Yorkers should have the right to available, decent15 and affordable housing. The construction of luxury16 housing in New York City has contributed to the17 current housing crisis we now find ourselves in.18 New York City continues to suffer19 from the worst housing affordability crisis it has20 experienced since the Great Depression. The21 current vacancy rate for rentals in New York City22 is less than one percent, further exacerbating the23 problem.24 The huge rent hikes of the last four25 years have created financial hardship for a lot of2 
2 rent stabilized tenants.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap.4 MS. MAROLYN CHARLES:	Yes . I'm5 going to wrap up.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, you're way7 over.8	MS. MAROLYN CHARLES:	Yes . I realize9	that . I'm sorry.10 In 2003 and 2004, the Rent11 Guidelines Board abandoned the traditional12 two-percent spread between the one-year and the13 two-year lease renewal guidelines in favor for  a14 three-percent point spread . Okay .15 What we are asking is that if16 possible, that you adopt a rent freeze and for the17 SROs, that there be no increase  whatsoever.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank you .19 Any questions?20 (Applause.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Adriene, did you22 have a question?23 MS. HOLDER:	Yes.24 How many of your members actually25 apply for waivers to live outside of the City and10 
2	have you seen an increase in that in recent years?3	MS . MAROLYN CHARLES:	A waiver?4 MS. HOLDER:	Yes . Yes, is there a5 residency requirement for your members ?6	MS. MAROLYN CHARLES:	What happened7 in our last bargaining, we did get from collective8 bargaining, the right to live outside of the five9 boroughs, which we're always confined in living in10 the five boroughs.	However, that has to go to the11 City Council because they have to waive that12 residency law that was - - that was done in  1986.13 So in City Council, some of the City14 Council members feel that if they waive it,  that15 they will lose constituents, they will lose votes.16 So there's a battle and they're battling with  us.17 They do not want to waive that residency law which18 is making it harder for our members to have that19 choice that the Police has, that the teachers has,20 that they can live in Westchester or Suffolk21 county. We do not have that.22 If any of our members live outside23 of the five boroughs, they are terminated.  Right24 now, Lillian Roberts, the Executive Director, has25 asked Mayor Bloomberg to hold off on those  charges7 
2 because some of our members are quitely living3 outside of the five boroughs because that's the4 only way they can afford a house, a roof over5 their head.6 MS . HOLDER:	And then you also7 said that you have some members that are in the8 shelter system?9	MS. MAROLYN CHARLES:	Yes, we do.10 We honestly do have members who are living in11 shelters. And recently, about two weeks ago, our12 Executive Director Lillian Roberts met with Mayor13 Bloomberg to see how they can come together and14 get some sort of housing for those people to bring15 them out of the shelter .16 MS . HOLDER:	How members is that?17 MS . MAROLYN CHARLES:	It's about 18	4,000 or 5,000.19 MS. ADAMS:	In shelters?20 MS. MAROLYN CHARLES:	Yes.	We --21 MS . HOLDER:	And those are22 individual members or does that include their23 families ?24 MS. MAROLYN CHARLES:	Including - -25 some of them do have families.19 
2MS.HOLDER:But doesthat number3include - -4MS.MAROLYNCHARLES:Yes, uh-huh.5 MS. HOLDER:	Okay. Thank you.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7	MS. MAROLYN CHARLES:	Thank you.8	(Applause.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Bob Jordan.10 Mr. Jordan?11 (No response.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Paulette Petion,13 is that you?14 Okay.15 Followed by Steve Herrick who was16 out of the room before.17 Are you here, Mr. Herrick ?	Yes? No?18 (No response.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Go ahead .20 MS. PAULETTE PETION :	Good21 afternoon, Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen of22 the Board.23 My name is Paulette Petion.	I live24 at Park Lincoln Hotel, 166 West 75th Street.25 I am asking that you do not raise10 
2 the rent for SRO tenants.	I am a senior citizen.3 I have $753 a month. I pay $420 a month for my4 income which is about 56 percent of my income.5 And the condition in the building is6 outrageous.	We have roaches running upstairs with7 mouse.	And downstairs they have a restaurant, the8 Cesca, where all, you know, the fashionable people9 are eating there.	And when they are eating there,10 you know, in the part of the restaurant, upstairs,11 I have peelings, plasters peelings coming down in12 my food if I am eating.13 And, you know, besides that, the14 landlord is making a lot of money. He's making15 millions of dollars with that restaurant16 downstairs.	And he's doing illegal things also.17 You know, raising our rent illegally. And he also18 has	you know, we have two different kind of19 people living, SRO people and he has some kind of20 thing he calls kitchenette people that, you know,21 they are paying $1,700, $2,000 a month, you  know,22 for rent.23 So, you know, I'm asking you, please24 do not raise the rent for SRO tenants.	And from25 what I understand they have - - all the SROs it's2 
2 even worse .	They have people, they are renting3 like hotels on a daily basis and they have no4 control, the SROs .	There is no control of what5 they do.6 And, you know, I'm asking you,7 please do not raise the rent for SRO tenants. And8 that will force people to become homeless also by9	raising rents.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11	MS. PAULETTE PETION:	You're12 welcome.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any questions?14 (No response.)15 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.16 (Applause.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Steve Herrick?18 (No response .)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jamil Leigh;20 Followed by Alissa Rodriguez;21 Followed by Chris Carroll .22 Mr. Leigh.2 3	MR. JAMIL LEIGH:	Hello.24 My name is Jamil Leigh. I'm a member25 of SPONY . I'm a small property owner.24 
2 And my question I want to pose is,3 people who live in New York City public housing4 they're asked to state their annual income and5 then that income will then be based - - then based6 on their income.	It will then state how much7 their rent will be.8 I just wanted to know if they have9 any guidelines for small property owners who have10 tenants who make $90,000 a year and they're still11 living in rent stabilized building.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	There are none.13 MR. JAMIL LEIGH:	Okay.	So is there14 a reason why15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The law doesn't16 provide for it. The only income test in the law is17 if the apartment is over $2,000 and if the owner18 can prove that for two consecutive years the19 tenants are over $175,000 he can get them out.20 That's the only income test in the law.21 MR. JAMIL LEIGH:	Okay. So there's22 a preference for people who live in public housing23 to get a preferential rent based on their income24 as opposed to a private individual landlord who25 has a - -2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	There is an3 income test in public housing and there is not one4 in private sector housing.5	MR. JAMIL LEIGH:	So I just want to6	pose that question to everybody if7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You're trying8 to point out the inconsistency, is that what9 you're trying to point out?10 MR . JAMIL LEIGH:	Yeah, definitely.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We see it.12 MR. JAMIL LEIGH:	Okay.	Thank you.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 (Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Alissa16 Rodriguez;17 Followed by Chris Carroll;18 Follow by Nicholas Codelessa.19 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Mr. Chair, if I20 could just - -21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.22 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Ms. Rodriguez is a23 summer law student intern at my office at South24 Brooklyn Legal Services. I think she's at her25 second - -12 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. So she's3 just an intern so we won't ask her if you're a4 good boss or not.5 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Right. She wouldn't6 know.7 Go ahead.8	MS . ALISSA RODRIGUEZ :	Good9	afternoon. Thank you.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Get a little11 close to the mike.12 MS . ALISSA RODRIGUEZ:	As Mr .13 Languedoc said, my name is Alissa Rodriguez . I am14 a student at Brooklyn Law School.	I am an intern15 at South Brooklyn Legal Services and I'm here to16 present testimony for LSNY and the Legal Aid17 Society.18 You'll all be receiving copies of19 this written testimony so there's really no need20 for me to recite it to you .21 My purpose here is to ask you not to22 simply skim over these pages  (indicating) and  toss23 them aside to be buried under all your other24 considerations.	Instead, I implore you to25 remember that we are talking about people's lives.10 
2 We are talking about families, women and children,3 elderly and disabled, all of whom are at risk of4 becoming homeless .5 In these pages you will read a lot6 of dry, boring statistics and they are faceless,7 they are nameless.	They do not have human stories8 attached to them . These people sitting here today9 are the embodiment of these statistics. These10 people are the ones you have to keep in mind when11 you're reading this testimony.12 You'll read in these pages about13 people who face rent burdens of 55 percent of14 their income. I'm not the first person here who's15 told you that today, 55 percent of their income.16 And we're not even talking about people who make17 minimum wage or subsist solely on fixed incomes of18 SSI, Public Assistance. We are talking about19 students like me. I can't afford to live here. If20 I didn't live in a dormitory, I couldn't afford to21 go to school here.22 You've already heard and will23 continue to hear story after story of hardship .24 And I beg you, please do not let yourselves be25 immune to the barrage of voices. If anything,2 
2 these stories should make you sit up and take3 notice that there are real people suffering and4 real human consequences that result from your5 actions here .6 Should government programs be7 picking up more slack than they are? Absolutely .8 But they're not . That's the reality.	SSI, SSD,9 Section 8, all kinds of public assistance they10 don't make up for the difference and they're not11 going to.12 Even if public assistance programs13 do increase, they're not going to cover a rent14 hike. They're not going to cover the cost of15 living because precedent has shown us that they16 will not . They have not .17 People are already paying more than18 they can afford and they will have no way to19 maintain their homes.	And so I ask you, when you20 get this paper and you read these nameless21 faceless, statistics, please remember the names22 and the faces of the people here today, the people23 who came out to beg you to save their communities24 and their homes.25 Thank you.2 
2CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Thank you .3MR . LANGUEDOC:Thank you.4(Applause.)5CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Very good. I'm6	going to recommend you a full-time job.7	MS . ALISSA RODRIGUEZ:	How about8	pay?	I don't get paid.9	(Laughter.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We'll recommend11 that too.	We always have the other side here, the12 landlord side, they pay. They pay .13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I have to tell14 you, you 're a great - - well, my grandmother15 graduated Brooklyn Law in 1912 so you're doing16 great .17 MR . LANGUEDOC:	Is that right?18 That's amazing .19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Great.20 Chris Carroll, are you still here?21 Thank you. Hold on a second.22 Nicholas Codelessa (phonetic) ?23 (No response. )24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Followed by25 Harold Lotsey.10 
2	Mr. Carroll, go ahead.3	MR. CHRIS CARROLL:	I'm a writer.4 I live in Dexter House SRO on West 86th Street5 whose owner/manager is Dale Wartski and Robert6 Goicochea are being sued by the New York City  Law7 Department for illegal hotel rentals in my8 building.9 Today at 1 p .m . as I picked up my10 mail from the desk in the lobby, manager Goicochea11 harassed me, which he has done repeatedly for the12 last two years ever since he discovered I was a13 leader of the tenants association.14 In November of 2005 he threatened to15 kill me. The criminal owners of my building do not16 deserve a rent increase.17 This is - - this is the third year I18 have testified before this Board and I see that19 Mr . Markus is still the Chairman; that a rich man20 who works for Goldman Sachs decides the rent21 increases for over two million middle and low22 income New Yorkers is intolerable.23 The Rent Guidelines Board --24 (Applause.)25 MR. CHRIS CARROLL:	The Rent4 
2 Guidelines Board is not elected and therefore not3 democratic.	Chairman Markus, over many years, you4 have put the squeeze on millions of New Yorkers5 and made thousands homeless by your rent6 increases.	You are an enemy of the people.	You7 ride in the hip pocket of the rich landlords. If8 you had a shred of honor, you would resign your9 chairmanship and campaign actively for the repeal10 of the Urstadt Law .11 (Applause.)12 MR . CHRIS CARROLL:	You will go down13 in New York history as a symbol of blatant abuse14 of power and blatant corruption.	Like Boss Tweed,15 you deserve to be tarred and feathered and  ridden16 out of this town on a rail .17 Go to hell,	Mr . Markus, where you18 belong and which you richly deserve.19 (Applause .)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Nicholas21 Codelessa?22 (No response.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Harold Lotsey.24 Mr. Lotsey, are you here?25 Followed by Rita Dicarlo;2 
2 Herbert Rock, who I think has left3 who is the man who prayed for us; and4 Doris McGibney.5 So Mr. Lotsey, go ahead.6 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	Thank you.7 I reside at 355 West 20th Street .8 And I live in an SRO.	And I don't want my9 landlord to increase my rent, because he's an10 a-h-o-1-e, okay.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.12 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	And his name13 is Ti-Hua Chang for Channel 2 News.	He's a14 journalist, whatever you want to call him .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That's who your16 landlord is?17 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	That's who my18 landlord is, yeah .	And I'm the last person there19 now , okay.	All the other people, they were20 elderly and one's in assisted living right now21 because he couldn't take the landlord anymore22 because he was harassing him .23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Your landlord is24 Ti Wang Chang or he did a story?25 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	Yes. No, my2 
2landlordisTiWang Chang, right.3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Okay.4MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:Beg your5	pardon?	Okay . So don't want him to raise my rent.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you subject7	to the proviso? You said you were an SRO or not?8 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	Yes, I am.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And is the10 building subjected to the proviso so your rent11 doesn't go up?12 MR . HAROLD LOTSEY:	My rent does not13 go up, no.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.15 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	So far.16 MS. HOLDER:	How many units are in17 your building?18 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	I'm the last19 one.20 MS. HOLDER:	Oh, he's the last one.21 MR . HAROLD LOTSEY:	He renovated22 the basement, first floor and the third and fourth23 floors.	So he did this in the third and fourth24 floor and they got tenants on the second floor and25 the basement.10 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You ought to get3	the opposing channel to do story on him.4	MR . HAROLD LOTSEY:	So - - yeah, not5 him anyway.6 I'm the last one there on the  second7 floor .8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'm sure CBS9 would be interested in doing the story about the10 NBC reporter.11	MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	Yeah, right.12 MR. LANGUEDOC:	How long has he13 owned your building?14 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	Only in 1997 I15 think he bought the building.	I've been there for16 almost 18 years now.17 MS . HOLDER :	And you say you live18 on West 20th?19 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	Beg your pardon?20 MS . HOLDER:	West 20th Street?21 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	West 20th,22 right . And I don't want him to get a rent23 increase.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.25 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	Okay?12 
2 And also I got an air conditioner3 problem, okay.	I got an air conditioner in my4 window and he charges me an extra $25 a month for5 12 months.	Now, why is that?6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We don't know7 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	It's legal.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What?9 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	It's legal that10 he does that, but how can I get that law changed?11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	For the law12 change you have to go to Albany or the13 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	You've got to be14 kidding me.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Or there might16 be a regulation.	So you need to17 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	It's very18 simple, you pay $99.	You put the air conditioner19 in the window, okay.	For June, July, August,20 September, okay, October, November, December,21 January, February and March and April I still have22 to pay the $25 a month when you're not using the23 air conditioner.24 If I took the air conditioner out,25 it doesn't matter, I still have to pay the  $2512 
2	extra per month.	I mean common sense.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You should talk4 to the State Division of Housing and Community5 Renewal and maybe they can help you, but we can't.6	MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	And where's7	that?	Where are they at?8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	They're at Broad9	Street.10 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	Well, I can find11 out.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	25 Beaver Street13 which is actually the back end of 65  Broad Street.14 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	But it's got to15 be a couple of people. I mean it's not just me.16 It's a lot of other people who are low income,17 okay, who are on disability and they rely on their18 one sole income, okay .	And like for myself, I got19 to pay an extra $25 a month. It's a hardship.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We understand.21 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	You know. And22 my landlord will not budget from that . He goes23 it's a law .24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I think you've25 got a lot of leverage on your landlord .10 
2	MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	He doesn't have3 to charge me that .	You know, for good will he4 could just charge me four months, but he won't do5 it. Okay.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.7 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY :	Anybody want to8	ask me anything?9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10	MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you, sir.11	MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	Nobody? No?12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What?13 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	Are you going14 to ask me any questions15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No more16 questions, no.17 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	-- about Ti-Hua18 Chang, the great Ti-Hua Chang?	No?19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No, no.20 MR. HAROLD LOTSEY:	Okay. Thank you21 very much .22	MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.2 3	(Applause. )24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Rita Dicarlo?25 Rita Dicarlo, are you here?24

VICKI LABOWSKI:	Don't worry,7	I'm not going to tell you to go to hell.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That's okay .9 Followed by Jimmy Silber .10 A VOICE:	What number are you up11 to?12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We are up to 62 in13 the tenants and we have an occasional owner .	Mr.14 Silber is No. 17 on the owners. But we're up to15 62. We are in the people who are no longer16 pre-registered and these are the people who came17 in.18 So we're at 62. Rita Dicarlo. Go19 ahead.20 MS . RITA DICARLO:	My name is Rita21 Dicarlo . I reside at 2130 Broadway in the22 Beacon - -23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	A little24 stronger .25 MS . RITA DICARLO:	-- operated by10 
2 Beekway Operating Corporation, 2130 Broadway, the3 Beacon, 75th and Broadway.4 On the exterior it looks like a5 palace. On the interior it's hell. I moved in6 there seven years ago in July 2000 .7 Within days I had a flood in my8 apartment.	Overnight, there was a flood that the9 uneven floors that are concrete so that  the10 Buildings Department won't do anything about it11 when they come and inspect and find the  uneven12 floors because it can't be fixed so the landlord13 gets away with that.14 The puddle that collected, because15 the building is obviously on a slant, went east,16 and filled the hallway and went under my kitchen17 sink.	Moldy in the cabinet. They didn 't fix it18 for seven months.	And me	trying to be a nice19 little cooperative new	new forced tenant20 because I took a room there for $300 a night and21 then I demanded a lease, which they didn't give me22 and I became a permanent resident anyway - - didn't23 ask the Health Department to come in because I was24 trying to cooperate with the landlord hoping25 they'd realize I wasn't a nutty person that they2 
2 were going to want to get rid of. That didn't3 matter.4 They removed the mold and then they5 proceeded to do other things to me. They ended up6 discontinuing my housekeeping service that I'm7 allowed to have once a week because it's a class B8 hotel.9 For two years it took to settle it10 while I was disabled with -- I had three surgeries11 and I couldn't clean for myself and I didn't have12 the money to pay anyone so my apartment became13 very bad. They didn't exterminate.14 The reason why I know they can get15 away with this because they haven't had an16 increase since 1998 and they shouldn't have17 because they've been doing this to other people18 I've investigated in the building.	And the DHCR19 regulation says that they have to make the20 decrease in rent for reduction go back to the last21 rent guidelines increase which was zero and they22 say they owe me zero.23 So they can't - - they don't even24 have to pay - - they don't get - - they don't - -25 they do this with impunity because they know that2 
2 it's going to take three or four years and you're3 going to have to live in this hell hole and then4 you're going to find out that they're not going to5 give you a decrease in your rent.	And if they6 did, it would only be $50 a month for all your7 suffering . And I've got mold spore poisoning and8 I'm on - - I have a heart condition because of it.9 I'm suing them. I'm going to win.10 And folks, I want you to know, hold out for 300 or11 $400,000.	Don't take the $100,00 when they first12 offer it because they really want you out of these13 hotels because you're there for 20 years, they get14 $300,000 . They lose $200 - - two million six15 hundred thousand if you stay. Go for more. These16 people are criminals.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .19 We're going to have to take one20 five-minute break for the stenographer, okay. And21 then Vicki Labowski.22 MR . LANGUEDOC:	Thank you very23 much.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 We'll be back in five minutes.2 
2 (At 4:30 p.m., the hearing was3 temporarily recessed.)4 (At 4:36 p .m ., the hearing resumed. )5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. We r re6 back.7 Vicki.	We r re getting started here.8 Appreciate your patience.9 Okay . Go ahead .10 MS. VICKI LABOWSKI:	My name is11 Vicki Labowski. I live at 345 West 86th Street,12 the Dexter House SRO.13 And in 2004 the building was using14 about 33 rooms as hotel rooms which they were15 using for about five years, but we didnr t know16 that it was illegal to have hotel rooms in our17 building. There are 261 units in the SRO that is18 the Dexter House.19 So because of the management that is20 full of harassments and evicting people with a lot21 of harassment and a lot of unlawful evictions,22 they now have 90 rooms. So within three  years,23 rather than using 33 rooms for hotel rentals, they24 have 90 rooms, okay.25 So these rooms rent for about $80 on2 
2 the average a night. So per night 80 times 90 is3 $7,200 per night.	And that amounts to about 4	$216,000, $216,000 per month.5 Now those same 90 rooms would be on6 the average of about $500 per month, okay. So $5007 times 90 is $45,000 per month. So the building is8 really making $216,000 a month on 90 rooms that9 are worth $45,000 a month.10 Now, that to me - - I just want to11 say that this 80 percent proviso is really12 important.	So when the building now of 261 units,13 80 - - we're below that so we don't get a rent14 increase now.	But we hope that that will stay15 intact because take a small building, even a16 townhouse that has like 20 units, if they're17 renting even three of those as hotel rooms, none18 of those tenants need to be paying rent . So these19 landlords don't really need the money if they're20 renting, really even in a small building five or21 ten rooms as hotel rooms.22 I have with me a DVD of a TV23 interview that I did with the Tenants Association.24 And it explains the whole situation at the Dexter25 House.	And this situation - it's on here -5 
2 explains a lot of the ins and outs of the3 harassment and they way they do it when they try4 to empty these buildings.5 And it goes for - - this explanation6 goes for every other SRO in all of Manhattan7 including all five boroughs. So I'd like to submit8 this as my testimony.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.10 MS. VICKY LABOWSKI:	Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 MR. LANGUEDOC :	Thank you .13 (Applause .)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Silber.15 Go ahead, you want to say one more16 thing?17 MS. VICKI LABOWSKI:	This is going18 to be on TV tonight at 9:30 p.m., this video .19 There are two parts to it .	But one of the parts20 is tonight at 9:30 p.m. on Channel 34.	It's 3021 minutes, that one.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.23 (Applau se. )24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Silber.25 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Hello.10 
2 I'm Jimmy Silber. I'm Vice President3 of SPONY, the Small Property Owners of New York.4 We had a SPONY meeting two weeks ago5 in preparation for the Rent Guidelines Board. And6 I'm here to tell you that sadly people told me7 that they weren't corning to testify because they8 said the Rent Guidelines Board ignores us as small9 owners, that we go every year to testify. The Rent10 Guidelines Board never helps us. They say they're11 interested. They realize that small owners are12 crucial, they're the key of housing in this City13 and they fall through the cracks and yet the Rent14 Guidelines Board never helps us.15 And they say that the guidelines16 increases over the last 15 years have averaged17 three percent a year, three percent. This Board18 was created to prevent profiteering . Well, three19 percent a year, healthcare goes up more than three20 percent. Gasoline goes up more than three percent.21 Everything goes up more than three percent.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So we're23 preventing profiteering then .24 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	But you've gone25 overboard and you haven 't helped the people that2 
2 are falling through the cracks.3 Just look at the numbers . Since this4 Bloomberg Board was appointed in 2002, in five5 years the average Price Index for the five years6 is 7.2 percent. What's the average Rent Guidelines7 Board increase? 3 .4 percent.8 Even the Core Index, taking out the9 volatility of fuel, the core for five years came10 out to 5 .9 percent . The Rent Guideline's Board11 one-year increase, 3.4 percent. Even taking the12 traditional commensurate rate adjustment that the13 Rent Guidelines staff prepares for you every year,14 for five years, the traditional average is 5 .915 percent . What is the Board giving for a one-year16 lease, average, 3 .4 percent .17 So owners, they have justification18 here. They say why should we go down and tell our19 stories and nobody listens, nobody helps us,20 nobody cares. They keep telling us tenants can't21 afford to pay more. That's what all the small22 owners tell me. They keep saying they can't give23 more than three percent because tenants can't24 afford it. But the hypocrisy in the system is, the25 system doesn't even measure whether a tenant can2 
2 afford to pay more. That's the inequity in this3 system.	Small owners have second jobs to run4 their buildings. They have tenants who have been5 in place for years and years. They don't get6 exempt apartments. They don't get a chance to7 raise rents high to meet expenses. They have long8 term tenants because their buildings are the best9 kept building and people don't want to move.10 If this Board could help them by11 doing special things. You could give a longevity12 increase. You could give a low rent adjustment.13 That used to be something the Board gave every14 year. We don't have that anymore . You could give a15 longevity increase.	You could have given it the16 year when we had such huge taxes and we had a 16.917 percent Price Index. You could have had a18 surcharge for that year, an $8 surcharge for real19 estate. That Board has done that before with fuel20 when fuel went through the roof. But this Board21 has consistently done nothing.22 You are locked into a small box of23 where you come up with a number and it's around24 three percent.	And owners just feel what is the25 point of going down there to argue to try to get2 
2 three-and-a-quarter instead of three percent. On a3 $600 apartment, a quarter percent is $1.50 for me4 a month. That's enough the pay for the phone call5 for the plumber.6 So it's sad to say you don't have a7 big turnout of small owners because they just8 don't believe this process is going to help them.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have a10 question.11 MS . CRUZ:	Mr . Silber?12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on a second.13 We have a question from Risa.14 MS . CRUZ:	Oh, sorry.15 MS. LEVINE:	How many members do16 you have?17 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	We have about a18 thousand throughout the City.19 MS. LEVINE:	And can you just20 explain to me the incentive to stay as small21 property owners and not sell when you're, you22 know, you're saying that you're losing money every23 year.24 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Most -- almost25 all of our owners live in their own buildings,2 
2 okay.	Many of them inherited them .	They're third3 generation. Many of them are immigrants who came4 to the United States and bought a building to have5 a space for their family and they inherited rent6 regulated apartments within their apartments .7 So they're people that live in their8 buildings. They want to stay there. It's their9 home.	They're not apt to - - they're not10 speculators. They're not - - they're not in it to11 make a profit and sell and move onto something12 else.	They live in their homes. Most of them have13 second jobs.14 So those that are selling are the15 ones that are in neighborhood where the costs have16 gone up so high and the rents are so low in their17 buildings that the three percent increase from the18 Rent Guidelines Board just doesn't help them meet19 expenses. Those are the people that finally have20 to give up and move.21 MS . CRUZ:	You answered my22 question . That was --23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	He answered the24 question.	Very good.25 MR . SCHLEIDER:	I have a question.2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider3 has a question for you.4	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you, Jim,5 for coming down.6 In spite of the lack of support that7 you have internally within your organization for8 this -- which is a shame because the small9 property owners really are the backbone of the10 rent stabilizing housing stock.11	But something came up as a12 discussion in the meetings this year. What13 percentage of the small properties would you say14 have commercial income or could rely on  sources15 other than the apartments themselves to help16 defray the expenses?17 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Very few .	Very18 few have commercial income.	Most of them are on19 side streets.	If they're in Manhattan, they're on20 side streets so there's no commercial space at21 all.	Very few are on avenues.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right .23 MR . JIMMY SILBER:	And most in the24 outer boroughs are in very residential areas. They25 don't have any commercial space.12 
1	3732 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So when the staff3 produces the reports and shows that there's4 commercial income that may be considered as an5 offset to expense, it really doesn't impact your6 thousand-plus members.7 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	No.	I'd think8 you'd find that more in larger buildings and9 certainly smaller buildings on the avenues.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	What would11	you say would be an appropriate rent increase then12 or meaningful rent increase for your constituents?13 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	I would say --14 well, I would propose a low rent adjustment.	I15 would propose just a percentage increase because16 of the owner who has a $500 or $600 rental, three17 percent, you know, is $18 a month. That won't even18 pay for the cost of calling a plumber once for a19 repair in that apartment.20 So and most of our owners, as Isaid21 before, have tenants who have been in place for a22 long time and they pay rents that are archaic.23	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right.24	MR. LANGUEDOC:	What do you mean by 25
2 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	It's the system.3 It's not the tenant's fault.	The owner -- the4 owner doesn't blame the tenant.	Our owners get5 along with our tenants. We live in the  same6 building.	There's harmony in small buildings.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So it's just a8 matter of a combination of a few elements that9 will go towards shifting10 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Yeah. And then11 when, you know, we have an owner who has a second12 job, she's a teacher and she comes home and she's13 somebody who's paying $600 for a one-bedroom14 apartment and is driving up in his car from his15 weekend vacation in the Hamptons where he has a16 second house.17 You know, she thinks why - - is this18 equitable? Shouldn't the system at least  measure19 if the tenant needs the subsidy?	If she's the one20 who solely bears the responsibility of subsidizing21 that tenant, then don't we owe her the bear22 minimum to make sure that that tenant deserves to23 be protected?24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And typically how25 many violations would be on a building like that?2 
2 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Most of our3 small owners don't have violations on their4 buildings. They live in their buildings.5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Has SPONY ever7 advocated an income test in Albany for rent --8	MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Yes. Means9	tests.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And what's been11 your success level?12 MR . JIMMY SILBER:	Zero.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	So it's14 not this Board that's necessarily disagreeing.15 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	No, but you16 could do other things that have been done in the17 past by the Rent Guidelines Board to help owners,18 to help small owners. The low rent adjustment was19 something that was geared to a small owner.20 You could have real estate21 surcharges in years where the real estate taxes22 are enormous. You could have a longevity allowance23 for tenants who have been in place for more than24 12 years.25 You could have a special surcharge10 
1	3762 for small owners who have buildings. You pick a3 number, say 20 units . If you own a building or 204 units or less, you get an $8 surcharge. If you5 live in your building, you get an $8 surcharge.6 (Audience participation.)7 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	This Board could8 be very creative in what they do to help  small9	owners but they don't.	They never do. You're10 locked into like this fixed -- this fixed11 parameter of like two to four percent, year after12 year after year .	And that's why small owners have13 given up because what's the difference if  they14 come down and tell you their problems.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Adriene.16 MS. HOLDER:	For the last about17 three or four years, I believe it has been, this18 Board has adopted rent increases on one and19 two-year leases for apartments where the spread20 was three percent.21 Have you seen that more and more of22 your members tenants and your tenants are taking23 one-year lease renewals as opposed to two-year24 lease renewals?25 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	I think most10 
2 take one-year renewals.	I think that's always3 been the case.4	MS . HOLDER:	And hasn't that been5 of a benefit to you and your members, you know, in6 terms of being able to see and realize the rents7 going up higher year by year?8	MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Well, three9 percent a year over 15 years, you know, what are10 we talking? We're not talking about a lot of money11 here. Three percent a year in 15 years.12 Things that you buy for yourself go13 up more than three percent a year.14 MS. HOLDER:	I understand. But I15 was just talking --16 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Our expenses go17 up more than three percent.18 MS. HOLDER:	I was just asking19 about the spread though .20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The spread .21 MS. HOLDER :	I'm just asking22 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	It's23 meaningless.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Meaningless.25 MS . HOLDER:	The spread is9 
2	meaningless so we don't need - -3	MR. JIMMY SILBER:	No, the spread4 is important.	Whether they take a one or5 two-year lease in the whole realm of whether6 owners make enough to support their buildings  is7 meaningless.8	MS . HOLDER:	So do you see a lot9 of your members getting out of the business of10 being landlords?11	MR. JIMMY SILBER:	If - - unless they12 have inherited their buildings, like I said13 before, if	and they have an emotional14 attachment to it and they've raised a family there15 and they don't want to leave, they stick  on.16 But when their children grow up and17 move away, they're getting out. They're  selling.18 There's no point. It's such a struggle. It is such19 a struggle. And there's so many expenses that the20 Price Index which you use as a barometer for what21 owners should get for increases - -22 (Audience participation.)23 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	The Price Index24 doesn't capture so many expenses that owners have25 to pay for that the system just drives them out.12 
2 MS. HOLDER:	Thinking about the3 types of studies that this Board does, I mean, you4 know, I actually would agree with you that I think5 that we should be looking at different ways to6 deal with this.	We may not agree as to what those7 ways are, but I do agree with you that this Board89CHAIRMAN MARKUS:We actually10disagreeastowhat - -11 MS. HOLDER:	What?12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You might13 actually disagree as to what they are.14 MS . HOLDER:	Yes. We actually would15 probably disagree as to what they are.	But I do16 agree that this Board, being a part of the whole17 process of trying to make some sense of what we're18 doing with our housing stock, should perhaps look19 for other ways in which to deal with what we're20 charged with here.21 But thinking about perhaps the22 report, one of the things we look at or we study,23 can you think of other things that we should be24 looking at? I mean it would also be helpful like25 counties outside of New York if it was actually11 
2 the case that landlords would open their books and3 then we could definitely identify those landlords4 who are actually experiencing the most hardship.5	MR. JIMMY SILBER:	You know, New6 York -- New York is so diverse. There's so many7 different real estate markets in New York. And8 you know, to give one increase that covers9 everybody is just - - it's absurd.10 If you live in the best area of New11 York on Fifth Avenue and 75th Street overlooking12 Central Park West, shouldn 't you be expected to13 pay more than somebody's who's living on the Grand14 Concourse?	And yet if you're rent stabilized,15 your rent increase goes up three percent. Why16 should that be? Maybe there should be separate17 separate increases for Manhattan and separate18 increase for other boroughs.19 MS. HOLDER:	But I mean someone20 would argue that a three-percent increase on an21 apartment that rents for $680 versus a22 three-percent increase on an apartment that rents23 for, you know, $1,600 is two very different24 things, right?25 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Well, we've6 
2 suggested in the past giving an increase per room.3 A room increase - -4 (Audience participation.)5 MR . JIMMY SILBER:	You know, like6 $20 per room.	So somebody who has a large7 apartment would get more of an increase than8 somebody who has a studio. That would make sense.9 There are a lot of things that make sense but10 they're never - - we just talk about it every year.11 (Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The three does13 not apply - -14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma'am, the three16 minutes does not apply to questions.	In fact, Mr .17 Silber is being questioned by the tenant reps who18 are extending his time so please keep quiet.19 (Audience participation.)20 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	There are many21 creative things this Board could do and it's done22 them in the past, as I said.23 When fuel went through the roof,24 this Board gave a surcharge for one year of $8  one25 year and $12 another year, for one year. This2 
2 Board could have done it the year I said the real3 estate taxes were enormous.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, the fuel5 surcharge, as you know, was declared - - we can't6 do it anymore.7 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Yes, you can.8 You can't -- you're not allowed to have openers in9 the middle of the guidelines Board, but you can10 have a surcharge. You can pass a surcharge now.11 You just can't do it after the guidelines have12 been set. You can't go back and do re-openers, but13 you could pass a surcharge.14 You could pass a surcharge for15 tenants who have been in place for 15 years who,16 if you don't want to pass a low rent adjustment,17 pass a longitude adjustment. Do something to show18 small owners that you care about them.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Any20 MS. CRUZ:	Ido.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.	Magda.22 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Silber, what happens23 when a small owner is forced, because of these24 economic constraints, to have to sell?	What25 happens to that type of housing generally in your5 
2	experience?3	MR. JIMMY SILBER:	It's obvious that4 the best housing is going to be owner occupied5 housing.	It 's obvious. If that owner, who lives6 in that building moves and sells it whomever who7 doesn't live there, an absentee owner, whomever,8 the building is never going to be run as well.9 The tenants are not happy. The10 tenants love to have owners in their building.11 When I rent apartments in my building and I tell12 the tenants that I live in the building, they are13 ecstatic because they know the building  is going14 to be kept in great condition.15 (Audience participation.)16 MS. CRUZ:	So do you believe that17 there would be a net loss of affordable housing by18 the fact that a small property owner is required19 because of these economic constraints to sell?20 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Yeah.21 MS. CRUZ:	Do you think that the22 next owner in line to buy this house or this small23 building would be more likely to be a speculator24 as opposed  to a long-time,  live-in property owner?25 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	I think it4 
2	definitely effects this stability of the3	neighborhood if you have absentee owners as4	opposed to owner-occupied houses, definitely.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, Mr.6 Silber .7 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Thank you .8 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Doris McGibney;10 Followed by Jean Grillo;11 Followed by Edwin Black.12 Doris, go ahead.13 MS. DORIS MCGIBNEY :	Hi. Good14 evening, 5 p.m . I think.15 Anyway, my name is Doris Claire16 McGibney.	I reside at 152 West 14th Street, No. 17	9 .18 I've lived in an SRO for 11 years.19 I've done everything within my means to make it20 livable, $4,000 . I leveled and had a new floor put21 in.	Ceramic tile, stainless sink,	everything.22 I'm a very clean person. I work full time. I'm a23 good citizen. I vote. I take care of my24 neighborhood and my neighbors.25 9/11 came, I went right down to my18 
2 neighborhood to the 6th Precinct.	We have two3 officers, one from the Bomb Squad and one  that4 took care of Hudson with a young family. I left5 two checks.	That's what I'm about.	And I pay6 into my own healthcare. I don't take a dime from7 anyone. I help others, if anything .8 My landlord has harassed me beyond9 since 2003, since I contacted the SRO Law Project.10 I never knew what an SRO was.  When I walked into11 that room, I cried.	My friend said, you can fix12 anything up. You'll do it. It was so filthy and13 disgusting the floor. The window had nicotine on14 it.	Had to use Oven Off to clean.15 I've had asthma and breathing16 situations since I've lived in that building . And17 yes, others have.	I am a creative individual, but18 I still work full time. We have other creative19 people in my building and they are well educated,20 Drew University, Fordham University, okay.21 You know, they say SRO. When I tell22 people I live on west 14th and 7th, they look at23 me and go, oh, you live in the Veermer?	No, I24 don't.	I can't afford it. Would I leave tomorrow25 if I found housing?	Absolutely I would.	I put in2 
2 for, you know, the application s.	I get it on my3 computer from Bloomberg's department.4 I recently filled out an application5 for housing. I hope I get it. But I have my shoes6 painted in the hall when I asked for heat. I had7 to go to a hospital because I couldn't breathe8 when for one month they didn't give us heat . And I9 am paying	I just started paying for the10 ambulance to the New York Fire Department. I've11 injured my hand in their shower . I had to pay for12 therapy. I couldn't even hold a pen. They have13 letters from my doctors and they do nothing but14 harass.15 The most recent harassment I kept16 asking them to clean out a room in five feet of17 trash that was abandoned . A man with a mask went18 in there and cleaned it out. They never fully19 cleaned it.	They took the door and put it on the20 side where I live because they know I am very21 clean person and they know about my allergies.22 I paid someone to get rid of one bug23 off the door.	I put on the mask and sprayed the24 door. They removed the door recently. I contacted25 the City Board of Health. I guess it's back in2 
2 that room that still hasn't been cleaned.3 When they removed the door, they4 took a mop that those hallways haven't been clean.5 They've been cleaned twice in a year. They took a6 filthy mop and put it in a sink where I have like7 a shared bathroom out in the hall.8 The rust is pouring from the sink.9 It's corroded. The floor is coming up . I covered10 the hole because roaches were coming out. I don't11 even wear shoes in my place. You're welcome to12 come and see it. It's something for a magazine. I13 take pride in it.14 That's all I can -- he's horrible15 and disgusting.	s.w. Wasserman Management, LLC .16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you

That particular owner11 of that store is now going to open up a new porn12 store he's doing so well and rent from the owner13 in the middle, Olga, another SRO.	Those are all14 foreign people . They wouldn 't say a word. He'd pay15 her and do whatever.16 So they're opening up some kind of17 porn shop with holes and boots .	That's what we're18 going to go out to.	Maybe he's going to rent them19 the rooms.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Any21 additional --22 MS. DORIS MCGIBNEY:	It's23 disgusting.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any additional25 questions?4 
1	3892	(No response.)3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4	MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you .5 (Applause .)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jean Grillo;7 Followed by Edwin Black;8 Followed by Council Member Gail9 Brewer.10 MS. JEAN GRILLO :	My name's Jean11 Grillo and I am the Downtown Independent Democrat12 District Leader for Tribeca and also a member of13 Community Board #1 and a 30-year resident of Lower14 Manhattan.15 For years I addressed my comments16 concerning Lower Manhattan and I will do so today.17 However, I must add that those I've raised and18 those I love who live in other parts in the City19 are also being effected.	We're talking about20 college educated, working and well paying jobs who21 are being tossed out of the City in the same way22 as the poor and working class and others seeking23 affordable housing.24 My daughter is living in25 Williamsburg .	She commutes to Manhattan.	I have7 
1	3902 two nieces who teach in Brooklyn and the Bronx.3 They are living in the outer boroughs of Queens.4 All of them are paying market rent. All of them5 are leaving. They cannot afford to stay in the6 City.7 My daughter works with children with8 cancer.	She is a pediatric psychologist.	She's9 going to go to Louisville, Kentucky because she10 can't live in New York City. You are losing a11 valuable resource.12 (Applause.)13 MS. JEAN GRILLO:	We have massive14 evictions, massive evictions going on Downtown for15 both rent regulated and free market buildings.16 I just want to put into the record,17 we have at 131, 135 Duane Street, we have the18 owners of the City Hall Restaurant evicting ten19 long-time artists.	They're all over the age of20 60.	Many over the age of 65. This is rent21 stabilized apartment.22 They have a phony demolition where23 they're saying that they're going to destroy the24 building when they're not. They're only destroying25 the rent regulated apartment.2 
2 In Battery Park City we have people3 paying between to $2,000 to $4,000 a month.	They4 are being evicted, given 60-day notices because5 their rents are going from $2,710 to $5,200 and6 these people are being told you have 60 days to7 get out.8 What I'm telling you9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What building10	is that?11	MS. JEAN GRILLO:	This is -- I'll12 submit the Battery Park - - Battery Park City13 Broadsheet.	They interviewed several families in14 the River Rose, and I'm quoting . This one family15 that are moving to Marblehead, Massachusetts,16 their rents went from $2,700 to $3,295 and then it17 went up to $42 - - $4,100.	They were told, the18 women in the management company told us you  have19 to	got to make more money. She said people like20 us can't afford to live here anymore .21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	These are not22 rent stabilized units?23 MS. JEAN GRILLO:	No.	What I'm24 telling you is that quickly, my recommendations25 are that we have a housing crisis.	Freeze rent12 
2 increases until the City and state deal with this3 affordable housing crisis including going into4 50/50 rather than 80/20 affordable housing splits.5 We need to lift vacancy decontrol.6 You've got to keep and protect and expand7 Mitchell-Lama. People in IPN are being evicted  on8 all kinds of technicalities - not dotting an ''I,"9 mailing something to a wrong address.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	IPN, you mean11 Independence Plaza North?12 MS. JEAN GRILLO:	Independence Plaza13 North, yes, exactly.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It's a15 Mitchell-Lama .16 MS . JEAN GRILLO:	That's a17 Mitchell-Lama?18 And what I'm saying is that in my19 own personal situation, I live in a rent20 stabilized loft on Duane Street. I help	I paid21 s o  percent of my owner's costs to bring this22 building up to code.	As soon as that was done23 and we lived and paid our rents .	And I work full24 time and my husband is an artist and he worked25 the building was sold at an enormous profit to2 
2	this particular owner.	She sold it for nearly $53	million. I was happy to see her gain all this4 money as long as I kept my rent stabilized5 apartment.6 But with these evictions happening7 to rent stabilized buildings with these phony8 demolitions and technicalities and stuff and I9 being out of work after 9/11 - - I'm 62 . My10 husband is 65.	He's ill.	My fear is that not11 only can my daughter not live here, but as I as12 grow old I am going to be kicked out as well.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you in the14 building, the City Hall building or not?15 MS. JEAN GRILLO:	No.	That's on16 my street.	And the Downtown Independence17 Democrats and others have been picketing the18 owners from day one because it's an illegal19 eviction.	It is just a gut renovation. It is not20 a demolition.21 And we are asking for - - and the22 City - - the state recently - - the Commissioner for23 the DHCR recently asked that the initial support24 for that eviction be put on hold and be looked at25 again.	And this is a win because what has been4 
2 happening is landlords around the City are3 cherry-picking individual units and are running4 these phony paper - - demolition paperwork through5 the DHCR . Right now DHCR has 56 phoney demolitions6 pending.	They are kicking us out.7 Any questions?8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9	Any additional questions?10	(No response. )11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.13 MS. JEAN GRILLO:	Thank you.14 (Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Edwin Black .16 MR. EDWIN BLACK:	Hi .	Thanks for17 giving me the opportunity.18 I live in a room also in Manhattan.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Fix your mike.20 MR. EDWIN BLACK:	And I wanted to21 address something that has to do more with22 electricity charge . I'm not sure if I'm going to23 use the terms correctly, these technical  terms,24 electrical  inclusion buildings.25 And I would imagine that rooms in an12 
2 SRO don't have electrical meters so probably  all3 SRO units would be - - would have their electricity4 included in their rent. It's just an assumption I5 would make. So I assume it's pretty synonymous in6 that sense.7 I want to bring up two things: One,8 the fact that I pay $25 a month in my rent, added9 to my rent to -- for the air conditioning. Of10 course, air conditioning is used basically say two11 months or something like that. But it's - - it's12 about $300 a year.	Maybe it went down a little13 bit, up a little bit . Basically it's somewhere in14 that neighborhood of $25.15 So when calculating rent, one really16 should include that extra $25.17 Now, there's another issue which I18 think is also very important and that's the actual19 amount.	I've been writing letters and calling up20 the state basically, Calogero. I cannot get21 through to her. I don't know if she really exists .22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	She's gone .23 MR. EDWIN BLACK:	Oh, okay.24 Roldan was the one I spoke to.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Deborah Van2 
2	Amerongen is the new Commissioner.3	MR. EDWIN BLACK:	Okay. Roldan is4	the one who I eventually5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	He's gone too.6	MR. EDWIN BLACK :	Gone too.	Thank7 goodness.8 (Laughter. )9	MR . EDWIN BLACK:	I don't know10 who's taking their place, but I don 't know if it11 will be more accessible.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Leslie Torres .13 MR. EDWIN BLACK:	Yeah . But it's14 impossible to get through to these people. I mean15 on the phone, I write letters, I yell. Eventually16 when I yell, I go one level up.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Try again .18 MR. EDWIN BLACK:	I tried - - this19 is two years.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	They have new21 people.22 MR . EDWIN BLACK :	Well, I will try.23 But I could show you this letter . I mean basically24 what they say is we decided that, you know, we're25 not going to listen to you so therefore we're  not10 
2 going to give you a meeting .3 The bottom line is anybody who4 understands a little bit about engineering or5 electricity costs and so on can figure out6 approximately how much one room, like an SRO,7 would use up in electricity for an air8 conditioner .9 Now, the air conditioner10 manufacturers obviously have an interest in saying11 that it won't be so much. They'll tell you that12 it's about 24 to 30 - - on the books it will be $3013 for a summer.	You don't have to trust their14 numbers, of course. But if you look at many15 websites that were - - with computations by state16 agencies and other states, you 'll find that the17 numbers are approximately that amount, $30, $40,18 doesn't even get up to $50 for an entire summer.19 And on the one hand we're talking20 about rooms, small rooms . And it gets very,	very21 hot obviously in New York City. And if you're in a22 room rather than in an apartment, you can't do23 cross-ventilation. You maybe have a window and24 probably your window faces either in an interior25 courtyard or in between buildings or something2 
2 like that. It gets very, very hot. It's not a3 luxury, it's a necessity.4 And the amount of electrical use5 that you have for a room is much less obviously6 than an apartment.	Now, the charge that they give7 of $300 a year for air conditioners they say is8 per room.	So they'll claim that, in other words,9 somebody who has an apartment with two bedrooms or10 whatever, three or four rooms, will be using three11 or four air conditioners.	I don't - - I don't12 believe that there's anybody charging and paying13 $1,200 a year extra for air conditioners.	Maybe14 they have only one and they cool off the whole15 house with it .16 In any case, the bottom line is that17 it's totally unfair to charge $300 for the18 electrical usage of an air conditioner in a  room19 when probably it doesn't go beyond $30 or $40 for20 the usage.	So that extra $260 or whatever21 dollars, are an unfair surcharge to many people22 who really, really need this and probably can't23 afford, you know, that amount.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And is that the25 nature -- your letter to DHCR is about that2 
2 subject?3 MR. EDWIN BLACK:	Is about that4 subject, yes.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.	Okay.6	MR. EDWIN BLACK:	And it's7 particularly - - again, it's particularly for8 people living in a small room.	So I think that9 there has to be -- I know that you're talking10 about rent guidelines probably for apartments and11 SROs - -12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.13 MR. EDWIN BLACK:	and so on.14 This is a particular problem I think for SROs.15 Now, there's another issue. The16 state guideline -- the answer to the letter is17 always the same that the state is authorized us to18 charge $300 therefore there's no need for  a19 meeting. That's what they say. In other words, we20 decided and screw you basically.21 So the point is somebody has to make22 a calculation of how much it costs and somebody23 has to then pass some kind of regulation saying24 that if you live in a room rather than an25 apartment, you know, that this calculation  applies7 
2 to you.3 Secondly, the maximum is what is set4 by the guidelines.	In other words, the5 government, the state allows landlords to charge6	up to, and then they write the number, $286, $300,7 whatever it is.	The landlords, of course,  will8 probably charge the maximum that they are allowed.9	So it's not that they are supposed10 to collect this amount from the tenant. This is11 the absolutely maximum that they are allowed to12 and that's also something that ought to be13 changed.	The wording should not necessarily be14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It's not our15 guidelines .16 MR. EDWIN BLACK:	Right. I17 understand. This is the state, but I can't get18 through to the state.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You should try.20 They're new people. They're going to be more21 responsive.22 MR. EDWIN BLACK:	Well, I don't23 know.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And if you have25 a problem, Council Woman Brewer will get you10 
2	through to them .	They're Democrats now .3	MR . EDWIN BLACK :	Okay . Thank you.4 In any case, take this to5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you . Thank6 you.7 (Audience participation.)8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Council Member9	Brewer.10 COUNCIL MEMBER BREWER:	Thank  you11 for that plug, Mr. Chairman.12 My name is Gale Brewer and I13 represent the City Council district on the West14 Side and Northern Clinton.15 I'm here today to request that you,16 as members of the Rent Guidelines Board, support17 no rent increase for residents of residential18 hotels, SROs and rooming houses and the same with19 some guidelines that I'll list for rent  regulated20 tenants .21 I just want to talk about the rent22 regulated apartments for a minute and get into the23 discussion very quickly about talking about some24 of the market issues - although I know you're not25 deciding on that .10 
2 I know that recent press reports3 indicate that thousands of rent regulated housing4 has been lost .	I think we know that, those of us5 who are in the trenches, and it's primarily in6 Manhattan.	Those of us working in this area7 really do know this depressing statistic.8 Just this morning I received a call9 from a family who lives in a market rate unit that10 used to be stabilized. The family now makes with11 two incomes too much to qualify for a rent12 regulated apartment.	The building is slated for13 condo conversion and the new owner sent workers14 around in the middle of the night to paste15 eviction papers on each market rate apartment.16 The children of these families in17 the market rate units grew up in the building.18 They heard the noise in the middle of the night,19 saw the papers on the door and now have nightmares20 about leaving their homes.21 In addition, the new owner is22 converting every inch of space. Dust is23 everywhere.	People are sick and I'm calling City24 agencies for inspections. The market rate units25 have an attorney.	The rent regulated families2 
2 have anther attorney and an entire community is3 uprooted .4 I mentioned this because this scene5 is depicted over and over and over. And I also6 mention this because if the Rent Guidelines Board7 increases, as is proposed under the renewals, any8 percentage, I really believe strongly - and this9 is a very viable alterative - that it be done in a10 way that includes a proviso stipulation that11 whatever percentage you decide on amongst12 yourselves, that is a market or condo co-op, in13 other words, some portions of those units that are14 market or a condo or a co-op, the rent regulated15 units in that building should not receive any16 increase.17 I know that Mayor has been working18 hard to build new affordable units, although very19 few in Manhattan.	And will all due respect to the20 HPD Commissioner, there isn't much support for the21 preservation of affordable units .22 Taking this bold step of23 implementing a proviso would help all New Yorkers24 in our advocacy for affordable housing.25 The Rent Guidelines Board - now2 
2 talking about some of the hotels - has done a3 wonderful report on that topic . I think you know4 that the number of units has decreased5 substantially and I hope that you will continue to6 have no increase for those units.7 And I'm sure you 've had a lot of8 discussion about that today.	We are pushing, with9 DHCR and the Corporation Counsel, to try to keep10 rent regulated tenants get off illegals as much as11 possible, but your job here is just to think  about12 the rent increases or lack thereof.13 You've heard a lot today about the14 number of homeless, a large percentage of income15 that so many tenants pay for rent, the scarcity of16 affordable units.	Obviously vacancy decontrol,17 condo, co-op conversions have all contributed to18 this.	And the Attorney General's office , to his19 credit - and I'm on his Advisory Board on condos20 and co-ops - is working at legislative and21 administrative action.22 I'm just here to urge you as you23 think about ways that you could do sort of terms24 and conditions, as we call it in the Council,25 provisos is what you would call it, think about2 
2 it, as I described above.3 It can also include no increase if4 units are not registered with DHCR, if there are5 too many hazardous violations that are not6 corrected, and if data is not provided to the Rent7 Guidelines Board.8 So I'm here to say that the families9	that we're talking about in these rent regulated10 apartments:	Seniors, vulnerable working families,11 the middle class New Yorkers, they are the12 backbone of our communities.	And I really urge13 the Board to follow a policy that adds to our14 affordable housing base and does not further15 decimate it and there are some very practical  ways16to do that.17Thank you very much.18(Applause.)19CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20Any questions?21Thank you Council Member.22MS. CRUZ:	I have a question.23CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	There's a24question.25MS. CRUZ:	I have a quick question.
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma'am .3	MS. CRUZ:	What district do you4	represent?5	COUNCIL MEMBER BREWER :	It's the6 Sixth Council District from 54th Street to  96th7 Street on the West Side from the Hudson River over8 to Central Park.9	MS . CRUZ:	And among your10	constituents are also small property owners?11	COUNCIL MEMBER BREWER :	Yes.12 MS. CRUZ:	What do they say to13 you?14 COUNCIL MEMBER BREWER :	I'm one of15 them .16 MS. CRUZ:	You are one of them.17 COUNCIL MEMBER BREWER :	I'm not a18 landlord, but I am a small property owner.19 To be honest with you I have - - they20 don't complain about - - they can, in many cases21 get market rate.	They have very few rent22 regulated.	Most of the constituents in my23 district who live in rent regulated units are  in24 large apartment buildings.25 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.12 
2	COUNCIL MEMBER BREWER:	Thank you.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I just want to4 tell you I'm one of your constituents, but I won't5 let anybody know so you don't get into trouble.6 COUNCIL MEMBER BREWER:	Thank you7 very much, Chairman . I appreciate that.8 MS . ADAMS:	I'm one of your9 constituents and I'm willing to let people know .10 COUNCIL MEMBER BREWER:	Thank you11 very much, Betty .12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, you won't13 get into trouble with her.14 COUNCIL MEMBER BREWER:	I know where15 you live, Mr . Markus.16 (Laughter. )17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'm sure you do.18 MS. HOLDER:	And Council Woman,19 I'd like to thank you for your testimony.	And20 although I'm not one of your constituents, I	very21 much appreciate all of your support.22 COUNCIL MEMBER BREWER:	We're a big23 fan. Thank you very much.24 (Applause .)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker4 
2 is Janet Bulan;3 Followed by Judy West;4 Followed by Loren Renz.5 Ms. Bulan.6	MS. JANET BULAN :	Hi.7 My name is Janet Bulan. And we own a8 building that was built in 1883, have been owner9 occupied since the 1920s.10 And as Jimmy was talking about11 before, I have no violations.12 I've been speaking at these hearings13 since the early 80s when my grandfather passed14 away.	I don't know why I bother, because most of15 you don't get the point.16 There are long-term tenants whose17 salaries have increased tremendously over the last18 30-odd years who do exist in well maintained,19 owner/occupied buildings.20 They know that they have a great21 deal, that their rent doesn't come close to cover22 our expenses on average for apartment and that our23 expenses have escalated.	Many of them have even24 said that to me.25 They are willing and could afford  to7 
2 pay a higher rent but don't because the law is3 saying that they don't have to.4	It's - - excuse me. I feel that we do5 a lot of work.	We're paying a lot of bills.6 Everything is going up and people are living7 this is on the Upper East Side - - and have great8 apartments.	And you people don't realize that  we9 need at least $700 in my building per apartment.10 I have a range.	My median rent for11 regulated apartments is $334.39. That includes12 rent control and rent stabilized.	It just isn't13 right and I think that somewhere with all the14 wisdom in the City Council and the Rent Guidelines15 Board and the government, someone could come up16 with some sort of solution and help small owners17 by ourselves.18 They're so many forms we have to19 fill out. There's so much information that tenants20 who are making $100,000, $150,000 and are  paying21 $500 rent, somehow you should be able to come up22 with something like Jimmy said, a longevity23 increase or a low rent increase, something to  help24 us want to stay.25 I mean at this point where it's5 
2 harder and harder to meet expenses, to take care3 of my parents and to do all the work that I do4 everyday. Everyday I'm doing something to keep a5 135-year-old building in good shape. And it is in6 good shape. It's in great shape because my7 grandmother took care of it and now I am.8 I really wasn't going to come down9 today because I didn't feel that good so I didn 't10 prepare a long speech . But whatever Jimmy said I11 agree 100 percent and I think something should be12 fair and equitable with people who could afford13 it.14 And I think people who can't,15 something should be done with them too. There are16 government agencies to help them out. There's so17 many different - - for senior citizens there's the18 SCRIE .	There's different ways to help them and I19 don't think owners should have to pay somebody,20 literally pay someone to live in their building .21 And like Jimmy said, I get along22 fine with my tenants . They like me. I like them23 but it just gets to the point of being very, very24 unfair.25 Thank you.2 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How many units do3	you have?4	MS . JANET BULAN:	Excuse me?5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Units?6 MS. JANET BULAN:	Twenty.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Twenty in one8	building.9	MS. JANET BULAN:	Yes.10 MS . LEVINE:	And where is it?11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	On the East Side.12 MS. JANET BULAN:	Upper East Side,13 Blst and Second. On the side street. No commercial14 space.15 And basical ly we're just making16 enough - - I have to save every year to maybe put17 on a new roof and then the next year maybe I save18 to do something else.19 Huh?20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. Go21 ahead.22 MS. LEVINE:	Continue what you were23 saying .24 MS. ADAMS:	Continue.25 MS. JANET BULAN:	Oh.	We don't10 
2	want take out a loan - -3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.4 MS. JANET BULAN:	-- okay? It's just5 something that we feel that we should do, that we6 should be able to make enough to be able to, you7 know, keep the building the way it should  be8 running .9	MS . HOLDER:	So the 20 units are all10	rent controlled or rent regulated?11	MS. JANET BULAN:	No. No, they're12 not.	Half the building is and half isn't.13 MS. HOLDER:	So ten of the units14 are unregulated and - -15 MS. JANET BULAN :	That's correct.16 MS . HOLDER:	And then the other17 ten are rent regulated, either rent controlled or18 rent stabilized.19 MS. JANET BULAN:	Right. It's a20 mixed building.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 MS . HOLDER:	Thank you.23	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 Judy West.25 (Applause .)24 
2	MS. JUDY WEST:	Hello, hello .3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hi.4	MS. JUDY WEST:	Good evening, ladies5 and gentlemen.6 I will tell you who I am for the7 sake of brevity and to avoid irrelevant questions.8 My name is Judy West. I am 84 years9 old. I have lived on the Upper West Side since I'm10 14. I was born and bred in New York City. I pay11 $756 in rent and I do not have a house in South12 Hampton.13 I have raised two male children to14 manhood by myself. I have been gainfully employed15 all of my life. I retired seven years ago and I16 feel that my golden years are threatened by the17 crisis that we see in rent regulation and in18 housing in general.19 In Park West Village, for example, I20 - - there are four buildings which have been21 converted to condominiums. I am a renter. I am a22 rent stabilized tenant .23 In my building, which has 400 units,24 there are approximately 25 percent of the people25 left, many of them older people have lived  there5 
2 forever and cannot afford or do not wish or don't3 see the possibility or the rationality of signing4 -- having a 30-year mortgage and therefore  we5 would like to be able to apply the proviso.6 When my landlord	when the7 two-bedroom apartment sells for $1 million and my8 apartment would sell for $700,000 - it's  a9 one-bedroom - I don 't believe that my landlord is10 really in need of the increases that will be given11 to him by the Rent Guidelines Board. So - -12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. JUDY WEST:	Also the fact that14 my landlord, I don't know how many of you people15 have passed that area, but this landlord has taken16 it upon himself to destroy our community in  total.17 He is building on the campus grounds of Park West18 Village which was built as a community with19 gardens and playground and parking lots.	Five -20 count them, five high- rise luxury apartments21 buildings on Columbus Avenue and Amsterdam Avenue.22 And this poor little church, which is a wonderful23 mainstay of the community, is being destroyed.24 They had to take out their stained glass windows25 for which the builder is not giving them any, you2 
2 know, money.3 So the question is this is what4 happens with uncontrollable market rent, greedy5 profit-taking housing.6 I would also like to point out that7 the pragmatic way in which the Rent Guidelines8 Board operates so that one year you have this kind9 of an increase, next year you have another kind of10 an increase because your costs are going up.11 Well, everybody's costs are going up. I don 't12 think I feel sorry for you guys. I mean when you13 think of what the average citizen has to pay,14 whether it be in food, in rent, in transportation15 in - - name it. You name it.	We can go on.16 I am not, I do not consider myself a17 victim and I am certainly not helpless. I would18 also like to point out that the senior citizens I19 know - and I hate that title - are those people20 that can fight and have fought all their lives and21 struggle to maintain democracy in this City and22 love their city.23 And I maintain that the long range24 of this constant raising of rents in New York City25 will destroy the City itself which to me is2 
2 unpatriotic.	The people who will not be able to3 -- who run the City - - this is not the landlords,4 this is not the Rent Guidelines Board, this is not5 the lawyers and not the stockbrokers, it is the6 people who run the trains, run the buses, put out7 the fires, take care of people in the hospitals,8 who cannot afford to live here anymore.	And if9	they are out of this City, you better believe,10 kids, there ain't going to be New York, this great11 City that we all love .12 (Applause .)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap 1415 MS. JUDY WEST :	I feel also that16 the role of the Rent Guidelines Board has become a17 dance, a dance where the landlords come in  and18 where the Rent Guidelines Board is terribly19 concerned about the fact that they can't make a20 decent profit, when this is not your role.21 At least this is not what I would22 expect from the Rent Guidelines Board. I therefore23 don't appeal to you, but tell you that you must24 change your ways or eventually, ladies and25 gentlemen, it will change for you.15 
2	Thank you very much.3	(Applause.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 You know, Ms. Brewer's term- limited6 so you may want to think of running.7 MS. LOREN RENZ:	Members of the8 Rent Guidelines Board, my name is Loren Renz.9 I want to tell you about my house on10 the Upper West Side. It happens to be in Gale11 Brewer's district and I'm sorry she's not here to12 hear this.13 I've owned it since 1979. It's my14 home and my only property. It's a small property .15 It has six stabilized units including three16 one-bedroom apartments that have been continuously17 occupied for 30 years. In addition, I have my own18 apartment there.19 Due to long term tenancy, two-year20 leases and more than a decade of low increases,21 the rents for these three apartments, between $60722 and $620, are what I think as unconscionably low23 for my neighborhood and for Manhattan .24 As Janet Bulan said, you can't have25 an apartment in the West Side, East Side in our4 
2 small buildings, put a number on it, 700, 800, I3 don't think it's 700 . I think it's higher than4 that.	I think city owned housing and city stock5 goes for a higher amount than our one-bedrooms6 that we put an awful lot of sweat equity as well7 as money into to make very nice and beautiful.8 The tenants pay increasingly less of9 what it cost to run the buildings, these three10 particularly. I subsidize them more and more to11 live so well in my house. I am frustrated and12 angry about how this crazy system gives them and13 their spouses a lifetime gift of low rents.14 Obviously after 30 years they're not going15 anywhere. They're my age. They've been there since16 I guess our heyday, late 20s or something.17 These low rent apartments are on a18 two-year renewal cycle and they will renew this19 coming year. It seems that each time they renew20 they get the lower guidelines than the previous21 year. The cycle of alternating high and lower22 guidelines means that rents in the off year, my23 low rent tenants never seem to face the24 consequences of escalating operating costs.25 Like last year, everybody said wow,2 
2 we know that fuel has gone up so much and yet3 there was no additional add-on for the people who4 renewed the year before to say you too need to pay5 some additional money for the fact that now we're6 paying three times as much for fuel.7 Nothing happened and now they're8 going to renew again.	Last year I showed you how9 my heat and electric bills had more than tripled10 and my taxes had soared.	This year taxes are up11 another eight percent for my size building, water12 ten percent, and I've got two new bills to show13 you.14 My insurance is increasing 4115 percent, 41 percent and you can see it. And16 starting last year the Fire Department requires a17 monthly sprinkler inspection which costs me $420.18 Something new right out of the blue. Can I pass19 this on to tenants? No, I can't.	It doesn't20 matter when they sign a lease. So with constant21 escalations and operating costs, there's really no22 way for a small building like mine to survive with23 low rents. It's just the economics of it.24 I ask you for a low rent adjustment25 and a surcharge on the rents of long term tenants2 
2 - I know that's been asked for before - until they3 cover a fair share of operating costs . In the4 absence of that, you know, we have to ask for5 higher guidelines because there's no equity put on6 the specially low rents.7 So I'm asking you for a five percent8 increase for one-year leases and a ten percent for9 two-year leases.10 (Audience participation.)11 MS. LOREN RENZ:	I'm only going to12 say I don't prefer that.	I prefer that you deal13 with the equity issues here and I think that long14 term tenancy and low rents are an issue you have15 to start confronting.	You can't just put this16 aside year after year and say Manhattan's the same17 as everywhere else and, you know, there aren't18 issues like that in every other borough.19 Owners should not have to bear huge20 operating cost increases along. It's a fact of New21 York city. I mean as you say, costs do go up. But22 we have very tangible evidence of how much these23 costs have gone up in our buildings.24 I just ask you to be fair.25 Thank you.2

Hold on a8 second.9 Bern Smyser;10 Elyana Kaiser;11 Claire Dockery;12 Edward Lewis .13 I'm going to call the names again. I14 just want to say, Duwol Kringle (phonetic) ?15 Lilian Perkins.16 A VOICE:	Here.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Steven Chabra?18 MR. STEVEN CHABRA:	I'm here.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Valerie20 Prescott?21 MS. VALERIE PRESCOTT:	Here .22	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And Jeanie23 Dubnau.24 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	Here.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. Mr.23 
2	Richman.3	MR. PHIL RICHMAN:	Yes .4 I ask your attention for what I5 consider an over - - overarching issues which is6 what is happening to the middle class and to the7 quality of life in this City.8 I know that your particular scope is9 just you're going to vote how big an increase it's10 going to be this year . And we know that every11 year it's been an increase because those are the12 pressures you're on and those are the expectations13 that the forces that be impose on us.14 However - - and I do have sympathy15 for some of these small property owners - although16 I have to ask how many of them purchased their17 property at a time when rent regulation was18 already in existence in which case it's a business19 decision and they should be treated as a business20 and not as charity cases.21 However, I think the overarching22 issue here is the quality of life.	And the23 quality of life is very intimately connected to24 the type of people who can live in a city of this25 immense variety and diversity.	And what I see4 
2 happening is that more and more it is becoming a3 rich person's town. I'm talking particularly in4 Manhattan.5 I live in Washington Heights near6 Fort Tryon.	It's very nice there and other people7 are starting to discover this . And I can see the8 pressures building of the apartment house that I'm9 in is under constant construction with illegal10 renovations and nobody's doing anything about it.11 We're under enormous pressures and12 the hope is to get people out . They've offered me13 money to leave my apartment so that they can chop14 it up and turn it into another illegal renovation .15 And I feel under assault, but I'm not - - I was16 originally a New Yorker.	I moved to Colorado.	I17 moved to Buffalo.18 I made a mistake of not purchasing a19 condominium when I came back here. I got a small20 one room, rent stabilized and I retired and21 decided to spend the rest of my life doing what I22 considered valuable.	And I think this is one of23 the things about New York is that there's an24 acceptance of people who are different .25 I am spending my time writing2 
2 philosophy and translating Tibetan text. It 1  s not3 a high-paying job.4 (Laughter. )5 MR. PHIL RICHMAN:	And I perhaps6 could have made more money, but this was what I7 chose to do with my life and I felt very8 comfortable doing that in New York City. But I9 feel that we 1 re under assault.	We're under10 assault from the vacancy decontrol, from a  pattern11 that is underway on the part of particularly large12 landlords whose greed seems boundless.13 And I ask you to put a stop to it14 somewhere.	You 1 re the only people that I seem to15 be able to address on this issue with any16 efficacy .	And I think that the appropriate thing17 would be to finally draw the line and say zero18 increase because that would really be the fair19 thing to preserve the original intent when people20 decided that we needed a rent stabilized21 environment in New York.22 Thank you.23 (Applause.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 Mr . Smyser representing Council2 
1	4252	Member Jessica Lappin.3	MR. BEM SMYSER :	Hi.4 My name is Bern Smyser. I'm here5 today representing - -6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Bern, get a7 little closer.	Pick the mike up and get a little8 closer.9 MR. BEM SMYSER:	I actually have a10 copy of the speech for each of you if you want it .11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You just want to12 leave it, don't read it. No, just kidding .13 MR. BEM SMYSER:	So as you said, my14 name is Bern Smyser and I am here today15 representing City Council Member Jessica Lappin.16 Jessica wishes she could be here today but17 unfortunately she simply could not make it18 herself.19 Thank you for the opportunity to20 testify today.	I represent the East - - excuse me.21 I represent the eastern edge of the Upper  East22 Side and Roosevelt Island.23 Although the Upper East Side is24 known as the silk stocking district, many of my25 constituents do not fit that stereotype.	Many are12 
2 seniors and on a fixed income and have lived in3 their apartments 20, 30, even 40-plus years. They4 count on every cent because they need every  cent.5 New York City is currently6 undergoing the largest loss of affordable housing7 in recent history.	One-third of the City's8 120,917 subsidized apartments were lost between 9	1990 and 2006.10 Within the subsidized stock, the11 city's Mitchell-L ama housing program has lost the12 most with close to 26,000 apartments out of the13 program.	Many of my Roosevelt Island constituents14 live in state Mitchell-Lama complexes.	All of15 these rental buildings are eligible for buyout.16 And it should come as no surprise that the17 landlords have chosen to exercise their options.18 This crisis in affordable housing19 means that many tenants, including many of my20 constituents, would have no place to turn if they21 were priced out of their apartments . Rent22 stabilized housing is the only affordable housing23 resource left to these mostly low and moderate24 income tenants.	But rent regulation means nothing25 if tenants cannot pay the increase that the Rent10 
2 Guidelines Board recommends.3 The proposed increase of two percent4 to 4.5 percent on one-year leases and four percent5 to 7.5 percent on two-year leases could put  rents6 out of reach for many of these tenants.7 Along with the burden of rising8 housing costs, some tenants must contend with9 unscrupulous landlords. I support tenants in their10 call for provisos to be included in the guidelines11 that would prohibit a landlord from obtaining a12 rent increase in certain situations such as when13 hazardous violations exists or when the landlord14 has not registered a rent stabilized apartment15 with the New York State Division of Housing and16 Community Renewal as is required by law.17 The Rent Guidelines Board can be18 part of the problem or part of the solution. The19 Board can project these increases an enact20 provisos that help the tenants stay in their rent21 stabilized apartment or it can allow unreasonable22 and unfair increases that will create  further23 financial hardships for tenants and add to the24 affordable housing crisis.25 I believe the choice is easy. Rent2 
2 stabilized apartments make up New York's largest3 supply of affordable housing. If we start to  chip4 away at it, we are on a slippery slope to losing5 it all.6 Many of my constituents and many7 tenants across the City are not asking for the8 moon. They are simply asking not to be priced out9	of the apartment that they worked so long and hard10 to keep. They are counting on you to do what you11 can to keep their apartments affordable. Rejecting12 these rent increases goes a long way toward that13 end.14 Thank you.15 (Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 No questions.

JEANIE DUBNAU :	Here.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And if anybody19 else wants to speak, would you sign in in the20 back, please.21 Go ahead, Mr. Lewis.22 MR. EDWARD LEWIS:	Yes .2 3	Last year before this Board24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The mike .25 MR. EDWARD LEWIS:	Last year before24 
2 this Board I asked the question that if this Board3 determined that the rental apartment owners4 admitted that they did not need an increase in5 rent, did this Board have the power to deny the6 owners that increase.7 And Chairman Markus implied8 conditionally that the Board had such authority.9 Then I presented a letter dated September 12, 200310 from the managing agent/owner admitting, in11 response to a prior letter from me, that after12 receiving complaints from other leasing tenants,13 that they were aware of the problem of warm quote,14 water in the toilets in the building at 211 East15 5th Street, New York, claiming - - and claiming16 that this letter is just such an admission.17 However, at the time I do not18 believe I was clear in presenting how this letter19 could be construed as such an admission. So this20 year I would like to make it clear why I believe21 this Board should consider this letter an22 admission sufficient to justify a denial of an23 increase in rents, if not for all apartment rental24 owners, then at least this owner.25 First I would like to respectfully2 
2 remind the Board that although a renter as a rent3 controlled leasing tenant, my rent will not be4	directly effected by this Board's actions and5 hopefully be more able to address this matter more6 dispassionately than others more directly7 effected.8 As of May 23rd, this warm water in9 the toilets continued for almost three years,10 despite representations by the owner/management11 that they were aware of it and would fix this  warm12 problem.13 If this building can afford to waste14 the oil needed to heat the water in the toilets to15 the tenants, they obviously could not be a16 marginal building.17 Although they did not admit it, the18 water entering my apartment's toilet was  scalding19 at times approaching 190 degrees and arguably20 wasting vastly more oil than the warm water they21 admit to.	And why was it not important enough of22 a problem to fix in less than the almost three23 years.24 I believe the fuel cost increase25 documents submitted to the DHCR in prior years5 
2	that the owners were trying to inflate their oil3	costs to skew the rent formulas of the Rent4 Guidelines Board and I believe to inadvertently or5 intentionally annoy leasing tenants.6 If these rent increases are to be7 used to fund such wasteful and spiteful management8 or owners intent on harassing leasing tenants, the9 Rent Guidelines Board should review the need for10 these increases and review these formulas.	And if11 evidence supports it, that it appropriately deny12 any portion of them to be used in such a wasteful13 and spiteful manner, especially from which it14 appears they are unnecessary, if not harmful.15 Further, if this extra rent is to be16 used to bring tortuous and question legal17 proceedings or to skew legislation, as it appears18 to have done, then this Board should also deny19 that portion of any rent increase so used.20CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21Thankyou.22Mr. Kringle was not here.23Ms. Perking.24MS. LILIAN PERKINS:	Yes.25Hi. My name is Lilian Perkins.
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Perkins, sorry.3 MS. LILIAN PERKINS:	With an "S.114	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Sorry. It5	looked like a 11 G. 11        But go ahead.6MS . LILIANPERKINS:AndIam from7the Bronx.I am a seniorperson.I amagreat8 grandmother. I have lived in my apartment since9 August of 1976.	So August of this year, '76.10 When I moved into my apartment, I11 was paying $228 -- $238. And I always signed a12 three-year lease up until whenever they changed13 from three years to two years.	So I switched to14 two years.15 I had the same landlord up until16 about eight years ago.	Then they sold it to one17 of the S&W Management. One of the ladies18 complained about him. He's a slumlord.	He owns19 not only buildings in Manhattan, he owns buildings20 in the Bronx also.	And I do research. His real21 estate office, his realty office is in Manhattan.22 I have been harassed by them. I have23 been in courts, Housing Court. His attorney, they24 all are working together.	My case is even in25 Supreme Court, okay, Supreme Court, because they8 
2 borrowed money to fix the place.	They pass it on3 to the tenants.	We fought it and it's like we4 didn't even count, okay.5 We had a tenants association, Divide6 and Conquer, and that worked.	The bottom line is7 - hold it before you get your gavel, okay - I'm8 still there. He does no repairs . I still pay my9 rent. No repairs, okay. I am like a joke to them,10 a real joke.11 Going to Housing Court, that's12 another joke . I am saying - - I'm not speaking13 about my personal problem.	I am about what's14 happening to other people.	There's no, what they15 call it, rent - - rent stabilized.	I applied for16 an apartment on 102nd Street. I said I'm tired in17 living in a substandard condition.	They wrote me18 back a letter.	Ms. Perkins, we like your letter.19 They called me.20 When I went for the apartment on21 102nd street, I think, and First Avenue or Second22 Avenue, my son drove me down. When I went on the23 side, it was condominium or whatever. So she said24 to me, oh, no, you're not for this side, you go25 around the corner.2 
2 I went around there.	Mrs. Perkins,3 your income is a little too much for the, what do4 you call it, middle income, middle - -5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Moderate.6 MS. LILIAN PERKINS:	Moderate,7 okay. I'm not -- I don't make enough for the8 luxury and have a couple of dollars more too much9 to live in the, what you call it?10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Moderate income.11	MS . LILIAN PERKINS:	Moderate12 income.	So I am in the middle, okay.	In 1991 I13 applied for Section 8.	I had gotten hurt on my14 job. I'm out on Workmen Comp, Social Security15 Disability.16 1991 I applied. They called me year17 before last, whatever year that was, asked me,18 everything I have.	Do you have this?	Do you have19 that?	And guess what, I'm not even eligible for20 that.	So where does that put me? Where does that21 put me?22 You know, I got so tired of fighting23 with my landlord, my apartment is like a storage24 place .	Three years ago - - prior to the three25 years, it took him almost five years to come.12 
1	4362 Instead of them doing the repairs, instead of him3 doing the repairs, he painted. So my stuff is4 still packed like I'm going someplace.5 But, you know, eventually,6 eventually whether he's a landlord, somebody is7 going to come there and fix my apartment. I have a8 roof over my head so what I'm fighting for - - I'm9 not fighting for myself per se, I'm fighting for10 others, and mostly the seniors because the11 seniors, they are sick.	They don't know their12 right . The landlords are harassing them . They13 have their - - I took mine to court for harassing14 and what happened, nothing.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You're going to16 have to wrap up .17 MS. LILIAN PERKINS:	Okay. I'm18 wrapping .19 Like I said, they want to go up on20 the rents, but they're not doing no repairs. How21 could you pay for something if you're not doing22 the repairs?	The people in public housing, in New23 York buildings, the projects or whatever you call24 them, now they want them to pay for their repairs25 and stuff like that. How could they give them2 
2 increases if they're not even doing any  repairs.3 If these peoples are not getting any repairs done,4 they need to file a decrease in service - -5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 MS.

HOLDER:	Where did you say you12 lived in the Bronx?13 MS. LILIAN PERKINS :	I didn't say,14 but I will tell you.15 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.16 MS. LILIAN PERKINS:	I live17 directly across from the Veterans Hospital. I am18 at 2575 Sedgwick Avenue.	And the realty is 257519 Segdwick Reality, LLC.	145 Huguenot Street, New20 Rochelle, New York 10801.21 MS. HOLDER:	Wait, wait.	I'm22 sorry, I have more questions.23 How many units are in your building?24 MS. LILIAN PERKINS:	We have a 7225 - - 72 apartments in my building. And he owns the12 
2	other buildings which is the next building, 2559.3	MS. HOLDER :	And are all those4	units in your building, are they all stabilized?5	MS . LILIAN PERKINS:	They supposed6 to be . I don't know what they are now . I really7 don't know.8	MS. HOLDER:	And you said you9	still have a tenants association?10	MS. LILIAN PERKINS :	No, no.11	MS. HOLDER:	What happened to the12 tenants association?13 MS . LILIAN PERKING:	Divide and14 Conquer, Divide and Conquer.	That's all I have to15 say.16 MS. HOLDER:	All right. Thank you.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.18 Mr. Chabra.19 MR. STEVEN CHABRA:	Hello. How's20 the volume, is that okay?21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.22 MR. STEVEN CHABRA:	One of the23 reasons that tenants come to these hearings is to24 impress upon this Board how angry and truly25 desperate we are.12 
2 And one of the sources of our anger3 and desperation is the arsenal of weapons that's4 pointed at us, that's been built up over the years5 by owners, lobbyists, landlords and politicians,6 and tenants are under attac .7 Tenants are under attack from the8 owner occupancy weapon claiming an entire building9 for landlord personal use and mass evicting the10 tenants.11 Then there's always the phony12 demolition weapon .	Using laws meant to preserve13 housing, owners file to evict tenants and demolish14 buildings when all they really intend to do is15 renovate the affordable apartments out of16 existence and create luxury deregulated17 apartments.18 Then there's the destructive19 construction weapon, the relentless daily pounding20 that loosens plaster to crash down on our heads as21 we sleep, turning off electricity, hot water, even22 cooking gas for days or weeks or months at a time.23 Tenants are under attack from the24 Urstadt weapon that lets nameless, faceless25 carpetbaggers manipulate our housing market by2 
2 remote control.3 If an owner is ordered to make4 repairs, there's a self- certified repairs weapon,5 swearing that repairs have been made when nothing6 has been done, leaving tenants in unsafe7 apartments in decrepit squalor. Strong-armed8 harassment, vacancy decontrol, Major Capital9 Improvement scams, misapplied eminent domain, the10 silent witnesses in government enforcement, the11 list of weapons goes on and on .12 Now, I know that the Rent Guidelines13 Board can't fix these problems.	But there's one14 weapon that's under your complete control, a15 weapon that you can abolish today.16 Tenants are under attack every time17 you vote to raise rents.18 For the Cromens, the Economacices,19 (phonetic) the OhepShaloms, the Pinnacles, the20 Forest City Ratners, the Extells, it's not a21 question of paying higher taxes or increased fuel22 costs. But every dollar more that you demand from23 me is a campaign contribution from my landlord to24 support poisonous politics that threaten tenants .25 Every dollar more that you demand2 
2 from me is my landlord's retainer for yet another3 law firm to find yet another loophole to create4 yet another weapon to evict me.	With every dollar5 more that you say I must pay, you are putting into6 law that I must pay for the cost of my own7 eviction.8	I urge the Rent Guidelines Board to9 eliminate the one weapon it controls absolutely,10 the weapon that funds evictions and tenant's11 expense. I urge you to mandate zero percent12 increases across the Board.13 (Applause.)14 MR. STEVEN CHABRA:	Tenants are15 under attack and being here today is one way that16 we have to fight back.17 Thank you for opportunity to speak.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 Well done.20 (Applause.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Valerie22 Prescott.

HOLDER :	Thank you for coming .23 MS. VALERIE PRESCOTT:	Thank you24 for having me.25 First of all, I'd like to say I  live10 
2 in a building on the Upper West Side. It is - - was3 a Mitchell-Lama.	It's been bought out. Fifty4 percent of the people who live in our building are5 City workers. They work for the City of New York,6 us right here, you and me and everybody in here7 who lives here.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is this building9	under rent stabilization?10 MS. VALERIE PRESCOTT:	It is11 partially and it's partially market value. So when12 they bought it out of Mitchell-Lama,  it went into13 rent stabilization and then --14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And then there15 were turnovers?16 MS. VALERIE PRESCOTT:	Right, as the 1718 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	But it's a19 pre- '74 Mitchell-Lama.20 MS. VALERIE PRESCOTT:	It is.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.22 Which development is it?23 MS . VALERIE PRESCOTT:	It's - - it's24 Central Park Gardens.	People are familiar with25 that?	97th Street.18 
2 Okay.	Now, so the problem is that3 City workers do need someplace to stay.	They4 can't afford to live in Westchester and commute5 in, I don't think. But there has to be someplace6 for these people to live in order for you to get7 the services that you need .8 These are sanitation workers,9 teachers, bus drivers, nurses, people who fix your10 potholes when you drive your cars. They fix the11 street lights. These are transit workers, postal12 workers and many more people that are essential13 for this City to live on.14 They don't make the kinds of money15 that would allow them to pay $3,000 a month rent16 or $4,000 or $5,000 . The apartments are going from17 $400 to $4,000 a month. It's insanity. There needs18 to be something in between something that we can19 all live with.20 That's just about all I have to say21 except the question is where will these people22 live, the people that we need them to work here in23 the City.24 So we're talking about25 (Timer goes off.)2 
2	MS. VALERIE PRESCOTT:	Oops .3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead, keep4 going.5 MS. VALERIE PRESCOTT:	So we're6	talking about rent	affordable rent for people7 who actually work for us. They have to have a8 place to live.9 Also I wanted to address the woman10 who was talking about the problems that small11 homeowners have or small owners who have tenants12 in their houses.	The problem is she wants them to13 pay their fair share.	But here's the problem:14 What is the fair share when the landlord gets a15 tax break for all of his expenses or her expenses16 and the tenant doesn't get any tax break for all17 the rent that they are paying.	Not one dime.18 Think about this. I know you19 probably can't control that, but it's something to20 consider.21 Also, a rent	a person who owns a22 building, when they get fed up and they can't get23 anymore profit, what happens to them? Oh, gee, I24 have to sell. And what do they walk away with?25 Millions.	But the person who lives in an7 
1	4462 apartment who's going to be evicted after 303 years, what are they going to say.	I'm going to4 sell my apartment and walk away with my millions ?5 No. They walk away with zero and they have no6 place to go so.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you. Very8 good for the first try.9 (Applause.)10 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Question.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.12 Question? Question, ma'am.13 MS. HOLDER:	We have a question.14 Ma' am, ma'am, come back, please.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Valerie, we have16 a question.17 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I just wanted to18 thank you.19 And I wanted to know approximately20 how many members there are of your association.21 MS. VALERIE PRESCOTT:	There are22 200 apartments and at the moment most of them are23 in the tenants association.	We do have quite a24 few people who are moving in.	Some of them are25 joining and some aren't.8 
1	4472 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And one other3 thing .4 Roughly, do you know how many are5 rent stabilized and how many are not rent6 stabilized?7 MS. VALERIE PRESCOTT:	That I don't8 know at the moment .	But I do know that some of9 the market value tenants are complain ing because10 they are doing illegal things to them .	They're11 saying that they're upgrading their apartments and12 they're not using the amount of money that they13 claim they're supposed to use in order to take it14 out of rent stabilization.15 And so they're not just the16 Mitchell -Lama that were in there before are not17 the only ones that are being affected by this.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How long have19 you lived there?20 MS . VALERIE PRESCOTT:	I've lived21 there 30 years.	I'm like the other lady over22 there.23 MS . ADAMS:	Is it the 50 West 97th24 Street building?25 MS . VALERIE PRESCOTT:	Yes, it is.2 
2	It is.3 MS. ADAMS :	Thank you .4 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you so much.5 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you. I6 appreciate it .7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you very8 much.9 Jeanie Dubnau.10 (Applause.)11 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	Hello,12 everybody.13 My name is Jeanie Dubnau and I'm14 representing an organization in Washington Heights15 called RENA, Riverside Edgecombe Neighborhood16 Association.17 I feel after having testified for18 many, many years - - and I know many of you who19 will recognize me and will know my face and  the20 things I'm going to say. I came here tonight after21 a day's work .	I left work early which I have the22 privilege of being able to have a job with a23 decent boss who will say okay, leave your job an24 hour early.	I came here from Newark and that's25 why I got here at about 5:30 p.m.5 
2 Most of the people in my3 neighborhood, who are working people, who without4 whose work you would never go to any restaurants,5 without whose work you would never have any6 nannies, without whose work you would never have7 any senior citizens being taken care of in their8 homes.9 I'm talking about Washington Heights10 and West Harlem. I am here because they can't be11 here because they don't have the types of jobs12 where they can just take off and they certainly13 can't go to Queens.14 So I'll just tell you the stories of15 two elderly ladies who live in 3671 Broadway which16 is on 152nd Street, a region that is being very,17 very quickly gentrified.18 One lady is 81 years old and the19 other is 82 years old. The landlord is basically20 getting as many people out of that building as he21 can.	Why? Because he can get rent - - market rate,22 market rents for all of the empty apartments.	He23 is trying his damndest to get these two ladies out24 telling them that they should move to senior - - he25 actually had the nerve to tell them that they2 
2 should move to senior citizens homes instead of3 the apartments where they've lived all their4 lives .5 They're not moving because I've6 given them heart and they've spoken to us and we7 have an organization.	However, how many countless8 others will be forced to moved because they get9 terrified by their landlords.10 Now, I now you 're bored and I know11 that the landlords are just yawning and waiting to12 go home and I know that that's not true of our two13 tenant members who - - but my appeal now and the14 ones to whom I want to speak are the public15 members - those of you who are supposed to16 represent the public.17 Look in your hearts and ask -- do a18 little calculation.	Calculate your income and19 calculate the rent that you pay or the amount that20 you pay for your housing, whether you are a co-op,21 condominium, renter, homeowner, whatever you are.22 Calculate that ratio. And in your heart of hearts23 say am I - - am I spending more than 30 percent of24 my income on housing?25 If that's true, the lower your2 
2 income would be. Imagine the worst that 30 percent3 - - the heavier that 30 percent falls on you.	If4 you are a family earning $28,000, for example, of5 whom there are thousands and thousands in the City6 of New York and thousands and thousands only in7 Washington Heights, West Harlem, 30 percent of8 their income is a rent that nobody can find,9 nobody. It doesn't exist anywhere.	In the worst10 slums of the South Bronx you can't even find those11 types of rents.12 So what are these people going to13 do?	They're going to become homeless and it's14 your responsibility.	I'm sorry, but the - - you15 have to look at your own consciences and see  are16 you going to be part of this process. I'm not17 going to repeat what everybody said. I feel I'm18 repeating what they probably said during the day19 anyway.20 Whether you're going to even listen21 to this, I don't know because after years and22 years I see that the decisions are basically made23 by the Chairperson of this Board.	Our tenant24 reps, there are only two of them, and the public25 members are swayed one way or the another,  but2 
2 never, never towards the tenants .3 So the reason that there's hardly4 anybody here tonight I think is because people are5 so discouraged, angry and upset.	Don't think that6 there's no problem and that's why the people7 aren't here .	The people aren't here - - I almost8 didn't come. I mean to tell you truth, what good9 does it do.	Everybody says what good does it do10 when the RGB is going to vote rent increases11 anyway because they don't care.	This is a farce.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you wrap13 up?14 Thank you.15 (Applau se .)16 MS . HOLDER:	Wait. I have a17 question.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ryan Galvin,19 please .20 MS . HOLDER:	I have a question.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ryan - - oh, you22 have a question?23 Go ahead.	Sorry .24 MS . HOLDER :	Yes .	I had a25 question.	I'm sorry .2 
2 Thank you for coming and to testify3 today.4 When you talk about people who are5 being priced out of their neighborhoods, where is6 it, just based upon all of your experience, and7 what it is that you 've seen through the years?8 Where is it that they go?9	MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	They double up10 mostly.	Mostly they double up and so you've got11 quite a few families living together.	That's in12 my experience.13 Some might move to the Bronx in the14 past where it was a little less expensive than15 now Washington Heights is the up-and-coming hot16 zone and Columbia University, which is part of  the17 expansion and is part of the driving of the market18 rents, talk about Mitchell-Lama, 3333 Broadway,19 which is a huge complex, was Mitchell-L ama is now20 been privatized.	Columbia students are moving in21 at if you've got three or four bedrooms, each22 student pays $500 or $600 they think it's a steal23 with a beautiful view of the river. And everybody24 there is sitting there saying what are we supposed25 to do.10 
2 And those rents, yes, they're not3 being rent stabilized. Those people who are4	teachers and are City workers are going	their5 rents are going market. I don't know where they're6 going. That's a gigantic development as some of7 you know .8 So, you know, and this is happening9 in other parts of the City too. It's not that10 we're unique.	We have Columbia University that11 adds to our problems.	But then there's NYU and12 there's various other institutions.13 The basic problem is we're losing14 affordable housing, and this is part of the loss15 of affordable housing.16 MS. HOLDER:	And so as we need to17 continue to develop and add to our workforce to18 those people who serve us, as you've listed and19 outlined who they are, where are they moving to,20 what kind of apartments can they find, our up and21 coming --22 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	They can't.23 MS . HOLDER:	- - teachers and City24 workers?25 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	Honestly the5 
2 teachers and City workers, where are they moving?3 I don't know. I don't know.4 I know that many people that are5 more familiar with like home attendants and6 restaurant workers and so forth are doubling and7 doubling and doubling up. So you've got several8 families each - - you've got several adults working9 round the clock and they're just paying rent - -10 you know, they're working to pay rent. That's all.11 I don't know about the teachers and the people12 like that. I have no idea where they're going.13 It's very sad. They're probably going to be forced14 to double up with their children .	I don't know.15 Or their children double up with them, you know.16 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you, Jeanie. I17 appreciate it .18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you for20 coming.21 (Applause.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ryan Galvin.23 MS. RYAN GALVIN:	Good afternoon .24 I offer these remarks on behalf of25 Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer.2 
2 Thank you, Chairman Markus and3 members of the Rent Guidelines Board, for the4 opportunity to testify on New York City's dire5 need for affordable housing and the role rent6 stabilization plays in filling that need.7 Vacancy rates throughout New York8 City are dangerously low and are predicted to fall9 even further.	The number of families living in10 over-crowded situations has nearly doubled with11 10.2 percent of all rental housing considered12 overcrowded.13 The average number of families14 receiving temporary shelter each night has15 increased.	This year, the Rent Guidelines Board's16 response to these alarming statistics is to17 propose increases of between 2.0 and 4.5 percent18 for one-year renewal leases and between 4.0 and19 7.5 percent for two-year renewal leases.20 I urge you to reconsider . The21 residents of this City cannot continue to pay more22 and more of their incomes in rent. The median23 share of income New York City renters spent on24 rent in 2005 was 31.2 percent, over the 30 percent25 federal benchmark of affordability. And that 1 s not2 
2 even the worst of it.3 Twenty-nine percent of renters pay4 50 percent or more of their incomes in rent.5 There has to be a limit.	The median household6 income for rent-stabilized households was $32,0007 in 2004, representing a nearly nine percent8 decrease since 2001 .	That means that the average9 rent-stabilized household should pay no more than10 $800 per month in rent in order for the rent to be11 affordable . Yet, in 2005, the average12 rent-stabilized rent was $844 - an over eight13 percent increase since 2002.14 So the incomes of rent-stabilized15 households are going down and the rents are going16 up.	Perhaps it's just me, but rent increases yet17 again this year in the face of such statistics18 seems contrary to the goal of rent stabilization.19 The negative impact of high rent20 increases does not end with the current tenant.21 Each high increase also reduces the potential of22 the apartment remaining rent stabilized in the23 future. High	rent vacancy decontrol makes up the24 largest category of subtractions from the City's25 stock of rent stabilized units.2 
2	As rents for rent-stabilized units3	continue to rise, the $2,000 threshold seems  lower4 and lower, making destabilization on vacancy an5 imminent reality for large numbers of apartments.6 In 2006 alone, 9,983 rent-stabilized7 units were lost due to High Rent decontrol and8 that's just the units lost through high rent9 vacancy decontrol.10 As we are all painfully aware,11 $2,000 is no longer "high rent" in New York City.12 As we fight to create more units of  affordable13 housing, we cannot continue to let our existing14 stock slip away. But we should not stop with15 ending high rent vacancy decontrol.	I also urge16 the Board to take a stance on Home Rule.17 Residents of the over one million18 rent-stabilized units of New York City should not19 have to live the whims of State legislators,  nor20 should they have to fight each year to be able to21 afford to live in the City they helped make22 prosperous.23 The housing crisis is not going24 away.	Do not add to the housing burden of low-25 and middle-income New Yorkers who are already4 
2 struggling make ends meet.	Freeze rents for this3 year and help us gain control of our City's rent4 laws.5 Thank you.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 (Applause.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any questions?9	(No response. )10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	John Foust or11 Fost .12 Mr . Foust will be followed by Diane13 Weston;14 Followed by Doreen Gushue .15 Is there anybody else who wishes to16 testify?17 A VOICE:	I would like to.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right . You'll19 go last.20 Did you testify before?21 A VOICE:	I did, but I have22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No, no. One23 chance. You can send us a letter.24 Go ahead.	Mr. Foust.25 MR. JOHN FOUST:	Good evening.10 
2 My name is John Foust. I'm one of3 those City workers that so many people spoke of. I4 have family members who are also City workers, who5 so many people spoke of, who they claim have no6 place, no affordable housing in this City. That is7 far from the truth.8 I have two sons and a daughter who9 live in this town. They live in Brooklyn, work for10 the City and they're doing very well. I worked for11 the City for some 20 years. I didn't go down  to12 Atlantic City and blow my funds. I worked all  the13 overtime I could get and I also worked a part time14 job and because I liked dealing with people I15 wanted to help folks out.16 So I went out and I purchased myself17 a small unit, a 20-family house . I don't live in18 it but I have pride in it. I will give you the19 address. Any member of the Guideline Board can20 walk there any given day of the month be it21 Christmas Eve or Halloween and I don't think you22 will find anything that you disapprove of.23 All landlords are not bad landlords.24 All tenants are not good tenants. No one spoke25 about - - I heard many, many people today, but no2 
2 one mentioned how much rent they are paying. They3 keep saying it's too high .4 I have my books here. Anyone like to5 see my books, they available . I have a tenant6 here, $214.	That 's a month, that is. That 's not a7 week. That 's a month .	$198.06. This is a8 completely renovated 20-family building .
910	building? 111213	Brooklyn? 14
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where is thisMR. JOHN FOUST:	It's in Brooklyn. CHAIRMAN MARKUS:		Where inMR. JOHN FOUST:	Van Siclen Avenue.
15 270 Van Siclen Avenue.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.17 MR. JOHN FOUST:	You see, we come18 here everyday and we play politics .	Every year we19 play politics. I believe that the Guideline Board20 job is to act as a J ury on a case.	Look at the21 evidence and be fair and honest with both sides.22 Landlords does not make money by evicting tenants,23 at least this one doesn 't . And my thing is to help24 tenants not to hurt tenants.25 You see, I'm a 65-year-old also. I15 
2 worked 20 years. Like I said earlier, we stand3 we come in here every year and we play politics.4 The politicians come in.	They never have anything5 positive to say on the side of the landlord.	They6 have forgotten that landlords are their7 constituents also.	We vote. We pay taxes. We in8 the community. We part of the community.9 Some of the people that complain10 about being too high are the first one if you go11 out and buy the public housing, you find	you12 find SUVs and Mercedes and BMWs you find on Park13 Avenue .	So don't stand here and convince the14 world that you all in poverty 'cause you're not.15 I show you my books any time you16 want to see my books you 're welcome to see them.17 I'll open them up to anybody. But show me your tax18 return . Show me your tax return and I'll show you19 my books.20	You making 50, 60, 70, $80,000 a21 year paying $500 a month rent and you 're crying22 like babies. I mean everything's expensive now .23 Everything is related to oil and we know what the24 situation is with the oil prices. Most of us25 drive.21 
2 What I used to pay a month for oil3 when I purchased this building, what I used to pay4 a year Inow pay a month in all .	Idon't have to5 tell you that brother Bloomberg raised the real6 estate taxes 18.6 and had the nerve to make it7 retroactive.	I mean when are we going to get a8 break.	Why don't we get a break.9	You see, I mean there has to be some10 fair play here. I mean we come here year after11 year.	Until we get honest and fair with each12 other nothing is going to be solved.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you.14 Any questions?15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Question.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider17 has a question.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for19 your testimony.20 It's like you're living the American21 dream now, right? You had your 20-unit building22 that you worked hard for and you're taking care of23 your tenants. You have a nice relationship with24 your tenants even though you don't live in the25 building.10 
1	4642	MR. JOHN FOUST:	I do.3	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Oh, you do live in4 the building. So you - -5 MR. JOHN FOUST:	I don't live in the6 building, but Ido have a nice relationship with7 the tenants.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.	Okay. Fine.9 Where do you see this building three10 years from now, four years from now? How do you11 see this type -- the expense profile that you're12 looking at right now and the type of rents that13 you're seeing right now, let's go out three years,14 let's go out four years . What's changed?15 MR. JOHN FOUST:	Okay.	Okay. Right16 now my average rent is about $475 a month.	If you17 average it, that's what it comes out to about $47518 a month if you average it out.19 MR. SCHLEIDER :	Right.20 MR. JOHN FOUST:	You see, like21 someone said earlier, there ought to be some  kind22 of system in place that the people that who don't23 need this low rent shouldn 't be receiving it.24 And on top of that, after living25 there 30 and 40 years, when they get ready to move10 
2 to Florida or South Carolina or Timbuktu, they put3 their granddaughter in the place. She is now 19,4 20 years. She'll be there for the next 30 or 405 years.	You still stuck with her .6	(Audience participation.)7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So you see8 succession rights as a real problem.9	MR. JOHN FOUST:	Excuse me?10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You see succession11 rights - -12 MR . JOHN FOUST:	That's one of the13 problems .	That's not the problem	that's not14 the whole problem, but that's one of the problems .15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Do you see any sort16 of rent rate of increase that we could give you17 that would meet your rate of increase  and18 expenses?19 MR. JOHN FOUST:	Probably20 probably six percent one year.	Maybe you want to21 break it down and give an incentive for signing a22 two-year lease that you would come up with maybe a23 nine, nine-and-a-half, ten percent for a two-year24 lease.25 Because when - - there are certain10 
2 regulations like fire things. I had to put fire3 things in the building now. You have to have them4 inspected every there months. I mean these are5 things that come along. Nobody tell you about it.6 Con Ed for crying out loud, anybody who pay7 electric bill.	I hear someone crying about an air8 conditioner. We know if you pay electric bills,9 you know what your electric bills  are.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank you12 very much .13 MR. JOHN FOUST:	Thank you.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Diane Weston.15 How are you doing?16 MS . DIANE WESTON:	Hello, how are17 you?18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good.19 MS. DIANE WESTON:	Different year,20 same person.21 Okay. Here I am again to say that I22 find that the rents are ridiculously high. I speak23 for myself . I speak for everyone in my situation.24 I'm in a rent stabilized apartment.25 I moved here - - I loved what someone had to say. I12 
1	4672 moved here in 1976 in August . For a minute I3 thought I had the same landlord someone else had4 but unfortunately or fortunately whatever that5 situation is, I don't. I have a slumlord though .6 And it's interesting because the7 person that we had when I moved here was a8 wonderful managing agent, great.	And anything he9 needed to have done we did get done by a10 subcontractor, not an illegal immigrant, which my11 grandparents worked.	But enough is enough.	Close12 the boarders. Let the landlords open their books.13 I want to see what they're profiting.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That's a new15 phrase, "open your books, close the boarders."16 (Laughter. )17 MS. DIANE WESTON:	Open your books18 and close the boarders, baby, because that's what19 it's about.	These people are making money.	Slave20 labor has come to America. Congratulations.21 That does not help the tenant get22 proper repair work.	But if the person knows what23 they're doing and they're slave labor, great. Do24 it, right.	And when I ask you a question in25 English, please know how to respond to my question2 
2 because I was born here.	And since I've moved to3 New York I've seen everything that has happened.4 And I'm on the Upper East Side. I'm in Jessica5 Lappin's neighborhood and I'm involved.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Have you lived7 in the same building since '76?8	MS . DIANE WESTON:	That's right.9	The building I'm in right now was10 taken over in 1999. Nobody, nobody knows what's11 going on from one day to the next.	But I will say12 one thing, when you haven't had heat in four13 years, when your water was tepid and you had to go14 to a church to take a shower, you were homeless in15 your own apartment, freezing bundled up for four16 years, with a landlord who owes you a new stove, a17 refurbished - - pardon me, a refurbished stove,18 refrigerator, property tiling who doesn't give a19 damn, does not want to do repairs, but wants to20 take you to court and drag you by your ass, which21 is where I went from 1999 until Lenox Hill22 Neighborhood House stepped in.23 We were together in court for a year24 and a half.	I won. I had no reason for being25 there in the first place when everything could10 
2 have been resolved over the phone.	Nothing has.3 But one thing -- sorry, but nothing.	One thing4 has only been resolved.	I got a refurbished5 stove.	But I had rats not too long ago and mice6 not too long ago.7 But because of my mouth, because of8 my efforts and my stopping to call all these9	agencies and let them know exactly what I'm coming10 from and what I might do, I got help . But I never11 surrendered . And I'm saying that the rents are way12 too high for tenants .13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How big is your14 building?15 MS . DIANE WESTON :	And with your16 permission, with your permission, with the Board17 to really put the shoe on the other foot for a
18 change. 19
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How big is your

MS. DIANE WESTON:	We're 20 units.CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Twenty units? MS. DIANE WESTON:	And he owns overCHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And the
2	building didn't have heat for three years?3	MS. DIANE WESTON:	I didn 't.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You didn't. The5 building had heat, but your unit did not.6	MS. DIANE WESTON:	I'm the one who7 tried forming an association.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I see.9	MS. DIANE WESTON:	Nobody wanted to10 march to the beat of the drum so I marched to my11 own beat. I did my own dance.	And I'm still going12 to do it in favor of tenants.	I've just - - coming13 here, I come here every year and it doesn't14 matter. If I get my rent frozen, which I did, it15 doesn't stop me from fighting. I will fight  until16 I die for tenants because they have a right to17 live in New York.	New York is a place of18 creativity, diversity.	Everybody should	it's a19 beautiful place. Who does not want to be here. You20have somuchgoing.21CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Can you wrap up?22MS. DIANE WESTON:Be fair.23CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Not you have, we24have.25MS. DIANE WESTON:Be fair to

And please, zero rent increases this5 year.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 (Applause.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Doreen Gushue?9	Doreen, are you here? Yes. Okay.10 Now, Doreen is our last scheduled11 speaker or last signed up speaker .12 Does anybody else want to speak?13 Have you spoken before?14 A VOICE :	Today?15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Today.16 A VOICE:	I've spoken in previous17 times.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No, that's fine.19 Come on down.20 Bob Barker retired so it's now me.21 "Come on down."22 (Laughter. )23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sit down. We'll24 be right with you.25 Doreen, go ahead .10 
2	MS . DOREEN GUSHUE:	Hi.3 I've never spoken before4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Pull it down.5 MS. DOREEN GUSHUE:	Pull it down.6 Sorry.7 I've never spoken before. I8 regularly attend these meetings.	But I'm just9 speaking -- from family we have a small building.10 My parents bought it in 1965. It's in Sunset Park,11 Brooklyn, 16 units. We lived there our - - you12 know, I've lived there my entire life.13 And we make a small profit on the14 building . Last year I believe we made about15 $50,000 on it.	However, that's the whole family16 working to keep	that's the profit for17 everybody.	And we work to keep the building like18 you know, so if you divide between the number19 of people that are working, it's really - - it's20 not -- it's not an extremely profitable21 enterprise .22 However, we do provide affordable23 housing for 15 other families in Sunset Park. And24 I, too agree that there is a crisis with25 affordable housing in New York.	I couldn't afford5 
2 to go and live -- to get an apartment of my own .3 I work for the State of the New York and if I had4 to go get another apartment, it would be difficult5 for me as well.6 So the question - - now, what I would7 like to see happen is a separation between the8 rents .	Like on the low end of the income there9 should be greater increases, and on the - - not the10 income.	The low end of the rental rents should11 have a higher increase	and the higher rents12 should have a lower increase. There should be some13 kind of a balance to apply the same amount of14 increase to a $1,900 apartment as you do to a $40015 apartment .16 That's where I think the problem is17 corning in. And I don't know how much authority you18 have to, you know, to fix that or to do  anything.19 But that's where I think we need to work on fixing20 affordable housing.	Because the landlords deserve21 to make a profit too because they put a lot of22 time and energy into it. But tenants also need a23 place to live, a decent, clean and, you know, well24 maintained apartment to live in that they can25 afford.2 
2 So I agree that there is a crisis in3 New York.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where's your5	building in Sunset Park?6	MS . DOREEN GUSHUE:	We're on 49th7	Street and Eighth Avenue .8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any questions - -9	are you done?10 MS. DOREEN GUSHUE:	Yes.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 MR . LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay .	Ma'am,14 state your name for the record.15 MS . KRYSTYNA PIORKOWSKA:	Sure.16 My name is Krystyna Piorkowska and I 1718 MS . ADAMS:	Repeat it, please.19 K-R-Y-S-T-Y-N-A.	Last name, P as in 20	"Peter," I-0-R-K-0-W-S- K-A.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.22 MS. KRYSTYNA PIORKOWSKA:	Members of23 the Rent Guidelines Board, I'm a small property24 owner.25 As I was preparing for my annual21 
2 presentation to this Board, I realized that in3 addition to speaking to you about the fuel cost4 and property tax increases of the past years, once5 again I would be speaking to the issue of low6 rents - a subject that the Board has insidiously7 avoided during the past years in which I persist8 in raising. And I refer specifically to the9 supplemental increases that were granted for a10 number of years when rents fell below a certain11 level.12 But to cover the issue of fuel cost,13 I used No . 2 fuel oil in my boiler and each year I14 ensure that the burner is overhauled , the chimney15 is clean, all tubes in the boiler are replaced as16 necessary, and the building is checked to ensure17 that all possible fuel conservation processes are18 in place .19 Our fuel oil expenses in 2005 were20 $20,953, or $194 per room while in 2006 the21 expenses were $27,097 or $250 per room. It is22 simple math. Fuel oil is up 29 percent even for23 those of us who purchase through a fuel co-op .24 Since my property is located in what25 is considered to be the booming East Village, the2 
2 assessors have determined in each year that it is3 more valuable than in the previous. Thus, in 20054 my taxes amounted to $52,000 while in 2006 they5 amounted to $61,247.  My property taxes had -- had6 gone up in those two years by 17 percent. If the7 tax rate remains the same this year, my property8 taxes will go up to over $65,000 for a six percent9 increase.10 But now let us discuss the issue of11 low rents.12 Of my 18-unit building whose income13 does not cover itself, and like a parasite sucks14 the income of my other building to aid in its15 maintenance and improvement, I think it would16 serve you to hear the demographics of this17 building because too often you hear the words18 working class families being bandied about as the19 rallying cry opposing a special increase for low20 rents.	Yet too often, as in my case, the21 individuals reaping the benefits of the RGB22 guidelines are well educated professionals .23 In the 18-unit building, a total of24 nine units pay an average rent of below $725 per25 month. I would like to note that the average rent2 
2 stabilized rent in this building totals $867 per3 month.4 The RGB guidelines in 2005,5 effective in 2006, brought - - meaning the ones6 that you vote on in 2005, brought a total increase7 for these subject apartments of $2,734 while the8 guideline increases you voted on in 2006 will9 increase the rents this year on these units by10 $1,456. No, these are not per unit increases,11 these are per annum for all the nine units in12 question.13 Yes, if you were look at the - - yet,14 if you were to look at the tenants living in these15 low rent paying apartments, you would find that16 they do not differ significantly from the tenants17 in the other apartments.	Eight of these low rent18 paying tenants are college graduates some of whom19 hold Masters Degrees.20 Among them are commercial artists,21 college professors, lawyers, commercial22 filmmakers, and a restaurant owner.23 One unit has a tenant who is an24 executive chef in a large restaurant. There is25 only one unit which has a married couple with2 
2 children .	The other units have professional3 couples or singles .4 Their disposable income reflects an5 income of well over the $35,000 which would be6 applicable if you were applying a 25 percent7 calculation and I'm sure you all understand what8 I'm referring to.9 Several of these tenants have large10 homes outside New York City while others own new11 modeled cars and motorcycles. There is one other12 fact that I would like to add.13 In the past three years I have gone14 to court and I will be, again, doing so this year.15 Do you know what the common factor of all these16 court cases is? It is the fact that the case is17 against a low rent paying tenant who is subletting18 the apartment for two times or more what the lease19 amount is.	Yet I have not had to go to court a20 single time against a tenant who pays a higher21 rent. Curious, is it not or is it?22 I would therefore suggest that you23 consider a special levy on low rents and for those24 cases where there are working class families which25 require assistance, the City of New York should2 
2 assume the reasonability for aiding those3 families, much as they do with senior citizens and4 the SCRIE program. Let all of the residents of the5 City assume that responsibility fairly.6 I hope I was helpful to you in7 giving you precise numbers and calculations and so8 that you could understand what impact your9 guideline has on a low rent paying apartment.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any questions?13 MS. CRUZ:	I just wanted to know14 how long you've owned this property on the Lower15East Side .16MS. KRYSTYNA PIORKOWSKA:	1981.17MS. CRUZ:	Since 1981.18CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And you said 1619units?20MS. KRYSTYNA PIORKOWSKA:	Eighteen .21CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Eighteen units.22Okay. Any other questions?23(No response.)24CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, ma'am.25MS. KRYSTYNA PIORKOWSKA :	Thank
2	you.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Last chance,4 anybody in the audience who hasn't spoken before?5 Okay. There's two more. Keep popping up here.6 Go ahead. Give your name to the7 stenographer.8	MS. BRIDGETT BOGARD:	Hi . My name is9	Bridgett Bogard.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to spell11	it.12 MS. BRIDGETT BOGARD:	B-0-G-A-R "D, 1113 as in David.14 I have lived in Stuyvesant Town for15 52 years. During this time I have paid rent and16 I've brought up a son who's since moved away .17 As you know, Metropolitan Life owns18 Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper . It has now been19 taken over by Tishman.	But the thing that upsets20 me more than anything else is not the  increases21 which you suggest, but the MCis, which brings our22 rent up way above what your increases would lift .23 So for instance, I have now suffered24 for two years with the repair of a roof where I25 couldn't sleep, sledgehammering, then brick12 
2 pointing, which was even worse. I'm on the top3 floor on the 11th floor and all my neighbors and4 myself were desperate with the noise.5 I'm rent stabilized and the MCis6 keep going up.	Now they want us to pay for the7 roof. Then we got a notice that each room is going8 to have a $10 increase.	I had four rooms $40 a9 month . Nothing to do with your increases.10 We have new elevators. Our old11 elevators obviously were at least 50 years old and12 weren't working anymore. We are now waiting for an13 increase for the new elevators which will be14 retroactive and could be several hundred dollars15 between the roof, which in my opinion is a repair .16 It's not an improvement. The elevators were17 broken. They had to repair them. That's not an18 improvement.19 We are paying $65, $70 a year for20 our intercom which is attached to our  telephones.21 If I use it three times a year, it's a lot . We22 have gone to the DHCR asking that this be removed.23 We have lost every single case. Every single case.24 Jack Lester is our lawyer, I believe . I belong to25 the tenants association. We keep fighting and we2 
2 lose.3 Now, the last thing I got was this4 increase for the building of $40 a month. And that5 does not effect you because whatever you decided,6 and I hope it will be a small amount, will go on7 top of our MCis. And this is why I'm here and I8	would like you to take that into consideration9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 MS. BRIDGETT BOGARD:	- - when you11 are considering once again.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 Appreciate your patience.14 (Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 Any questions?17 (No response.)18 MS . HOLDER:	Thank you very much for19 coming.20 MS . BRIDGETT BOGARD:	Thank you for21 hearing me out.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No problem. Thank23 you.24 Sir, state your name for the record.25 MR . LARRY HIRSCH:	My name is Larry10 
2 Hirsch.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Pick it up .4	MR. LARRY HIRSCH:	I'll pick up the5 mike.6 I'm actually coming in my role as7 President of Community Free Democrats on the West8 Side because I am a market rate tenant.9 But I wasn 't going to say anything10 but then the owner came.	I didn 't want the last11 image in your mind to be one of people of high12 income and very low rents being the ones that are13 benefiting from rent stabilization.14 I can tell you the members in my15 club and the people I work with on the West Side16 on a daily basis are seniors. They're teachers,17 they're civil servants. I'm also a government18 employee so I know how little our - - my annual19 increase goes up, my annual pay increase goes up.20 And really just to add my voice to21 the many people that have probably been here all22 day, some of whom are probably in my club that you23 remember that the people - - most of the people in24 rent controlled apartments and rent stabilized are25 people who are getting by everyday who've, you5 
2 know, if you raise their rent two, three and  five3 percent, is going to be a significant hardship,4 many of who are on fixed incomes.	And then5 there's MCis and everything else that goes on top6 of it .7 So I wanted to leave this image in8 your mind on behalf of the people that are on the9 Upper West Side of Community Free Democrats.10 Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.13 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you for coming.14 (Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Last chances.16 (No response.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS	okay.	Seeing18 nobody's hands, seeing nobody in the audience,19 it's past 6:00 . We keep the sign in open to 6:00.20 I want to thank everybody for your21 patience. There is another public hearing next22 Tuesday, the 19th in Queens at LaGuardia Community23 College in the Performing Arts Center in Long24 Island City.	And anybody - who's probably not25 here - but anybody who would like to preregister2
