2	Thank you.345
MR. WILLIAM SMALLWOOD:	Okay.Good afternoon, folks.I' m a rent stabilized tenant 
6 and I don' t believe there should be an increase  in 7 rent because personally I can' t afford it. I' m8 living on a pension and Social Security. And   the 9 raise on our Social Security is still 2012 . And  if 10 the rent goes up, I wouldn ' t be able to afford  it.11 I' m just about making it.12 The building that I ' m living in 13 has been renovated and the people who  have 14 renovated it are unskilled workers just off  the 15 street . The place is actually shambles . There' s no 16 closets in the place. The sinks and  everything 17 else is backed up. They just don' t know  what 18 they' re doing.19 And I think that to raise  rent 20 it would be absolutely impossible to survive  out 21 here.22 I' m also a veteran of the 23 Vietnam War. When I moved into the place it was   a24 rooming house and I had the whole floor  plus 25 another floor upstairs . I was paying $ 480 . Now I' m6 
2 paying close to $ 1000 for something that is  worse 3 off than when I first moved in  there.4 My landlady is insensitive.  I5 can -- she ' ll stand the phone up. She has put 6 notes on my door claiming that I live in   another 7 state and has refused to give me a new   lease.8 SRO saved me many times  from 9 being evicted from the  apartment.10 No, I don' t believe there 11 should be an increase. In fact , there should be  a12 decrease in rent for us.13 I wouldn' t mind paying for a14 sensible place , but to live in a place like  that 15 where nothing is actually done , and when  something 16 is done, it' s by someone that' s just picked up off 17 the street and given a couple of dollars to   fix 18 something up and say, well , we did what we  could.19 And that' s the bottomline.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.21 Mr. Languedoc.22 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Hi, there!23 Thank you for coming in .24 Did you say you were an  SRO 25 tenant ?2 
2MR. WILLIAM SMALLWOOD:	Yes, I3am .4MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay.5And what borough do you  live 6in , sir?7MR. WILLIAM SMALLWOOD:8Manhattan.9MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay. All 10right. Thank you.11MR. WILLIAM SMALLWOOD:	Yes,12sir.13CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.14MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you very 15much.16 Cedrick Callemder.17 ( Applause.)18 MR. CEDRICK CALLEMDER:	Good 19 afternoon, Members of the Rent Guidelines  Board.20 My position as a tenant and  a21 retiree and a Social Security recipient I   would 22 like to ask the Board to consider not granting   any 23 increases this year.24 The Social Security considered 25 last year to send us a nice little love   letter 16 
2 telling us that for the year 2010 there would   be 3 no increases because there wasn' t an increase in 4 the cost of living . So we are stuck with  that.5 But most of you go to  the 6 store. You know that is not  true.7 If you do that, you will  be 8 creating a precedent because Westchester  went 9 ahead of you.10 But there is another factor 11 that we should look at . I don' t know if you  are 12 aware of that, is that when MCI is granted ,  they 13 don' t consider the total cost is $ 30 , 000 , we have 14 so many apartments , and divide it up, and  a15 specified time and you pay that and then it   ends.16 No , it continues forever.17 So, therefore, the landlords 18 are getting extra money after they have  already 19 gotten back the returns that they expended . So ,20 therefore, that is another factor that we  should 21 look at.22 But then the long- term factor 23 is if we continue in this trend and people   just 24 say it ' s too costly to live in the City of  New 25 York and they move to other areas, then  you' ll 2 
2 have to do like what used to happen in the  ' 40 s3 and ' 50 s, bus in employees . And wouldn ' t that be 4 more costly than to try to keep the  stabilized 5 rent here?6 That is my testimony. Thank  you 7 very much.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.9 ( Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Tolliver 11 Scott.12 Mr. Scott will be followed  by 13 Chelsea Gleason;14 Afua Atta- Mensah;15 And Maggie Russell- Ciardi.16 MR. TOLLIVER SCOTT:	Good 17 afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.18 I know you can hear me.  You 19 didn' t have any trouble with the other accents  up 20 here so I hope you won ' t have any with myself  in 21 the accent .22 I don' t want to harp too much 23 on the rising costs of the landlord and what  he' s24 making . I don' t want to go into the tenants and 25 how they are doing .2 
2 But I would like to speak  about 3 the 16 , 000 children that live in shelters.4 It' s a hell of a thing when  you 5 leave school and you go home to a   shelter.6 In your decision think about 7 how many kids that are not going to go to   college,8 not going to see Rye Playland this summer, or   Six 9 Flags, but they' re going to be in shelters .10 How would you like it if  your 11 kids would come home and not go to a home but   go 12 to a shelter?13 It' s a hell of a thing  when 14 parents have to wait for their kids in a   shelter.15 I' m not going to take up a16 whole lot of time. I just want you to   consider 17 that.18 In making your decision , I19 heard a lot of you say you ' re going to be fair ,20 you' re going to be impartial. This time instead  of 21 the cat birdseed, take the worm' s point of  view.22 Look up instead of  down.23 Thank you.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you,25 sir.2

( Applause.)CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Chelsea MR. CHELSEA GLEASON :	Hi!My name is Chelsea Gleason  and 
7 I' m an intern tenant organizer at the SRO  Law 8 Project.9 As an Urban Studies major  at 10 Barnard College, I have learned of the  inequities 11 wrought by New York City' s housing market as  it 12 promotes the growth of few through  the 13 marginalization of many.14 Working at the SRO Law  Project 15 has shown me the context of this larger system   of 16 exploitation.17 SRO tenants come to our  office 18 and speak of the same pattern of major  problems:19 Private landlords that harass 20 them, going so far as to impose curfews,  tamper 21 with their mail, or prevent them from  having 22 guests ;23 Landlords that convert their 24 homes into illegal hotel units to make a   profit;25 Landlords that overcharge 7 
2 tenants for rent and landlords that fail to  make 3 repairs for months , even years .4 Beyond the problems of  the 5 landlord/ tenant relationship, tenants struggle 6 everyday to make ends meet within a   struggling 7 economy.8 On a larger scale, the  housing 9 market in New York City favors luxury housing  over 10 preserving affordable housing and has resulted  in 11 the demise of living spaces for low  and 12 middle - income individuals, particularly for 13 individuals in SRO units which continue  to 14 diminish each year .15 The City is being bought  and 16 sold in order to transform it into a place   of 17 privilege and exclusion. This trend is , to say  the 18 least, unjust, and denies individuals the right  to 19 adequate and affordable housing and the right  to 20 the City itself.21 When landlords argue that 22 everyone is struggling , they choose to ignore the 23 fact that not everyone is struggling to nearly  the 24 same degree, and that the struggle of many is   the 25 direct result of the privilege endowed to a   few.2 
2 The very least this Board  can 3 do is vote for a zero percent increase for   all 4 tenants including SRO tenants. While SRO  tenants 5 struggle to defend and protect their ability  to 6 live in this City, landlords struggle to make  a7 larger profit.8 It is clear to me  which 9 struggle is the more difficult and  unjust 10 struggle, and I hope you can see this   too.11 Raising the rent will hurt  the 12 people least able to pay. To do them justice,   vote 13 for a zero percent increase in  rent.14 Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.16 ( Applause.)17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Afua 18 Atta- Mensah.19 ( No response.)20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Maggie 21 Russell- Ciardi .22 Who will be followed by  Noel 23 Ferrando;24 And Juan Hugo Antunish.25 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:2 

2	Good afternoon !3
I' m Maggie Russell Ciardi and 
4 I' m the Executive Director of Tenants &  Neighbors.5 And what we do is we  assist 6 tenants who live in affordable housing that' s  at 7 risk of being converted to market- rate housing , to 8 take action to keep their homes affordable  and 9 make sure that the tenants who live there are   not 10 displaced.11 So we work in rent  stabilized 12 housing as well as Section 8 and  Mitchell- Lama 13 housing.14 And much of what we do  is 15 helping tenants whose owners want to leave  the 16 subsidy program, it' s actually Mitchell- Lama, or 17 whose homes are getting foreclosed on  because 18 they' ve not properly maintained them, help those 19 tenants find another owner , you know, a  more 20 responsible developer who is interested in  buying 21 the property and who will work with them  to 22 rehabilitate the property and make sure that it' s23 preserved as affordable housing for the long  term.24 And in this way we' ve saved 25 thousands of units of at- risk affordable housing.4 
2 I only bring this up because  I3 think it highlights that, as an organization,  we 4 really do understand that there are  responsible 5 landlords and an important part of  preserving 6 affordable housing is identifying those folks  and 7 working with them in partnership with  tenants.8 The other component of our  work 9 when we' re not doing that is trying to  preserve 10 rent stabilized housing. That' s more difficult 11 because of the vacancy decontrol provision in  the 12 laws. You know , when owners get the legal 13 regulated rent up to $ 2 , 000 and the apartment 14 becomes vacant , they can take it out of  rent 15 stabilization.16 And I can attest to the  fact 17 that owners throughout the City do everything  that 18 they possibly can to get rents to that   threshold 19 including fraudulent MCI increases and 1 / 40 th 20 increases, trying to get very high turnover  rates 21 in the apartments, bringing in people that  they 22 know will only stay there for a short time   and 23 then sort of try to push them out so they   can 24 collect vacancy bonuses, and coming to the RGB  and 25 asking for very high rent  increases.2 
2 And all owners do this  even 3 knowing that they are not going to be able   to 4 actually charge the legal regulated rent  because 5 the market won ' t bear it but they are trying to 6 get it to that threshold at which it can be   taken 7 out of rent stabilization.8 And once that happens, those 9 future tenants that live in that apartment won ' t10 have the important protections afforded to  them.11 So we see this  increasingly 12 with the rise of speculative investing  in 13 affordable housing . And this year more than ever 14 we ' re seeing huge pressures on the existing 15 housing stock.16 So we' re working really hard on 17 getting those laws changed in Albany through  our 18 501 ( c ) affiliate, but in the meantime we are  here 19 at the RGB to try to urge you to keep the    rent 20 increases this year as low as possible .21 Part of what makes New  York 22 City such a great place to live is our   diversity,23 our racial and economic diversity. That' s why  I24 moved here . And that' s one of the reasons that I25 decided to spend my life working to preserve  our 2 
2 at - risk affordable housing .3 And I understand that you  all 4 have a very difficult decision in front of   you 5 today and next week. And I just wanted to   make 6 sure that you know that the tenants that we   work 7 with, who are increasingly disillusioned  by 8 participating in this process year after year  and 9 seeing rents continue to rise to levels that  their 10 incomes just can' t support , are really counting on 11 you to truly listen to what they say in   the 12 testimony today and to take that to  heart.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	I' m going to 14 ask you to wrap up .15 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:16 Sure.17 So I was very pleased that  the 18 proposed increases this year are lower than  they 19 have been in previous years, and also have  been 20 truly encouraged by the very sort of  thoughtful 21 engagements of all of the Board  Members,22 particularly the public members, who I  understand 23 you have a very difficult decision ahead of   you,24 the engagement that you' ve had with the testimony 25 that has been presented today.2 
2 This year is a year  of 3 unprecedented efforts on the part of landlords  to 4 raise rents and to displace tenants and a   full 5 year of tremendous economic hardship for  low,6 moderate and even middle- income people .7 And so we' re hoping that you,8 when you cast your vote on the 24 th, really  do 9 demonstrate that you' ve heard what the tenants 10 have said and that you truly understand  the 11 hardships that they face.12 Thank you.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.14 ( Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Ms. Adams.16 MS. ADAMS:	I have one 17 question.18 Thank you very much for  your 19 testimony.20 If you were voting on the 24 th,21 what would you vote?22 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:23 This year I think a rent freeze would be in   order.24 ( Applause.)25 MS. ADAMS:	Could you give us a2 

2	number ?3
MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:
4 Zero percent increase.5 MS. ADAMS:	Okay.6 ( Applause.)7 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:8 And I think -- and I do understand that it is    a9 responsibility of the Board to look both at   the 10 cost to owners and the economic conditions .  I11 think this year with the tremendous  economic 12 hardship that we' re facing and the tremendous 13 amount of pressure on the housing stock, that   a14 rent freeze would be the appropriate solution  for 15 this particular year.16 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Ms. Cruz ,18 did you have a  question?19 MS. CRUZ:	Yes.20 I have a question about  the 21 beginning of your testimony. You discuss some  of 22 the work that your organization does  in 23 representing tenants of Mitchell- Lama' s and other 24 type - - those types of buildings that are  trying 25 -- when they go out of those programs, to try   to 4 
 2 work with property owners or developers that  they 3 feel will perhaps invest in that property  without 4 going to market.5 Could you tell us a little  bit 6 about how that collaborative effort  works?7 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:8 Sure.9 So if owners plan to opt out  of 10 the affordability program when the  contract 11 expires or buyout if it' s a Mitchell- Lama, or if 12 the owner has not maintained the building  properly 13 and has failed multiple inspections and HUD  is 14 moving to foreclose on the property and sell it   at 15 auction, we go to the tenants and help them   figure 16 out what they want to do and allow the situation  17	--18 A VOICE :	Is there an AV 19 person ?20 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:21 That' s better.22 So in a lot of the  situations 23 what they decided they would like to do is to   find 24 an owner who will maintain the building  as 25 affordable housing .18 
2 And so we' ll help them identify 3 sometimes non- profits, sometimes for- profit, what 4 we call preservation purchasers, the people  that 5 really want to maintain these buildings  as 6 affordable housing , they contribute perspective 7 partners, they figure out which one has the  vision 8 for the building that more closely resembles  their 9 own. And then once they' ve selected, that person 10 they work to be -- or that entity or sometimes   a11 sort of collaboration of organizations , they work 12 to be able to get them to acquire the   buildings 13 and maintain them as affordable  housing.14 So our piece of it is  helping 15 the tenants identify who they want to work  with 16 and who they want to own their building and   then 17 helping to facilitate that transfer of  ownership.18 MS. CRUZ:	Now, when you' re 19 working to obtain a known or interested in   that 20 kind of an arrangement , even if that is  a21 not- for- profit organization, how does the rent 22 roll get affected?23 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:24 Right.	Normally we' ve done this up until now in 25 Mitchell- Lama and Section 8 housing where there' s2 
2 subsidies or there ' s sort of limits on what 3 tenants pay in their rents .4 We are trying it now in  the 5 rent stabilized stock that has been  overleveraged.6 We are trying to see if we can -- you know ,   say 7 there' s an investor that wants to get rid of  the 8 property, they realize they' ve overpaid for it ,9 they want to back out, we are trying to   find 10 owners who will come in and take over  those 11 properties and manage them sort of properly  and 12 responsibly.13 The issue is that a lot  of 14 times they were paid for at purchase prices  that 15 were so speculative that they couldn' t be 16 supported by the rent rolls and they tried  to 17 solve that problem by raising rents and  whatever 18 mechanism they had available to  them.19 Our position would be that  the 20 banks who sort of lent the money for those   deals 21 should take some responsibility and that  it 22 shouldn' t be tenants who are sort of paying  for 23 those irresponsible investments.24 MS. CRUZ:	All right.25 But I' m not talking about those 2 
2 sorts of buildings . I' m talking about the 3 Mitchell- Lama' s and those sorts of buildings that 4 are getting out of a subsidized arrangement  and 5 into perhaps market and a not- for- profit is trying 6 to collaborate with the tenants to maintain  this 7 building.8 How does the rent roll  get 9 impacted in order to meet the expenses of   that 10 building?11 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:12 Right.13 Specifically what the new owner 14 does is keep it in the affordability  program 15 rather than convert it to market rate  housing.16 They' ll commit to keep it affordable for, you 17 know, twenty or thirty years or in  perpetuity.18 MS. CRUZ:	Does that mean no 19 increases, no increases in  rents?20 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:	In 21 some buildings , yes.22 MS. CRUZ:	It is?23 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:24 Uh - huh .25 MS. CRUZ:	Can you tell me  the 2 
2 address of some of those buildings that you  are 3 referring to that have zero increases and  still 4 are able to be  maintained?5 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:6 Well, a lot of them they are able to   access 7 various sources of financing rates for  the 8 rehabilitation . There are government programs that 9 they can access, you know, and certainly there ' s a10 need for expansion of those types of programs  so 11 that more owners have the opportunity to,  you 12 know, put more into their  buildings.13 And , yes, I could give you --14 you know, we' ve preserved thousands of units of 15 affordable housing and I' d be happy to provide  a16 list.17 MS. CRUZ:	At zero rent 18 increases?19 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:20 Uh - huh .21 MS. CRUZ:	I would love to  get 22 a few addresses --23 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:24 Sure.25 MS. CRUZ:	-- at zero rent 2 

2	increases.34
Thank you.MR. SCHLEIDER:	So if I  hear 
5 you correctly, the only way for zero  rent 6 increases if a new ownership structure comes in   or 7 any ownership structure comes in and wants  to 8 preserve the affordable rents with the low  rent 9 structure that is already in place , is to  have 10 some sort of favorable financing to do  upgrades 11 and possibly - -12 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:13 No .14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I just heard 15 you say that they had  --16 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:17 No , no , no . I say -- I didn' t say that was the 18 only way.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- clients with 20 these upgrades .21 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:22 There' s some circumstances where that' s helpful in 23 some particular buildings.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Can you give me 25 a for instance where it hasn' t been  secured?5 
2 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:	The 3 times when it has been necessary is when the   owner 4 has really let the building fall into  major 5 neglect and there' s huge rehab needs. Then there' s6 needs to be a lot of new investment in   the 7 properties .8 If they haven' t done that and 9 the building is in reasonable condition, it' s  just 10 a question of finding an owner who is   truly 11 committed to preserving it as affordable  housing.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.13 So we have a building that' s  in 14 reasonable condition. We have an owner  that 15 voluntarily came into an affordable program,  like 16 a Mitchell - Lama, and now wants to opt out. The 17 building' s in good condition. How do you  structure 18 a purchase price for that owner who has  maintained 19 the property in good order and is opting out   of 20 the program that they were told they could opt   out 21 after twenty to twenty - five years?22 So how do you structure a  deal 23 to preserve low rents, keep the building  operating 24 and get the owner whole?25 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:	All 2 

2	right.3
So a lot of the owners who  want 
4 to leave the affordability program , they' re 5 leaving because they had hoped to be able to   make 6 a really tremendous return on their  investments.7 And if you can find owners that are willing   to 8 make a reasonable return on their  investment,9 which there are plenty of them out there, then   you 10 don' t have to raise the rents.11 You know, you have to  find 12 people who are willing to own and operate   a13 building knowing what the rent rolls are and  be 14 willing to accept the return on their  investment 15 given those rentals.16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.17 So given the rent rolls  and 18 given the operating expense profile for  these 19 buildings, given the net operating income that ' s20 available to service any sort of debt that  you 21 would have to put on to facilitate a   purchase,22 unless your non- profit can just a write a  check 23 from their coffers to purchase this building,  how 24 does all that translate to a purchase price  that 25 would entice a current owner from accepting  your 4 
2 check rather than either converting the  property 3 to market rate or putting it on the open   market?4 I' m not sure I understand how 5 your group effects a  transaction.6 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:	We 7 organize the tenants and we work with them  to 8 educate the owner about the importance  of 9 preserving affordable housing and the tenants  that 10 live there not being displaced . And many owners 11 are amenable to get out of the building and   to 12 sell it to someone who will continue to   maintain 13 it as affordable housing.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I understand 15 that. But at what  price?16 MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:	At 17 a purchase price that can be supported by the   rent 18 rolls.19 It really works . I know it 20 sounds incredible, but that' s how we' ve preserved 21 thousands of units of affordable housing  by 22 finding really responsible owners and that ' s who 23 we hope will be owning our rent regulated  stock.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And you ' ve done 25 this how many times?2 

23	Countless.45
MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:MR. SCHLEIDER:	Countless? MS. MAGGIE RUSSELL CIARDI:

9 afternoon, ladies and gentlemen of the  Board 10 Members, ladies and gentlemen of the tenants  and 11 the landlords.12 I' m a landlord of two 13 brownstones on the west on the 50 s in the  special 14 Clinton District. And we are really having  a15 problem really because , I don' t know, most of the 16 tenants think that we are like -- comparing  us 17 like to Donald Trump or other landlords. We  are 18 not in that position.19 And the operating costs , the 20 taxes, insurance, fuel and everything else is  just 21 real high.22 Besides that, when the  tenant 23 leaves , they don' t leave the apartment in decent 24 condition and it' s very costly to renovate  them.25 As a matter of fact, I ' m just coming right now 9 
2 doing the work and helping the people myself.   And 3 I' ve been doing like this already for thirty- five 4 years.5 So I' m really, really aware of 6 every little nitty - gritty because I' m there.7 And we have other  problems 8 here. I mean I have like one simple example.   I9 have a tenant that live in my building on   a10 studio , which is about three hundred square feet.11 Then he bring his wife and two kids, like one   age 12 five, one of ten, and a small apartment like   this 13 now end up with four people. He says only for   one 14 month or two months. He' s going to fix up  the 15 place for them .16 I says, fine.17 Now , he ' s over two years.18 And I think we' re getting 19 beaten on that . And his rent is really $ 500 , way 20 below numbers here . And he ' s operating a parking 21 lot down the block . He charges $ 20 for one spot 22 for a car. So he' s easily paying less - it   costs 23 to park the car more than he live in the   building.24 If you multiply $ 20 by thirty days , it ' s $ 600 .25 He ' s paying $ 500 for four people in a three 2 
2 hundred square foot apartment.3 I don' t understand how the City 4 allow that .5 I sympathize with the  tenants 6 but the tenants cannot fall on the shoulder of   the 7 landlord.8 The Federal government, the 9 State or the City, they have to pick up the   bill 10 and help the needy people. This is democracy  and 11 that' s what happens. That' s why we pay taxes. They 12 can do whatever they want. I mean they   can 13 ( unintelligible) or labor taxes or anything like 14 this or cut down on the government spending  so 15 they have enough money to support the people  with 16 low income .17 I definitely don' t want to see 18 anybody out on the street. I could be in   that 19 position, could be my family members, my  kids,20 anybody could be in that position because we   see 21 now people lost jobs and the government has  to 22 help.23 But I don' t think it' s so fair 24 to put everything, the burden, on the back of,   on 25 the shoulder of the landlord.2 
2 When you go to the  supermarket 3 or anybody go to the supermarket, you  can' t4 comment, listen, I can ' t afford it , I' m going to 5 pay you half price . This does not happen. So  why 6 should it be done to the  landlord?7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	I' m going to 8 have to ask you to wrap up .9 MR. ABRAHAM MUSSAFI :	Okay. I' m10 done.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Question .12 Your two buildings are how  many 13 units?14 MR. ABRAHAM MUSSAFI :	One is 15 twenty studios and one eight  apartments 16 one- bedroom.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Are they all 18 stabilized ?19 MR. ABRAHAM MUSSAFI :	I have 20 two, a couple of rent controls .21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	I' m sorry.22 MR. ABRAHAM MUSSAFI :	I have 23 two rent controls.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The rest are 25 all stabilized ?2 
2 MR. ABRAHAM MUSSAFI :	I have 3 one stabilized that also pays $ 560 where the 4 apartment should be for $ 1500 .5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.6 MR.

ANNE EMERMAN:	Good 23 afternoon.24 My name is Anne Emerman . I am  a25 tenant speaking on behalf of a hundred and   twenty 2 
2 rent- regulated tenant neighbors at Kips Bay 3 Towers , speaking as well as for the East  Side 4 Housing Coalition and the Gray Panthers New  York 5 City Network.6 All groups have members 7 struggling to afford the annual rent increases .8 Some will lose their current  housing.9 Whether they' re seniors on 10 Social Security, workers on less than a   living 11 wage, laid off workers , on unemployment, they' re 12 vulnerable and may become the City ' s newly 13 displaced.14 I' m a resident of Kips Bay for 15 forty- five years. We, and our neighbors, raised 16 families and worked in nearby hospitals as  social 17 workers, nurses, therapists and lab  technicians.18 Kips Bay Towers is now  a19 condominium and a gated complex. We' re no longer  a20 part of the community of working people. The  Mayor 21 has gentrified our neighborhoods via  zoning 22 changes, subsidies and City- owned land giveaways.23 Manhattan in my experience is becoming more  and 24 more gentrified.25 Some of us remember the 1970 s,2 
2 and I go back in housing issues as far as   Anne 3 Cunningham , over thirty- two years.4 We remember the neglected 5 neighborhoods, buildings being torched , people 6 dying, injured , families displaced and the 7 beginning of a horrendous homeless problem .8 Neighborhoods were emptied of 9 the working poor. The hidden public policy  agenda 10 of the time was planned shrinkage, rid the City   of 11 its poorest and some would say mostly non- white 12 residents.13 Is there a new hidden  agenda?14 The April Chinatown fire fits 15 into a familiar pattern. Government agencies  fail 16 to act on resident complaints. The landlord  gets 17 away with dangerously neglecting his  building.18 Several buildings are destroyed beyond  repair,19 long- term rent regulated families are displaced,20 and a traditionally worker neighborhood  will 21 become gentrified.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	I will ask 23 you to wrap up .24 MS. ANNE EMERMAN:	Well, you 25 have copies.2 
2 I just wanted to say  also 3 there' s another disturbing public policy trend and 4 that is the privatization of NYCHA housing .5 Twenty - one complexes built by the City and the 6 State were not provided the ongoing annual  funding 7 for operating and capital projects . There' s now a8 new deal between the chairperson of NYCHA who  came 9 out of business and finance with the  Federal 10 government where these buildings will now  get 11 their subsidized money and their operating  and 12 capital funding, but they will be run by   private 13 equity firms, the same players who gave us   the 14 mortgage meltdown.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	You have to 16 wrap up.17 MS. ANNE EMERMAN:	It appears 18 the Rent Guidelines Board is also part of   the 19 problem, a willing accomplice and also I feel   a20 tool of the Mayor.21 It too is gradually ridding  the 22 City of lower and middle income rent  regulated 23 residents.24 Are not most of the Mayor' s25 appointees , except for two , affiliated with real 2 
2 estate and financial interests ? Who among you 3 represent the minimum wage workers , young 4 families, students and the  aged?5 Let all concerned work  together 6 to make the Rent Guidelines Board a solution  to 7 preserving affordable housing.8 Let ' s work for City and State 9 legislation to make the Rent Guidelines  Board 10 truly representative of the people of the  City .11 Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.13 ( Applause.)14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Is it Hiu 15 Ying Kou?16 We' ll have your mike shortly.17 MS. HIU YING KOU:	Hi, ladies 18 and gentlemen.19 I' m here today as landlord. And 20 after we do the books, I feel this is necessary   to 21 come over. And since 2008 , the water and  sewerage 22 fee increased 8 percent, more than 8   percent,23 almost 9 , and the fuel costs increased 9  percent,24 and all the taxes increased 5  percent.25 So my bill is like, if there  is 2 
2 increase for everything, the rents should  be 3 increased equally to the other expenses. That' s  my 4 opinion.5 Because that increase, actually 6 we look at it, the 2008 rent guideline was 4 . 25 7 percent for one year and 7 . 25 percent for two 8 years, and then 2009 it already dropped to   39 percent for one year and 6 percent for two   years.10 So that increase, because 11 everything has increased, it should be  increased,12 not decreased.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.14 MS. HIU YING KOU:	My opinion 15 is that everybody should be -- you know, share   the 16 recession. It' s not only tenants. The landlord 17 also suffer too.18 That' s my opinion.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Okay .20 Mr. Scheinberg.21 MR. SCHEINBERG:	Is there a22 percentage increase you' re looking for ?23 MS. HIU YING KOU:	Well, I was 24 looking for at least 5 percent for one year and   825 percent for two years.2 

23	to 2007 .45678
You know, I think that, go  back MR. SCHEINBERG:	Thank you. MS. HIU YING KOU:		Thank you. CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :		Thank you.Jim Morgan.Who will be followed by  Teresa 
9	Boemio , representing Councilman Dan Garodnick.10 Forgive me if I  mispronounce 11 any names.12 MR. JIM MORGAN:	Good 13 afternoon.14 I' m Jim Morgan. I live in  a15 rent stabilized apartment on Avenue C and 12 th 16 Street . I am an adjunct faculty member at  NYU,17 which is fancy language, as you know, for  a18 part- time teacher.19 I' m not here to criticize or 20 complain about my landlord . I feel as  though 21 they' re well organized and fair and responsive to 22 the tenants' needs in the building . I don' t think 23 they' re harassing people like me who have been 24 there for a while in favor of getting people   to 25 leave.10 
2 What I want to do is take  my 3 time to say a little something about what I   would 4 call the culture of independent creativity in  New 5 York City that needs to be sustained by all of   us 6 for the health of the City , and that is, I ' m7 calling for a zero rent increase this year .  And 8 this is what I would like to say about   it.9 We often when we think  about 10 people living in rent regulated apartments in  the 11 arts, who are in one way or another eking out   an 12 existence doing sort of odd jobs while they  are 13 writing a novel or poetry or writing a play,   or 14 other people who work in some of the  technical 15 aspects of the theatre where they have  only 16 part- time employment or occasional employment and 17 so on.18 But actually this variety of 19 occupation spreads across the whole spectrum  of 20 work that you find being available in a city   like 21 New York.22 And the reason why I want  to 23 draw attention to it is that while people tend   to 24 dismiss people like that as sort of losers ,  in 25 fact, it' s people working in this way who form  the 2 
2 foundation for the kind of creative triumphs  on 3 which New York ' s, its national and international 4 reputation is based.5 And the point is that  these 6 people are able to be here and continue to   do 7 their work and make their services  available 8 because they are living in apartments where  the 9 rent has been regulated and many times for  many,10 many years , and thus they are able to stay  here.11 So this is really what I  would 12 like to say to you .13 Keep in mind that the 14 conglories of New York that we all are aware   of 15 are fundamentally based in the fact that there  are 16 many, many people living here you might say by   the 17 skin of their teeth who are providing the kinds   of 18 creative services on which the rest of it   is 19 based.20 Thank you.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you,22 Mr . Morgan .23 Robert Cohen. Mr. Cohen .24 MR. ROBERT COHEN:	Good 25 evening.2 
2 I' m here because I think 3 sometimes it' s important actually --4 A VOICE :	Can' t hear you.5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	A little 6 closer to the mike , please .7 MR. ROBERT COHEN:	All right.8 I' m here because sometimes I9 think it' s important for people to show up  to 10 really represent those people within our  community 11 that believe that sometimes when we' re trying to 12 do what' s right for one party, it' s harmful to 13 another.14 And I think fair and  equitable 15 is always what ' s important within working with 16 people .17 And in this particular  instance 18 where there' s representatives suggesting that 19 rents shouldn' t be increased, it' s important to 20 understand that expenses do increase and  these 21 expenses should be borne by all parties  obviously 22 and passed through .23 So if the cost of operating  a24 facility is increasing at a rate which  is 25 meaningful during this period of time - I know   the 2 
2 City needs money, I know organizations need  money 3 and they' re increasing taxes and they' re 4 increasing the cost of water, heat and things  of 5 that nature - those expenses should be passed  on 6 to the tenants as well so that the burden is   not 7 just borne by the owner who has fixed  expenses 8 that are rising at a rapid  rate.9 So, again, the point is  simple 10 that the discussion of reducing from what  was 11 already previously discussed is something that  we 12 strongly object to .13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	And do you 14 have a number that you would recommend ?15 MR. ROBERT COHEN:	I think it 16 should be proportional to the expenses . And  I17 think that you have the data probably as well   as 18 any building owner does.19 The expenses are rising at  a20 rate which is not two or three percent ,  but 21 probably five and six percent these  days.22 That doesn' t mean that there 23 would be agreement on all parties to  have 24 increases of that nature, but I think there   should 25 be some compromise in that  regard.2 
 2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.3 ( Applause.)4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Teresa, is 5 it Boemio? Representing Councilman Dan  Garodnick.6 MS. TERESA BOEMIO:	Good 7 afternoon, Chairman Kimmel and Members of the  Rent 8 Guidelines Board.9 My name is Dan Garodnick and  I10 represent the 4 th District in the New York  City 11 Council, an area that stretches from 14 th to 97 th 12 Streets on the East Side of Manhattan and   which 13 also includes a portion of the West 50 s  below 14 Central Park.15 The thousands of rent  regulated 16 tenants I represent have, as you might  expect,17 widely varying rents, incomes and tenancies,  but 18 everyone of them has been affected in some way   by 19 the continuing economic crisis in which we  find 20 ourselves today.21 The average unemployment rate 22 in 2009 was 9 . 5 percent, up from 5 . 4 percent in 23	2008 .24 For those with jobs wages  have 25 been stagnant or worse . According to the 24 
2 Independent Budget Office, this has been the  worst 3 recession in terms of wage loses. Average  wages 4 declined last year in 70 of the 88   private 5 industries - that' s a quote - those which  employ 6 more than eighty percent of New Yorkers in   the 7 private sector .8 This is the context in  which 9 you must base your decision.10 Put simply, New Yorkers  are 11 having an ever greater difficulty bearing the  cost 12 of increased rents .13 By contract , it appears that 14 landlords are doing better . As the Rent 15 Stabilization Association acknowledges in its  2010 16 report , quote, net operating income appears to 17 have increased this year, end quote. Indeed,  from 18 2007 to 2008 , owner' s revenue outpaced expenses by 19 5 . 8 percent.20 The well- being of tenants 21 depends in part on landlord' s ability to  provide 22 safe and well- maintained housing. Depriving 23 building owners of the necessary resources to  do 24 this is in no one' s interest.25 The question before you is  what 2 
2 assistance , if any , building owners are entitled 3 to in the form of allowable rent  increases .4 The Board currently proposes -5 gone dead?6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Is the mike 7 out?8 MS. TERESA BOEMIO:	The Board 9 currently proposes increases of 2 to 4 percent   for 10 one- year leases and 4 to 6 percent for two - year 11 leases .12 To the extent that  increases 13 are necessary at all, the Board should seek  the 14 lowest of them in keeping with its  own 15 commensurate rent adjustment formulas.16 At a time when New York City' s17 economy is experiencing the whiplash  of 18 contraction after many years of growth , I ask  that 19 you take into serious consideration the  millions 20 of New Yorkers struggling even to meet  their 21 current expenses and that your  decision 22 appropriately reflect the basic  financial 23 realities faced by the vast majority of the  City' s24 residents.25 Thank you.2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.3 ( Applause.)4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Jonathan 5 Davis representing Assemblymember Linda  Rosenthal.6 MR. JONATHAN DAVIS:	Thank you.7 I am Assemblymember Linda B .8 Rosenthal and I represent the 67 th Assembly 9 District, which includes the Upper West Side  of 10 Manhattan and parts of Clinton , Hell' s Kitchen .11 As Chair of the New York  State 12 Assembly' s Mitchell Lama Housing Subcommittee and 13 as a long- time tenant advocate , I urge the Rent 14 Guidelines Board to forego imposing any  rent 15 increases this year.16 My district is home  to 17 thousands of rent stabilized tenants and  this 18 Board' s decision is the primary factor in 19 determining whether or not my residents  and 20 tenants throughout the City can afford to  remain 21 in their homes .22 Many residents dedicate more 23 than thirty percent of their income to  rent 24 payments, and if they indeed have income at   all,25 it is because of the failing  economy.2 
2 As times have gotten tougher,3 it has become near impossible for countless  New 4 Yorkers to make ends meet.5 I ask that the RGB enact a   rent 6 freeze this year in consideration of our economy' s7 horrid fiscal standing , just as the Westchester 8 Rent Guidelines Board bravely and  thoughtfully 9 voted to do just two days  ago.10 With each successive year the 11 Rent Guidelines Board has worked to  incrementally 12 undermine and dismantle our City' s commitment to 13 providing affordable housing for our citizenry  and 14 appears intent on transforming our City' s stock  of 15 rental housing into units that are no  longer 16 within economic reach for the middle  and 17 low- income households most affected by New York 18 City' s housing shortage.19 In the 67 th Assembly District,20 these actions have had the additional  consequence 21 of reducing the diversity, vibrancy and  character 22 of our neighborhood as tenants with deep  community 23 roots are priced out of their area and must   leave 24 their homes behind .25 While today ' s proceedings have 2 
2 been perhaps accurately depicted as  a3 choreographed annual rite of passage in which  the 4 RGB solicits public comments, witnesses  compelling 5 accounts and overwhelming evidence of  the 6 hardships these increases inflict and  properly 7 levies the proposed raises originally sought,  this 8 does not need to be the  case.9 This Board can forego its 10 reputation as a virtual appendage of the  real 11 estate industry and elect to forego exacting  any 12 increases this year.13 What a compelling statement  it 14 would make and what relief it would be to   the 15 hundreds of thousands of tenants if the  Rent 16 Guidelines Board were to acknowledge New  York 17 City' s deep fiscal turmoil , one that is mirrored 18 throughout the nation.19 Surely this once in  a20 generation economic phenomenon could force us  all 21 to reevaluate our social priorities  and 22 allegiances and focus our attention on  those 23 struggling simply to keep up in one of the   most 24 costly cities to live in worldwide .25 Ignoring this plainly visible 2 
2 recession is myopic at best, and given  the 3 impeccable credentials and business acumen of  a4 majority of Board Members, must certainly  be 5 willful ignorance.6 The consequences of allowing a7 conventional rent increase to occur at  this 8 extraordinary moment can be measured in the  number 9 of tenants displaced and the direct results  of 10 this process.11 It is well- known that rising 12 Manhattan rents have caused inflated prices  in 13 Brooklyn, and this domino effect continues  until 14 those New Yorkers at the lowest socioeconomic  rung 15 experience the cost of this  sequence.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	I' m going to 17 ask you to please wrap  up.18 MR. JONATHAN DAVIS:	Sure.19 Sure.20 With our homeless shelters at 21 full capacity and the New York City  Housing 22 Authority unable to process thousands of Section  823 voucher requests, how does this end for these  New 24 Yorkers?25 The RGB ' s landlord friendly 2 
2 members may have made up their minds  before 3 today' s hearing, but any conclusion that is 4 reached without considering the full weight  of 5 this decision is an insult to those  testifying 6 here today and those struggling to maintain a   life 7 in the City.8 Thank you.9 ( Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Jonathan 11 Rosen.12 MR. JONATHAN ROSEN:	I am 13 Jonathan Rosen and I have lived at the   Hotel 14 Windermere , a Class A apartment hotel for  over 15 thirty - four years.16 I am outraged that  the 17 landlords are demanding a rent  increase.18 For all the violations  and 19 reductions in services in violation of the  Hotel 20 Stabilization Law, we deserve a rent reduction ,21 not an increase.22 Some of these violations 23 include a dirty ventilation system  previously 24 cited by the Department of Health. A system  wide 25 cleaning was ordered but never adequately  done 2 
2 because no City agency has the equipment  to 3 inspect the inside of the ventilation  shafts.4 Renovations to apartments 5 performed without adequate dust barriers  resulting 6 in dust travelling throughout the building  and 7 into other apartments.8 This is a 1927  fireproof 9 building with asbestos between the walls and  under 10 the fireboards . Yet when these renovations are 11 done, we never see qualified asbestos  removal 12 contractors, much less dust barriers.13 Fire doors which are not 14 self- closing.15 Garbage on the firestairs  and 16 landings every night impeding egress, not  to 17 mention a fire hazard.18 Major repairs to the exterior 19 of the walls have caused copious amounts of  dust 20 from ground- up brick and mortar to circulate 21 throughout the air shaft and into our  apartments.22 Even if we keep our windows closed during  hours 23 when the work is in progress, every  exterior 24 surface including scaffolding, window sills  and 25 air conditioners is covered by a thin blanket   of 2 
2 this dust which is then carried into  our 3 apartments by air currents as soon as we open   our 4 windows.5 Many of these apartments have 6 windows facing the air shaft and no other  source 7 of ventilation .8 Yet no attempt has been made  to 9 ameliorate this condition or even to notify  the 10 tenants of when the contractors will be working  in 11 their area .12 Management has failed to 13 maintain various building amenities and  community 14 areas. Apartments are being rented without  hotel 15 services and there is every appearance of  a16 conversion from a hotel to an apartment  house 17 without proper permits or  procedure.18 In addition to these 19 violations , management refuses to rent vacant 20 units sometimes for years at a time until  they 21 have two units side- by - side and then combine them 22 and rent them for market  rate.23 If they do re- rent the vacant 24 unit without enlarging it, they renovate  sometimes 25 without proper work permits and have been known  to 2 
2 claim a renovation increase in excess of what   that 3 allowed based on over- inflated costs and erroneous 4 receipts and they rent it without services  even 5 though the rent is predicated on the inclusion  of 6 those services .7 By these means the  landlord 8 exacerbates the housing shortage, fails  to 9 properly maintain his property often  creating 10 hazardous conditions and gives himself an  illegal 11 rent increase.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Mr. Rosen,13 I' m going to ask you to please wrap it  up.14 MR.

2 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:3 Congratulations to the new  Chair.4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.5 And congratulations to you.6 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:7 Thank you very much. I appreciate  it.8 I didn' t provide a written 9 testimony, you know, to give to everyone who is   on 10 the dais. I wanted to speak from the heart   today.11 And I think that the  problem 12 with the way this works - and this is to   the 13 media, this is to everyone on the Panel - we   ask 14 the wrong questions, we try to pretend that  the 15 answers are the right answers.16 Usually it' s portrayed as, if 17 both sides are upset, then we' ve done  something 18 good. And I think that ' s a huge problem because 19 that' s categorically wrong .20 Because we never really ask  --21 the first question is whether there should be   an 22 increase to begin with . We always go to how  much 23 the increase should be .24 And I think the purpose of  the 25 Board is to really decide whether or not  there 2 
2 should have been a rent increase to begin  with .3 It ' s a zero sum game that the tenants lose every 4 single year. Every year there' s an increase.5 The real question, and I  really 6 would love an answer for this, is there  --7 particularly to the owners -- is there an   economic 8 climate that you can think of where there  should 9 be a rent freeze and what does that look at.   I10 really would like to  know.11 For forty some odd  years 12 there' s been a rent increase every single  year 13 whether owners are making money, whether  owners 14 are not making money, regardless of what  tenants 15 are, there is a rent increase every single  year.16 I would love somebody to  be 17 able to answer the question: What does the   climate 18 look like when there is not a rent increase   for 19 tenants?20 Because obviously in forty 21 years we haven ' t seen it so I don' t know if we 22 will ever get it.23 And if we can' t answer those 24 questions honestly , how do we then skip over to  we 25 automatically get a rent increase and then  say 2 
2 that, well , both sides are mad so now we' ve done  a3 good job?4 The question really is do  we 5 need a rent increase.6 The question is how do we  begin 7 to separate out landlords who are really not  doing 8 a good job - and I have I think a    more unique 9 perspective on this than most people. I come   from 10 the advocacy side. Now I' m an elected official .11 I' m a homeowner with tenants. I' m also a rent 12 stabilized tenant. So I understand every part  of 13 how this works and all the  complexities.14 And I think we begin by  asking 15 the wrong questions.16 So I' m going to concede my last 17 forty seconds to see if somebody can really  answer 18 that question for me of what does a climate   look 19 like when we can have a rent  freeze.20 MS. CRUZ:	I' ll venture --21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Ms. Cruz .22 MS. CRUZ:	I' ll venture an 23 answer to you --24 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:25 Thank you.2 
2 MS. CRUZ:	-- because in the 3 realm of apartments that have gone to  market,4 there are many , many owners that have, in fact ,5 reduced the rents because the market forces  have 6 caused the rents to go  down.7 There' s no rent regulation in 8 market housing and it is under those  circumstances 9 where you could have rent decreases, not  zero 10 increases, but rent decreases.11 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:12 New York' s -- first of all , rent control and rent 13 stabilization is one of the best and  biggest 14 affordable housing programs and we need to call  it 15 what it is . It is an affordable housing  program.16 New York City has a  terrible,17 terrible history of dealing with people,  middle 18 class to low income. There is nothing to say   that 19 providing a free market system would help  the 20 rents go down. That' s preposterous because now , as 21 it stands, with these rent guidelines, we  have 22 owners who break the law and take it out in   rent 23 stabilization and raise rents illegally right  now.24 So what ' s going to happen when 25 they have carte blanche to do that with  no 2 
2 regulations? Sometimes they don' t even register 3 those rent stabilized. There' s a lot of  craziness 4 that goes on.5 And I understand that  sometimes 6 it ' s not everybody . The problem is one landlord 7 can affect and does affect hundreds and  thousands 8 of tenants . And that' s why the law is the way  it 9 is .10 You may have one tenant that  is 11 bad. Granted. And I really feel sorry  particularly 12 for those having six units or less because  that 13 can be a hard thing. And I ' ve dealt and worked 14 with owners of that.15 But when you have owners  who 16 have hundreds of tenants, and one tenant that' s17 bad, it doesn' t affect you as much .18 And we have to sit here  and 19 figure out how we can also protect the  tenants .20 Every single year there' s an increase. We  know 21 there' s going to be an increase. You know  right 22 now there' s going to be increase.23 The question in most of  your 24 minds is how much that increase should  be.25 What I' m saying is, and though 2 
2 you didn' t answer my question, what does the 3 climate look like, what is the economic  climate 4 for owners that could make you say , yes,  tenants 5 deserve a rent freeze.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' ll handle 7 that one.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Mr.9 Schleider.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you,11 Councilmember.12 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:13 Thank you.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	First, New York 15 is an anomaly compared to the rest of the   country.16 Two - thirds of our population 17 are renters, be they regulated or free  market,18 one- third are owners. The rest of the country it' s19 two- thirds are owners and one- third is a renter,20 either rent- regulated or deregulated or market .21 There are swats of this  country 22 where for miles upon square miles we have no   rent 23 regulation . For states upon states we have no  rent 24 regulation . We also have rents that are 25 significantly lower than what we see in New  York 2 

2	City.3
And the housing stock is  very 
4 homogeneous. The rent levels are very  homogeneous.5 We have the market itself  in 6 those locations dictating what the rent  structures 7 are going to be like, whether rents are going   to 8 rise because of economic conditions allowing  such 9 or rents are going to fall because  economic 10 conditions provide for such.11 You asked the question specific 12 to New York City. And the rent regulated   housing 13 stock here is fairly static. Tenants don' t  move 14 like they move in other parts of the country.   And 15 that' s based on the rent regulation providing 16 tenant protections , a leasehold interest that is 17 valuable to the tenants, and they have an   economic 18 stake in preserving their positive  leasehold 19 interest.20 So those tenants don' t move .21 We have a significant  housing 22 shortage here because you don' t have that  inherent 23 mobility in our housing stock.24 So landlords are strapped with 25 rents that are at a certain  structure,4 
2 administratively so, that are lower than what  a3 market condition in this City would allow  them 4 either to rise or the higher rents to fall   down 5 towards we had some sort of  equilibrium.6 The economic climate, given the 7 rent regulation picture that we have in the  City,8 would be your Council reduces real estate  taxes,9 your Council puts pressure on the Water Board  to 10 reduce , significantly reduce the water and sewer 11 charges, and remove the horrendous amount of  fees 12 that are charged just purely as revenue  generators 13 for the City.14 Now we' re talking about an 15 economic climate that government is providing  the 16 incentive for landlords to say , okay, the 17 partnership is working now so that government  is,18 who is our silent partner and a preferred   revenue 19 stream partner , because they get their taxes 20 first, they get their water and sewer  charges 21 first, they get their fees from the  inspections 22 and everything else that goes on first before  the 23 landlord does, all right, so now government  has 24 created an environment that is easing up the   cost 25 burden , the expense profile for these properties.2 
2 We would be more than happy  to 3 do a rent freeze, possibly a rollback - who   knows?4 But you asked for  the 5 situation. That' s the economic climate and 6 picture. Get busy.7 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:8 That' s -- there' s a lot of things going on  that 9 you said.10 One , you know, from the 11 advocacy point of view when I was organizing,   one 12 of the problems that we did have in   coalescing 13 tenant organizations is that tenants did move.  So 14 I don' t know if -- where the basis is and I' d  like 15 to actually figure out how much tenants do   move 16 because when I was organizing we did have   a17 problem with people moving too much to keep  a18 cohesive organization.19 But I also have a follow- up 20 question to what you' re saying because both of  you 21 answered.22 What I felt was that  you 23 probably don' t want rent stabilization and your 24 goal is maybe to eliminate  that.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Not at all.2 
2 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:3 Okay. But it sounded like from what you  were 4 saying .5 So my question is:	One , no one 6 asked owners to purchase the buildings that  they 7 purchased that they knew were on  rent 8 stabilization or rent control.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You don ' t want 10 to go there.11 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:12 Yes, we do , I do. Because they did . They  purchased 13 it and want to make money. And I want them to    make 14 money.15 The goal of the Panel here  is 16 not to make sure they make a certain amount   of 17 money. That' s not the goal here.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That' s correct.19 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:20 What I want to find out, with everything  that 21 you' re saying, how can you fairly assess  whether 22 or not there should be a rent freeze? Because   the 23 question that the Panel should be asking,  the 24 system that is set up in New York City is   rent 25 stabilization and rent control .2 
2 The question you should first 3 ask is what is the economic climate and does   it 4 deserve to have a rent  increase.5 And I don' t think the majority 6 of people on the Panel , including yourselves,  can 7 fairly assess that question. And that is a   problem 8 for me .9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Now , sir, I ' m10 confused because you did ask the question  under 11 what economic conditions would we  --12 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:13 Yes, but you' re talking about --14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- consider a15 rent decrease.16 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:17 -- the anomaly --18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I answered that 19 question and I think quite clearly .20 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:21 You talk about -- but, also, owners get  more 22 breaks than the tenants do .23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	We can argue 24 that point under a different venue .25 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:2 
2 Period . Period . Period . They just do.3 And anything you get, you  pass 4 on .5 You look at MCIs. It' s the 6 biggest farce I' ve ever seen. Continuing into 7 perpetuity .8 There are so many things  where 9 owners can make money.10 The job here is not to say  they 11 should make a certain amount of money, which  is 12 what I feel gets done every time. We have to   make 13 sure they make a certain amount of  money.14 I want everybody to make  money.15 I want to make money off the home that I    own. So I16 understand that.17 But what happens in this  City 18 is we always make money off the backs of   the 19 people who can least afford to spend it. And   we 20 don' t think about them . And I do not think this 21 Panel thinks about them.22 All I' m asking is that we first 23 really look at the question of whether  there 24 should be a rent freeze at all before we   decide 25 there should be a rent increase and how   much 2 

2	should that be .3
And I applaud Westchester 
4 County for putting a rent freeze into  their 5 system . And I really, really would love if you  can 6 honestly just ask yourselves that question  first.7 I know what the vote is  going 8 to be. I know who is going to vote where.   But 9 first ask that question of whether there should  be 10 one first, whether the landlords have made  money,11 whether they' re not making money, whether they say 12 they' re going to lose out on oil because there ' s a13 lot of money going to get lost there and   that 14 money doesn' t get lost and you still come back  and 15 ask for more money .16 All these things end up  with 17 landlords making money .18 And I think that makes  this 19 process a sham . And I think to correct that  would 20 have to ask the correct  question.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Now , when we 22 have an increase in inventory of  distressed 23 properties which the Board classifies as  expenses 24 exceeding income, and one in ten properties  --25 that more than one in ten properties have   that 4 
2 economic profile challenge , and that' s been 3 increasing , how would you address those 4 properties ?5 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:6 First, I would love to see the books of the   owners 7 so that we can believe and understand exactly   what 8 you are putting forth.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	It' s like 10 talking to a  wall.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Ms. Levine.12 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:13 If you ' re telling me something , I' d like to see 14 it .15 MS. LEVINE:	Thank you for your 16 testimony.17 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:18 Thank you.19 MS. LEVINE:	I hear you on 20 asking the right questions . But I think that I ' m21 going to reject the premise of which you think   the 22 right question is.23 My question to you as  a24 legislator is do you really think that this law   is 25 a good law , that this law actually addresses  the 2 
2 problems that it' s supposed to address , that it 3 really protects the people who most need it  as 4 well as preserving the housing  stock.5 We' re seeing loses in the 6 housing stock every year because it' s not 7 profitable for landlords to continue to run it ,  in 8 addition to all of the things like  vacancy 9 decontrol --10 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:11 I' m sorry. When you say law, do you mean  rent 12 stabilization?13 MS. LEVINE:	-- et cetera.14 Wait. I listened to you .15 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:16 I want to understand your question when you   said 17 law.18 MS. LEVINE:	I' m getting to it.19 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:20 Thank you.21 MS. LEVINE:	You asked if we 22 need a rent increase.23 I' m going to ask you if you 24 think that this law is really what is  good .25 What I' m looking for, what I' m2 
 2 dying to see, is one brave legislator to   come 3 forward and say not that there is a problem   with 4 this Board , but there is a problem with  the 5 underlying law that we ' re asked to enforce or to 6 come to an action  under.7 We heard testimony earlier 8 today that there is not enough regulated  housing 9 stock for homeless people coming out of  shelters 10 to get regulated housing.11 You asked - - you just mentioned 12 breaks , that there is more breaks for  landlords 13 than there are tenants .14 Well, you' re in the position to 15 actually legislate more breaks for the tenants .16 That' s what you do . You get to go to work everyday 17	--18 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:19 That' s not true.20 MS. LEVINE:	-- and address --21 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:22 That power is in the State .23 MS. LEVINE:	-- opportunities.24 You have --25 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:18 
2 Most of that power is in the State .3 MS. LEVINE:	-- opportunities 4 everyday. We just sit here .5 So I want to know if you  really 6 think that this law that we' re asked to come  up 7 with a number under this law - and that' s the   best 8 we can do - if    you really and truly think -- and I9 don' t expect you to be able to answer that  today 10 -- but if you' re going to ask me to ask  myself 11 questions --12 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:13 I' d be happy to answer you now .14 MS. LEVINE:	-- I' m going to 15 ask you to ask the question if this law is   really 16 a good law .17 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:18 Are you talking about rent stabilization and  rent 19 control?20 MS. LEVINE:	Yes.21 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:22 Absolutely , one hundred percent, categorically 23 yes.24 All of these housing programs,25 affordable housing programs, whether it' s rent 2 
2 stabilization, whether it' s Mitchell Lama, or the 3 Section 8 , provide a function that ' s desperately 4 needed .5 And we see what happens  when 6 those functions no longer exist. We see  what 7 happens when speculators come in. We see  what 8 happens when landlords take their  buildings 9 outside of Mitchell Lama, out of Section 8 .  It 10 will be a complete wild, wild west . We lose  more 11 affordable units than we can ever pretend  that 12 we ' re going to build.13 So the only way  --14 MS. LEVINE:	Can' t you do 15 better to preserve it?16 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:17 The only - -18 MS. LEVINE:	Can' t you find a19 better way to preserve  it?20 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:21 That' s what I' m talking about.22 But we can' t preserve it if you 23 raise the rents every year .24 And most of the things that  you 25 said - -2 
2 MS. LEVINE:	That' s a - -3 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:4 -- that I can -- most of the things that you   said 5 I can do are actually powers in the State which   I6 fight everyday to try to repeal, the Erstadt  Law,7 so I would have more power in the  City .8 If you want to help me lobby  to 9 do that, I would welcome  it.10 MS. LEVINE:	I' m thrilled to 11 help you. I offer my help to legislators who   come 12 here every year.13 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:14 Thank you very much.15 But to answer your question ,16 it ' s a categorical , emphatical yes .17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Ms. Adams.18 MS. ADAMS:	If I am 19 understanding you correctly, that you think  that 20 the rent stabilization law as written  is 21 absolutely categorically right as it  is.22 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:23 I don' t think there is any problem that can' t  use 24 improvement.25 I think the basics	--2 
2 MS. ADAMS:	Okay. One - -3 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:4 -- of what rent stabilization and rent  control 5 were designed to do is correct . Can there  be 6 tweaks ? Yes. Can there be tweaks in what you  do?7 Yes.8 MS. ADAMS:	Well, I would think 9 that it' s more than a tweak.10 One of the big problems that  we 11 see every year that we come in here is that   it 12 takes the one- size - fits- all approach.13 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:14 I agree.15 MS. ADAMS:	And that the whole 16 cost structure is different for people who ,  say,17 own one brownstone with six units as opposed  to 18 people who may own two thousand  units.19 And the law does not allow  us 20 to make a difference of units up to ten or   units 21 to a hundred, units to a thousand, and that   sort 22 of thing. And that is one of the reasons  - -23 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:24 I agree.25 MS. ADAMS:	-- that I would  say 2 

2	it ' s not good -- 3
COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:
4 I agree a hundred percent. That was one of   the 5 most sensible things I ' ve heard.6 But one year it would be  great 7 to err on the side of the other side. You   always 8 err on the side of giving the increases. Let' s  err 9 on the side of the rent  freezes.10 MS. ADAMS:	But the question 11 was not which side to err on. It was do you   think 12 this law is correct as presently  written.13 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:14 I do think -- that ' s a different question than 15 what you were asking.16 MS. LEVINE:	No , it ' s the same 17 question. It' s the exact question I' m asking you.18 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:19 But you just added the word " as  presently 20 written," is what you said .21 MS. ADAMS:	Okay.22 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:23 I do think there are problems that can be   fixed 24 with rent stabilization and rent  control.25 I do think every year you  give 4 
2 a rent increase I guess to solve the   problem 3 you' re talking about. One year we could get a  rent 4 freeze to lift the burden from some other  people 5 who need assistance.6 MS. ADAMS:	Okay.7 I want to make sure that I' m8 understanding you correctly.9 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:10 Yes.11 MS. ADAMS:	That the current 12 law that we operate under, the Rent  Stabilization 13 Law, you' re saying that you agree with it  as 14 written a hundred percent?15 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:16 That - - I just answered your question more  than 17 once.18 The current law as written  has 19 issues in it that I think need to be  fixed .20 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you very 21 much.22 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:23 You' re welcome .24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.25 Ms. Holder.2 
2 MS. HOLDER:	Yes.3 Mr. Schleider had said 4 something about the increase in  distressed 5 property. I just wanted to make sure that  I6 understood from your vantage point as an  organizer 7 and now as an elected official and someone who   is 8 familiar with issues around housing. And, also ,9 congratulations, Councilman Williams, very happy 10 to have you there.11 But what we see , and I' m just 12 talking off of my experience, is that in   our 13 caseload at the Legal Aid Society one of   the 14 things that we had to shift to start doing   two 15 years ago was actually doing more building  work.16 We always had a housing development unit and   we 17 always did building work, but we ended up   having 18 to do more building work with your  former 19 organization as well as, you know, Maggie' s20 organization, other groups that you have,  because 21 what we found is that there was an increase in   the 22 distressed property --23 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:24 Physical distress.25 MS. HOLDER:	I' m sorry?2 
2 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:3 You' re talking physical distress?4 MS. HOLDER:	Physical stress,5 yes, physical distress .6 -- of housing stock because  of 7 overleveraging .8 And that was the problem  that 9 we saw . And that' s why we' ve gone, we try to band 10 together and work collaboratively with for - profits 11 as well as non - for - profits and folks to try and 12 figure out how to preserve this housing stock  and 13 get responsible owners and good business  people 14 who actually will deal with these  units.15 So that ' s what we' ve seen in 16 distressed property. Again , that' s just our 17 caseload. And I made that shift in terms of   our 18 priority in our housing work to deal with what   was 19 the trend that we were seeing in our   communities,20 in our caseload, about overleveraging which  was 21 creating and adding to the distressed  property 22 stock.23 What is it that you ' ve seen 24 with your experience in the various positions  that 25 you hold?2 
2 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:3 I do think that the primary reason for   the 4 increase in distressed properties, both  physical 5 and economic, is overleveraging, is  speculation,6 people coming in, paying more than what  the 7 property is worth, then can' t afford it, so  then 8 can' t pay, and then also stop making repairs.9 There' s a lot of managers who 10 just walked away from properties.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Fine.12 Just --13 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:14 There are -- just let me  finish.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m sorry. Go 16 ahead.17 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:18 There are other ways that people can fix  their 19 properties without walking away that  definitely 20 don' t include raising rents.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Understood.22 Just to be clear, the  stats 23 that we have are only through 2008 , most  likely 24 before the foreclosures occurred, to calculate  the 25 rate of distressed properties and the rate  of 2 
 2 increase in distressed properties.3 And just to be clear  mortgages 4 are not calculated in what determines, or  debt 5 service is not calculated in what determines  a6 distressed property.7 A distressed property is  taxes,8 maintenance, labor , administration , utilities,9 miscellaneous, fuel, insurance ; no mortgage costs.10 All right? And those costs exceed the rent  that' s11 collected. That dictates what a  distressed 12 property is by our  definition.13 It has nothing to do  with 14 whether or not a property is leveraged  or 15 overleveraged or not leveraged at all. It' s  just 16 purely the operational expenses are not met by   the 17 rents. End of story.18 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS: 19	I --20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So all we' re 21 going to do is just increase the rate  of 22 distressed properties if we start counting in  the 23 overall economic aspect.24 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:25 All I' m saying is both sides sit down, open  books 20 
2 and see exactly what' s going on.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That' s fine .4 MS. HOLDER:	But you know that 5 a lot of operating costs are not being able to   be 6 met because people did not properly do the   due 7 diligence that ' s required when you actually make 8 purchases of a  building.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I don' t know 10 that and you don' t know that. Come on, Adriene !11 MS. HOLDER:	And oftentimes 12 this Board is in a position where we are asked   to 13 bail out people who actually are bad  business 14 people . That is not everybody. Certainly are not 15 the folks that easily come before us and speak   to 16 us --17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But this Board 18 is also asked to bail out tenants. If you want   to 19 go down that road, we can go down that   road,20 Adriene.21 But --22 MS. HOLDER:	We can go --23 ( Overlapping conversation.)24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Our definition 25 of distressed properties - -2 
2 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:3 Every year we have bailed out owners. We   have 4 never ever , ever bailed out tenants.5 So we should go down that  road.6 ( Applause.)7 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:8 Based on what you just said. Based on your   work,9 because every year you bail out owners ,  every 10 single year.11 All I' m saying -- and you just 12 said you' d be happy to open the books so we  can 13 both look at it. Is that an accurate  statement ?14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I don' t have 15 books. I don' t own property.16 MS. CRUZ:	Councilman, before 17 -- we have many owners that come forward  and 18 present their income statements to  us.19 It is not an unusual  situation 20 where we are able to see the books of fairly   large 21 property owners in the City.22 No one here is trying to  hide 23 income . The facts are that , as --24 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:25 I would love to see  --2 
2 MS. CRUZ: - - Mr ., as my 3 colleague indicated here, --4 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:5 -- how many owners would be  --6 MS. CRUZ:	-- we have a  high 7 percentage of distressed properties that they  have 8 nothing to do with  overleveraging.9 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:10 I would love to see how many owners, big   owners,11 are living on forty, sixty , eighty percent of 12 their ( unintelligible) income. I' d love to see 13 that.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Boy!15 All right. Sorry.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you,17 Councilman .18 COUNCILMEMBER JUMAANI WILLIAMS:19 Thank you.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Tom Diana.21 Nice to see you again  this 22 week.23 MR. THOMAS DIANA:	You know, I24 almost have to laugh.25 We have a property owner  here 2 
2 complaining he doesn' t know what it costs to run  a3 building. Okay ? I find that amazing how we  can 4 have a property owner come here and say he has   no 5 idea of how much it costs to run a   building.6 You guys have - I don' t know  -7 thirty pages of documents. Your entire  thirty 8 pages of documents are incorrect? Okay ?9 So if we use your own  records,10 your own calculations for 2011 , the cost of 11 maintaining an apartment would be  approximately 12 $ 1000 . You guys can argue the pennies, but that' s13 your own research. Okay?14 You ' re showing that there are 15 300 , 000 apartments under $ 1000 . The court case 16 just showed that.17 You got 200 , 000 that are under 18 $ 400 a month.19 That' s your own research. So 20 you can argue with it.21 Based on tenants' own 22 testimony, most of SCRIE should cover the 300 , 000 23 apartments . Yet, nobody is applying for SCRIE.24 I' ve got stacks of this. They' re not applying for 25 SCRIE. Okay? I ' ve got the applications , which, by 2 
2 the way, are from the New York City Department   of 3 Finance. So there are City remedies supposedly  for 4 this problem.5 They use mystery men to  explain 6 how they pay - - have a $ 400 rent, pay half  their 7 income and simultaneously make too much for  SCRIE.8 The math doesn ' t work.9 Quinn, Paterson , Rangel , Koch,10 Dinkins, all have stabilized and  controlled 11 apartments . Yet they have owned rental properties.12 I mean how fair is that? The State is $ 9   billion 13 in debt, yet they come here and you treat   them 14 like financial rock stars. How many more of   them 15 must go to jail before you start treating  them 16 like the con artists they  are.17 Let ' s stop with the stories . We 18 all want a phantasy job being a singer , a   rock 19 star, an artist, a basketball star . Okay? But  the 20 landlords should not have to finance  their 21 forty- year old dream to be discovered. Okay? Leave 22 the people who are paying their fair share .  Okay?23 Hit the freeloaders with a big increase. Let   SCRIE 24 be the one to pay  it.25 They pay everything under $ 1200 2 
 2 for seniors, for the disabled. And we all   keep 3 getting away from that . Nobody wants to discuss 4 the $ 99 rents. Okay? There ' s 1200 of them out 5 there. All right? It' s chilling people .6 Our high- end rents have tanked.7 Okay? They ' re gone . There' s not enough gay yuppie 8 guys out there who want to pay $ 2 , 000 / $ 3 , 000 for 9 an apartment. They ' re gone .10 And you guys have got  to 11 recognize that . It ' s really not fair to ask those 12 people to pay more when other people are paying 13	$ 99 .14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	I' m going to 15 ask you to wrap up .16 MR. THOMAS DIANA:	That' s17 close enough.18 And you notice, I wore  my 19 t- shirt for politicians.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.21 You can leave them on  the 22 table.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Councilmember 24 Robert Jackson .25 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:14 
2 Good afternoon , everyone!3 And let me thank you for  being 4 here and listening to the testimony of the   public 5 regarding the proposed rent  increases.6 And , Mr . Chairman, I believe 7 this is your first term.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Yes, it is.9 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:10 Congratulations. I hope it ' s a successful one on 11 behalf of everyone involved.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.13 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:14 My name is Robert  Jackson.15 And since 2002 , I' ve had the 16 privilege of representing parts of Upper  Manhattan 17 neighborhoods, of Morningside Heights,  West 18 Harlem , Hamilton Heights, Washington Heights and 19 Inwood in the City Council . And for eight years  I20 have made the trek down here to Cooper Hall   in 21 order to speak on the proposed rent  guidelines 22 before this Board, one of few legislators that   do 23 so on a continuous basis. And this year is   no 24 exception.25 I ask the Board , as I' ve seen 2 
2 many of you here before, to reject the  proposed 3 increases and follow the lead of  Westchester 4 County and freeze our  rents.5 As we all know, these are  dire 6 economic times and every measurement attests  to 7 this. Production is down, unemployment is up  over 8 ten percent in the early months of this  year,9 personal bankruptcies are up, earnings of  rent 10 stabilized and rent controlled tenants down  by 11 roughly 1 . 5 to 2 . 4 percent respectively.12 Half of all households in 13 rental buildings in New York City - and a   majority 14 of my constituents live in rental buildings -   pay 15 more than 31 percent of their income for rent,   and 16 an alarming 29 . 4 percent pay more than half of 17 their income for rent, which does not leave  much 18 for the necessities of life, like food ,  utilities 19 or health care .20 Yet analysis demonstrates that 21 owners of buildings under your purview are  making 22 money.23 It is true that some owners  are 24 in distress because -- for various reasons ,  but 25 also because some of them have  grossly 2 
2 overleveraged themselves and created a  predatory 3 equity situation. And those that did that,  that 4 greedy miscalculation on their part cannot  be 5 remedied on the backs of the  renters.6 ( Applause.)7 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:8 Apart from freezing the rents, this is the  moment 9 in time to insist on terms and conditions  for 10 future adjustments predicated on these  principles.11 One , require owners with 12 serious violations , Class B and C violations,  to 13 correct these conditions before any  Rent 14 Guidelines Board adjustments upward is 15 implemented.16 Two , require owners to document 17 and justify the costs attributed to  improvements 18 before an increase in the rent is  allowed.19 Three, penalize owners who  do 20 not register all rent stabilized apartments  with 21 the Division of Housing and Community  Renewal.22 Five, pass a resolution of  this 23 Board asking the State Legislature to  eliminate 24 the $ 2000 vacancy decontrol ceiling.25 I urge you to impose  these 2 
2 reforms and freeze rents at their current  level.3 ( Applause.)4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.5 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:6 I' ve submitted my testimony for the record and  I7 read it into the record, and I ask you to   consider 8 all of the things that I put  forward.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you,10 Councilmember.11 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:12 Thank you.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Ms. Adams.14 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you for your 15 testimony. I appreciate your coming in every  year.16 But help me out here a  bit.17 In terms of the things that  we 18 would like -- that you suggested be required  of 19 owners before rent increases were imposed,  my 20 understanding of the law that we operate  under 21 does not allow for  that.22 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:23 Well, you know , I' m not a member of the Board.  But 24 if , in fact, it' s your jurisdiction, then I ask 25 you to do that .2 
2 MS. ADAMS:	I don' t --3 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:4 If you ' re saying to me that is not within your 5 jurisdiction to do that, then you can' t do  that 6 obviously.7 But what you can do , to the 8 best of my knowledge, unless you tell me you  can' t9 do that, you could pass a resolution saying  that 10 you feel a certain way .11 As you know , if you don ' t know,12 in the City Council the City Council passes  laws,13 which we, when they' re introduced, they call it 14 intro, and we pass resolutions . And resolutions 15 have no effect of law. But resolutions express   the 16 will of the body.17 And so I don' t know if you  can,18 but if you can do, assuming that you can' t  do 19 certain things because you don ' t have the 20 authority within your rules and regulations,  then 21 I ask you to consider, if you can, pass   resolution 22 expressing your opinion about certain  things 23 because those opinions will be taken hopefully  up 24 to Albany and be considered by the  State 25 Legislature or by those individuals who have  the 2 
2 authority to make those types of decisions .3 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.4 I' m sure that we will take that 5 under consideration.6 Let me ask you one  more 7 question.8 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:9 Yes, ma' am .10 MS. ADAMS:	Has the City 11 Council passed such a  resolution?12 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:13 Have we passed --14 MS. ADAMS:	With regard to 15 moderate income housing in the  City.16 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:17 We ' ve passed many resolutions concerning housing 18 and rent stabilization laws. We have to do that,   I19 believe, every year in order to send up to   Albany.20 MS. ADAMS:	And have they had 21 any effect that you know  of?22 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:23 Well, you know , as you know, Public Member  Ms.24 Adams, it' s a process of negotiations up  in 25 Albany .2 
2 MS. ADAMS:	Yes .3 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:4 And I would be naive to stand here and say   that 5 that was not the case.6 But I think as a Board if   no 7 one came down here to give testimony on one way   or 8 the other, then it ' s left up to you to decide.9 But by hearing testimony you' ll 10 get the opportunity to maybe hear something  new,11 or if not to hear something new, to hear the   same 12 requests that are made over and over  by 13 individuals that come forward.14 And as you know , I come  forward 15 representing - - the majority of the constituents 16 that I represent in Northern Manhattan  are 17 renters. So the majority of constituents I ' m here 18 to represent - - and obviously I have hundreds  of 19 homeowners and I have thousands of co- op and  condo 20 owners . But the majority of people are renters .21 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you very 22 much.23 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:24 You' re welcome .25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.2

2 I' m asking for a rent freeze 3 this year. I don' t have to talk about the  economy.4 I know you all understand that .5 I just want to give you  some 6 insight into the type of owners of the   buildings 7 in my neighborhood , what they are like .8 There are a few businesses  that 9 are buying up many buildings. So these are   the 10 same people who own many, many buildings. And,  for 11 example, my building was purchased  about 12 two- and- a- half years ago by one of these, you 13 know, large -- they' ll say they' re not , they have 14 all these different LLCs, but they ' re all 15 connected.16 The first thing they did  was 17 they raised the fees for washers and dryers.  The 18 next thing they did was not give us enough heat   in 19 October when it was cold enough. I know the law   on 20 that. We were going to do a rent reduction   that 21 year. We planned and got signatures. The  building 22 manager spoke to at least one elderly tenant  to 23 basically intimidate her into taking her name  off 24 of that list. These things happen.  Okay.25 We have -- we got a new   super 2 
2 whose whole family lives there , but we have  no 3 porters. Okay.4 We don' t have an emergency 5 phone number to call. Our superintendent is  not 6 there a lot or he' s unreachable.7 And the last thing -- there ' s8 lots of things that they don' t do and this is  what 9 we ' re paying for. And we have a lot of people 10 paying market rate now .11 And I want to understand  why 12 the increases that you approve have become  more 13 expensive for two- year leases than for one - year 14 leases because it didn ' t used to be that way. I15 believe that it creates a trend in population  and 16 I ask you if you would like that where you live,   a17 transient population where community ties  cannot 18 be formed and where the buildings are unsafe as   a19 result because people who know each other look  out 20 for each other . And I don' t understand why that' s21 happening. Can anyone answer that?22 MS. HOLDER:	You' re talking 23 about the discrepancy where there used to be   like 24 a two percent spread between one and  two- year 25 leases , and we ' ve seen through the years, as I ,2 
2	that it' s more like a three percent or , you know, 3	--4 MS. ROBIN ROSIELLO:	No. What 5 I' m saying is for a one- year lease it' s, you know,6 3 percent, for a two- year lease it ' s 6 percent .7 MS. HOLDER:	Right.8 MS. ROBIN ROSIELLO:	It wasn' t9 that way. It was the  reverse.10 MS. HOLDER:	Right. It used to 11 be more like a two percent spread, now it' s   a12 three percent spread.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	How far back 14 are you going with your memory ?15 MS. ROBIN ROSIELLO:	At least 16 a couple of years. Am I remembering wrong,   that 17 figure ?18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes .19 I mean I' m just looking clearly 20 back to nineteen eighty --21 MS. ROBIN ROSIELLO:	Or maybe 22 less of a discrepancy like you  said.23 MS. HOLDER:	No .24 MS. ROBIN ROSIELLO:	Or more 25 of a discrepancy.4 

23	discrepancy.45	right.6
MS. HOLDER:	More of aA DIRECTOR:	I think you' re MS. HOLDER:	I think that what 
7 some of the thinking of the Board has been , and  I8 think it' s been on the record for years, is  that 9 if there was a big -- there was a larger or    wider 10 spread between one and two - year, it would prompt 11 people to go into one- year lease renewals and,12 therefore, their rents would go up more  quickly 13 than in two years because we know the long - term 14 tenants have always taken two years, their  rents 15 overall tend to be less than those  others.16 And I think our Chair  was 17 pointing out that was easily the thinking  behind 18 that ( unintelligible.)19 MS. ROBIN ROSIELLO:	Do you 20 understand my point about it creating  more 21 turnover in a building ?22 MS. HOLDER:	Yes. I understand.23 I have a  question.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Yes, Ms.25 Holder .7 
2 MS. HOLDER:	So where you live 3 -- thank you for your  testimony.4 Where you live, what kind  of 5 rents do you see in your  building?6 MS. ROBIN ROSIELLO:	Oh, I7 wish I really knew the exact answer to   that 8 question.9 I know I live in a  two- bedroom 10 that' s $ 1470 right now . There are some that are 11 less, and they ' re are some people paying, you 12 know, $ 2500 for, I think a one - bedroom perhaps .13 MS. HOLDER:	And you said 14 you' ve been there for six years?15 MS. ROBIN ROSIELLO:	About 16 four years .17 MS. HOLDER:	Four years .18 MS. ROBIN ROSIELLO:	So not 19 that long.

2 Councilmember Margaret Chin.3 COUNCILMEMBER MARGARET CHIN :4 Hi ! Good afternoon .5 I' m here for the first time as 6 a Councilmember. I represent Council District # 1 ,7 which is Lower Manhattan from Battery Park City  to 8 Wall Street to Lower East Side , Chinatown, SoHo,9 Tribeca. So I have a lot of  rent- regulated 10 buildings in my district.11 And I just wanted to start  off 12 with over a month ago there was tragic fire   in 13 Chinatown. Two buildings were gutted and had to   be 14 demolished . The residents in those buildings, over 15 two hundred people , were displaced and one  senior 16 was killed .17 Year after year the rent  went 18 up . They have to pay the rent increase . But they 19 weren' t getting the services. The buildings had a20 lot of violations. And these just represent a   lot 21 of examples of all these buildings .22 This year I ' m here with other 23 elected officials to ask the Board to change  the 24 way you do things and look at it in a    different 25 way, to look at doing a rent freeze and not   have 2 
2 an increase this year.3 We are in one of the  worst 4 economic crises that we all see. And being in   the 5 City Council as a new member, we' ve been  dealing 6 with budget cuts. And the cuts are in   social 7 service, we' re talking about library closing,8 firehouse closing. We' re talking about cuts to 9 senior centers , closing senior centers , daycare.10 Working families, low- income 11 families, middle- income families are taking the 12 brunt of this budget cut. And they ' re the ones 13 that have to face this rent  increase.14 So I submitted testimony. I ' m15 not going to read. But I just wanted to ask   you 16 guys to really be compassionate and think  about 17 the over a million renters who are  seniors ,18 immigrant, low - income families , middle - income 19 families, who really deserve a  break.20 Because when the oil price  went 21 up , the rent went up. When the economy is good ,22 the rent went up. The rent never went down   when 23 the economy was good. When the economy was bad ,  it 24 didn' t go down either; right?25 And when the oil price  went 2 
2 down, the rent didn' t go down.3 So this is the year to do   the 4 right thing and show compassion by giving a   rent 5 freeze .6 And recently Westchester did 7 it . If they can do it, New York City, we can   do 8 that. Right?9 So I' m asking you to consider 10 that. So you' re not taking the lead. Westchester 11 did it first. But you can follow and do the   right 12 thing.13 How ' s that? All right.14 So please fiercely consider 15 that for all the New Yorkers and all the   people 16 who build up our neighborhood so that they  can 17 continue to stay there .18 Thank you.19 ( Applause.)20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you,21 Councilmember.22 COUNCILMEMBER MARGARET CHIN :23 Do you have any questions or - -24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	No. Thank 25 you.2

10 representing the tenant association, 640 and  664 11 Washington Avenue in Washington Heights.12 We' ve been experiencing in 13 Washington Heights these landlords , new landlords,14 because we thought we had a bad landlord   before,15 but, believe me, nothing compared to these  new 16 ones that have come in .17 They' re going crazy ,18 renovations, trying to get people out of  the 19 buildings and renovating the apartments  and 20 creating from one- bedroom, two - bedroom ,21 two- bedroom, two- bedroom. I don' t know whether 22 that' s legal.23 I started a meeting in  my 24 building to stop what' s going on and the 25 harassment was awful. And then they have  these 10 
2 managers. And you call these managers and  you 3 never get a return call. Supposedly there is   a4 manager. He comes to the building, quite nasty ,  if 5 you see him, which most of the time he runs   away 6 from people, from the tenants.7 And he stopped the  renovation 8 because we got united in the  building.9 But the heat' s a problem. When 10 this year, when it was cold, I went downstairs   to 11 get the super. The super was walking with  a12 temperature.13 He said , oh , it ' s only fifty 14 degrees. It has to be forty- six.15 And I said: Sabri, it' s16 forty- six outside.17 No, inside it' s fifty degrees.18 And we were in a cold  apartment 19 this winter.20 And they claim they pay a  lot 21 of money for fuel, but , believe me , the heat is  a22 big issue in Washington Heights.23 And these landlords , I don' t24 know if you heard, the Shalons , they' re buying all 25 Washington Heights . I don' t have no problems with 2 
2 them. I don' t have no problems if they want  to 3 turn the building to renovation,  whatever.4 But , you know what? Most of the 5 renovation they do is  unsafe.6 And I don' t think they deserve 7 to have an increase this year - all right?   -8 because we suffered much too much cold  this 9 winter , and we are thinking of the next  winter 10 what' s going to happen .11 And I suggest, highly  suggest 12 to tenants to unite and have a meeting and   not 13 allow these landlords to abuse what' s going on .14 It ' s a big abuse going on, believe me, believe  me.15 I know there' s tenants that 16 abuse too. I know that . I' m very fair about that 17 when it comes to tenant  association.18 But you know what? Their  abuse 19 that goes with the landlord, it' s awful, awful .20 Often you can hear the  boiler 21 or the water pressure, boom, boom, which we   never 22 had that problem. And it' s very scary. One  of 23 these days we' re going to blow up because they  do 24 illegal construction, they do illegal wiring.  I25 don' t know that they hire the proper people to  do 2 
2 work, like the electrician , do they have  a3 license, or a contractor, do they have a   license.4 And most of these renovations 5 are very dangerous .6 So I think they shouldn ' t get 7 an increase this year. Please.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.9 Mr. Languedoc.10 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I' d just like 11 to say I' ve heard many stories similar to  this 12 where buildings that are a combination  of 13 regulated units and unregulated units that  are 14 renting for over $ 2000 , where the owners are 15 trying to do renovations so that they can,  you 16 know, rent out the unregulated units, that  they 17 put the regulated units through a lot  of 18 difficulty with the way they do the renovations  in 19 terms of, you know , dust, improper -- failing  to 20 follow the lead paint abatement laws,  elevator 21 breakdown because of not, you know , using it - -22 MS. OLGA TELLO:	Sheetrock .23 MR. LANGUEDOC:	-- workers 24 constantly using the elevator, things falling  off 25 roofs, things falling out windows,  excessive 2 
2 noise, working late into the night . You know, it' s3 definitely -- I agree with you . It ' s a big problem 4 in the City right  now.5 MS. OLGA TELLO:	One of the 6 things I forgot to mention is very dangerous.   And 7 the walls, when they were renovating  the 8 apartment, they have to remove the sheetrock  from 9 the wall.10 So now that you put the  garbage 11 outside, all the debris, they throw it between  the 12 walls and lands downstairs in the basement .13 ( Unintelligible.)14 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Right.15 So renovations go on  --16 renovations go on and cause situations like  this 17 which makes --18 MS. OLGA TELLO:	And no 19 foreman.20 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Pardon me?21 MS. OLGA TELLO:	And we didn' t22 have a foreman .23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.24 MS. OLGA TELLO:	You have to 25 go after this landlord , please , please . They' re 2 
2 not landlords anymore. They' re gangsters. I' m3 sorry.4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.5 Councilmember Gale Brewer.6 COUNCILMEMBER GALE BREWER:7 Thank you very much.8 I' m going to join my colleagues 9 and request that the Members of the  Rent 10 Guidelines Board freeze increases for  all 11 regulated rentals including Class A hotels , single 12 room occupancies and rooming houses.13 As you know , I represent the 14 West Side of Manhattan from 54 th Street to 96 th 15 Street and we have many, many rent  regulated 16 residents.17 I think you know that there  are 18 about a million, only about a  million 19 rent- stabilized units left in the City , 40 , 000 20 rent controlled.21 And just since, in 2009  alone 22 Manhattan lost 11 , 717 units of stabilized housing 23 and gained only about 2400 probably from some  of 24 the 80 / 20 projects .25 The other issue why I  think 2 
2 rents should not increase is that so  many 3 buildings - and I bring this up every single   year 4 - have both in their four walls individuals  who 5 are rent- regulated , condos and co- ops and those 6 who have come under the high- rent vacancy 7 decontrol. And it' s actually high rent vacancy 8 decontrol that accounts for 73 percent of the   loss 9 of rent- regulated housing in our City.10 And that particular issue, the 11 provision of having that mixed income in  one 12 building, I think is almost enough to be able   to 13 state that another rent increase is not viable  and 14 not necessary.15 I don' t need to talk about the 16 economic crisis. You are extremely aware of it .17 I' m not saying that everybody who becomes  homeless 18 becomes homeless as a result of the  vacancy 19 decontrol, personal use or other issues that  come 20 about when one does not want to leave one' s  home 21 but has to . But certainly we do have a  seven 22 percent increase in homelessness since 2008 , and 23 it ' s up to about 36 , 000 people .24 The only issue, of course,  is 25 the predatory equity investors , something new to 2 
2 some of us . You hear about it in some of  the 3 larger developments where owners intentionally 4 overleverage their buildings and try to get  people 5 out. It' s another way in which the tenants  are 6 feeling the pinch of a major recession and   owners 7 are not doing the right  thing.8 And it' s another reason in my 9 opinion not to increase the  rent.10 I want to talk just for  a11 minute about what' s known as the poor tax.  That 12 was something that we didn ' t know about until 13 fairly recently.14 And I think -- I' m glad it  went 15 to court. I hope we win it . And it ' s16 unconscionable I think in terms of the way   in 17 which the Board has acted in the  past.18 So I just want to make it  clear 19 that I support all those who call for a no   rent 20 increase. I think that there are many  different 21 kinds of housing within so many buildings today.  I22 think that the predatory issue is raising a   very 23 ugly head in my opinion, and many, many people   are 24 being chased out because of it .25 And I urge you strongly not  to 2 
2 increase rents for rent- regulated apartments in 3 the City of New York.4 Thank you.5 ( Applause.)6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you,7 Councilmember.8 Manhattan Borough President 9 Scott Stringer .10 ( Applause.)11 BORO.

LEVINE:	Only if I can 16 congratulate you on your recent engagement . I' m17 sure that the rest of the Board joins me   in 18 wishing you and your fiance the  best.19 BORO. PRES. SCOTT STRINGER:20 Which is why we need rent freezes because  it' s21 getting very expensive .22 ( Laughter.)23 BORO. PRES. SCOTT STRINGER:24 I' m going to submit formal testimony, but I  do 25 want to say that, like many of you , I come  here 2 
2 year after year hoping that we can have  a3 different kind of conversation .4 And , unfortunately, it' s just 5 become so predictable year after year. The  rent 6 increases from the tenant perspective get  bigger 7 and bigger .8 130 , 000 people lost their job 9 in this City. We have a ten percent   unemployment 10 rate. According to statistics that we' ve looked 11 at , most of our landlord community , after 12 expenses, seem to be making a lot of   money 13 throughout the City and Manhattan. They' re making 14 some $ 600 a unit per month . That' s a lot of units 15 and that' s a lot of money.16 So it seems that on the  one 17 hand the landlords are doing well, but our   middle 18 income and working New Yorkers are really on   the 19 edge.20 And your job is to try  to 21 figure all of this out , to try to come up   with 22 something that makes sense .23 Obviously, being a landlord  is 24 about making money and I actually have no   problem 25 with that. People may think I do, but I   really 2 

2	don' t.3
But what I am concerned  about 
4 is that if you keep piling on these increases   in 5 the worst economic times since the 1970 s, you 6 really are not going to be needed as a   Board 7 because there' s going to be no affordable  housing 8 left in this City.9 And what I would hope is  that 10 you look at what Westchester now realizes, that  we 11 are in extraordinary - -12 ( Applause.)13 BORO. PRES. SCOTT STRINGER:14 -- we are in extraordinary difficult times .15 And Westchester County, which 16 actually, I believe, probably has just as many   if 17 not more very wealthy people in that County -  it' s18 not a poor county, many of those areas are   very 19 affluent - they recognize that they' ve got to  stem 20 the tide.21 So if we could get a  rent 22 freeze this year, it would do two  things.23 One , it would catch a break for 24 people who are really on the edge. It   would 25 probably mean that more people could stay in  their 4 
2 apartments . It probably means that there are some 3 families that are going to be able to help   make 4 things happen for their loved ones . And it  would 5 also, I think, change the tone as it relates   to 6 the RGB. The conversation would change next  year 7 because people in this City, the one  million 8 people in rent - stabilized apartments would realize 9 that you listen to them in very difficult  times.10 So I respectfully ask all  of 11 you to think about , to do something you' ve never 12 done before, to look at the evidence and the   data 13 that shows this disparity between landlord  profit 14 and tenant agony, and come up with something  that 15 would truly be extraordinary.16 I would appreciate it on  behalf 17 of the 1 . 6 million people who live in our  borough,18 but also as somebody who has seen good times   in 19 the City and bad times . As a life- long New Yorker,20 I know the difference. We are in very, very   bad 21times and you can help a lot of people .22Thank you very much .23( Applause.)24CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.25Monroe Litman.

And I even made a special effort -  I' m11 glad to see that Mr. Markus is no longer   here.12 ( Applause.)13 MR.

I don' t know your abilities yet, but  in 18 the forthcoming days - - I think I will go on   the 19 comedy routine .20 In the coming days you will ,21 unless your associates have told you about  the 22 coming days, you may be in for an experience   that 23 even I had never experienced until  recently.24 Mr. Markus even had to go  out 25 for supper when it got to be eight o' clock or  so.7 
2 And when he came back, the chaotic - well,   I3 shouldn' t use that word because the tenants were 4 up in arms parading around with their signs,  with 5 their noisemakers and everything, and  nothing 6 could be heard . The desk here had to be moved  up 7 so you could tell us the bad  news.8 Which Th e Ne w Yor k Times had a9 first page , front page statement on, and they 10 quoted Adriene Holder one thing, and they  failed 11 to quote her on the fact that she claimed - I    was 12 sitting over there at about 9 : 10 in the evening 13 when they came back - that she believed that   this 14 group was, this Rent Board was a fraud . That  was 15 her first sentence . Her second sentence was that 16 Mayor Bloomberg, even though these were  appointees 17 of his - naturally he couldn' t investigate  them 18 personally - they should be investigated. And  the 19 third one was to open the books so that the   people 20 would know whether the landlords really needed  the 21 increases that they were asking  for.22 The point is I spoke  three 23 times on WBAI, I' m a fifty - year member , three 24 times. The last time Adriene Holder was there.  I25 mentioned these things that I heard her  say.2 
2 She said: Well, I didn' t really 3 say exactly that. But she never told us what   she 4 exactly said.5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Mr. Litman,6 I will ask you to wrap  up.7 MR. MONROE LITMAN:	I am 8 telling you what she exactly  said.9 Now you are missing out  --10 because it ' s time for me to go ; right?11 You are missing out on a lot  of 12 beauty that I could have  said.13 But the thing is my heroes  are 14 Michael Moore, Ralph Nadar and Abraham Lincoln ,15 who spoke from this platform, and my father  also 16 did.17 And I speak for the people.  I18 wish - - I didn ' t know that these gentlemen who 19 came would ask for zero. I ' m astounded . It ' s so 20 beautiful to know that things may be  changing 21 because I was going to tell you again, if   there 22 was a recording you would hear , that I brought  up 23 Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol and I   talked 24 about Scrooge and how he did  change.25 And so I am asking you  --2

I  am 25 a small property owner , Brooklyn, Sunset Park,2 

2	six- unit.3
The reason that I' m here is I' m
4 not asking for a big increase, but I need   an 5 increase. Every year the tenants said  freeze 6 increase. But how come nobody say let' s freeze  the 7 water, let ' s freeze the insurance, let ' s freeze 8 the taxes. Okay?9 I sold my home to pay the  water 10 bill - okay? - because the water bill usually   is 11 nineteen percent if you don' t pay on time.  Okay?12 So I' m begging you that I  need 13 an increase. Okay?14 I know tenants, they  sublease 15 the apartment. Okay? So they have three rooms,  two 16 bedrooms. They lease it and then they get  paid 17 more than what they pay the landlord. And   believe 18 me , I know who they are. Okay?19 You take the tenant to  court 20 because of nonpayment. They live in the  apartment 21 for six, nine months, and because they have  a22 child, the judge is not going to give you   a23 warrant until nine months. So you lose all   that 24 money and it' s not coming back . Okay?25 The landlord, small property 4 
2 owner like me, we have to take money from   credit 3 card, anywhere you can get  from.4 So I' m begging you for a  rent 5 increase.6 Thank you very much .7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.8 Mr. Scheinberg.9 MR. SCHEINBERG:	How many units 10 do you have?11 MS. MARILYN PERCY:	Six units,12 sir.13 MR. SCHEINBERG:	And what 14 percent increase would you want?15 MS. MARILYN PERCY:	Well,16 right now we got 11 percent for water. I' m  not 17 asking for that much. At least 5 .18 MR. SCHEINBERG:	Thank you.19 MS. MARILYN PERCY:	Thank you 20 very much.21 Anybody else?22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.23 Arnold Elman,24 Who will be followed by 25 Reginald Johnson;2 
2 And then Johnnie Barnes .3 MR. ARNOLD ELMAN:	Thank you.4 My name is Arnold Elman . I5 apologize. I was supposed to be here earlier and   I6 just misjudged the time.7 I have lived in New York  City 8 all my life. I have lived at the same address   for 9 the last thirty- four years .10 I am not eligible for SCRIE ,11 but I am a proud member of the Park West   Village 12 Tenants Association.13 When I first moved there  with 14 my wife, it was not the most desirable  of 15 locations. Crime was rampant. My wife was  even 16 attacked at knifepoint in the elevator . Yet  we 17 stuck it out.18 But now things are  much 19 different. The neighborhood is tonier. A whole  new 20 slew of upscale stores opened on Columbus  Avenue 21 with more expected to  follow.22 I expect that the people  who 23 have rent -- who can pay rent of $ 2000 or more   are 24 probably living in the building that just  opened 25 up at 808 Columbus .2 
2 I say all this because when  it 3 was prudent for landlords to invite us in we   were 4 welcomed. Now that the environment has changed ,  I5 am sure, were it not for the laws  protecting 6 tenants, they would be looking to kick us   out,7 regardless of the fact that we have been  steady 8 and loyal tenants for all these  years.9 I am retired now, but I live  on 10 a fixed income . It will be enough for me to   manage 11 as long as rents are affordable. But rents  are 12 skyrocketing, and even when costs for  landlords 13 have been reduced, the landlords, some  landlords 14 still crave more. It is never  enough.15 I understand that this is  their 16 living and that they are entitled to a   reasonable 17 profit despite the debate over what the  term 18 reasonable means.19 Obviously to some it means  take 20 whatever you can regardless of who you harm in   the 21 process.22 But in the end we all pay  a23 price. As rents soar and thousands  of 24 rent- stabilized apartments become decontrolled , we 25 will have no place to go and no protection   from 2 
2 unscrupulous landlords .3 Although I don' t have 4 statistics to back me up, I am sure that   the 5 average policeman or fireman at the 24 th  precinct 6 could not afford the rents of 808 Columbus ,  the 7 new rental development , much less live in  them 8 considering their small size.9 To add insult to injury , in the 10 interest of aiding landlords who claim  their 11 income is being reduced because their long - term 12 residents, and generally older tenants , are not 13 paying as much as new tenants, long- term tenants 14 are being penalized rather than rewarded for  being 15 steadfast customers.16 This completely ignores the 17 fact that these same landlords received  increases 18 over periods when they were not sustaining a   loss 19 and who had steady tenants when the market  was 20 unstable.21 Now they are asking the  tenants 22 to make up and effectively subsidize their  losses.23 Let me remind you  that 24 landlords and realtors are businessmen who  take 25 the risk of losing business if the market  turns 2 
2 downward, yet they want their steady clients  to 3 make up their lose if they lose money and to   be 4 assured of higher prices for making  money.5 In other words, they want to  be 6 covered both ways so they can have their cake   and 7 eat it too .8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Mr. Elman, I9 have to ask you to wrap up .10 MR. ARNOLD ELMAN:	I' m just --11 I' m coming .12 For me the purpose and  outcome 13 of this is clear. As the landlords and   realtors 14 rid themselves of tenants who stay longer,  they 15 can charge higher rents for especially new  and 16 less experienced tenants who are not familiar  with 17 the laws that protect them or have no   investment 18 in staying here.19 As the base of long - term 20 tenants is penalized, squeezed and  destabilized,21 landlords could charge what they want and  whatever 22 the market will bear regardless the cost to  the 23 community that surrounds it.24 Landlords will have carte 25 blanche to squeeze the middle class and the  poor 2 
2 so only the rich people can afford the rents  - -3 who can afford these rents can live  here.4 The long- term residents , the 5 middle class and poor residents of the City  who 6 care about their neighbors and make this City  a7 viable , multi- cultural and affordable place to 8 live will gradually be pushed  out.9 For all these reasons I  urge 10 the Board not to pass any further increases and   to 11 repeal the length of residency add - ons that are 12 currently being pursued.13 Please vote no for any  further 14 increases or fees for long - term rental leases.15 Thank you.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you,17 Mr . Elman.18 ( Applause.)19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	I would like 20 to announce to the hall, registration for  speakers 21 will close at 6 : 00 o' clock .22 We also will be taking a  break 23 at 6 : 00 o' clock.

Reginald Johnson.MR. REGINALD JOHNSON:	Good I' m a landlord --CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	You need to 
7 get a little closer to the mike. I ' m sorry .8 MR. REGINALD JOHNSON:	I' m a9 landlord in Brooklyn. I have a four- family  house 10 and I have a rent- stabilized building that ' s11 six- family .12 My four - family building , I13 don' t have any problems. I got good tenants,  I14 don' t even go up on the rent. They take care  of 15 things .16 But in my six- family building,17 because of rent registration, because of  rent 18 laws, I' ve got bad tenants that don' t pay rent . I19 have a tenant that hasn' t paid rent in  seven 20 months . They always pay the rent late.21 Not only that, there' s drugs 22 going on in my building in this apartment.  I' ve 23 been to court several times with them.  They 24 brought in cats. They smelled up the building.  The 25 Health Department -- I had to beg the   Health 7 
2 Department to come in.3 And it' s just hard being a4 landlord with a six- family house because 5 everything goes up , and everything in my  building 6 is in good shape.7 Last year the boiler went  out 8 in the building and I had to put a new boiler   in.9 The permit was $ 2500 , just for the permit because 10 of the rent stabilization, because of big  building 11 laws. And so I had to go into my savings to    get 12 the rest of the money to pay for the   building.13 Now , I' m not -- I' m very 14 sympathetic to people who can' t pay the rent. I' m15 retired from the Department of Homeless Service.  I16 put in twenty years with the Department  of 17 Homeless Service as a social worker, an  outreach 18 worker . I' ve picked up homeless people off the 19 streets in my arms from the snow. I helped place   a20 lot of people in New York in  placements.21 So I' m sympathetic to people 22 who can' t pay the rents. But I ' m having a very 23 difficult time trying to maintain this  stabilized 24 building.25 Thank you very much .2

CRUZ:	Sixteen years.13 MR. REGINALD JOHNSON:	Yes .14 MS. CRUZ:	And how much of  a15 rent increase would you think would enable you  to 16 sustain your property?17 MR.

JOHNNIE BARNES:	Good 24 evening.25 My name is Johnnie Barnes and  I7 
2 currently reside at an SRO at 462 West  145 th 3 Street .4 Now I' ve lived there for 5 thirty - nine going into forty years . When I moved 6 into the building, I was paying $ 12 a week and  I7 currently pay $ 90 a week. That ain ' t that much ,8 but it ' s a lot to me.9 The bathrooms in the  hallways 10 are also used by the tenants. And that ' s no 11 problem. They' re not the problem. The landlord is.12 There' s nine units and my 13 landlord, they stay there some time, but they  have 14 -- they' re upscale people and they make money 15 doing other things and they live elsewhere .16 They' re small SRO owners. And 17 there are about two units that are  being 18 warehoused and have been vacant for  about 19 seven/ eight years.20 In 2006 , the landlord tried to 21 raise my rent to $ 93 a week. However, the  year 22 before that, they tried to raise it, you  know,23 like $ 5 . But still it was a lot to  me.24 But the legal - - the Rent 25 Guidelines Board increase was for two percent  and 2 
2 it should have been raised only to $ 91 . 80 a week.3 And when the landlord was 4 informed of this with the help of the West   Side 5 SRO Law Project, they decided not to even take   the 6 increase at the moment because the increase  meant 7 nothing to them and they figured they wouldn' t8 even just bother with it because they' re just 9 waiting until they can come up with some kind   of 10 trick to get me out  legally.11 And no increase at all would  be 12 enough for my landlord . They just want me out.  My 13 landlord has told me before in the past since   that 14 gentrification money got up in their  nostrils,15 that they want me out of that room because   they 16 knew they could get much more money if I  wasn' t17 there.18 I used to be like family  when 19 they needed me to help keep the place in order   for 20 some of their lesser, more unsavory tenants  that 21 they had rented to in the past .22 Now I also have  problems 23 getting repairs. Fifteen years my door was  broken.24 I mean they would fix it, but they didn' t  know 25 how. It would be off in two months  again.2 
 2 And , finally, in 2005 , from 3 1979 , SRO made them fix it .4 They just want me out so  that 5 they can just -- they' re trying to harass me  out 6 so they can make a lot more money by   renovating 7 the building, going up like ten times the rent ,  or 8 just out and out selling the  building.9 They want me and all the  other 10 tenants out. I ' ve been there twice as long , got 11 the biggest room, and they have told me this.   But 12 the other tenants they ' ll go. Once something' s13 going, it' s like out of there.14 So basically the SROs - - I  mean 15 no kind of rent at all would make my   landlord 16 happy. They just want me out so that they can   get 17 this money .18 Any rent raise at all would  be 19 a problem to me because I' m on a fixed ,  fixed 20 income . I have a school loan that' s bogus but 21 that' s another story. But my income is fixed  at 22 $ 750 a month and it' s going to stay there for  the 23 next like ten years until I get that $ 7 , 000 or 24	$ 8 , 000 pay .25	CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Mr. Barnes,
2 I' m going to have to ask you to wrap  up.3 MR. JOHNNIE BARNES:	Okay.4 I really can' t stand nothing.5 My rent is $ 93 a month . That' s more than fifty 6 percent of my income. And I need to stay in   my 7 home and I can ' t afford any increase nor to move.8 Please pass a zero increase .9 Thank you 10 ( Applause.)11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you,12 sir.13 MS.

I' m from  RENA,25 Riverside/ Edgecombe Neighborhood Association in 2 

2	Washington Heights .3
Maybe I should just start  by 
4 reminding the Members of the Rent Guidelines  Board 5 that the purpose of this Board is to   maintain 6 affordable rents for the people of the City of   New 7 York.8 The purpose of this Board  is 9 not to raise rents automatically. However, as  we 10 have seen over the years, that is exactly what   the 11 Board has been doing.12 Now , we ' ve all lived through 13 this time when the two Presidents, both  President 14 Bush and President Obama, have decided that it   was 15 necessary, because of the emergency that  our 16 country was in , to bail out the banks. That  was 17 necessary.18 It was necessary to  spend 19 trillions of dollars of U. S. taxpayers ' money to 20 do what? To bail out the banks . Because  why?21 They' re too big to fail.22 So what happens with  the 23 tenants in New York City I don ' t have to prove  to 24 you because you all know, you all read the   papers 25 I assume, the papers every single day that   are 4 
2 telling you what the average income - I don' t  have 3 to repeat that , it ' s been repeated a million times 4 - what the unemployment rate is - it' s  been 5 repeated a million times.6 So when will the time come  when 7 it ' s time to help the little people who are too 8 little to fail but they' re failing all the  time,9 economically they' re failing.10 So isn' t it the burden and the 11 responsibility and the duty of you - and I ' m12 appealing to the public members here - you who   are 13 supposed to represent the public? The  landlords,14 of course, we know what they' re going to say.  The 15 tenants reps, of course, they represent us .16 But you , the public members ,17 it ' s your responsibility to represent the public.18 The majority of people in New York City  are 19 suffering.20 Now , when is it going to be 21 time? We are supposed to spread the pain,  right?22 That' s what all of our officials and our  elected 23 leaders tell us.24 The pain is not of  the 25 landlords. I think you all know that very,   very 2 
2 well. Every single one of you knows that. It' s  not 3 the landlords who are hurting. It' s the  tenants 4 who are hurting, in spite of what small  landlords 5 get up and they say that their tenants  aren' t6 paying them. You know that that' s just a lot  of 7 malarkey because the facts prove it themselves .8 So anybody with a brain  in 9 their head will read the papers. You don' t  even 10 need to be a rocket scientist to know  this .11 Please, do the right thing  and 12 vote for a zero percent rent increase. That' s  the 13 only just thing you can do .14 Thank you.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.17 Maxine Zeifman.18 Who will be followed by  Lauren 19 Mariotti;20 Who will be followed by  Judith 21 Frank.22 MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	Yeah!23 I am representing the  middle 24 class, the middle class.25 And I' ve been speaking to 2 
2 friends here who find this an  extremely 3 frustrating experience because the Nassau  Board 4 and the Westchester Board not only this year  but 5 other years has had one and two percent  increases 6 and two and three percent increases while you' ve 7 had six and eight.8 And there had been a time  when 9 this Board was appointed by Dinkins who  those 10 public appointees were really public  appointees.11 They won' t go along Sachs the way you are  or 12 Barker ' s the way you are. They were public .13 I remember a wonderful  man,14 even recently who was only an architect. He was   in 15 favor of the tenants. He was just gone the   next 16 year. I don' t think he could stand  it.17 Now , it ' s very, very 18 frustrating because it ' s like there' s a foregone 19 conclusion here. It' s all a done deal. It' s20 settled before you ever get up .21 You know, the poor  landlords 22 can have hardship increases. Everybody thinks  they 23 should be increased. The majority of the people  in 24 the City live in middle- income housing . I live in 25 a middle- income building. It had sixty - five --2 
2 sixty- seven rent- regulated apartments. It' s got 3 seven left .4 The landlords are making a5 terrific amount of money.6 I know Adriene has asked  people 7 who are in SoHo and say, you know, they' ve got  a8 couple of people that are, you know, low rent.   And 9 then she says how many are owners. And  they' re 10 eighty percent owners.11 You know, there is very  little 12 left, first of all , because the Republicans voted 13 in in 1993 and ' 97 vacancy decontrol and  have 14 taken 300 , 000 apartments.15 If this were not profitable ,16 why would the tenants, who have been  fighting 17 since 1972 to bring back - - to repeal the  Erstadt 18 Law and bring back rent regulation to the  City 19 Council, why have we failed? Because real  estate 20 to New York is like oil is to Texas. It' s a   great 21 big profitable private interest. Who the hell  are 22 we fooling ? It ' s disingenuous this talk about 23 landlord hardship.24 You know, they' re making sixty 25 cents, six zero, on their operating costs.  You 2 
2 know who are we fooling? Why are they  struggling 3 to keep it since 1972 ? Why can ' t the City Council 4 get it back?5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Ms. Zeifman,6 I' m going to ask you to please wrap up .7 MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	Because 8 it ' s so profitable .9 No, my building -- you know ,  I10 brought somebody from Channel 7 a couple of   years 11 ago and she photographed me because I kept   saying 12 I' m sick of hearing that you can get a two - bedroom 13 apartment for $ 400 a month .14 Because I have a two- bedroom 15 apartment. I had a son and a daughter and I    needed 16 two bedrooms. 1972 , it was $ 700 ; now it' s $ 2412 .17 It is not $ 400 for a two- bedroom apartment .18 So they are doing fine  and 19 they' ve got all of them, there ' s sixty - seven 20 except seven. You know , they' re all warehoused .21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Please wrap 22 up .23 MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	So , you 24 know, it' s very frustrating to have this Board 25 appointed by Bloomberg because he doesn' t2 
2 represent -- the public appointees are not  public.3 It is very frustrating for us to have to have   you 4 every year do what you do when Westchester  doesn' t5 need it, Dinkins' Board didn' t need it . And 6 Nassau ' s Board doesn' t need it because they' re 7 being fair and decent.8 So it is really , really hard 9 because that man who was talking about  the 10 creative people in the City, that' s what makes  the 11 City great .12 And I know a whole bunch  of 13 medical researchers, M . D., Ph. D. s, I' ve said this 14 every year , they come to Columbia, they come  to 15 Rockefeller Center , they make $ 32 , 000 a year.16 You know, this City needs  to 17 support the greatness in the  City.18 And when you listen to  Bill 19 Moyers who stopped speaking to us - I' m so sorry  -20 because every Friday night I could have that  man 21 with a moral talk - he said our country has   become 22 a plutocracy. It' s not a democracy . It ' s owned by 23 these special interests, these special  interests.24 And , you know, I know even the 25 Democratic Senators that are supposed to  be 2 
2 representing us in Albany, according to  Newsweek 3 last year, Jeffrey Klein took two hundred  and 4 forty from the real estate lobby, the others  were 5 taking it too. You know, they' re buying off --  the 6 health insurance companies and the  pharmaceutical 7 companies buy the elections.8 You know, this country isn' t9 that. This auditorium wasn ' t this with Lincoln .10 This institution gives free, free tuition  to 11 gifted young architects.12 There are values in this 13 country besides special interests and  money.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Ms. Zeifman,15 thank you.16 ( Applause.)17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Lauren 18 Mariotti?19 ( No response.)20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Judith 21 Frank.22 MS. JUDITH FRANK:	Hi!23 My name is Judith Frank . I' ve 24 lived in New York all my life. I' ve lived  in 25 apartments all my life .2 
2 I am here to represent  those 3 tenants who live in apartments where we have  to 4 pay for our own heat. Every year I come here,   the 5 last few years , representing us because the 6 landlords seem to get increases every year in   part 7 based on their increased heating costs where  we 8 tenants have to pay for our own heat and we   pay 9 hundreds of dollars every month for our gas  bills.10 Every year the only difference 11 between those who pay for heat and those who  don' t12 is a measly . 5 percent . Please increase it	this 13 year or else follow the precedent of  Westchester 14 and San Francisco and have a rent  freeze.15 A few years ago I spoke  to 16 Marvin Markus about the fact that landlords  never 17 put it into their property when they get  their 18 increases. I' ve seen it every year . My landlord 19 never puts any improvements.20 And I notice that this year  the 21 deteriorating buildings are purposely made  that 22 way so the landlords, as has been publicized,  they 23 have their buildings deteriorate so much that  they 24 have to tear them down and , therefore,  their 25 property is more valuable.2 
2 And who has to pay for this  but 3 the tenants, the people in New York, because  they 4 gain by having this incredible bonanza that  comes 5 their way by their own intentional neglect  of 6 buildings.7 So I' m pleased to ask for a8 rent increase -- a rent freeze and no   increases.9 Thank you.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you 11 You got to be careful there !12 MS. JUDITH FRANK:	Yes . I' m13 sorry. I' m nervous . But, yes.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you 15 for coming .16 Delsenia Parker .17 MS. DELSENIA GLOVER :	Glover.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Glover. I' m19 sorry.20 MS. DELSENIA GLOVER :	Good 21 evening!22 My name is Delsenia Glover.  I23 am President of the Lenox Terrace Association  of 24 Concerned Tenants.25 It is a six high- rise 2 
2 development in Harlem. I have no notes .3 I guess all I really want  to 4 say is that I' m tired of doing this. Every year  we 5 come here, the tenants , and ask for decency.  And 6 every year you ignore us.7 I feel like Rosa Parks. I' m8 sick and tired of being sick and tired .9 So what is right for  the 10 tenants, do what is right for the City .11 I saw you outside, Mr.  Kimmel,12 and I said is a rent freeze  possible.13 You said anything is  possible.14 Do what is possible .15 Thank you.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.17 Constantine Harrison.18 ( No response.)19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Mario 20 Mazzoni.21 Who will be followed by  Edmond 22 Black;23 Emily Pinkowitz ;24 Christine Reed; and 25 Gina Pope.2 
2 MR. MARIO MAZZONI:	My name is 3 Mario Mazzoni. I' m an organizer for the 4 Metropolitan Council on Housing, New York City ' s5 oldest tenants union.6 And I want to spend the  three 7 minutes that I have clarifying what I think   are 8 myths and misunderstandings about the RGB  from 9 people who might be  here.10 Rent stabilization is an 11 anti- profiteering measure based on imbalance 12 market conditions that favor landlords . And if 13 this were not the case , right now our City  is 14 experiencing recession , and the rents would be 15 going down .16 But they' re not in this City 17 very much because we are in a perpetual   housing 18 crisis . The role of rent stabilization is  to 19 regulate a segment of the housing market to keep   a20 stock of reasonably priced apartments and  to 21 stabilize neighborhoods and the housing market .22 I think that some of  the 23 Members of this Board see their job as   entirely 24 different. I think that some believe that  their 25 job is to guarantee landlords of buildings  a2 
2 minimum profit no matter the economic  conditions 3 or the tenants ' ability to pay .4 One of the landlord 5 representatives at the preliminary vote said  this 6 year that a rent- stabilized apartment is not a7 birthright . I would reply that a consistently  high 8 profit margin for a real estate investment is   not 9 a birthright.10 It seems like the only  data 11 that many of the Public Members of this Board   are 12 interested in is the rise and the cost of   building 13 maintenance. The baseline of a net  operating 14 income that now averages about 39 percent,  which 15 has risen in recent years, is never questioned .16 They don' t account for the 17 ever- increasing number of deregulated apartments 18 which are not reported what those incomes are.   Nor 19 do they question the landlords coming up who  talk 20 about the improvements that they make which  are 21 all passed along to tenants through MCIs in  the 22 individual apartment improvements.23 It seems like that many  Members 24 of this Board obsessively look at that  only.25 And , finally, I really feel 2 
2 like some of the Public Members feel that  their 3 job is to treat landlords as a protected class   in 4 this economy. They ' re a special category of 5 investors whose rate of return on  their 6 investments is supposed to be guaranteed by  your 7 agency and that the Rent Guidelines Board acts  as 8 an agency to protect their ability to make   profit 9 that stays about the same no matter what  the 10 economy is , no matter that tenants are  suffering 11 and ignoring every other factor in our economy .12 I think the -- we' ve heard much 13 about the Westchester Rent Board. And I   was 14 thinking what' s the difference between Westchester 15 and New York. It certainly can ' t be that they' re 16 suffering more . The average income in Westchester 17 is far higher than in New York City as a   whole .18 I guess the difference is  is 19 that the members of their rent board  actually 20 understand what the rent stabilization system  is 21 for and what their job in it  is.22 So I' m shocked that I have 23 thirty seconds left. I ' ll use that last thirty 24 seconds to say who I  am.25 I' m thirty- one years old. I2 
2 came to New York City when I was eighteen. I    have 3 never been able to afford from when I   graduated 4 college a rent - stabilized apartment. And so I have 5 thirteen years on the room rental market  waiting 6 for my income to catch up with the rents and   it 7 hasn' t yet done that.8 If I didn' t love New York as 9 much as I did, it would have driven me out a    long 10 time ago.11 And so what I' m imploring the 12 Members of this Board is to actually think  about 13 what you are here for.14 Thank you 15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.16 ( Applause.)17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Edmond 18 Black.19 MR. EDMOND BLACK:	Okay. Good 20 evening.21 My name is Edmond Black . I' m an 22 SRO resident of 530 West 149 th Street.23 I' m here today to encourage the 24 Board to vote for a zero rent  increase .25 My landlord does not deserve  a2 
2 rent increase because -- sorry  --3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	That ' s okay.4 MR. EDMOND BLACK:	My landlord 5 does not deserve a rent increase. She has   reduced 6 services in my building while continuing to  charge 7 me the same rent.8 When she bought the  building,9 she proceeded to remove all the pipes  and 10 radiators and installed a central heating  system.11 Okay.12 Each room has a heating  unit 13 with a remote control. She took the  remote 14 controls a month later claiming the system  needed 15 cleaning, which is false because it' s a brand  new 16 system .17 Okay. All right .18 And she then -- she called  me 19 at work claiming that she needed to enter my   room 20 to replace my gas stove with an electric  stove .21 Instead she installed a  --22 instead she installed a hot plate with a   toaster 23 oven and in place of my  stove.24 I' m sorry.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	That ' s okay.2 

2	Take your time .34
MR. EDMOND BLACK:	Okay.Additionally, she rewired the 
5 electric box so that out of four outlets in   my 6 room only two of them work  today.7 And she also locked up  the 8 common bathroom outside of my room which me and   my 9 neighbor shares and told us we had to use   the 10 bathroom upstairs when the City inspector told  her 11 to repair our bathroom .12 My neighbor , she' s sixty- four 13 years old, and it' s difficult for her to  go 14 upstairs to use the bathroom even like in   the 15 middle of the night.16 We' ve also sometimes been 17 unable to gain access to the bathroom because  of 18 it being occupied. And we sometimes have to   use 19 our room.20 This reduction of services and 21 behavior on my landlord' s part is unfair  and 22 unacceptable. Okay .23 For this reason my  landlord 24 should not -- does not deserve a rent  increase .25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you,5

Are you aware that at  our 
4 preliminary vote what was voted on by the   Board 5 was a zero increase for  SRO?6 MR. EDMOND BLACK:	Yes .

CHRISTINE REED:	Hi!22 Thank you for letting me  speak.23 I' m just going to throw out a24 bunch of stuff that I think it ' s a good idea to  be 25 aware of.4 
2 People have brought up  the 3 issue with BP. BP is in trouble, the whole   country 4 is in trouble because they tried to cut   corners.5 They wouldn' t pay for $ 500 , 000 backup safety 6 mechanisms and that' s the reason why we have  a7 multi- trillion dollar mess and a ruined coast.8 I watched closely a lot  of 9 things that are going on in real estate in   the 10 City. I see there is a lot of development   being 11 proposed in Williamsburg and elsewhere . They' re 12 talking about twenty percent affordable going  to 13 people with incomes of $ 68 , 000 to $ 100 , 000 .14 I don' t know anybody that has 15 an income of $ 68 , 000 to $ 100 , 000 , but there' s a16 lot of people whose incomes are $ 20 , 000 , $ 30 , 000 17 and $ 40 , 000 if they' re lucky enough to have a job.18 People are working in  stores,19 people are working in bars , they' re working in 20 K- Mart . They don' t have -- recently they' ve made 21 major cuts . The Governor was asking for cuts  to 22 health care, twenty firehouses .23 I' m a health care worker. I ' m a24 registered nurse, thirty years experience. I can' t25 get a job. I just got my license renewed. I    work 2 
2 in health care quality management. With the  new 3 laws coming in , the new health care, they' re 4 looking for quality as opposed to quantity ,  I5 should be in gravy .6 But they closed St. Vincent ' s,7 they closed St . John' s in Queens. They ' re slating 8 approximately 2 , 400 health care workers to be laid 9 off.10 They' re rats living in the 11 subway . They take out the token booth clerks,  they 12 put them back.13 New York is in trouble. We' re 14 in a bubble. They were talking about these   luxury 15 apartments that are being built and there' s  nobody 16 now to buy them because the euro' s going  down.17 They used to get people ,18 wealthy people I guess from France or Europe  or 19 wherever, getting pied - a- terres in New York.20 That' s not happening anymore.21 You have banks on every  corner.22 They pay I heard $ 30 , 000 a month rent. What does 23 that do to the price of  bread?24 If you want to bring back  New 25 York, you have to lower the rents generally,  not 2 
2 just rent stabilized, all rents. It will  bring 3 creative people in here, businesses will open,  New 4 York will boom .5 That' s all I have to say. And 6 thank you very much for listening to  me.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.8 Gina Pope.9 Oh, I' m sorry. I didn' t see 10 you.11 MS. GINA POPA:	Hi !12 My name is actually Gina  Popa 13 and I had not planned to speak at this meeting .   I14 had not even planned to be here. I was supposed   to 15 attend the 5 : 00 rally and the No. 6 train had 16 major problems holding us in the station and   then 17 dumping us out at 14 th Street.18 So I missed the rally,  I19 wandered in, and now I feel I have to   speak.20 I feel very much for all  the 21 people who had given their various problems.  But 22 they' ve spoken about them. And while they' re of 23 major interest , I want to speak about my  situation 24 which is that I live in a Mitchell - Lama 25 repurchased building. I' ve been there since when 2 
2 it was put up in about ' 62 or ' 63 .3 My landlord , the new landlord,4 has now been applying tons of MCIs to raise   the 5 rent. And this month we' re getting a $ 50 increase,6 but it goes retroactively, so we actually owe   many 7 hundreds of dollars.8 I understand that landlords 9 have expenses. But with all the corruption  in 10 politics that we' ve seen, with all the corruption 11 in all of the construction companies and  every 12 single company , I think that if landlords  really 13 were interested in maintaining their  properties 14 with the best value, they should refuse to  work 15 with corrupt people.16 We have corrupt people in  every 17 single industry that the landlords work with.  That 18 would certainly lower your expenses and  enable 19 them to pass that on.20 Also regarding the MCIs , one of 21 the things that our landlord did was to install   a22 fence around this 17 parked cars outer --  you' ll 23 have to excuse me, I have dentures , I  cannot 24 afford to get new dentures , Medicare doesn ' t cover 25 teeth and my dentures are twenty years old   and 2 
2 right now they ' re falling out. And I will have to 3 live with them for the rest of my life . So   please 4 excuse me if I  slur.5 But this fenced area we  really 6 didn' t need. We had a fence around  it.7 They also created a  staircase 8 going down to the basement , which is along  the 9 wall and a closed door constantly locked.  We 10 didn' t need it . It was disallowed.11 They sent us notices with 12 petitions to allow it. We don' t want to allow  it.13 That was part of a  security 14 system with cameras that were installed in  our 15 building. So far we have absolutely not  one 16 monitor and no one monitoring. So why are   we 17 paying for these cameras that were installed?  We 18 have no security.19 Our front door lock keeps 20 breaking. So there ' s that.21 I want to be brief. I just  want 22 to say that those folks who are here  representing 23 the public , I am disgusted that Bloomberg  managed 24 to get himself a third term. I think he has   done 25 New York, basically New Yorkers like me, born  on 2 
2 East 116 th Street, an enormous disservice. He 3 doesn' t know what New Yorkers are. He' s destroying 4 us . He ' s destroying our City.5 I know that talking about  no 6 rent increase probably sounds bizarre to you.  But 7 I got no increase in my Social Security. When   my 8 husband died, I didn' t get any Security for  him.9 He lost it . But my rent keeps going up .10 Please help us.11 Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you,13 Ms . Popa.14 We have finished the list  of 15 registered speakers.16 If there is anyone in the  room 17 who would still like to speak, we will take   some 18 time.19 Please -- the gentleman in  the 20 blue shirt . If you would come up.21 Please state your name.22 MR. JUAN ALONZO :	Thank you 23 for giving me this time to  talk.24 I came late . I work for  the 25 Legal Aid Society' s Criminal Appeals Bureau. I  was 2 

2	stuck in Queens.34	give us your name?56
CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Could you MR. JUAN ALONZO :	I' m sorry.My name is Juan , J- u- a- n, last 
7 name Alonzo, A - l- o - n- z - o. I work for a8 not- for- profit known as the Legal Aid Society' s9 Criminal Appeals Bureau.10 I was stuck on the Queens and  I11 didn' t meet your deadline. So, again, I  appreciate 12 the time to speak.13 Very briefly.14 I' m also an Iraqi freedom 15 veteran and I am appointed to Community Board  # 12 16 up in Washington Heights.17 Now , my grandma has been living 18 there since 1947 in a rent controlled  apartment.19 And now due to Major Capital Improvements  they 20 want to change her from rent control to  rent 21 stabilization, which is illegal, but nobody  is 22 really fighting for us except for maybe Legal  Aid 23 and a couple of other not- for- profit legal 24 services.25 And I' m sure Adriene Holder 7 
2 could attest to this that we are turning  away 3 seven out of every eight clients that come to   our 4 doors because --5 MS. HOLDER:	Eight out of every 6 nine now.7 MR. JUAN ALONZO :	-- even 8 Legal Aid is not getting  funded.9 MS. HOLDER:	Eight out of every 10 nine now.11 MR. JUAN ALONZO :	Whatever the 12 number is. It could be larger than  that.13 We are turning clients  away 14 because there' s no funding .15 People keep coming to  these 16 meetings and they feel like they are coming to   the 17 MTA Board because nobody seems to listen to  the 18 recommendations of the general  public.19 You guys keep increasing,20 increasing , increasing , and the landlords are 21 making profits and they' re trying to find ways  to 22 do tax abatements and tax loopholes and they   make 23 profit , and the poor disabled people are 24 suffering, New Yorkers are  suffering.25 We need to find some type  of 2 
2 common ground where if you guys are going  to 3 increase, which I hope you have zero increases ,4 it ' s really, really low or zero, because people 5 need their salaries to catch  up.6 I' ve been working without a7 contract for two years because we' re waiting for 8 the State to pass their budget and then  Bloomberg 9 to pass his. I might not get a pay   increase.10 So I don' t want to end  up 11 having to panhandle on the street or come to   my 12 same agency who has a homeless rights project  and 13 say not only am I an employee, but I' m also  a14 client . I think it would be a sad day in Legal   Aid 15 Society.16 I don' t have a rent controlled 17 or rent stabilized apartment. I pay market  value,18 which I' m sure this gentleman behind me  would 19 gladly appreciate that with his signs that he   has 20 been mocking elderly.21 I' m sure --22 MR. DIANA:	I' m not mocking 23 elderly. Then ask for a SCRIE  application.24 MR. JUAN ALONZO :	Well , SCRIE 25 also has - -2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Let' s --3 MR. JUAN ALONZO :	-- been 4 filtering people because they' re overworked and 5 underpaid just like us . They' re turning people 6 away - -7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Mr. Alonzo,8 let' s -- direct your comments to us, please.9 MR. JUAN ALONZO :	I' m sorry,10 sir.11 You know, - -12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	You do have 13 a little more time .14 MR. JUAN ALONZO :	-- a lot of 15 services are being cut because we need to   balance 16 the budget . Please do not balance it on the  backs 17 of people like my grandma, who are native   New 18 Yorkers, who were born and raised in New  York.19 They don' t want to live in 20 Connecticut, much less New  Jersey.21 ( Laughter.)22 MR.

CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.Is there anyone else? Please step down.Again, I remind the  speakers 
7 now we are still limiting three minutes. There  is 8 a counter.9 MS. ADELE BENDER:	Please 10 don' t banish me to Florida . It ' s like going to 11 hell.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Wait . Let me 13 interrupt you.14 Please state your name.15 MS. ADELE BENDER:	My name is 16 Adele Bender and I am a member and former   Queens 17 Coordinator for JPAC, Joint Public  Affairs 18 Committee, for older adults, which is part  of 19 JASA, the Jewish Association for Service to  the 20 Aged, and I am on the board of the   Queens 21 Interagency Council for the Aged and the  Vice 22 President for the tenants association in  my 23 building, and several other such organizations ,24 senior and otherwise.25 But what I want to say very ,7 
2 very quickly is like I think we' re going back  to 3 the caves. I mean everything is so  reactionary .4 I don' t know who to get more 5 mad at : The Real Estate Board or the MTA, both  of 6 them. I mean I thought I would have a heart   attack 7 getting over here today.8 And , you know, the rents keep 9 going up. If you have two cents more than $ 29 , 000 10 required for SCRIE , you still have to keep  paying 11 increase after increase after increase . Where is 12 it going to stop?13 Rent -- I know we' re not here 14 for rent control, but I know they' re paying 12 . 515 percent increases.16 I' m a rent- stabilized tenant.17 And, again , as I say, I don' t know where it' s18 going to stop.19 I don' t have to tell you that 20 the cost of food is not getting any  cheaper.21 Everybody knows, as was mentioned before,  that 22 there' s a health care crisis out there . The 23 hospitals are closing. Nurses are losing  jobs.24 Patients are - - you go into the emergency room ,25 you' ll have to wait for God knows how long  unless 2 
2 it ' s, you know , a trauma thing .3 It' s like this whole society is 4 going to hell in a  handbasket.5 And the fact that the rents  are 6 going up is just an added plus to  this .7 I just think that the  whole 8 thing is a tragedy . And I' m just hoping that you 9 people will try to understand what is happening  in 10 this society and, please, freeze the rents for  a11 change .12 Okay. Thank you .13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you.14 ( Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Are there 16 any other speakers ?17 I' m sorry. I honestly can' t18 hear you.19 MR.

6 William Ricardo Gibson .7 The question I would like  to 8 ask of the Panel, the ones who are owners   of 9 buildings, how much do you pay for the  repairs ,10 and are the persons that repair your buildings ,  do 11 they work for the unions and what would the   costs 12 be ?13 Could you answer those 14 questions?15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Let me just 16 clarify something.17 The owner representatives on 18 this Board do not necessarily own buildings.  They 19 represent the owner interest.20 The tenant members on  the 21 Board, although we know Ms . Holder is a tenant ,  do 22 not --23 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I' m a tenant 24 also.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Ron is also.6 

2	I' m sorry.3
-- do not necessarily have  to 
4 be . They promote the group ' s interest.5 So let me clarify  that.6 MR. WILLIAM GIBSON:	All right.7 So my question is there ' s a lot 8 of monies that they may pay for for unions .  With 9 all the teenagers and people who are out of   work,10 retired, to cut the costs, if they  collaborate 11 probably with the owners, you understand,  in 12 making these repairs, they wouldn' t have to take 13 the buildings itself and let it  deteriorate.14 And that way, in return , you 15 would have maybe a communication between  the 16 owners and the tenants .17 And the costs - - I mean ,18 because we ' ve talked about costs. Everybody is 19 silent here. So why not work at together  having,20 just like you have here, and you have  buildings 21 that are at great expenses , you understand ,22 everybody wants to make money.23 But what the community and  some 24 of these groups, with teenagers and what it  may 25 be , can collaborate with the owners and with  the 4 
2 City agencies, the lawyers as well , maybe  some 3 could be reached.4 And I' d like to know what' s5 your opinion, what do you think about that ?6 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I think it' s a7 good idea. I don' t own any buildings so I  don' t8 have any control over who can be hired .9 MR. WILLIAM GIBSON:	Well, Ms.10 Cruz.11 MS. CRUZ:	I don' t own any 12 buildings.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	She' s not an 14 owner either.15 MS. CRUZ:	But I support summer 16 jobs for teenagers . And actually your proposal 17 doesn' t seem very --18 MR. WILLIAM GIBSON:	What I ' m19 saying , you don' t own buildings, but you know 20 building owners.21 MS. CRUZ:	Yes.22 MR. WILLIAM GIBSON:	So by 23 being a representative here, maybe you  could 24 convey that to --25 MS. CRUZ:	As you speak , I am 2 
2 taking notes as you can  see.3 MR. WILLIAM GIBSON:	And who is 4 the next lady?5 MS. LEVINE:	I don' t own 6 buildings and I' m a public member.7 MR. WILLIAM GIBSON:	So would 8 you be able to do the same ?9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Let me just 10 step in and say we appreciate your comments,  we 11 hear them, we value them, and we' ll pass them  on 12 where we can.13 We' re not owners.14 MR. WILLIAM GIBSON:	I just --15 I hear everybody here asking about the cuts   and 16 the regulations. But I hear nobody speaking --   I17 want to know as feedback, what do you think,   what 18 can you offer, or what  --19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	What we can 20 offer is to listen to what you  say .21 MR. WILLIAM GIBSON:	But it 22 should be a two- way street I think , in my  opinion.23 MS. LEVINE:	It ' s not actually.24 It ' s a public hearing. We are supposed to listen 25 to you .2 
2 But I think that  you 3 misunderstand the role of this Board. We have   one 4 job and one job only and that' s to set the  legal 5 rents for increases for regulated  housing.6 There were a multitude  of 7 elected officials and their staffs here over  the 8 course of the day and that ' s their job is to  enact 9 those programs that you are talking about or  to 10 create new opportunities or to change the law   to 11 make it better .12 You ' re preaching to the choir.13 We think the law is flawed . Talk to the people  who 14 represent you. You go to the voting booth and   vote 15 for who you vote for, whose salaries you pay   for.16 That' s their job.17 I hope you' ll talk to them and 18 I hope you will bring these ideas  forward.19 MR. WILLIAM GIBSON:	Well, this 20 is my first time and it won' t be my  last.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	And we look 22 forward to you coming back .23 MR. WILLIAM GIBSON:	Thank you 24 very much.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	Thank you 2

I feel like I' m doing the last Is there anyone else in  the 
 5 room who would like to speak who is not   --6 obviously is not registered?7 ( No response.)8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL :	No one else.9 Just a reminder , that our final 10 vote on the adjustments to the rent  stabilized 11 renewal leases will be held here at the Great   Hall 12 at Cooper Union on Thursday, June 24 th , starting 13	at 5 : 30 .14 With no other speakers to  be 15 heard, is there a motion to adjourn this   meeting?16 MR.
