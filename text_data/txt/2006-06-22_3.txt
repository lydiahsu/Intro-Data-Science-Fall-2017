2 need these subsidies .	And, you know, they have3 brand new cars.4 I'm on call 24 hours a day, seven5 days a week, 365 days a year cleaning their6 toilets, fixing their leaks, changing their light7 bulbs and sweeping the floors outside .	This is8 not fair .	My car is nine years old, by the way.9 I need the Rent Guidelines Board10 help so I force - - so I am not forced out of the11 City that I've lived and born here and lose my12 property.	I cannot afford the increased expenses13 or the subsidies to subsidize my tenants.14 After ten, fifteen, twenty years I15 should be allowed market rents after subsidizing16 them .	I'm a small property owner.	It's just not17 fair .	I, and other small property owners of18 these SRO buildings that are under twenty units,19 need reasonable rents and not fall through the20 cracks .	Zero percent increases are unreasonable .21 Thank you for your time .22 (Audience participation .)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have some24 questions.25 Go ahead.2 
2 DIRECTOR KAUFMAN:	How long have3 you owned your building?4	MR. JOHN ACKERMAN:	Fifteen years.5 DIRECTOR KAUFMAN:	Do you own other6 properties?7 MR. JOHN ACKERMAN:	Yes, I own8 another property, small properties.9 DIRECTOR KAUFMAN:	Other SROs?10 MR. JOHN ACKERMAN:	Yes.11	DIRECTOR KAUFMAN:	Where?12 MR. JOHN ACKERMAN:	On the Upper13 West Side.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	These are all15 operated as SROs.	What was the size of these16 rooms?17 MR. JOHN ACKERMAN:	They're small18 brownstones.	The rooms are decent - - you know,19 smaller studio sizes that they would go for, you20 know, 850, as I said, market rent.21 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And your22 average rent that you're collecting now in these23 SROs?24 MR. JOHN ACKERMAN:	The average25 rent on one particular building is probably about12 
2	$450 a month.3	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And how many4	tourists do you have?5	MR. JOHN ACKERMAN:	None, zero, zip.6 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	How come?7 MR. JOHN ACKERMAN:	I don't even8 know about this whole thing the tourist market.9 (Audience participation.)10 MR. JOHN ACKERMAN:	Honestly, you11 can check.	I don't.	I think - - I don't know12 what that' s come out with.	These are smaller13 properties.	Maybe the bigger properties are in a14 different situation, I don't know.	These are15 under twenty units.16 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	You're running17 small properties, some	very affordable units in18 the communities that you're within.19 MR. JOHN ACKERMAN:	Yes.20 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And you're21 having difficulties meeting the - - making  your22 ends meet.23 MR. JOHN ACKERMAN:	I can't pay my24 real estate taxes.	I have to pay the City 1825 percent interest on it.	July 1st as taxes come6 
2 in, I have to work elsewhere in order to3 subsidize them.4	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Why aren't you5	selling this building?6	MR. JOHN ACKERMAN:	What's that?7	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Why aren't you8	selling these buildings?9	MR. JOHN ACKERMAN:	Well, I mean I10 don't think that' s a fair request that I have to11 sell the buildings.12 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	I didn't say13 you had to, I said why aren't you.14 MR. JOHN ACKERMAN:	Because I've15 lived in Manhattan, this is what I do.	If I16 sell, what am I going to do.	What am I going to17 do for work?	I mean if you guys - - why don't you18 quit your jobs.	I mean I don't think that's a19 fair request to ask someone to quit their job.20 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	So you're21 committed to providing quality, affordable22 housing.2 3	MR. JOHN ACKERMAN:	Yes, and I don't24 have any complaints from my tenants, by the way.25 They all say I do a good job. I just can't afford
2it.3VOICES:Open yourbooks.4MR. JOHNACKERMAN:They are open.5CHAIRMANMARKUS:You're under the6 hotel stabilization .7 MR. JOHN ACKERMAN:	Yes, I'm a8 small property owner, but they put it under - - if9 you have one SRO it's considered an SRO building.10 Thank you so much .11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Lawrence12 Gregory;13 Steven Chabra;14 Will be followed by Penny LaForest.15 MR . LAWRENCE GREGORY:	Good16 afternoon.17 My name is Lawrence Gregory. I'm the18 President of the Flatbush Carroll Gardens19 Association in Brooklyn.	And there are two20 buildings involved in our complex, 580 and 59021 Flatbush. They are a combined 722 units.22 At this time our tenants feel that,23 as well as I do, that we cannot afford such a24 rent increase that is being proposed .	And we're25 hoping that you will really keep all the tenants12 
2 in the City in line about this.3 There are three basic problems that4 we have:	That is security, maintenance and5 harassment, along with cleanliness of the two6 buildings.7 For example, just two weeks ago we8 had intruders come into one of the buildings.9 There was an attempted rape.	We 've had runaway10 boys that would come into the building, fallen11 asleep, this type of thing .	This was also about12 two weeks ago, it's an every day occurrence.13 Our senior citizens aren 't able to14 come out and sit in a park area that we have15 there for fear of the profanity use, the smoking16 of marijuana and the harassment that they receive17 to move out.18 We lost a child a year and a half to19 two years ago when someone thew something like a20 pipe out of a window and they left the apartment21 and never returned.22 These are things that are on the23 record at the Police Department.	We do have ETAP24 that we try to work with and - - along with other25 agencies .
2 One of the things also that we are3 seeing the harassment recently is that our senior4	citizens, as well as our workers tenants are5 receiving notices to	about late payments for6 rent.	The rent is paid on time and they send - -7 when the rent is sent in to management, they hold8	the checks for some reason for two weeks.	They9 do not deposit these checks.	And then these10 tenants - - and this is going on today, these11 tenants are getting court appearance notices.12 And when they appear there it's13 clear, but however, these - - I mean the charges14 are cleared because it's shown that they have15 paid the rent, but it's costing the tenants16 money.	It's cost them a day	a penalty of a17 day off from work.	And they really can't afford18 it.19 And I just feel it's not correct and20 it's unjust for such an increase to be given21 towards tenants at this time.	And we really are22 hoping and truly, truly hoping that you would23 take this into consideration because it really24 isn't fair to the tenants.	They cannot25 they're not getting the increases in pay as we9 
2 are getting these increases in these record rent3 deals.4 As long as the - -and also - - I'll5 just end there.6 Thank you.7 (Audience participation. )8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.9	DIRECTOR ADAMS:	You mentioned two10 buildings with 722 units?11 MR. LAWRENCE GREGORY:	Yes.	There12 are.13 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Are all of those14 rent stabilized?15 MR. LAWRENCE GREGORY:	Not all.	It16 seems that for some reason after tenants move out17 that those certain apartments are warehoused and18 they do not fall under the guidelines.	I don't19 know how the landlord does it, but it doesn't20 fall into the guidelines of rent control so21 basically the majority of our apartments in both22 buildings are rent controlled.2 3	DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Okay .	Thank you.24 MR. LAWRENCE GREGORY:	Thank you.25 (Audience participation.)24 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Steve Chabra;3 Followed by Penny LaForest.4 MR . STEVEN CHABRA:	How does this5 sound? Sound okay?6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Perfect .	A7 little louder.8 Go ahead .9	MR. STEVEN CHABRA:	You can always10 tell when it's summer in New York, because the11 tenants come out and - - to chant, chant and jeer12 at these meetings.	But we're not only angry,13 we're terrified.	We' re terrified by the arsenal14 of weapons that' s been built by - -15 (Audience participation .)16 MR. STEVEN CHABRA:	- - owners,17 lobbyists, politicians and lawyers that' s aimed18 at us and we, tenants, are under attack.19 Tenants are under attack from the20 owner/occupancy weapon claiming entire buildings21 for landlord personal use and mass evicting the22 rent regulated tenants.23 Tenants like me are under attack24 from the phoney demolition weapon using loopholes25 meant to create new housing owners file to
2 demolish affordable housing but only mean to3 renovate existing buildings to create deregulated4	luxury housing.5 (Audience participation .)6 MR . STEVEN CHABRA :	And you know7 what, it's just a scam to get rid of the rent8 regulated tenants.9	Tenants are under attack from the10 destructive construction weapon .	The relentless11 daily pounding that loosens plaster to crash down12 on our heads as we sleep, shutting off cooking13 gas, electricity, water and heat for days or14 weeks or months at a time.	Anything to get rid15 of us.16 If an owner is ordered to make17 repairs, there' s the self-certified repairs18 weapon, swearing that repairs have been done when19 nothing has been done leaving tenants in unsafe20 apartments in decrepit squalor.21 Tenants are under attack by the22 Urstadt weapon that lets Albany manipulate our23 housing market by remote control; strong- arm24 harassment, vacancy decontrol, major capital25 improvements scams, misapplied imminent domain;10 
2 malignant neglect by agencies; the sign of3 witnesses in government and enforcement.4 The list of weapons goes on and on.5 I know the Rent Guidelines Board6 can't fix all these problems, but there' s one way7 that tenants are under attack that's under your8 complete control, a weapon you can abolish today,9 a weapon that funds a creation of other weapons.10 Tenants are under attack every time11 you vote to raise rents.12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. STEVE CHABRA:	The programs14 voted to allow it, don't need higher rents for15 higher taxes.	The Pinnacle, Extells or Vornados16 don't need more rent money for higher fuel costs .17 They want more money for other purpose.	Every18 dollar more that you demand from tenants is a19 dollar from landlords is for Albany payola .20 Every dollar more that you demand21 from tenants is a campaign contribution from our22 landlord to support poisonous politics of greed23 that terrorize tenants.24 (Audience participation.)25 MR. STEVEN CHABRA:	For every
2	dollar more that you demand from me is used by my3 landlord, Steve Klowman, for yet another law firm4 to higher to yet lawyer to find yet another5 loophole to create yet another weapon to evict6 me .7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap8	up.9	MR. STEVEN CHABRA :	With every10 increase you save us paying, you 're putting into11 law that I must pay for the cost of the weapons12 by which I will be evicted .13 Tenants are under attack by all of14 these forces and I am sad to say by this Board.15 The RGB must vote to eliminate the16 one weapon it controls completely and mandate17 zero percent increases for all categories of18 renewal leases.19 Tenants are under attack.	We need20 your help to fight .21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you.22 (Audience participation.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Penny LaForest.24 MS . PENNY LAFOREST:	Is this okay?25 This is okay, right?10 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One second.3 Penny LaForest;4 Will be followed by Bob Katz;5	Followed by Steve Herrick.6 MS. PENNY LAFOREST:	My name is7 Penny LaForest.	And I live in Queens and I have8 a message for you from Queens tenants. I'm from9 the Queens League of United Tenants.10 We know this is a charade.	We know11 that we come here every year.	We know that12 you've already decided pretty much what you're13 going to do.	And all the statistics and the14 percentages really don't mean anything to you.15 And you probably don't read half the16 stuff that is submitted to you because you take17 your marching orders from higher up.18 (Audience participation.)19 MS. PENNY LAFOREST:	You don't want20 me to say this stuff, right.21 So I'm here to tell you this, that22 the reason we do continue to come here and tell23 you all the statistics and talk to you the way we24 do is not because we believe in you and not25 because we believe that your decisions our based6 
2 on our needs, but because we have to in a3 democracy at least have the pretense  of4 accountability.	And you individuals have to5 start feeling accountable for what you do.6 Because I teach young men who have done crimes in7 this City and they have done robbery and they8 have hurt people and they have sold drugs and9 they are the poorest kids in this city.10 And I always tell them you are maybe11 one kind of criminal, but there are other12 criminals with pens and paper, you guys who with13 pens and paper destroy lives, bring terrible14 conditions into peoples homes, are responsible15 for putting people out in the street and you are16 those criminals.17 And you know what, I won't say - -18 just, wait a minute.	I won't say what you said,19 Mr. Markus when you opened your mouth to Tim20 Collins but I will tell you, you may all go fuck21 yourself.22 (Audience participation .)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Katz.24 You will not put before someone on25 the list ever again starting next year.	She was2 
2	number 112, 112.3	Let' s go, Mr. Katz.4	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I have no idea5 what she was going to say, but she has people6 here who need to catch a bus.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That' s too bad.8 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	No, it's not too9	bad.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	She should put11 her name on the list.	No, it's not.	She's12 number 112.13 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I want to know if14 there are a bunch of tenants who ask that they15 get to see her before they had to get on the bus.16 Am I not right?17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That' s great.19 Go ahead, Mr. Katz.20 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Marvin, Marvin,21 Marvin .22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. Let's23 go, Mr. Katz.24 MR. ROBERT KATZ:	My time has been25 running. Put it back10 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right. We' ll3 start your name again.4 MR. ROBERT KATZ:	Thank you.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you ready to6 go.	Tell me when you're ready to start.7 MR. ROBERT KATZ:	I'm ready to8 start .9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Let's go.10 MR. ROBERT KATZ:	As counsel to the11 Queens League Of United Tenants QLOUT, I appear12 in my role as a tenant advocate to plead with you13 to institute a cap on the amount of rent increase14 a landlord may impose in a given leasehold15 period.16 You must be made to understand that17 because of major capital improvements, where18 there is a cap of six percent per annum and in19 many areas of the City where at the end OF the20 lease term the tenant can be denied a21 preferential rent leading to increases of as much22 as 200 to 300 percent by the landlords now23 rightful demand of legal regulated rent, your24 rent guideline increase then goes on top of what25 I've already described.10 
2 Doing what I fear you will do will3 call for a demand of cat food where there are no4 cats, especially as to seniors and disabled5 tenants who live on fixed incomes.6 Iam annexing a chapter of the7 recent NYU Furman Study of the New York8 University School of Law.	The chapter deals with9 the changes as to affordability and10 availabilities between 2002 and 2005.11 Inow bullet from the report the12 following facts found by this staid institution13 that lists HPD among the sponsors of the report.14 The real median household income15 decreased between 2002 and 2005 by more than 6.316 percent;17 During the same period median18 monthly rent increased by more than eight percent19 in real terms;20 The median share of income spent on21 rent rose from 28.5 percent in 2002 to 31.222 percent in 2005;23 And, finally, Furman' s observation24 that : "Even after controlling for inflation, the25 number of rental units available at rents2 
2 affordable to low and moderate income households3 has fallen significantly since 2002.4 These increases in rent levels are5 especially disconcerting given the decline in6 citywide income from 2002 to 2005.7 A rent increase would be the last8 thing that Furman would advise in such9 circumstances, for it is another nail in the10 coffin to those who stand as the bread winners of11 this, our City, where Furman finds that already12 the tenants we are concerned with pay well in13 excess of the thirty percent of income for rent14 which is in excess of Federal standards.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, Mr.16 Katz.17 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I have a18 question.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Sure .20 Question .21 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you for22 your testimony this afternoon.23 What would you suggest that this24 Board do in addition to - -25 MR. ROBERT KATZ:	This Board has6 
2 the power to put in supplemental guidelines for3 many, many years.	I believe you also have the4 power to grant a cap.	Tenants should not have to5 pay 24 percent, when you have an MCI, 24 percent6 a year in the leasehold period of increased rent7 before they reach to your rent guideline.8	As to the preferential rent, there,9 the legislature has done an abomination because10 there are people that then when their lease11 expires this year, are going to be faced with two12 and 300 percent rent raise, because the low and13 preferential rent to the legal regulated rent and14 after that, 200 or 300 percent rent increase15 you're going to put something on top of it, isn't16 that nice?17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 (Audience participation.)19 DIRECTOR HOLDER :	I have another20 question.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Another22 question.23 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	So when someone24 says that - - I understood that you're referring25 to the Furman Report.9 
2 So when someone says that there's3 this diminishing middle class, where do you think4 that they' re going?5	MR. ROBERT KATZ:	Oh, you want to6 know where they're going, I tell you where7 they're going.	When they're evicted, and if you8 go down to the - - to the Housing Court and see9 how non-payment proceedings are exploding.	When10 they are evicted, they don't join the homeless in11 the street usually, what they do is they double12 or triple up or they go into the cribs that are13 all in Sunnyside and Astoria.14 They cribs are little, little rooms15 in basements where there' s only one way of egress16 and ingress, or they go and they live in the17 holes, in the cellars of the family houses that18 were never CO'd or multiple dwelling, et cetera.19 But they have to go somewhere.20 And I must say to you that as far as21 I am concerned, your Board may very well one day22 cause a fire that's going to kill people.23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. ROBERT KATZ:	- - because you25 had them evicted by your rent increases.6 
13212CHAIRMANMARKUS:Thank you.3DIRECTORHOLDER:I have one more4question.5CHAIRMANMARKUS:One more6question.7	Go ahead.8	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And so - - thank,9 I'm sorry to keep you, but I have some more10 questions for you.11 MR. ROBERT KATZ:	You can keep me12 all day long if you want to.13 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	What would be14 your response based on your years of advocacy and15 understanding of what's been happening with16 housing, the rental housing here in New York17 City, how would say that landlords are faring18 right now in 2006?19 MR. ROBERT KATZ:	Well, let's take20 a look at what's going on.21 First of all, you are having whole22 apartment houses emptied by eviction so that23 landlords can live in their private mansion, and24 I'm talking 21 units, 30 units, et cetera.25 The next thing is that the Pataki9 
2 Administration forgot when there was MCis, they3 forgot that the law required on an MCI that it be4 depreciable under the Internal Revenue Code.	So5 now we have something like an MCI in Fresh6 Meadows where it's $6.5 million and less - - more7 than twenty percent is not depreciable under the8 IRS code.	But the Pataki Administration allowed9 the landlord consultants where no consultants10 were ever allowed before.	They allowed them to11 take maintenance, ordinary maintenance, put it12 into the MCI so that the landlord can pay his13 payroll, the tenants pay his payroll within - - in14 the MCI.15 And, of course, the 140.	And what16 about the vacancy decontrol.	Do you know that if17 a tenant moves in in March and leaves in June, a18 landlord gets another twenty percent.	And if the19 tenants in June leaves in September, the landlord20 gets another twenty percent.	The law is21 ridiculous in terms of rent increases.	It all22 goes to one place.23 Get that rate up to 2000.	And of,24 course, if any decent, middle class tenant moves25 out of an apartment today, a landlord, by the use2 
2	of the device 140th can deregulate that3 apartment.4 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	But how are the5	landlords doing?6	MR. ROBERT KATZ:	What? The7	landlords are doing very well.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next11 speaker is Steve Herrick, Cooper Square12 Committee;13 Followed by Vajra Kilgour;14 Followed by Aliya Feldman15 Representing State Senator Tom Duane.16 Go ahead.17 Mr. Herrick.18 MR. STEVE HERRICK:	Good afternoon.19 Yes, I'm Steve Herrick, Cooper Square Committee20 Director.21 I am here today to urge the Rent22 Guidelines Board to vote for zero percent rent23 increase.	There are many reasons why a rent24 freeze is justified.25 First, a recent housing study by the10 
 2 Furman Center at NYU, which was recently3 mentioned, has found that the median rent for4 unsubsidized apartments jumped to $900 from $750,5 a twenty percent increase in the past three6 years.	As a result, the number of apartments7 affordable to households earning less than8 $32,000 has dropped by 205,000 in just three9 years.10 Secondly, the same study found that11 the median income of New York City households has 12	declined from $42,700 in 2003 to $40,000 in 2006,13 a 6.3 percent decline in income for the typical14 New Yorker in the past three years.15 In addition, more than thirty16 percent of New Yorkers pay over fifty percent of17 their income for rent, and this percentage18 continues to rise.19 In the East Village and Lower East20 Side, one out of every seven rent regulated21 apartments have been deregulated in the last six22 years according to a Cooper Square Committee23 survey.	The loss of an estimated 6,000 rent24 regulated apartments from our local housing stock25 during the past few years, often from illegal13 
2 practices by landlords, is not taken into account3 by the Rent Guidelines Board when it calculates4 landlords' cost of doing business.5 The reality, as every tenant knows,6 is that landlords have a vast arsenal of tactics7 for raising rents.	As Steve Chabra mentioned8 just recently, from major capital improvement9 rent increases to vacancy increases, combined10 with apartment improvement rent increases, to11 aggressive litigation against tenants followed by12 buyout offers, to illegal practices such as13 filing fraudulent rent registrations with DHCR.14 We have documented dozens upon15 dozens of buildings that have been purchased by16 landlords like Steven Crowin, the Shaloms,17 Economikus, Ben Shal and other landlords, who18 have been able vacate over eighty percent of the19 rent regulated tenants within three years of20 buying the buildings, and the rent rolls have21 risen exponentially.22 Annual Rent Guidelines Board23 increases play only a very small role in the24 dramatic rent restructuring of these buildings.25 The reality is that landlords are now paying over
2 $200,000 per unit to buy buildings on the Lower3 East Side and they are not hurting financially.4 They are involved in bidding wars to5 buy real estate in our neighborhood .	Many of6 these buildings are eight to sixteen unit7 tenement buildings, yet, the real estate lobby is8 always telling us that small building owners are9 hurting financially because of the rising cost of10 fuel and real estate taxes .11	If this is the case, why are these12 developers scrambling to buy small buildings?13 And why are the banks so eager - -14 (Audience participation.)15 MR . STEVEN HERRICK :	to finance16 these transactions if owners of these small17 buildings are in such a dicey proposition.18 Clearly, the Rent Guidelines Board19 needs to develop a more sophisticated formula for20 analyzing the financial health of the City's21 rental housing stock, and they should worry more22 about the health of the average tenant' s bank23 accounts.24 The typical New York tenant is rent25 poor, just a paycheck away from disaster .12 
2	I urge the Rent Guidelines Board to3	take this larger reality into account and to stop4 being complicit in deregulating housing for low,5 moderate and middle income New Yorkers.6 Otherwise, in another decade the Rent Guidelines7 Board will be voting on rent increases for just a8 few hundred thousand apartments instead of close9 to a million apartments.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11	(Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have a13 question.14 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	You mentioned the15 list that you've complied of buildings that have16 been deregulated or otherwise used by yourself.17 Can you make that list available to18 us?19 MR. STEVE HERRICK:	Yeah, we can20 compile that list for you.21 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Thank you very22 much23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 4	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I have a25	question.
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.3	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	So when you said4 that the rents have gone up from 750 to $900,5 you're saying occupied units or unoccupied units?6 MR. STEVE HERRICK:	I'm talking7 about the median rent of occupied units.8	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And what about9 unoccupied or vacant units where people have to10 try to find when they - -11	MR. STEVE HERRICK:	Yeah.	What we12 found actually was striking when we did a survey13 of the Lower East Side tenants.	We found the14 median rent was about $975, but the people who15 moved in just in the last three years, the16 typical rent was $1750.17 And there' s a huge gap between, you18 know, long term tenants who are paying if they've19 been there ten or fifteen years, they may be20 paying $700 or something in that range.	But once21 they vacate these landlords are raising rents22 typically about a thousand dollars or more per23 unit.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead,25 there' s another question.
2	Go ahead, Mr. Schleider.3	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.4 You say that property investors are5 coming in and paying upwards of $200,000 a unit6 for buildings in your neighborhood.	And you're7 citing that there was a loss of, what was it8	6,000 - -9	MR. STEVE HERRICK:	We estimate10	6,000.	There's 607 units.11	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And tn12 you're saying that the new renters coming in are13 begin charged fifteen, sixteen, $1700 a month?14 MR. STEVE HERRICK:	At least.15 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Is there any16 correlation between why this property was sold so17 that they have to - - so that the new owners18 coming in have to get these high rents?	What do19 you think happened with low median rents?	And20 before these $1700 rents I'm sure the median rent21 in those buildings was probably below $600. What22 do you think23 MR. STEVE HERRICK:	No, that' s not24 true.	I mean the median rents we found in these25 building is about $975.
2 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Is 975 and so3 over the past three years the new rent is coming4 in around 1700 and it's only math.	If you take5 out the $1700 a month rent from that' s 6,0006 apartments, right, your median rent three years7 ago had to be much lower.8 So do you think that if those9 landlords had a reasonable rent increase they10 could have held on that much longer and maybe11 lost 6000 units?12 MR. STEVE HERRICK:	I don't think13 that' s - - first, I don't agree with the way the14 question is phrased.15 (Audience participation.)16 MR. STEVEN HERRICK:	The reality17 is that some of these landlords are displacement18 artists, they know if they can get a building19 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Not the20 landlords, the property manipulators that come in21 after the landlords who have serviced your22 community for years.2 3	MR.	STEVE HERRICK:	Well, we have24 some good, long term owners who are keeping their25 rents relatively affordable, but what' s happening
2	is3	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	You have to4	help those landlords stay in place by allowing5	them to have reasonable rent increases otherwise6 you're going to have a further deterioration of7 the affordable housing stock.8	MR. STEVE HERRICK:	Well, they're9 not hurting, a lot of these long term owners are10 not hurting or they won' t be holding up these11 buildings long term if they were hurting .12 They've got a commercial tenant on the ground13 floor, they've got tenants that are paying a mix14 of different rents depending on when they moved15 in.16 What' s happening though is that17 certain landlords are corning in and buying18 buildings and they know that within a few years19 they can, through a variety of tactics that were20 mentioned, they can start doing renovations that21 goes for months and months and it just drives22 people crazy and then they start moving out or23 they take buy outs and then they deregulate.24 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And what' s25 keeping your long term landlords from doing the
2 same thing?3 A VOICE:	Decency.4	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER :	Well - -5 decency, that's right.6 MR . STEVE HERRICK:	Well, yes,7 decency is probably a good for it .	They are8 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	You have to9 work with us to protect those tenants in those10 buildings by allowing these landlords to have a11 reasonable rent increase12 MR. STEVE HERRICK:	No, what needs13 to happen is that you know prosecution needs to14 be done and brought against some of these15 landlords that are doing these very things.16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Another18 question.19 Let's go .20 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	What do you think21 is the reason for speculation in the housing22 market, do you think it's only because the RGB23 has been giving increases that a lot of landlords24 think are too low?25 MR. STEVE HERRICK:	Well, I think
2 there's a just an array of - - you know, DCHR has3 a number of methods by which landlords can4 legally raise rents .	And then on top of that5 there are landlords who know there are things6 that they can just get away with, you know, by7 doing preferential rents where tenants within a8 few years end up having losses.	They come in and9 they go up to a new legal rent which actually was10 fraudulently filed with DHCR and it was never11 caught by the tenant living there.12 There' s a number of ways that13 they're able to do his.	But I think there' s just14 - - there' s so much equity out there by investors15 who are looking at this and see that there's16 money to be made.	The tenants, especially on the17 Lower East Side, there' s a lot of transient18 people.	There' s a lot of students from NYU and19 people coming from out of New York who don' t know20 about the rent regulatory system and don' t21 challenge rent	suspected rent overcharges.22 Are willing to have a couple of23 roommates and pay over $2000 a month rent.	And24 so with all these factors these speculators25 coming in knowing that if they vacate these units
2 they could bring these types of tenants .3 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And to the4 extent that you have speculators or people coming5 in who are trying to convert and make these6 apartments into coops or condos, do you think7 that is because the RGB has issued kind of8 guideline increases it's done or there are other9 reasons why that happens?10 MR . STEVE HERRICK:	No .	I mean the11 reality is that we' re seeing condos developed in12 the Lower East Side and the East Village. They're13 now over a million dollars per apartment.14 Given that reality - - I mean whether15 the Rent Guidelines Board would pass along a16 seven percent increases or two percent increases17 is not really going to enter into their18 calculation about what the economic value of19 these buildings is, but they know if they can20 vacant them, they can find a market out there .21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We belive that .22 That doesn't take away what our job is, but we'll23 see.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.25 Next .
13352(Audience participation.)3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on a4second.Let me just tell you who' s next.5Aliya Feldman;6After Vajra Kilgour;7Followed by Daniel Peckham.8Go ahead.9MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	Okay.	Last10 year, Marvin you - - somebody - - Martin Zelman, a11 profoundly decent human being, who we all mis,12 suggested that if there were buildings where they13 were a large number of non-stabilized apartments14 that there should not be increases voted for the15 stabilized apartments. And you challenged this16 and said, well, what about Harlem where that's17 not the case and that would a poor tax as if18 these rent increases were not a poor tax across19 the board.20 Let me tell you about my building.21 I'm a sister building of 65 apartments.	The22 not-for-profit landlord tried to do an empty out,23 managed to empty about half the apartments.24 They've been out of rent stabilization for over25 four years.10 
2 And they sold the buildings to a new3 landlord who is keeping a fairly low profile and4 doing gut rehabs on apartments that become5 vacant.	Those apartment will rent for a lot of6 money.7 Our landlord will not be needing any8 rent increase for the poor people who still9	remain.	And we are working class people.	The10 people who still remain, in fact, have been there11 for over twenty years.	We used to joke we can't12 afford to move.	Now it's not a joke anymore,13 that we can seriously afford to stay thanks to14 the rent increases that you put in over the last15 four years.16 I don't know how I'm going	maybe17 I'll be able to afford to retire on Social18 Security at 70, I don't know.	If could hang in19 until I was eligible for SCRIE at the rate you're2 0	raising the rents.21 Okay.	So it's an aging population22 that' s left there.	We are not looking at major2 3	career changes that are going to cause us to have24 lots more money, that' s not going to happen.	But25 there are going to be apartments in those24 
2 buildings running for vast sums of money.3 When you-all talk about whether its4 fair for some people to have lower rents, you5 never get into the issue to whether it's fair,6 the income discrepancies in this town or in this7 country. You never talk about that.8 (Audience participation.)9 MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	All right?10 With regard to the job of this Board, and I11 believe you said in a moment when you were12 injecting into the concept that was longer13 possible terms of the job of this board was to14 vote rent increases, no!	It is to prevent rent15 gouging.	It is not to put a seal of approval on16 rent gouging as you have done, year after year,17 Mr. Greed.	Rent gouging and you're out crying18 about how this oh, but the Government should be19 fixing the housing crisis.	Y'all are part of it20 darn it, and your part of it has been21 consistently to make the housing crisis worse.22 If you can't make it better, at23 least don't make it worse. Okay.	Do no harm.24 These increases are killing people.	We have a25 net-out migration of African-American people from2 
2 this city of 30,000 over the last four years.3 And we have poorer people having to leave.	We4 have the homelessness rate going up. Ya'll  are5 presiding over what we might call a quite6 Katrina.	Maybe you're looking to the right and7 you saying well, that' s good, that's fine.	You8 know, maybe we're supposed to come up here  and9 say it hurts, it's like talking to a sadist but10 it hurts well, it's supposed to hurt, all right.11 I mean your job is to prevent rent gouging, not12 to put a seal of approval on it. You need to  stop13 this now, all right, stop it now.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 (Audience participatio n.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Aliya Feldman;17 Followed by Daniel Peckham;18 Followed by Janet Henne or Henn.19 Go ahead, Aliya.2 0	MS. ALIYA FELDMAN:	Hi.21 Do I have to speak directly22 (Audience participation)23 MS. ALIYA FELDMAN:	Hi. My name is24 Aliya Feldman and I'm here testifying on  behalf25 of New York State Senator, Tom Duane who is in
2 Albany today3 (Audience participation.)4	MS. ALYIA FELDMAN:	"My name is5 Thomas K. Duane and I represent New York State's6 29th Senatorial District, which includes the7 Upper West Side, Hell' s Kitchen, Greenwich8 Village, Chelsea, the East Side, Stuyvesant Town,9 Peter Cooper Village and Waterside Plaza.10 This mixed-income district is11 composed largely of tenants, thousands of them12 rent stabilized, many of whom already allocate13 too high a percentage of their incomes to pay14 their rent.15 New York continues to be in a16 housing crisis.	While the affordable housing17 stock in our City is rapidly dwindling, the New18 York City Department of Housing Preservation and19 Development' s 2005 Housing and Vacancy Survey20 found that the median income for rent-stabilized21 households in New York City is $32,000.	That's a22 reduction in real dollars of 5.6 percent since23 the last survey.24 At the same time, the median rent25 for a rent-stabilized apartment is $844, an5 
2 increase of 8.2 percent over three years ago.3 Even worse, almost thirty percent of New York4 City' s households are now paying more than fifty5 percent of their incomes for gross rent.6 Meanwhile, the Rent Guidelines7 Board' s own studies show that landlords continue8 to make profits.	Furthermore, landlords have9 greatly profited from the State's vacancy10 decontrol law so they can now charge "sky's the11 limit'' rents on thousands of deregulated12 apartments.	And loopholes in State laws,13 including allowances for phony demolitions and14 owner occupancy scams, permit landlords to empty15 buildings of rent-regulated tenants whose former16 homes become fair game for exorbitant,17 non-regulated rents.18 Given these facts, it's absurd that19 the Board is even considering passing additional20 financial burdens onto tenants.21 This year's proposed rent increases22 of three to 6.5 percent for one year and five to23 8.5 percent for two year leases would be an24 unfair and unnecessary hardship to many tenants25 still reeling from last year' s increases.
2 Tenants have invested their lives in3 our City and have improved our neighborhoods.4 The Board should be proactive in preserving New5 York City' s affordable housing so that poor and6 middle-class working people can continue to live7 here.8 Towards that end, I strongly urge9 you to impose an immediate freeze on rents for10 all apartments, lofts, hotels, rooming houses,11 single room occupancy SRO buildings and lodging12 houses.13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. ALIYA FELDMAN:	The Board is15 meant to decide on rent increases based on the16 relative cost of maintaining and financing17 buildings, the available housing supply as18 defined by the vacancy rate, and the cost of19 living.20 If the Board bases its decision on21 these standards, rents should not be raised this22 year.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 Wrap up, you have to wrap up.25 MS. ALIYA FELDMAN:	I want to2 
2 briefly comment on Chair Marvin Markus's reaction3 at the June 1st Board meeting to tenant lawyer,4 and former Executive Director of the Rent5 Guidelines Board, Timothy Collins.6 I find it highly inappropriate for a7 public official to act as he did that day.	When8 Mr. Markus used an obscenity to tell Mr. Collins9 to leave, and that he didn't care to hear what he10 wanted to say, it was insulting to all11 rent-regulated tenants and to those of us who12 recognize their contributions to our communities13 and our great City.14 It was certainly hard not to15 perceive an anti- tenant stance on the Board that16 day.17 Raising rents for New York City's18 long-term residents is a back-door effort to19 force them out of the neighborhoods and20 communities that they have built.	Landlords have21 been trying for years to chip away at rent22 regulation laws, endangering the individuals and23 families who live in the approximately one24 million rent- stabilized apartments in New York25 City.	It is not sound public policy to endanger2 
2 the quality of living for hundreds of thousands3 of people.4 And I'll wrap up by saying the5 importance of this vote cannot be overstated. The6 only acceptable outcome of this Board' s vote is7 no rent new increases.8 Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma'am, question .11 Ma'am, Aliya, there' s a question.12 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you for13 coming this afternoon and thank the Senator.	I14 know they're busy with their last week in Albany.15 Do you know if the Senator supports16 repeal of the Urstadt Law?17 MS. ALIYA FELDMAN:	Yes, he does.18 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And what is he19 trying to do in regards to that?20 MS. ALIYA FELDMAN:	Well, Senator21 Duane - - that's really a legislative question and22 because I don't work in Albany I can't tell you23 the direct work that goes on in Albany.	But I24 know he's a definitely a supporter of the repeal25 of the Urstadt Laws.	And I'll bring that2 
2	question back to Senator Duane.3	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I have another4	question.5	With the tenants that come in to the6 constituency offices in Manhattan, what are the7 biggest issues around housing that people are8	coming to you about?9	MS. ALIYA FELDMAN:	In regards to10 tenants, there are definitely many issues that I11 see on a day- to-day basis in terms of12 unscrupulous landlords and landlords attempting13 to get rent regulated tenants out of their14 apartments.15 A number of these are illegal16 construction, phony demolitions, rent17 overcharges, poor conditions in the buildings.18 Mostly what I think we've seen in our office is19 landlords making conditions in buildings so awful20 to make the buildings unlivable.21 So that while it may not be - - while22 there are violations in the buildings we see2 3	landlords not acting	we can't pinpoint them as24 doing illegal things directly, it's just mostly25 when these buildings fall into such awful24 
2 conditions that tenants can't live in a safe,3 habitable buildings.4 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Question.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.6 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Are you saying that7 most of those conditions are not illegal?8 MS. ALIYA FELDMAN:	I can't9 because I don't have any documentation in front10 of me, I don't want to answer anything about11 illegal and legal practices of landlords.	But I12 will be happy to answer questions for you.	If13 you want to contact Senator Duane directly, I'm14 sure he would be happy to speak about this.15 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Then is it your16 testimony - I understand you don't have any17 papers in front of you - but you say that in18 terms those activities, whatever you would call19 them, it has the impact of having tenants leave20 the units?21 MS. ALIYA FELDMAN:	Yes .22 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Okay .	Thank23 you.24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. We're6 
2 going to read the next three then we're going to3 have a break for the stenographer.4 Daniel Peckham;5 Janet Henne or Henn;6 And Stanford William.7 The break should take place8 somewhere around 4:25 and will last fifteen9 minutes.10 MR. DANIEL PECKHAM:	Hi.11 My name is Daniel Peckham.	I live12 at 244 West 21st Street in Chelsea.13 My landlord in 2000 brought eleven14 buildings, mostly on the Upper West Side15 brownstones for - - I'm sorry.	Thirteen buildings16 for $14 million.	He - - where I live I'm17 representing four buildings.	I'm the head of the18 tenants organization, Tenants Against Talbert.19 That' s - - our landlord is Larry Talbert and his20 father Josh Talbert.21 I went with Betty Bower (phonetic)22 to ten of the SROs that he purchased and we found23 maybe two or three people left in the SROs.	All24 of them had been made into luxury rentals,25 duplexes going for $2500 month.	How he does2 
2 this, I don't know.3 In my instance I'm the only one left4	in the building.	He has sent	he sent the5 tenants this DHCR operational bulletin 2002- 1	on6 how to - - it's the owners obligation to refuse to7 renew leases on the grounds of demolition.	In8 this, there's a bio schedule. And according to9 the schedule it says the 1999 New York City10 Housing Vacancy Survey calculated the mean asking11 rent level at $312 per month.12 According to this schedule they13 figure out how much you're eligible to be brought14 out for.	And since my rent was over a $1000 I'm15 eligible for zero. I can just pay for my moving,16 that' s all he has to do.17 There an ad here that' s on the18 Belkin, Berkin, Weineg & Golden web site.	And19 it's entitled, Let's Get Ready To Rumble, DHCR20 plans demolition application without holding a21 hearing.22 And the final paragraph in the23 article says the demolition application is the24 more attractive option for owners seeking to25 recover possession of rent regulated buildings5 
2 (indicating.) They don't even try to disguise it.3 Then in 2002 the landlord broke4 through when he demolished building the next door5 to us.	He broke into our bedrooms and into our6 hallways over the 4th of July weekend and left7 debris in the hallway, in people's bedrooms with8 a full four days. He had the police there, the9 DOB, everybody we could call and nobody did10 anything.11 The landlord was never found guilty.12 He was just supposedly in an accident.	He used13 this as a weapon to get people out saying that if14 you don't take my buyout offer, I'm going to15 build around you.	And knowing	from - -16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap17 up. Mr. Peckham, you need to wrap up.18 MR. DANIEL PECKHAM:	Okay. Here it19 just seems that it's the poorest of the tenants20 here and the poorest of the landlords.	It's21 ridiculous here, you know, it's just the poor and22 the poorer.23 It's the ones that use the DHCR who24 use the law.	I've been to the court three times25 to get my ceiling fixed in my bedroom, had to2 
2 replastered five times and it is now leaking3 again.4 There should be some kind of way to5 figure out that these landlords who are corrupt6 and they are making a career out of using the7 courts to get people out and not let them have8 any increase, as the very first step.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 (Audience participation.)11 DIRECTOR HOLDER :	Can we see the12 pictures?13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Janet Henne,14 please;15 Followed by William Standford.16 And then we're going to take a17 break.18 Before we go to the break I will19 read the names of the speakers that will come20 after, some of them.21 Go ahead .22 MS. JANET HENNE:	Well, my name23 Janet Henne.	I'm a President of our Tenants24 Association.25 There would be thousands of people10 
2 here, it should be known.	And you probably know3 that they feel that this is done deal.	That's4 everyone who says that.	And I believe that too,5 that I'm standing here.	And there' s really not6 much more that I can say that hasn' t been said7 perfectly here except to tell you exactly what' s8 happening in Queens.	In all boroughs people are9 being harassed.	People are being made miserable.10 And they're getting their high rents out there11 because of vacancy decontrol, legally or12 illegally the preferred rents, they' re up there.13 I'm in Rego Park.	Studios are14 fourteen and $1600.	That's the studio and up.15 Every month, maybe less, losing an apartment off16 of rent controls, every month.17 I don't think my landlord is losing18 money.	He has 300,000 apartments.	He could19 build plenty of buildings in Jersey, he can20 building in China.	He's very, very wealthy.	And21 he' s doing a better job because he had 300,00022 apartments and now he was 20,000.23 We are harassed every day in court.24 We have don't carbon monoxide.	We talking you to25 court when tenants had them three months with2 
2 their proof.3 You're walking your dog thorough the4	lobby	personally I walk my dog through the5 lobby for forty years, I have the same dog and i6 haven' t been able to teach any of them to fly .7 People are being taken to court they helping8 their dogs, I don't even have a dog, all right,9 is that harassment?10 The latest is using	illegally11 using or interpreting Local Law 11.	They'll say12 if your lease is terminated in ten days, we' re13 taking you to court because Local Law 11 says you14 can't have any air conditioner there. Local Law15 11 says it must be secure, nothing else .16 I'm running around trying to help17 scared and frightened people because this is18 fraud by sending these notices out.	It's pure,19 total harassment.	And it's rampant in Queens now20 because that's the new hot market.21 And there are no more $500 rents .	A22 few people who are on SCRIE whose life is being23 made miserable.24 I would like to get on a plane and25 get out of here, that' s how bad it is.	I walk5 
2 home and	I - -	they'll get me when I get home, I3 know it.	And the only thing you're going to do4 is add to this.	You're going to reward them by5 giving them a raised rent.6 Thank you.7 (Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I have a10	question.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question, ma'am.12 Yes.13 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you for14 your testimony this afternoon.15 Where in Queens do you live?16 MS. JANET HENNE:	Rego Park, Rego17 Park.	Forest Hill, Rego Park.18 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	How long have you19 lived there?20 MS. JANET HENNE:	Since 1962.21 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	How has your22 neighborhood changed?23 MS. JANET HENNE:	It's transient.24 It's become - - it was families and singles, of25 course, but mostly families.	And the natural12 
2 course was that if you were single and you got3 married, you went from a studio	to a one4 bedroom.	If you had children, you went to a two5 bedroom.	That' s impossible now, absolutely6 impossible.7 There are children living in two and8 three years old living in a one bedroom with9 their parents or they're living in the bedroom.10 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	How many units11 in your - -12 MS. JANET HENNE:	I mean I don't13 have luxury, but it was better been than that?14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you in15 Lefrak City, is that where you are?16 MS. JANET HENNE:	Pardon?17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you in18 Lefrak City?19 MS. JANET HENNE:	No, in one of20 his other buildings.21 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And so how many22 units in your building?23 MS. JANET HENNE:	500.24 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	How many of25 those are rent stabilized?2 
2 MS. JANET HENNE:	As I said, we're3 losing one just about every month, at least every4 month, legally or illegal .	We're right now5	investing that.	I have to get in touch with the6 new tenants.7 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And what are the8 unregulated apartments going for?9 MS. JANET HENNE:	Unregulated,10 well, there' s a preferred rents deal that' s going11 on.	So they're given for say 2000 but of course12 they're registered with these - - the lease  says13 more and they' re going to hit with more14 increases.	And they don't it, I have to go15 around educating everybody about this so you know16 they won't be surprised.17 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	What about the18 condition of the apartments?19 MS. JANET HENNE:	Bad, bad.	They20 do not make repairs.	They're busy renovating the21 apartments so they can raise it.	And even	I22 see - - what I see, I see them taking a23 refrigerator from one apartment and putting it24 another empty apartment.25 And I knew that they're going to6 
2 charge - - add that on to their rent .	Same as3 they do to rent a air conditioner .4 I walked in for people charge for5 new air conditioners and a new air conditioner6 was 40 years old so it was the original .7	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	The 1408	increase .9	MS. JANET HENNE:	Pardon?10 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	You' re saying11 they 're charging to 140th increase for the12 markets .13 MS. JANET HENNE:	Yes.14 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	All right.	Thank15 you.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .17 Appreciate it .18 (Audience participation .)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Standford20 William .21 MR . WILLIAM STANFORD :	That 's22 William Standford .23 When I look at this - -24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Sorry.25 MR. WILLIAM STANDFORD :	When I look10 
2 at this board - - this Board reminds me of the MTA3 board.	This board - - Marvin reminds me of Peter4 Kalikow or should I say, big daddy Kalikow.	He5 was is discourteous.	There' s hope for David and6 Adriene.	There's no hope for Marvin, obviously.7 He was a little disrespectful to Adriene on8 Monday, and more disrespectful to her than today.9 There's no excuse for that, there really isn't.10 I mean first of all, if you did that11 to me, I probably knock you upside your head. I12 probably take that computer and knock you upside13 your head.	You don't do that, okay, that's14 wrong.15 All right, you settle your things16 with her outside, don't do that in here, okay?17 You're supposed to get you point across, not bash18 each other. There' s no excuse for that. Okay.19 This forum was terrible.	The forum20 you had on Monday was terrible.21 I like the Urstadt Law.	I like the22 Mayor to repeal of Urstadt Law, I don' t know too23 much about it, but I heard it was helpful to24 people with low incomes.	I don't know why it was25 dropped.	It should be repealed, right.2 
2 As far as rent increases go, you3 don' t need any more rent increases.	Judging from4 what I saw on Monday and then again here today,5 you don't need any more rent increases .6 You've had enough - - you - - from7 what I was told you constantly increased the8 rents yearly for the least seven years. But what9 has been done since these rents have been10 increased?	The tenants haven' t gotten better11 service. More tenants became homeless.	There' s12 no excuse for this, there really isn't.	There' s13 no reason	it's like you're deciding where they14 should live, how and where they should live.15 You' re acting like dictators and there' s no16 excuse for that.	It's like you're going back to17 the Adolph Hitler days, there' s no excuse for18 that.19 Why are you deciding how and where20 - - how and where and where we should live, how21 and where we should support ourselves.	Let us22 decide how and where we should live.	If we're23 paying rent with these high rents, then you24 should let us decide how and where we should25 live.	And it shouldn't be up to you.2 
2 And Marvin, it's time for you to go.3 Like I said, you remind me of Peter Kalikow.4	I don't know what you said to Mr.5 Collins on June 1, I didn't attend that forum,6 but it's time for you to go.	In fact, you're7 worse than Peter Kal - - you're more offensive8 then Peter Kalikow, okay.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap10 up.11 MR. WILLIAM STANDFORD:	Yeah, but12 you're disrespectful to speakers like myself on13 Monday and today.	And like I said, with Adriene14 you were a little disrespectful to her on Monday15 but more disrespectful today.	There's no excuse16 for that.	There' s hope for David and Adriene,17 there's no hope for you.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 MR. WILLIAM STANDFORD:	It's time20 for you to go.21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. WILLIAM STANDFORD:	You2 3	disgust me.	I should smash it over your head.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' re going to25 take a recess now.24 
2	The next speakers will be:3	Rafael Gomez;4 Sona Fink;5 And Sheila Stower; Stower.6 Those are the next three speakers.7 It's now 4:30.	We'll be back at a8 quarter to five.9 (At 4:30 p.m. the hearing was10 temporarily recessed.)11 (At 4:47 p.m. the hearing was12 resumed.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker14 is Rafael Gomez, are you here?	Yes, sir.15 Rafael Gomez;16 Sona Fink; and17 Then Sheila Stower;18 Welcome back.19 Go ahead, sir.20 MR. RAFAEL GOMEZ:	Hello, Members21 of the Board, concerned citizens.	Allow me to22 add to the statements of the people before me.23 As we note today, there are families24 that in order to make ends meet have resorted to25 rent roofs in their apartments, sometimes to4 
2 strangers which may put a family in harms way.3 These tactics are not growing out of greed, but4 out of necessity.5 Speaking to the fellow housing6 advocates for the past two weeks while assisting7 to these open forum, have lead me to believe that8 our struggle is a open battle against an enemy9 that is sitting at the top while we climbing up10 to the hills.	As some of us know, this is not11 the way for us too win.12 Every single time we come to these13 open sessions we found ourselves in a dogfight in14 which - - dogfight and the premeditated grounds15 and terms that are at the abandon of the enemy.16 Therefore, it is time to reevaluate our resources17 and strategies.18 Our resources are the power of the19 people which is the stronger power of all, the20 power of information like the web, which can21 reach billions of people and informing and22 organizing who is the enemy and what they're all23 about.24 The power of the vote.	It is time25 for people to register to vote and when the time2 
2 comes, to exercise it wisely.3 When we talk about the struggle it4 is a struggle about greed versus survival.	The5 people who suffer the most in these problems are6 our senior citizens, our retired.7 With the cost of living, inflation8 or food, utility, et cetera, et cetera against a9 fixed rate - - a fixed income, how can they10 survive?	So it is important for us to take that11 into consideration because I ask myself, do we12 live in America in America in the land of13 opportunity or we live in a cloud of wrong where14 the elder and disabled is worthless.15 We have to ask this question to16 ourselves.	We have to ask where are we going to17 and it's important that we take care of our18 elderly and it's important that we take care of19 the property member who is working so hard, maybe20 one job and two jobs in order to provide his kids21 and his family with a better opportunity.	It is22 important that we take this into consideration.23 Thank you.24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 
2 MS. SONA FINK:	As one of the3 speakers pointed out before, World War II ended4 62 years ago, but I'm still here.5 Anti-rent stabilization advocates6 would like you to believe that a majority of7 middle class tenants, stabilized tenants are8 getting a free ride in apartments for which they9 could easily pay going market rates.10 In Metropolitan Life's Stuyvesant11 Town and Peter Cooper Village, where I have lived12 for 44 years, about three- quarters of the 11013 no-doorman buildings are still rent-stabilized.14 The rest, with bathrooms retiled and gussied-up15 kitchens boasting dishwashers, which we are not16 permitted, are now short- term first homes for17 young professionals or official housing for NYU18 students.19 Because rents for vacated apartments20 have quadrupled, a notably stable family-oriented21 community is being transformed into a22 non- community of transients.23 Met Life built these developments as24 moderate income housing for veterans returning25 from World War II.	Many of those vets or their2 
2 surviving spouses, of which I am one, are still3 here.4 We retired twenty or more years ago5 after foolishly putting our kids through college6 on our own money.	We live on income from savings7 accumulated in 1950s, 1960s and 1970s salaries at8 today' s pitiful interest rates. Social Security9 adds $12,000 or so a year and some fortunate10 people have modest pensions.11 I have two neighbors with incomes12 below $20,000 and a number around $30,000, but13 most older residents live $35,000 to $45,000 and14 after taxes, stunning medical and dental bills15 and such, are able to pay bus, train or airfare16 to visit the kids, go to theater and concerts in17 non-premium seating and perhaps take a trip from18 time to time.	We live and sleep - - shop19 carefully and ride public transportation.20 Of the younger rent-stabilized21 tenants, a large proportion is made up of22 second-generation residents who have followed23 their parents into the Police and Fire24 Departments, nursing, and teaching.25 Some are able to afford, against all2 
2 rules of current custom, to have one member of a3 couple actually stay at home in place of a nanny4 to raise their young children.5 Nine out of ten of us would have our6 annual incomes swallowed by rent if we were faced7 with having to pay Met Life' s advertised market8 rates "starting at" in last week New York Times9 ad 2,550 for a one-bedroom in Stuyvesant Town and10 soaring to well - -11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap12 up.13 MS. SONIA FINK:	- - over $4,50014 I'm almost there - - for the two-bedroom15 apartments in which many of us raised or are16 raising our families .17 The increases you members of the RGB18 - - I'm sorry, you make me nervous.19 The increases the members of the RGB20 are considering today terrify me and my21 neighbors.	We' re too rich for SCRIE and too poor22 to absorb the $50-per-room-per month MCI's that23 keep coming at us and are folded into the24 increases you grant .25 Most of us haven't a clue as to2 
2 where we might go if we are priced out of our3 homes.4 Please consider the quality of the5 many lives you will be changing when you make6 your decision on raising our rents yet again.7 Thank you.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sheila Stower.11 Hold on one second, Sheila.12 Sheila Stower is 90 - - is the third13 speaker.14 Sheila Stower;15 Martin Smith; and16 Ricardo Gotia.17 Mr. Gotia is number 86.18 Go ahead, Sheila.19 MS. SHEILA STOWER:	My name is20 Sheila Stower.	And I work as a tenant organizer21 at the West Side SRO Law Project at the Riverside22 Community Center.23 I am one of 2.5 million rent24 stabilized tenants whose pockets are being picked25 and I'm here as a single room occupancy tenant9 
2 citywide.3 In 2002 the median income for SRO4 tenants was $9,680, the equivalent of $806 per5 month.	Legally defined affordable rent at this6 level is approximately $260 per month.	However7 the reality is that SROs tenants pay a much8 higher percentage of their limited income than9 most other tenants.10 As you ask the SRO tenants how much11 rent they pay, please pay attention to what there12 is, more than $260.	Also pay attention to the13 fact that in 2002 of SRO tenants, 65 percent made14 less than $50,000 year and 48,000 were below the15 poverty line.	Even a two percent increase is16 disproportionally a burden on these tenants.17 As my mom says, as another rent18 stabilized tenant, you can't get blood from a19 turnip.20 Certainly if landlords of SROs can't21 pay taxes, fuel bills, or keep their buildings in22 code as required by law, then they shouldn't buy23 the buildings and should allow others with the24 commitment to the rent stabilization who can25 afford to own the building to safeguard our2 
2 homes.3 The implication that all existing4 landlords of rent stabilized housing are not5 slumlords and that some demon landlord will6 replace angelic, current landlords is false7 especially for SRO landlords. We'd rather have8 SRO landlords who are committed to quality, safe,9 affordable housing in some of the City' s most10 vulnerable that a landlord was more	concerned11 with the perpetuation of generational wealth.12 In this debate today of13 profitability versus affordability, or14 gentrification versus homelessness, where is the15 onslaught of SRO landlords asking for rent16 increases and therefore, what is the17 justification or providing increases to these18 landlords.19 Perhaps it is because the SRO20 landlords don't need them.	From what we've21 observed they certainly have their money to22 attempt to buy out tenants, do illegal work often23 as a form as harassment, initiate false24 demolition plans also as a means to harassing25 tenants, refuse rents, pay to evict tenants and2 
2 often own more than one building .3 This is often source not only from4 their other businesses, but also from5 overcharges, transient rentals, neglected code6 violations or MDs and savings and fuel costs for7 not providing heat in the winter months and8 rapidly resorting to individual metering.	Will9 tenants be compensated for their gas, electric10 and other fuel costs? Landlords of SROs often11 resort to other destabilization tactics such as12 IRS fraud, refusal to register rents with low and13 overcharged tenants, create holdovers for14 evictions and other forms of harassment.15 SRO landlords are claiming poor, yet16 how are they able to afford MCis that convert to17 single family homes, apartments and illegal18 hotels?19 More and more often tenants are20 struggling to find affordable housing that21 landlords would rather refuse rent deregulators22 as the cost of doing business. These landlords23 cannot be rewarded for costs they are not24 incurring.25 Given the plague of illegal2 
2 transient rentals by SRO landlords, subjecting3 tourists, students and corporations to the same4 horrifying conditions faced by us early tenants,5 there is no way these criminals can cry for. They6 can't have it both ways.7 The New York Times reported that the8 Mayor admitted that homelessness was never on his9 radar for his first term and pledged to reduce10 homelessness by two thirds by 2009. The Mayor11 also said that 2006 State of City address said12 that housing would be a priority for this term13 with an emphasis affordability.	His quote was,14 we all share the goal of building and preserving15 more affordable housing in New York City.16 Well, I say to the mayoralty17 appointed Rent Guidelines Board, only a zero18 percent for SRO tenants for New York City.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 (Audience participation.)21 MS. SHEILA STOWER:	Thank you.22 I also wanted to leave a pictorial23 about the conditions faced by SRO tenants.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Fine.	Give it25 to our staff.2 
2	(Audience participation.)3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Martin Smith for4 Councilman Robert Jackson? Are you here?5 And then followed by Ricardo Gotia;6 And then Earnestine Temple.7 Mr. Smith.8	MR. MARTIN SMITH:	Thank you very9	much.10 Good afternoon, Members of the11 Board. Good afternoon, brothers and sisters. Good12 to see you all.13 I'm going to read some testimony on14 behalf of Councilman Robert Jackson.15 "I am here to urge you to deny16 landlords request for an increase in rents.17 According to the testimony taken by this Board18 earlier in this week, the average rent in New19 York City is already $900.00 per month - and many20 of my constituents pay significantly more than21 this for small apartments in very poorly22 maintained buildings.23 I am aware that there has been an24 increase in fuel costs and that this has cut into25 the profits of many landlords, but this increase10 
2 has affected businesses and industries all over3 the country.	I ask you: Should tenants be made4 to bear the brunt of these costs? We say no.5 What proportion of the costs will6 the owners bear?	There have been many requests7 over many years to create a less subjective and8 one-sided basis for determining rent increases.9 There is no - - this is so important for us as a10 City because while rent has steadily increased,11 our residents' ability to pay lags far behind.12 Year after year, many tenants pay an13 ever greater proportion of their take home pay on14 housing costs.	And while many landlords become15 richer and even more powerful, tenants see a16 steady decline in their standard of living.17 They suffer, work two jobs, are18 unable to provide anything more that the very19 basics for their children and many of them go20 hungry or face eviction.21 In my office, we are seeing an ever22 increasing number of working people needing23 public assistance to pay their rent and our food24 pantries can't provide enough food for many25 people who are in need.2 
2 Year after year, landlords come to3 the Rent Guidelines Board crying poverty, even in4 the face of tax abatements and other programs5 designed to help them defray the costs of6 maintaining their buildings, including MCI rent7 increases.	Yet in five years, I have never seen8 a landlord come to my office looking for help9 because he or she is losing their home because of10 high costs.11 (Audience participation.)12 MR. MARTIN SMITH:	Let the landlords13 submit their books for auditing to justify their14 need for rent increases.15 (Audience participation.)16 MR. MARTIN SMITH:	Just as they17 require prospective tenants to prove their18 ability to pay rent.	Let there - - let there be19 transparency on all sides.20 Members of the Board, stop21 across- the-board rent increases.	Make the22 landlords open their books and prove their need.23 We cannot allow the working class and the working24 poor to be driven further into poverty because of25 excessive housing costs.	You have a2 
2 responsibility to create an equitable system that3 protects tenants and not just landlords.4	No increases in 2006.5 (Audience participation.)6 MR. MARTIN SMITH:	I have a copy7 of the testimony available if you want .8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 Any questions?10 Thank you11 Sorry.	Adriene, go ahead.12 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you for13 testimony this afternoon. Tell the councilmember14 that I appreciate his time.15 In regards to the neighborhoods that16 councilman represents, what are you seeing are17 the vacant rents or the available units rent for18 those units?19 MR. MARTIN SMITH:	For one bedroom,20 Ms. Holder, the average is between 850 and 900.21 Any other questions?22 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Yes.23 Are you seeing a lot of the units24 become deregulated in your neighborhood?25 MR. MARTIN SMITH :	If you're talking10 
2 about have landlords been pushing tenants out to3 increase their apartment stock by raising4 apartment rents beyond 2000, yes.	There are many5 apartments being lost to vacancy decontrol .6 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	What is the7 councilmember 's view about the Urstadt Law?8 MR. MARTIN SMITH:	We are very much9 in favor of its repeal.	We have been working10 (Audience participation.)11	MR . MARTIN SMITH :	- - along with12 other citywide organization and issues .	We feel13 that they are also in favor overhauling the 421 A14 tax abatements and other incentives that15 landlords have been given so that they are better16 focused and better delivery agents for our17 constituents.18 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	When it comes to19 other things that can happen in terms of let's20 say building of affordable or rezoning, what is21 the councilmember	what are his opinions about22 those issues?23 MR. MARTIN SMITH:	I'm sorry.	Can24 you repeat the first part.25 DIRECTOR HOLDER :	When it comes to12 
2 issues around rebuilding of affordable housing or3 zoning issues or rezoning issues in New York4 city, what' s the Council Member working on around5 those issues in here in New York?6 MR. MARTIN SMITH :	First and7 foremost we are working on preservation.	That' s8	our number one goal.	Then second, we are asking9 and looking to finds ways and means to do more10 affordable housing .	And by affordable the11 councilman' s is very clear, he' s not talking12 about the national standard of affordability,13 he' s talking about affordability that' s14 reflective of the constituents in our district,15 people who make $25,000 or $30,000, people with16 middle income.17 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	In terms of the18 new housing that is being developed by the City19 right now, what are you finding is the definition20 of affordable for those units?21 MR. MARTIN SMITH:	Unfortunately22 it's not a good reflection in most cases of the23 reality of the income levels of people who are24 indigenous to the district so there are a lot of25 people who are being priced out .9 
2	Any other questions?3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 MR. MARTIN SMITH:	Thank you.5 (Audience participation.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ricardo Gotia;7 Followed by Earnestine Temple;8 Followed by Tom Diana;9 Followed by Ann Cunningham for10 Councilmember Gale Brewer.11 MR. RICARDO GOTIA:	Hello.	Thank12 the RGB for these hearings.13 My name is Richard Gotia.	I'm a14 housing organizer for Councilmember Palma in the15 South District, South East Bronx, excuse me, 18th16 Council District.	And I'm also a Crown Heights17 residents for three years.18 And the root and source of my19 testimony doesn' t lie in eliminating facts and20 figures that you've already gone over, but rather21 my experience as a young professional with a22 family moving to New York City.23 I personally work obviously in24 politics.	My wife is a free lance photographer.25 And kind of our experience trying to make it in a
2 City where if you can make it in New York City3 you can make it anywhere and I think that's more4 true today now than ever.5 We were - - we moved to Crown Heights6 in Brooklyn.	It was the only place we could find7 and afford. It was $1300 a month.	And we working8 at the time for a nonprofit organization.	My9 wife being a free lance photographer, we were10 paying roughly about 40 to s o  percent of our11 income to our rent.12 Within two years we were priced out13 of our apartment.	It went up to $1400 a month.14 We simply couldn't absorb the cost .	And our15 landlord warned us that if the rent - - she16 promised us it would continue increasing about17 four percent a year which is an unregulated18 apartment, second story, kind of makeshift one19 bedroom in a brownstone which is typical for a20 lot of young people moving to the City.21 It was far from ideal.	My wife22 didn' t feel comfortable coming home after dark.23 And we were - - we couldn't absorb the rent.	And24 to be quite frank we were thinking about moving25 out of the city because we could not afford the2 
1	3782	location over the cost of living.3	It was a fortuitous event.	We were4 able to find a stabilized apartment that cost5 roughly about 825 a month. It was very unlike the6 event of know of many people who search for years7 for stabilized apartments.	I deal as a housing8 advocate for Councilmember Palmer in the9 southeast east Bronx.10 These are my personal opinions, this11 testimony does not reflect the Councilwoman' s12 opinions.13 People search for months for rent14 stabilized apartments, sometimes for years and15 they can never find them. So because I was able16 to find this apartment, I was able to stay in New17 York City and maintain my job as an housing18 advocate.	And I provide services such as19 helping seniors with joining the SCRIE OR tenant20 eviction prevention; teaching parents how to go21 to Housing Court.22 Right now we're organizing about23 five Mitchell- lama buildings in our district.24 We're organizing tenants in those buildings to25 help them maintain their affordable housing.
2	And basically none of these services3 could be provided if I wasn' t given the4 opportunity to have affordable housing in New5 York City.	And I think this is that case we face6 here.	A lot of young, motivated, intelligent7 people aren't able to afford the cost of living8	here, and they simply choose not - - they choose9	to live other places. I think nothing more10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap11 up.12 MR. RICARDO GOTIA:	- - clearly13 demonstrates that that the fact the City will14 currently be spending millions of dollars a year15 on housing subsidies for New York city teaching16 fellows.	It's the only way they can encourage17 professionals.	And many served the positions,18 teachers, quite honestly, social service workers.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap20 up.21 MR. RICARDO GOTIA:	- - wouldn' t be22 able to afford to live here and provide the basic23 services that our City needs to function.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 (Audience participation.)10 
1	3802 MR. RICARDO GOTIA:	And one more3 thing, I want to make a statement in support for4 Home Rule.	And if you are going to vote on5 increases, please consider provisions or6	provisos.	A rent increase simply won 't work for7	us.8	Thank you.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .10	(Audience participation. )11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Earnestine12 Temple, is that you?13 MS. EARNESTINE TEMPLE:	Yes.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Great.15 Followed by Tom Diana;16 Ann Cunningham for Councilmember17 Gail Brewer;.18 And then Eilyanna Kaiser for19 Assemblymember Richard Gottfried.20 Go ahead.21 MS. EARNESTINE TEMPLE:	Good22 afternoon, Board Members, neighbors.23 My name is Earnestine Temple, I'm24 here as a rent stabilized tenant.25 I live at 706 Riverside Drive, which12 
2	is a Pinnacle building, which the landlord a year3	ago said it's valued at $56 million.	It4 frightened me through my socks.5 I work for Assemblyman Herbert Danny6 Farrell and this is my testimony.7 Assemblyman Farrell' s testimony will8 be forthcoming.9 It scared me and it scared many of10 my neighbors who are maybe 90 percent senior, 7011 years and older who are rent control.	The12 landlord then said that my seven room apartment13 was valued at $1.3 million.14 We have at, 706, 110 electricity.15 You cannot iron and use the microwave without16 smelling oil which then you have a burst of smoke17 and then your lights go out.18 There are times during the month,19 and we should be happening soon, where the20 electrical services are so bad that parts of the21 building go in darkness when they're using too22 many electrical appliances.23 Landlords should understand,24 especially greedy landlords, that the world is25 built for all of us, well -off people, seniors,4 
2 students, working class, everything cannot be3 decontrolled, it cannot be.4 (Audience participation.)5	MS. EARNESTINE TEMPLE:	We need to6 live in this City also, as great as it is.	I'm7 honored to share this with you.8 Buildings on 145th Street from Lenox9 Avenue going to Riverside Drive are all being10 built condominium, $500,000 and better.11 At 129th Street, right out my back12 door, 48 units, $700,000.	My job reflects that I13 serve your families, the families behind me. I14 can't afford that.	I want to stay in New York.15 I've lived here all my life. I'm committed to16 advocacy.17 Please take all of that into18 consideration and reconsider any increase.19 I am in support of the repeal of the20 Urstadt Law.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 (Audience participation.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Tom Diana.24 MR. TOM DIANA:	Hi.25 Another year and you get lost in the6 
2 rhetoric.	You make detailed reports of what3 apartments cost down to the penny and then you4 forget about it out as soon a penny makes up a5 heart well story.6 These Brooklyn apartments are7 costing us $1200 real dollars a month in long8 term basic maintenance.	The gas company wants9 real money for my $7000 gas bill. After the10 terrorist attacks the insurance companies simply11 doubled my insurance costs.	The next year12 insurance bill will be $5000 in real money.13 Basic big building materials have14 doubled and tripled in the last two years in real15 money.	The last bathroom I renovated cost me the16 equivalent of two years rent from the tenant,17 $14,000 in real money.	Most of it I will never18 see a meaningful return.19 You should listen to the tenants but20 listen to what they say, not what they want you21 to hear.	Ask the basic question of the tenants22 and the politicians.	Ask every senior how big23 their apartment is and how much they pay in real24 rent money.	Do not accept the convoluted story25 that it is half of their government paycheck,2 
2 their pension check or a monologue of what they3 can't afford.	What are they actually paying.4 You will find all of the seniors5 paying significantly less then the basic $12006 cost of the apartment to the landlord.	4250 a7 month, 119 a month, 156 a month, $97 a month is a8 cable TV bill.	It is not recommended for a9 apartment that costs a landlord $1200 a month.10 Seniors are all poor and starving11 yet year - -12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quite.14 MR. TOM DIANA:	Seniors are all poor15 and starving yet year after year I cannot seem to16 give away half the applications for SCRIE.	I've17 brought these things down every year.	I brought18 down a big pile and nobody seems to want them or19 nobody seems to, you know, have a reason for20 them. I don't understand it. I have a whole stock21 here. No seniors want them.22 Ask why are they not eligible for23 SCRIE, every time a tenant's life falls apart the24 landlord picks up the pieces.	It is not our25 fault that tenants get drunk and beat each other2 
2 up twice a week.	It is not our fault that they3 get pregnant from a one night stand. It is not4	our fault	it is not our fault they are5 abandoned by their kids.	Let' s stop the stories6 and use real numbers and we know where we are .7 We should not be taking hundreds of8 dollars away a month in services away from9 tenants who are paying their fair share above the10 $1200 a month cost to support long term11 freeloaders. Let those sponge off their kids. We12 shouldn't have to paying for this and you should13 be asking better questions.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ann Cunningham for17 Councilmember Gale Brewer.18 (Audience participation .)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS.

2 My name is Gale Brewer and I3 represent City Council District 6, which4 encompasses the Upper West Side and the northern5 part of Clinton in Manhattan.6 I am proud to represent this7 district with the second largest stock of8 rent-regulated apartments in the City of New9 York.10 The seniors and the families of my11 district rely on rents remaining affordable so12 that they may continue to live in the13 neighborhood that they call home.14 You have heard from many tenants and15 tenant advocate groups and I am here today to16 echo their sentiment.17 We all are - - we suffer from a18 housing affordability crisis. Due to the rent19 hikes of the last few years and to a shrinking20 number of rent controlled and stabilized21 apartments and an extremely tight housing market,22 financial hardship is widespread among23 rent-stabilized tenants.24 Incomes of rent stabilized tenants25 went down while rents went up.	Between 2002 and2 
2 2005 stabilized rents rose by over eight percent3 while incomes for stabilized tenants went down by4 8.6 percent.5 Tenants are paying high rent burdens6 in a shrinking supply of affordable regulated7 apartments and the City has no power to change8 the housing policies that are making this9 situation worse.	Needless to say, I believe that10 the City of New York needs Home Rule over rent11 and eviction protections .12 In 1970, the average tenant13 household paid twenty percent of income for rent.14 Today, the average household pays over 31 percent15 of their income for rent .	Nearly 29 percent of16 City tenants devote over half their incomes to17 rent, the highest figure ever.18 The State legislature weakened the19 rent laws several times in the 1990's and again20 in 2003.	These changes have made it easier for21 landlords to raise rents. The combination of high22 vacancy allowances, preferential rents and the23 four year rule has meant that tenants all over24 the City cannot find a vacant, affordable rent25 stabilized apartment when they need to move.
2 Since the first - - the first RGB3 change in 1993 - -4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You're never going5 to make it.	Ann, you're never going to make it6 with this full statement so you want to summarize7 somewhere about what her position is?8 We have the full statement.9	MS. ANN CUNNINGHAM:	Close to10 17,000 units were lost through coop/condo11 conversion.12 Over 1,700 units were lost through13 tax abatement expirations and substantial rehabs;14 Over 9,000 units were lost through15 high rent/vacancy decontrol.16 Let' s talk about the Mitchell-Lama17 quite a bit about that which we know about.18 Single room occupancy building are19 also mentioned.20 In general - -21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Read the third22 from last paragraph.23 MS. ANN CUNNINGHAM:	That' s what I24 was going to.25 In general, regarding owners, the10 
2 2004 Income and Expense data showed net operating3 incomes increased from 37.8 to 38 percent and4 mortgage lenders reported to the RGB that they5 had not experienced many foreclosures.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes . Well, I'll7 read the paragraph before that.8 Support should be given to the - -9 this is from the Councilwoman.10 Support should be given to New11 Yorkers who need it most.	As inflation rises,12 real incomes drop, and the number of rent13 stabilized units and rent controlled units14 continue to decrease.15 I urge the Rent Guidelines Board not16 NOT, capitalize, to raise rents for 2006.17 Thank you.18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ann, we have a20 question.21 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Yes.	I just22 happen to lived in the area that she represents23 and very rarely do I disagree with her, but I did24 hear in her statement she says tenants are paying25 higher rent burdens in a shrinking supply of2 
2 affordable, regulated apartments and the City has3 no power to change the housing policies that are4 making the situation worse.5 I don 't want you to answer this on6 the spot, but if you would take back to7 councilwoman Brewer that we would like to hear8 her thinking about using the enforcement agencies9 of the City with regard to violations in these10 houses and that a rent increase would be11 predicated on a unit not having any violations12 MS. ANN CUNNINGHAM:	She adds13 we are thinking about legislation.	We have a14 task force for legislation for turning the SRO15 and residential apartments .	And also there' s16 other types of legislation that the Councilmember17 is working on in committee.18 As you know, we don't have Home Rule19 so we understand that your power is limited and20 you can only function in a certain capacity .21 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Right.	What I'm22 asking for though is not new legislation, but to23 take a closer look at the authority that is24 already within City agencies so that we don't25 have units coming up with fifty violation, a 1002 
2	violations, and that sort of thing.3	MS . ANN CUNNINGHAM:	Okay.4 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Thank you .5 (Audience participation.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 Eliyanna Kaiser.8	MS . EILYANNA KAISER:	I'm here9	representing Assemblymember Richard Gottfried.10 I'll read	he statement or a11 apartments of it.12 " ...the proposed increases are13 unjustified and would make life harder for all14 New Yorkers .	This past - - last year, this Board15 approved a two to four and one half percent16 increase for one-year leases and a four to seven17 percent increase for two-year leases.	Those18 increases were already large and tenants are19 struggling as a result.20 I oppose this year's proposal and21 urge that the Board reject them .22 On SROs.	Any SRO rent increase is23 unsupportable.	As anyone who has witnessed the24 conditions of most SRO housing knows, it is25 housing of last resort.	For a person with a low10 
2 income, even a small increase could mean the3 difference between being on the street or being4 in a one's own room .5 Last year, the Board approved a rent6 increase range of zero to two. While it is good7 to see that the Board again has a range that8 begins with zero, the Board should not approve9 any SRO rent increase in order to protect10 vulnerable housing for those who need it most,11 and who can least afford to pay.12 In past years, the RGB justified13 high, permanent rent increases in rents by citing14 unusual temporary price surges in the Price Index15 of Operating Costs. This year, rising fuel costs16 are being cited as a hardship.17 But as a result of the past18 increases, the current rents are already well19 above landlords costs.	If costs have gone up20 they now only beginning to catch up with21 unwarranted increases from the past.22 (Audience participation.)23 MS. EILYANNA KAISER:	The Board24 should be enacting a rent freeze this year, or at25 the very least, dramatically scaling back its2 
2 proposed increases.	If the Board does adopt rent3 increases, it should adopt a narrow spread rather4 than institute a "longevity tax" on long-term5 tenants.6 There' s a paragraph I'm not going to7 read in full because of the time about why the8 Price Index is not a very good model for9 measuring change .10 I am aware of the needs and concerns11 of small property owners, many of whom work hard12 to accommodate tenants.	But only buildings with13 more than five apartments are subject to rent14 regulation laws.15 Data from the New York City16 Department of Finance and from recent real estate17 studies suggest that ownership of rent- stabilized18 buildings is rather profitable.19 Any straightforward analysis of20 landlord and tenant incomes makes the case for21 much lower rent increases .22 According to the most recent Housing23 and Vacancy Survey (2005), the median income for24 rent-stabilized households is in decline.25 Rent- stabilized households earned an average of2 
2 $32,000 a year, that' s 2004 figures, an eight and3 one half percent decline from 2001 when it was 4	$35,000 a year.5 These households pay a third of6 their pre- tax income in rent and over a quarter7 pay at least half of their income.8 Before you approve these increases,9 please think about what it means to take so much10 money from a poor family, especially children.11 The reality is that low-income12 families don't have money to spare.	When you13 take money out of their pockets, you make their14 lives harder and shorter.15 The number of families sleeping in16 City shelters has doubled since the mid 1980s.17 Tenants are paying high rents in a shrinking18 market of housing and these housing policies are19 making it worse.20 Every administrative body that21 oversees New York City housing issues has a22 responsibility to tell Albany where they stand on23 the call to repeal the Urstadt Law and return24 Home Rule to the City.25 (Audience participation.)
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And why is that?3 Why is that?4 MS. EILYANNA KAISER:	Because - -5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Because why?6 MS. EILYANNA KAISER:	Sir7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Because you say8 so?9 (Audience participation .)10 MS . EILYANNA KAISER :	I can answer .11	Sir, would you like me to12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure, answer it.13 MS. EILYANNA KAISER :	I can handle14 things alone.	Thanks.15 The answer to that is because you're16 overseeing rents and housing for New York City17 and so when there is an issue of political18 significance, as an administrative body you have19 a responsibility to be part of the process and to20 see what am I seeing here as an administrative21 official .	What am I	what am I viewing year,22 after year after year .	You have a responsibility23 to report that to people in power because there24 are changes that could be made if we hear from25 people such as yourself, that New York City would12 
2 benefit from having control over how polices are3 made.4 He's an elected official in Albany5 who sees what happens in Albany.	And if people6 in the City, right here like yourself, don't tell7 people what' s going on, he' s only one voice and8 that's just not right.	We need City' s help on9 this.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	He's an11 Assemblyman who has power, we do not. We12 adjudicate and administer a law, that' s all we13 do. We disagree.14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Finish your16 statement.	You didn' t totally finish.17 MS. EILYANNA KAISER:	I think we're18 done, sir.	Thank you.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have a22 question.23 Go ahead, Adriene.24 MS. EILYANNA KAISER:	It's really25 okay.
2 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you for3 your testimony and thank the Assemblyman.	I know4 he' s busy up in Albany this next week.5 When you think about your6 neighborhood and the folks who come in to your7 constituency office, what are they major issues8 that they are bringing to folks in regards to9 their housing?10 MS. EILYANNA KAISER:	Sorry, this11 is slipping.12 I would say that probably about half13 the people that walk into our office with a14 housing issue are coming because they're looking15 for affordable housing.	We get the, like I'm16 sure all the other offices do, the notices for17 construction or apartments that are coming18 available that are affordable.19 As you know, many, many more people20 apply for those then there are actually space21 available.	We've got some people, I just22 actually spoke to one woman this afternoon, she's23 been coming into our office for a year and a24 half.	She sends the post cards gets the25 applications, puts them in.	She's living in a2 
2 shelter.	And she, you know, she makes a little3 over $20,000 a year and it's been a year and a4 half and she's had no luck yet.	So we have a lot5 of poeple like that.6 I mean the other part of it is7 certainly decontrol and tenant harassment.	You8 know, this whole issue, which I'm sure you've9 heard a lot of it, today and every other day10 you're doing this hearing is tenant harassment11 and the vacancies and the loss of stabilized12 units.13 So those are the two big pieces.14 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	What would you15 say has been your experience with trying to help16 seniors get SCRIE through the Department of17 Aging.18 MS. EILYANNA KAISER:	We've had good19 experiences with that.	You know, we found20 occasionally an application will get lost, a21 phone call usually corrects that.22 We have a lot of tenants.	I was23 surprised at what a previous speaker said.	They24 come into our office specifically asking for help25 getting on to SCRIE and fighting and, you know,2 
2 we certainly help process a lot of that3 paperwork.4 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And when it5 comes to trying to deal with overcharge issues or6 harassment issues DHCR, what has been your7 experience with that agency?8	MS. EILYANNA KAISER:	My experience9 with DHCR is that there' s a bunch of very10 wonderful individuals there that I personally11 like, but that the agency itself is very12 frustrating; that very little gets accomplished13 and that they significant problems obeying their14 own rules and enforcing their own rules.	And we15 have that experience - -16 (Audience participation.)17 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And one last18 question, thank you.19 What about the ability to get20 repairs or conditions addressed in the buildings,21 apartments for tenants?22MS. EILYANNA KAISER:Through DHCR,23HPD or?24DIRECTOR HOLDER:Or any means.25MS. EILYANNA KAISER:Through any
2	means?	Well, you know, certainly it's always an3	uphill battle.	There are significant problems4 with , you know, repair unit issues.	We get a lot5 of it .	If it's DHCR, it's much more frustrating .6 The Department of Buildings, you know, will come7 and do inspections and that' s good, but sometimes8 things get cured, you know, relatively easily and9 there can be long term issues that you have to10 have keep constant attention to .	And it's not11 it's not a simple matter for the long term12 issues.	The short terms things are very - -13 usually they're easily fixed.14 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	What about with15 HPD or through courts with the HPD parts?16 MS. EILYANNA KAISER :	Through HPD17 actions you mean or?	HPD actions are really18 difficult to help tenants with.	You know,19 there' s a lot that goes on in Housing Court, it's20 a broken system, we all know that .21 (Audience participation .)22 MS . ELIYANNA KAISER :	And it's23 very, very, difficult for tenants to be able to24 get to together and stay organized and explain to25 a judge you know , what' s going on in the4 
2 buildings and have the violations to back it up.3 And then it's not the easiest4 possible thing.	I've seen very little success5 and they're having some great successes.6 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	What about HPD?7 MS. EILYANNA KAISER:	With HPD?8 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Yes, in terms of9	tenant complaints and trying to get violations10 corrected.11 MS. EILYANNA KAISER:	I mean if12 you're bar is DHCR they're golden, but, you know,13 it's - - they're	it's not necessarily the best14 run system.15 MS. EILYANNA KAISER:	Thanks.16 (Audience participation.)17 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Am I18 understanding you correctly that the agencies19 that have responsibility for enforcing things20 that are already on the books are not doing it21 and that getting them to do it is not the way?22 MS. EILYANNA KAISER:	That' s23 absolutely true.	And I'm sure you've heard that24 from other people.	I'm sure it's not a news25 flash. I mean it's - - yeah, they're definitely10 
2 not enforcing the rules that already exist.	And3 it is very, very difficult to bring enough4 attention for more than a quarter of a second to5 get problems solved.6 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	And it's the view7 of your office that rather than move for8 enforcement with people who already have the9 mandate to do that, it's better to do something10 else?11	MS. EILYANNA KAISER:	No, both are12 necessary.	You know, we absolutely need better13 enforcement from agencies.	And we regularly14 we'll write letters to agencies, call15 commissioners, sit down with agencies and talk16 about enforcement problems.17 There are other changes that we'd18 like to see.	We'd like to see the Urstadt Law19 repealed.	You know, we believe that the rent20 increases aren't justified, et cetera et cetera21 but, you know, yes, enforcement has to happen at22 the same time.	It is really unfortunate that a23 lot of energy is spent sitting down with agencies24 and reminding them what their responsibilities is25 and asking them to do better at enforcing what is12 
2	already the law.3 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Thank you very4 much.5 MS. ELIYANNA KAISER:	Thank you very6 much.7 And thank you for your comment, Mr.8 Chairman.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' re going to10 move one speaker out of order here.11 We have Manhattan Borough President12 Scott Singer next.13 MAN. BOR. PRES. STRINGER:	Stringer?14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS.	Stringer . Excuse16 me.17 Sorry for the mix-up.18 MAN. BOR. PRES. STRINGER:	You know,19 Mr. Chairman, I just got to tell you, I had been20 in Albany for thirteen years so I always miss21 these meetings, you know, we send a22 representative.	But for you to be rude to that23 woman who did such a good job.24 (Audience participation.)25 MAN . BOR. PRES. STRINGER:	I know10 
2 you're doing this a long time, but that' s just3 unacceptable behavior.	And, you know, you really4 should have to apologize, but that' s up to you.5 Bullies are bullies.6 Okay. So I'm here to tell the annual7 Rent - - the annual Rent Guidelines Board meetings8 I think have become very predictable and quite9 dismaying: Every year residents and advocates10 come to hear that rents are going up.11 Rent increases, I think should not12 be the default action of every meeting of the13 Rent Guidelines Board, yet they are par for the14 course.	Even as vacancy rates remain dangerously15 low, over- crowding numbers nearly double, and the16 net income of landlords are going up.17 And what you're basically creating18 is a Borough in Manhattan and the City for the19 very, very, very wealthy, with enclave for the20 poor and nothing in between.21 You are hollowing out, as told in22 The New York Times, the middle class, forcing23 them to leave and for what?	Profits are up.24 Things are doing well .25 A recent report by the Furman Center
2 states, "In the past three years, the combination3 of falling real incomes and rising rents has4 significantly increased the burden housing costs5 impose upon City's households, especially those6 households earning incomes paid by the workforce7 that staff the City's Police force and other8 basic services. "9 Do we really want a City of the very10 rich with enclaves for the poor? That's the path11 we're on and you're doing it.12 Some landlords claim that their13 pockets are becoming thin, that rising fuel costs14 and real estate taxes warrant significant15 increases in rent.	But according to a report by16 Tim Collins, the former staff of the Rent17 Guidelines Board, 38 cents of every dollar18 collected by landlords goes to net operating19 income.	The ratio is the same as nearly forty20 years ago.	And this is for an aging housing21 stock.22 In a normal market, owners would23 have seen a decline in income relative to the24 rent rolls.	Plus, with vacancy and luxury25 decontrol, we are seeing more buildings that are2 
2 a mix of rent- stabilized and free-market units,3 which means fewer buildings are solely dependent4 on rent rolls of rent-stabilized tenants.5 There is no question that landlords6 are making money, and plenty of it.	And Crain's7 has even noted that buying rent stabilized8 apartments is one of the better investments in9 New York City.10 So for these reasons I want to ask11 all of you to reconsider the higher increases12 proposed this year.13 We want to end this charade here.14 We do not want to keep coming here year after15 year.16 (Audience participation.)17 MAN. BOR. PRES. STRINGER:	Until18 tonight I always thought that you really listened19 to people, that you didn' t yell at people.	And20 I'm telling you right now, that you should look21 at the evidence, do a real analysis, stop the22 gamesmanship and the showmanship and try to23 protect the middle income people, the people who24 are the backbone of this City.25 The numbers are there.	The truth of
2 the matter is the real estate market is doing3 very well.	I'm someone who's actually not in an4 development.	We recognize that guidelines5 change.	All we' re asking you to do is keep the6 people in the City who we need, firefighters,7 police officers, teachers, poets, artists8 (Audience participation.)9 MAN. BOR. PRES. STRINGER:	You have10 power to do this and we ask you to seriously11 consider the testimony here tonight.12 If you have any questions, I'd be13 happy to answer them.14 (Audience participation.)15 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you,16 Borough President for coming down this afternoon.17 It is good seeing you here since you're no longer18 an Assemblyman that you're our Borough President.19 I appreciate you coming in.20 Could you tell me how you feel about21 Home Rule or the Urstadt Law.22 MAN. BOR. PRES STRINGER:	Good23 question.24 Well, I mean if we effected home25 rule under the Pataki regime we'd be a better2 
2 City for it .3 (Audience participation .)4	MAN. BOR . PRES. STRINGER:	We5 should have the opportunity to impose our own6 regulations .	It's an idea that has come . I hope7 that the next Governor will recognize that .8 I think that we have a wonderful9 opportunity to create our own rules of the game.10 We don' t need, quite frankly, legislators in11 Albany, who I served with for thirteen years,12 they're very nice people, but people who own cows13 and live on farms have no idea about the rent14 stabilization law .15 (Audience participation .)16 MAN. BOR . PRES. STRINGER :	So I17 think that Home Rule should determine the rent18 rule .	And what we've seen in Albany between19 vacancy decontrol, weakening of the rent laws,20 and I voted against it every single time, but21 that has not been the norm and we need never22 bring it back to the City.	It's probably the23 best thing we can do for tenants .24 And part of the way we do that.25 Adriene, as you know, is it 's not only about rent5 
2 stabilization or rent control, we see that the3 rents are going up in public housing.	We see4 that the Mitchell-Lama program is being brought5 out.	We have no way of just taking a deep6 breathe and saying, if it goes like this we're7 just going to lose hundreds of thousands of8 people.9 And some are saying and are friends10 in the landlord industry will always said, well,11 why do you need rent stabilization.	If you take12 off the control, the market will shake out. You13 know, there was always that - - I mean that14 intellectual discussion.15 We've had that discussion now .	We16 have lost over 100,000 affordable housing units17 since decontrol.	And what we found, what we18 found was that rents didn' t equalize, rents19 didn' t go down, rents keep going up .	When20 Bloomingdale work with Macy' s, we don' t gain21 jobs, we lose jobs, you know what I'm saying. So22 when we lift the controls, we lift - - the sky is23 the limit.24 We have people in Manhattan who are25 paying for one bedroom apartment rentals four to2 
2 ten to $15,000 a year - - I'm sorry, a month, a3 month.	Who can afford that?	Not even the top4 one percent wage earners can afford that.5 And why are we doing this, it makes6 no sense for the City.7 (Audience participation.)8 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	The speaker just9 before you said that the agencies that already10 have the legislation, already have the mandate11 for dealing with violations in all apartments,12 particularly these that we' re concerned about,13 are not doing their job - - hold on - - but it's a14 very difficult to expect that from them.15 When you talk to them, they say they16 don't have enough staff.	And so her suggestion17 was that yes, we continue to press on that, but18 we know that's not the way to work.19 And so my question with regard to20 Home Rule is, what about the things that we21 already have on the books that the State has not22 interfered with our enforcement that we are not23 enforcing which lead to some of the very bad24 living conditions that people in stabilized25 housing and other lower income housing or2 
2 moderate income housing.3 MAN. BOR. PRES. STRINGER:	Well,4 first of all, and I tend to speak with some5 experience.	I served on the Housing Committee in6 the legislature for thirteen years and I know a7 little bit about DHCR.8 It is a scandal, if it wasn't so9 serious.	It is a laughing stock agency. I happen10 to think we should take it apart.11 No tenant gets justice at DHCR.	No12 tenant	in fact, in some of the - - I never - - I13 didn't want to go DHCR. Take my chances in14 Housing Court.	You don' t want to go to that15 agency.	So as a result, there is no oversight.16 There is not monitoring of whether claims are17 justified.18 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	But they still have19 a mandate to do it, right.20 MAN. BOR. PRES. STRINGER:	But they21 don't it.	And the funding for DHCR that case22 management, well, the legislature and the23 Governor had never wanted to fund that agency. It24 hasn't been a priority.	And when you look at25 what's happening in even in New York City the2 
2 lack of HPD inspectors, the lack of building3 inspectors, this is an industry with no4 oversight.5 And when you look now at who has to6 pay the price for that in the form of higher7 rents and lack of services, it's the tenants.8 And, again, it's not just in rent stabilized9 buildings, look what' s happening in public10 housing.	we re asking tenants of public housing11 to pay additional fees and rents and the City12 response is, well, you know, we're not going to13 raise rents for everyone in public housing, just14 the rich tenants.	There are no rich tenants in15 public housing.	And yet we' re forcing them to16 bear the burden.17 Rent stabilization - - every time we18 raise the rents here we decontrol our apartments19 and we throw more people out of their20 neighborhood. What good is going to come from21 that.22 I believe that you have enough data,23 and we're going to submit tonight obviously, a24 much more deeper analysis of what we think the25 numbers are, that this guidelines Board should2 
2 just step back and just say, this is not the time3 to give the highest rent increase in fifteen4 years when we're in the midst of a housing5 crisis.	I mean what are you people thinking?6 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	I think you7 didn't understand my question.	And I'm talking8 about the existing9	MAN. BOR PRES. STRINGER:	It's okay.10 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	I have great11 respect for you.12 MAN. BOR. PRES. STRINGER:	No, I13 don't always understand the.14 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Which is why I15 asked you the question.16 But we have city departments with17 mandates to do certain things.	We' re very18 concerned about the enforcement of violations in19 apartments.20 MAN. BOR. PRES. STRINGER:	Okay, but21 then I don't understand.	I really don't - - you22 say that, but what' s the specific question I will23 try to answer?2 4	DIRECTOR ADAMS:	The question is25	if they are not already carrying out these
2 mandates, do you have anything in terms of how to3 get them to do or do we just forget that and4 start all over again?5	MAN. BOR. PRES. STRINGER:	No, no.6 I see where you're going with that.7 I would refer you to a report I did8 a number of years ago on the Buildings Department9 called "Total Collapse" where we documented,10 through Freedom of Information Request of the11 Buildings Department, the thousands and thousands12 of violations on buildings that were not13 corrected.14 I would ask you to go to that report15 that I was proud to author.	And to say to you16 that, no, the agencies are not dealing with this17 and your tenants are getting squeezed in the18 worst possible way.	And I think I know where19 you're going with this.20 There has to be a commitment to21 enforcement, to inspection, to oversight.	This22 has not - - this is no one's fault.	I think this23 has been going on for the last twenty years.	And24 the housing stock in some of our poorest25 neighborhood, are showing	are showing that6 
2 now.	Signs of decay.	But the tragedy is that3 rather than build and create infrastructure4 improvements, the first agenda is to get rid of5 the existing tenants who have had to endure some6 of that for many years.	And it's just not fair.7 We're asking them to leave.8	DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Let me just ask9	one more thing.10	(Audience participation.)11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.12 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	If we said that13 people in stabilized housing, land owners were14 not going to able to increase any rents because15 they had 25, 50, 100 or whatever number you want16 choose, violations against them, and if you were17 in violation, you cannot raise the rent.	That' s18 the - -19 (Audience participation.)20 MAN. BOR. PRES. STRINGER:	I'm21 sorry. Hold on.	Just say - - sorry. Where you22 going?23 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	I'm saying if24 there are agencies that already have the25 authority to be enforcement on many of these12 
2 things and they are not, and if we decided which,3 we have not, but if we decided that there would4	be no increases for landlords would had any5 number of violations against them - -6 MAN. BOR. PRES STRINGER:	Right.7 Yes.8 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	In other words, if9 those agencies are not going to use the10 enforcement power that they already have, I mean11 is there anything underway to get them to do that12 or should we just scrap that and start all over13 again?14 MAN. BOR. PRES. STRINGER:	Well, I15 tried to answer the question, you know, in five16 different ways.	I think it's a larger question17 and I won't take up anymore time.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank19 you, sir.20 MAN. BOR. PRES. STRINGER:	Thank21 you.22 (Audience participation.)2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker24 is Albert Scott;25 Followed by Alvaro Rodriguez;24

WILLIAM TURNER:	I'd like to say21 good afternoon to the RGB.	It's my first time22 here.2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Welcome.24 MR. WILLIAM TURNER:	I don't know a25 lot about politics and this situation, but what I24 
2 do know is that I can't afford these proposed3 rent hikes.4 I'm not middle class, I'm a street5vendorthat doesnot have a stable income.I'm6an SROcontinualtenant.7 My landlord is not the original8 landlord, he' s the landlord that has a commercial9 tenant in the building.	He had reconstruction.10 He brought in market rent tenants.	He' s doing11 fine.	He doesn't need money from me.	He's12 person that's - -	just yesterday I had to buy13 medical supplies.	They raised the prices on my14 medical supplies, my syringes, my test strips.15 When I go into Fairway, I'm unable to buy food.16 The prices are inflated.17 I don't know what to do.	I write18 it, I read, put it on the streets working.	I'm19 trying to write a book.	I'm trying to bring my20 life up.	I'm trying to improve it and I really21 don' t know what to do because I'm scared that I'm22 going to be on the streets because I can't afford23 these rent hikes.24 I realize that this is long meeting25 and I don't know if I'm out of place, but that' s7 
2 where I stand.	I'm paying over fifty percent of3 my income to rent and I don't what I'm going to4 do if I have an increase.5 I'm a diabetic and I don't want to6 live on the streets. I pay taxes as a vendor. I7 do everything I can do be politically and8 socially responsible, but still I'm hit with9	these	you know, if I'm going with these hikes10 every year, it doesn't make sense to me. I mean11 what do you want?	I mean how can people enter12 the middle class if they can't survive.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do you live in14 an SRO?15 MR. WILLIAM TURNER:	I live in an16 SRO, yes.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And does the SRO18 have many transient tourists units too?19 MR. WILLIAM TURNER:	Well, I tell20 you, before this new landlord came in every21 summer he was getting them.	I haven't paid a22 much attention now and just like I'm said, I'm a23 little woozy because I got this cut in my head24 and I'm trying to write fiction.25 But what I have seen is that it was10 
2 unoccupied for all the years, especially with the3 prior landlord so I don't know what's going on4 now, I can't say.5CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Okay.Thank you.6MR.

Loren, go ahead.21 MS. LOREN RENZ:	Good evening,22 Members of the Rent Guidelines Board.23 My name is Loren Renz. I'm going to24 tell you about my house - -25 VOICE:	Louder.12 
2MS. LOREN RENZ:Can you hear me3now?4I want to tellyou about my house on5 the Upper West Side. I've owned it for 26 years.6 It's my home and my only property.7 The house has seven stabilized units8 including three that have been continuously9 occupied for more than 25 years.10 Due to long-term tenancy, two-year11 leases, and more than a decade of low increases,12 the rents for these apartments, between $575 and13 $620 for one bedrooms are absurdly low for my14 neighborhood and for all of Manhattan.15 You know that these rents don't16 cover operating costs and you know also that the17 City charges much more for public housing.18 For years I've supported these low19 rents with my salary from another job and with20 income from the units that have experienced at21 least one turnover.22 I figured if I waited long enough, I23 would get back an apartment about every five24 years.	That was okay when costs rose gradually.25 But in the last four years, my taxes jumped5 
1	4232 $75,000, 45 percent.	My heat and electric bills3 skyrocketed.4 I've got my bills for you. I'm going5 to leave them with you.6 In January '02, gas heat cost 477 cents per therm; by Jan '05 it had almost doubled8 to 87 cents; by November it skyrocketed to $1.65,9 more than triple, and it stayed around $1.4010 throughout the heat season this year.11 In a single month, I paid more than12 a $1000 for heat alone. Electricity was seven13 cents a kilowatt hour in Jan '02.	Last November,14 it was twenty cents, or triple.15 I ask you to look at these real16 bills from a real small building.17 One last figure, or actually two,18 when I renewed my insurance last year, the19 premium shot up 27 percent.	And you may or may20 not know that we are now required, even in small21 houses like mine, to have the monthly inspection22 by the Fire Department.	I must hire a service to23 do this.24 They came in. It was $2000 in the25 initial inspection and $35 a month to maintain2 
2 it.	And in addition, DHCR requires that I have3 it inspected once a year, for which I pay $120 a4 year.5 So this is the kind of thing that6 we' re faced with that I hope you're putting in to7 your calculation and understanding how8 complicated it is for those of who really do try9 to abide by the rules and keep our housing in10 good shape .11 So what is a regulated owner to do?12 I, myself, have become increasingly frustrated by13 low rents, low increases, and really by failure14 to pass along skyrocketing costs when they15 happen, especially for two year leases.16 I ask you to impose a surcharge on17 the rents of long-term tenants until they cover a18 fair share of operating costs. I also ask you to19 vote for a nine percent increase on two-year20 renewals; a six percent increase for one year and21 to consider a retroactive surcharge for two-year22 leases taking effect since last October which had23 such a low increase compared to our rising24 expenses .25 Huge operating cost - -2 
1	4252	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Please wrap up.3	MS. LOREN RENZ:	- - increases4 cannot be born by owners alone.5 Please be fair.6 (Audience participation.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Kaytrue Ting for8 Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal.9 Would you indicate where the10 Assemblymember is from.11 MS. KAYTRUE TING:	Sure.12 Can you hear me?13 Good evening.14 I am here on behalf of15 Assemblymember Linda B. Rosenthal who represents16 the 67th Assembly District in Manhattan.17 The Upper West Side is home to18 thousands of rent- stabilized tenants for whom19 this issue is vitally important.	I urge you, in20 the strongest possible terms, to reject the rent21 increase proposals of three to 6.5 percent for22 one-year lease renewals and five to 8.5 percent23 for two-year lease renewals, and to freeze rents24 for these tenants this year.25 Year after year, the Rent Guidelines4 
2 Board has determined in favor of landlords,3 granting them higher and higher rents on4 stabilized apartments.	Given that the RGB has a5 statutory duty to consider the full economic6 situation of the real estate industry in7 determining these adjustments, this increase is8 unwarranted and inappropriate.9 The RGB' s determination of the10 economic situation is lopsided.	The proposal has11 not considered the host of methods that landlords12 use, both legally or illegally, to increase their13 revenues, and instead considers only the costs14 incurred.15 Costs for fuel and maintenance, from16 the speaker we just heard from, have risen, and17 these are important to take into account when18 determining whether or not a rent increase is19 justified.	However, landlords across the City,20 aided and emboldened by practically nonexistent21 oversight and enforcement from the Department of22 Housing and Community Renewal, DHCR, have an23 arsenal of ways to neutralize these costs through24 increased profits .25 Primary among these methods is2 
2 vacancy decontrol, which deregulates units when3 rent reaches $2,000 a month.4 Since 1997, when Governor Pataki and5 this landlord - - and a landlord lobby schemed to6 pass this law, landlords have aggressively pushed7 rents toward this mark.	State data indicates8 that 321 percent more units were deregulated in9 2005 than in 1998.	Once deregulated, landlords10 can generate exponentially more profit, in11 buildings in New York City with more than six12 units, unregulated rents are seven percent higher13 than regulated rents.14 To get to that $2,000 mark,15 landlords use a number of tricks. Chief among16 them is the highly abused system of Major Capital17 Improvements which permanently increase a18 tenant's rent, pushing them ever closer to $2,00019 a month.20 The DHCR, which administers MCis,21 allows landlords to flagrantly charge MCis to22 tenants with essentially no substantive review23 process.	Many constituents have come to the24 office telling of rents that have increased25 exorbitantly through multiple MCis in one year,2 
2 often for work that they believe is overcharged3 or completed shoddily.4 In order to these challenge MCis,5 tenants are required to go through the convoluted6 and expensive process of hiring engineers and7 experts to submit a request for DHCR inspections.8 In addition, landlords have also9 have began to engage in illegal practices,10 renting to tourists to SROs and apartment11 buildings and also the practice of phony12 demolitions.13 The Upper West Side, Clinton, and14 many other parts of the City are seeing a huge15 number of units being turned into condos and16 coops .	The result of this trend is that more and17 more housing that was once affordable to the18 middle class is becoming forever unattainable.19 And this is at a time when landlords are20 profiting dramatically.21 It is inconceivable to ask the22 tenants in this an ever-shrinking pool of23 affordable apartments to shoulder still more of24 the burden.25 The real estate industry sector in2 
2 2003 to 2004 saw one of the largest wage3 increases in the City of any job sector.	You4 know, we recognize that landlords in New York5 City engage - - not all of the landlords in New6 York City engage in these tenant-harassing7 practices, but the current calculation that the8 RGB is taking into account does not take account9 the profits that are being raked in.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you wrap up,11 please.12 MS. KAYTRUE TING:	Sure.13 The Assemblywoman is working on14 legislation which would current equalize this by15 requiring the Board to consider all sources of16 income earned by landlords from buildings with17 rent-regulated apartments, including the units in18 the buildings that are unregulated, as well as19 the retail stores are paying, which is incredibly20 high.21 And the legislation notes in22 particular that the RGB must consider the effects23 of these profits in offsetting any changes that24 occur.25 Lastly, she strongly urges you to2 
2 reject the proposed rent increases not only3 because they would harm thousands of new Yorkers4	by making housing unattainable, but also because5 it's your duty by law to consider the full6 economic situation.7	Right now, we need you to rework the8 numbers because frankly, the proposal doesn' t add9 anything.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 (Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Anya Borysenko;13 Followed by Joseph Kleinman; and14 Deacon Worrell.15 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Excuse me. I'm16 sorry. Was that testimony passed out to us?17 A VOICE:	What number are you up18 to?19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Kleinman is20 number 99.	He's a tenant.	He is the first,21 first non-preregistered tenant who showed up at22 9:35.	So it pays to preregister, okay.23 It also pays, in this case, to be a24 landlord because there aren't too many and then25 show up and because they' re not preregistered and8 
2 since we alternate, you can show up and still3 talk. But if you're a tenant, there' s a lot, a4 lot people ahead of you.5 Once again, Mr. Kleinman is the6 first non-registered tenant.7 Go ahead. Anya Borysenko.8 MS. ANYA BORYSENKO:	Good evening.9 I'm here to present the minority, I10 think the real minority.	I am an landlord, I11 hate to say it, it feels like a dirty word.	But12 I would like to present you as to where I come13 from and what difficulties I have.14 My mother and I both own this15 building.	My mother is an immigrant and she16 really had to scrape and really scrape in order17 to get anyplace.	And it was a very arduous18 journey.19 I, myself, am a retired teacher.	So20 my income is low, I say about 2000 and she has21 just a pension.22 And we have a four story building23 with many - - with three rentals with five rooms24 are $500 each.	Now, this makes it really almost25 impossible to pay the expense because it has10 
2	certainly risen so much within the last couple of3 years.	And whenever there is a law or there is4 an increase, it's so minimal that it's almost5 impossible.	Most of it goes either for taxes or6 other city kind water, or whatever so there7 practically is no income.8 As a matter of fact, at this point9 we haven't generated any at all.	If anything, it10 has come to the point where we might have to act.11 And I certainly do not endorse it or encourage12 my mother to use her pension or that I should use13 my pension in order to support this building.14 And I am very concerned because in a15 situation where affordable housing is getting an16 increase, we cannot, there is no way that we can17 even reach the affordable levels stage.	And I18 really think that it is not our duty to support19 the City in that respect or work for the City for20 free.	Everybody else gets a profit or gets21 something out of it.	We really don't.	If22 anything, we have some obnoxious tenants that do23 nothing but run around accusing us of harassment24 and other kinds of charges and discrimination,25 which have, at this point, been dismissed because10 
2 they are not fair and they' re not just and3 they' re basically lies.4 So I believe that I am a silent5 minority here because many people don't pay6 attention to us.	And I really think that at this7 point it is important to - - I'm not saying to8 make the rents incredibly high, but at least to9 increase it to the point where we can meet the10 expenses.	I think I shouldn't be displaced or11 unable to live in my neighborhood because I can't12 afford to support the building with the tenants.13 So I would like to ask you to14 consider people like me who are not rich by any15 means and we' re trying to make a living and to16 stay in your own neighborhoods if the situation17 is such that we couldn't afford it.18 So thank you very much.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 (Audience participation.)21 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Question.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma'am, there' s a23 question.24 MS. ANYA BORYSENKO:	Yes25 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for2 
2 your testimony.3 What neighborhood are you in?4 MS. ANYA BORYSENKO:	This is5 Greenpoint or North Williamsburg .6 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And there' s7 tremendous pressure, I'm sure, for8 MS. ANYA BORYSENKO:	There's a lot9 of building going on.	We have many	all over10 the place there are buildings that are - - condos11 that are extremely expensive.	It's like one12 bedroom, $500,000 which I personally can't13 afford. If I want to really pay I can't afford to14 be in that neighborhood because it's impossible15 for me to make that money, to meet that money.16 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	So the rents17 that your tenants are paying are highly18 affordable for your neighborhood?19 MS. ANYA BORYSENKO:	Yes.	Like 50020 for five rooms or 800 square - - 850 square feet.21 That' s what they're paying.	I have three22 tenants, one is lower, 475.	So it gets23 increasingly difficult to maintain it even though24 my mother insists that she has to because this is25 the only life she knows.10 
2 She's 86 and she wants to stay in3 her building.	But at this rate it's almost4 impossible for us to afford it to stay in the5 building because our expenses have risen much6 more than the rents.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS.	How many units you8 have?9	MS. ANYA BORYSENKO:	Units, eight.10	(Audience participation.)11	MS. ANYA BORYSENKO:	So I just12 wanted to present a different face, that13 represent a segment of the City also that has a14 hard time and needs help.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 MS .

2 Go ahead.3 MR. DEACON WORRELL:	I'm not a4 professional advocate and I have no formal5 affiliation with any tenant group, I'm just a6 citizen and a tenant of New York	City.7 I'm 31 years old, and I work in the8 financial services industry at Morgan Stanley. I9 am an upwardly, mobile young professional.	And I10 feel that I belong to a demographic that is11 directly impacted by this Board's decisions that12 is for the most part underrepresented in the13 public dialogue about rent regulation ..14 I would like to list for you the15 apartment-related costs I face as a rent16 stabilized tenant.17 The tenant who occupied my apartment18 before me paid $408.83 a month.	Today the legal19 registered rent is $2,237.15.20 In 2001 when I signed the first21 lease on my apartment, an 18 percent vacancy22 increase on my unit was $73.59.	After $55,000 in23 individual apartment improvements, that's $20624 per square foot for stained fixtures, the monthly25 rent increased by $1,375.2 
2Myfirst four percent RGB increase3in 2002amountedto $74.30 being added to my4 monthly rent.5 In 2003, a two percent annual6 increase added 38.63.7 In 2004 after sending my first two8 year lease, the 7.5 percent RGB increase amounted9 $127.78 a month, an additional $1,773 .36 per10 year.11 My landlord also did building12 improvements in the amount of almost $300,000 in13 which have resulted in two MCI increases for the14 third still unresolved by DHCR.	These have added15 a total of $73.43 a month to my rental cost.16 I lived in a 243 square foot alcove17 studio, crooked floor, roaches, and mice and18 intermittent lack of heat and hot water.19 It's an average apartment in the20 West Village, not a luxury one and I pay just21 under what the market rent would likely be.22 Now, I am not here to complain that23 I cannot afford my apartment, rather it is vital24 that the RGB recognize that I do pay my share of25 my regulated apartment and that my landlord is4 
2 making what can easily be termed as a reasonable3 profit from my unit.4 I have other young, professional5 friends and peers who live in rent stabilized6 apartments .	And up to this point we're the only7 onces that have been able to stay in the City and8 maintain any sort of sustainable quality	of life9 for ourselves.	The majority of my other friends,10 who have always lived in market rent apartments,11 have already left the City because of these12 conditions.13 More and more young professionals in14 my	demographic don't see a future for themselves15 in the City.	And because of the ease of which16 the landlords can increase rents in the housing17 policy changes over the last ten years in18 addition to the RGBs continual increases, those19 of us in rent stabilized apartments are facing20 larger and larger permanent rent burdens that21 only compound over time.22 We are now looking at the very real23 prospect of having to consider moving out of the24 City as well.25 Now, there may be other answers as2 
2	to how to solve this problem from inclusionary3	zoning to just increase in the housing stock, but4 right now, rent regulated apartments are the only5 resource people have for maintaining a stable6	presence3esence in the city .	And if we prevent7	regulated housing from being a reliable means of8	affordable housing, we are going to drive out an9 entire segment of professionals that are10 currently keeping the City dynamic, sustainable11 and economically viable.12 (Audience participation.)13 MR . DEACON WORRELL:	And ultimately14 what is the worst that could possibly happen by15 instituting the rent - -16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap17 up .18 MR . DEACON WORRELL:	What is the19 worst that could possibly happen by instituting a20 freeze for this year?	I mean landlords won't be21 able to offset the increase in cost to maintain22 their buildings?	Landlords will possibly turn23 their buildings over to speculators.24 Current landlords of rent regulated25 buildings are already doing both and the9 
2 financial incentives to renovate that are3 available to them.	And it is through the fault4 of no one but the landlords if they are too5 inexperienced or uninformed to take advantage of6 the current laws that - -7 (Audience participation.)8 MR.	DEACON WORRELL:9 specifically designed to offset their10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Worrell, you11 need to wrap up.12 We' ll be glad to take your13 statement.14 One last paragraph, let's go.15 MR. DEACON WORRELL:	So ultimately16 faced with a decision to either contribute to the17 housing crisis or help alleviate the housing18 crisis, I can't imagine that you wouldn't want to19 make the decision to help alleviate it. It is20 certainly within your power to do so.	And21 regardless of what the City Council can or cannot22 do or any other agency for that matter, it is23 within you power right now to set a zero percent24 increase.25 Thank you.2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr . Williamson,3 Patrick Williamson.4 Thank you.5	MR . PATRICK WILLIAMSON:	Good6 evening.7 First of all, I'm not a politician8 looking for votes.

PATRICK WILLIAMSON:	Nine out16 of ten of them are paying $225 a month, and that17 doesn' t come on the first of month.	You're lucky18 if you get it on the 15th of the month.19 And legally I can take these people20 to court and don't have to accept a check from21 them after the 1st, but I give them five extra22 days.	They make it fifteen days.23 I go to the court.	If I did go to24 the court, the court just says, what do you want25 us to do with them?	Well, that's not my14 
2 problem .	I'm so sick and tired of hearing people3 say - - everybody has to sacrifice .4 You heard this gentleman say he5 lived in an SRO for $411 a month .	Some people in6 rent stabilized apartments, rent controlled7 apartments, two bedroom apartments paying $411 a8 month.9 And why is that?	It's not right .10 You're saying here about do we have tourists.11 Yes, we do have tourists. And I'm glad with have12 the tourists come because they pay on time, and13 they make the place look decent.14 Would you like to see some of the15 way these people live?	Would you like to see the16 garbage they leave. Would you also like to know17 what they do, they bring their friends in from18 other countries and letting them stay there while19 they go wherever they go .	Oh, that' s quite all20 right, that' s quite all right. I don't have any21 complaint about that.22 But you keep going after the23 landlords .	Hey, we' re sacrificing too but we24 don't come and gripe every five minutes .	These25 people are going to - - these people are taking it2 
2 back in the 60s.	Prices go up.	People in New3 Jersey have homes, old people mind you, their4 taxes go up ever year. They don't get stabilized5 where they can go and cry the blues. Oh, I can't6 pay this month, tough, sell your house.7 Now, what I'm saying is I'm sick and8 tired of people always putting people the down9 who are trying to make a living.	We' re not doing10 it because we love doing it.	We've heard more11 stories, Ican give you hospital bills from St.12 Vincents why this guy couldn't pay a bill.	I can13 give you bills from Bellevue, some psychiatrist14 called, well, the guys not too himself that week.15 That's not my problem.	And why should I have to16 lose money.17 And every time Iget these people18 out they go get one of these civil liberty19 lawyers who then contact me, and they come up20 with all these great stories like you never heard21 before your life, why this guy comes this country22 and doesn' t speak good English.	Oh, is that my23 fault too?	Ilet him in because he had - - for24 now on truthfully, what we're doing now is we' re25 screening these people.	We' re not letting them2 
2 come in without being able to screen them.3 Because if we don't screen them, then we're held4 with the bill.5 These people don't care if we're6 left with the bills, do they.	Oh, they couldn't7 care less.	But God forbid they got to pay five8 extra dollars they're the first one screaming9 their heads off.	Well, I say tough.	Rent10 control and rent stabilization, you got any11 brains, getting it all because all of this stuff12 is caused problem. Everybody should pay their13 fair share.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Wrap up.15 MR. PATRICK WILLIAMSON:	Leave it16 at that.	Everybody should pay their fair share.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That' s a good18 wrap up.19 Thank you.20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Dorothy22 Williams-Perejra;23 Followed by - - and I'm going to read24 some names and see if they're here.25 Edward Lewis, are you here, Mr.2 
2 Lewis?	Mr. Lewis, Edward Lewis. Yes, okay,3 great.4 Diane Stein?	Yes, you're here?5 Diane Stein. Doesn't sound like she's here.6 (No response.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ernst Endrich?8 MR. ERNST ENDRICH:	Here.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Endrich is10 here.11 Bob Grossman, are you here?12 MR. BOB GROSSMAN:	Here.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.14 So it's Dorothy Williams-Perjra;15 Edward Lewis;16 Ernst Endrich;17 And Bob Grossman.18 Go ahead.19 MR. DOROTHY WILLIAMS- PEREJRA:	My20 name is Dorothy Williams- Perejra.	And I have21 been a court manager for many, many years.22 Fair share is not what the landlords23 are paying, or are they necessarily even from24 here.	How many of them are absentee landlords.25 An owner occupied person gives up10 
2	beautiful chance for somebody to make it in as a3	young person or as an immigrant or	I honor4 that person.	I have memories.	My mother was one5 of those people.6 When my daughter became sick, the7 tenants came and gave their blood to my daughter8 because they got to be homeowners of their own.9 These people are exploiting us, they're10 exploiting our city.11 The mortgage companies, the bank,12 the illegal occupancy, the illegal apartments13 they put in, even the luxury apartments are14 illegally occupied.	They put in multiple15 students in single apartments that is against the16 law.17 They put in two Spanish immigrant18 families or illegal immigrants in a basement to19 live like rats in a cellar. This is outrageous.20 There' s a lemon law when you buy a21 car.	If you buy an apartment that' s abusive,22 that the ceiling is falling down, then you23 shouldn' t have to pay anything.	It's a violation24 of the law of uninhabitability.	They should have25 to pay you for the damage it does to your health.4 
2 And to your children, and to your senior citizens3 and to your disabled.4 We should have Court TV and we5 should bring it into Landlord/Tenant.	That's the6 place we need to have Court TV.	The cameras and7 the recorders that are not allowed in the courts.8 Oversight, what oversight. They' re9 getting away with murder, murder.	When a child' s10 life is ruined by lead, when a senior citizen11 dies because they are living without heat, it's12 murder and it's time to stop the lemon law of the13 housing market .	We've got to stop these14 exploiters . We've got to help the good landlords .15 We've got to give them their hardship, whatever,16 but we've got to stop the exploiters that come in17 from Westchester, Long Island and New Jersey and18 are sucking this City dry and ruining it .19 (Audience participation .)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .21 Mr. Lewis, Edward Lewis ;22 Followed by Ernst Endrich;23 Followed by Bob Grossman.24 After Mr . Lewis I'm going to read25 some other names to see if they' re still here .2 
2	Go ahead, Mr. Lewis.3	MR. EDWARD LEWIS:	Excuse me, I have4 a question.5 If this Board were to find with the6 landlords - -7 VOICE:	Can't hear you.8 MR. EDWARD LEWIS:	If this Board9 were to find that the landlords admitted that10 they did not need an increase, would you still11 grant an increase?12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You're going to13 bring every landlord in town in here to say that?14 MR . EDWARD LEWIS:	I just want to15 know whether you have the power if you find that16 the landlords don't need an increase or they say17 they don't need an increase that you have the18 power to deny that increase.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have the20 power.21 Go ahead.22 Would you give your testimony,23 please.24 MR. EDWARD LEWIS:	Well, I have25 some exhibits.9 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure, exhibits.3 We' ll get one of our staff people to come down.4 (Handing.)5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We're going to6 start the three minutes all over. Let's start.7 Thank you, thank you, sir. Go ahead.8	MR. EDWARD LEWIS:	This is a9 letter basically from my landlord claiming that10 he's been informed of hot water running into our11 toilets, not to just my apartment, but to the12 three buildings that are fed by the one boiler,13 the common boiler.14 A VOICE: Speak into the mike,15 please.16 MR. EDWARD LEWIS:	By the common17 boiler.18 So I would like to suggest that if19 my landlord has the extra income to heat20 everybody' s toilet water.	And if a landlord has21 the money to heat everybody's toilet or whatever22 the price of oil today, I believe that is an23 admission that he does not need any increase and24 therefore, I request that this Board find that25 the landlords have admitted that - -9 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lewis, you3 do win the argument of the day award.4 (Laughter.)5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.	Keep6	going. Sorry.7	MR. EDWARD LEWIS:	I believe that8 this Board is required by this letter to find9 that the landlords have admitted that they do not10 need a rent increase and therefore this Board is11 empowered to find that you will not grant a rent12 increase.	And therefore, I request that you not13 grant a rent increase to the landlords.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 Thank you, sir.18 Ernst Endrich, please;19 Followed by Bob Grossman.

ERNST ENDRICH:	Good evening,19 ladies and gentleman .20 In the last six years my real estate21 taxes doubled.	Oil doubled.	Heating went fives22 time - - five times up and insurance doubled too.23 So it's not the fault of the landlords we need an24 increase, it's the fault of the whole society.25 Thank you .12 
2	(Audience participation.)3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 Mr. Grossman, how you doing this5 year?6 MR. BOB GROSSMAN:	Good afternoon.7 I've noticed that in these8 proceedings the landlords can talk about their9 expenses and expenses going up and expenses keep10 going up, the question is not that expenses, the11 question is their profits.	They're too savvy.12 If that' s all they keep talking13 about is their expenses, they have something to14 hide.15 Now, I suggest - - first of all, I'm16 a SRO tenant, 43 years, Riverside Tower hotel. A17 live in a ten foot by ten foot room, sleeping18 room.19 A VOICE:	And that' s a big room.20 MR. BOB GROSSMAN:	I have to share21 a bathroom with another tenant.22 Now, there' s a simple way of23 separating whether these tenants - - whether the24 landlords rather deserve the rent increase,25 that' s to open their books and prove it.4 
2	(Audience participation.)3	MR. BOB GROSSMAN:	Otherwise4 they' re going they' re going complain .	The5 landlords keep complaining their expenses are6 going up and the SRO charges, blah, blah, blah7 for oil and so on and so and so on .	How do we8 know they're telling the truth that they really9 need the rent increase?	Find out.	Ask them to10 open their books and we will find out they way in11 ordinary business does.	They come out clean and12 show us what the heck is really going on instead13 of baloneying their rent increase that their14 income decreases and their expenses increases.15 It's silly to talk about living in vacant16 apartment, they' re not17 I have a landlord, for example,18 who' s owned his building for 35 years.	If he was19 losing money over 35 years, he would have been20 gone long ago, that' s just common sense.21 Thank you .22 (Audience participation.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, Mr.24 Grossman .25 Steven Colvin.4 
2	MR. STEVEN COLVIN:	Some pictures.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Pictures, sure.4 MR. STEVEN COLVIN:	The pictures5 you are looking at are the bathroom in my SRO6 that I lived in for 18 years.	And basically it7 looks like that every six months, okay, for 188 years.	And they've fixed the ceiling tiles and9 cleaned it up and painted it and it hasn' t10 changed in 18 years.11 This is a Landmark building in the12 Breslin Hotel with 270 B class and 35 A class.13 It's a small space, a room of less than 10014 square feet, but I'll get right to the point.15 You see those pictures, and for16 those reasons I don't think this building that I17 live in should have an increase over the majority18 of tenants who are low income.19 But that' s really not the problem20 that I'm here or that you're really here to21 address because there' s a much greater problem.22 Building management has indicated23 that the current landlord wants everybody out24 because they have "big plans" for the building.25 The second thing, management has5 
2 started renting small vacant space to both class3 A and class B units in 1186 Broadway.	Management4 is and is in the process of scheduling5 appointments to politely ask primarily Asian6 tenants, who may be unaware of their rights, to7 leave before their lease expires .8	Tenants have lived for decades in9 this building and or will shortly will be10 informed that their leases will not be renewed.11 The issue is that I hear after12 observing and listening is that there are some13 good landlords and some bad landlords, and some14 good tenants and some bad tenants.	And15 unfortunately an overall increase really doesn' t16 differentiate .	It rewards people who don't get17 an increase to those who may need it .18 But I don't know how you could19 possibly do that in this current situation so I20 don't think it's a good idea to increase the21 rents with the increase and percentage.22 If you have any questions, I live at23 29th and Broadway.	This is an area that's had at24 least ten to 12 luxury building go up.	And many25 other buildings are being gutted and converted9 
2 into high, high cost, rent that' s for rich3 people.4 The violinist who played at Ground5 Zero Ceremony one year after the event lives in6 my building, James .	He's a violinist.	And it7 seems that the Breslin Hotel is now the new8 Ground Zero.9 And I'd like you to do what you can10 to make things better for us.11 Thank you12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Your owner takes14 the transients or he does not, he' s just trying15 to evict people?16 MR. STEVEN COLVIN:	The process is17 begun and we are unaware of what the facts are.18 I related the facts to you as I know them, but19 we're trying to inform the tenants association to20 determine what the facts are so that we do not21 overact and so that we do not underreact.	So22 we're in the process of discovering what the real23 intentions of the landlords are.24	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Have you talked25	to the West Side SRO Project?
1	4582 MR. STEVEN COLVIN:	Yes, we are.3 We are communicating with everyone we could4 possible communicate with.5 Thank you.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.

2 Followed by Matthew Shotkin;3 Followed by Clare Dockery.4 MR. BERNARD CONNAUGHTON:	Good5	afternoon.6	My name Bernie Connaughton.	I live7 in the neighborhood.	I live on 53rd Street and8 I've lived in this neighborhood for twenty years.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	This10 neighborhood, when you say "the neighborhood. "11 MR. BERNARD CONNAUGHTON:	This12 neighborhood, yes.	It's changed a lot since I've13 lived here.14 When I moved in I lived over on near15 Avenue B, when moved in, the neighborhood was so16 different.	There were bodegas, there were lots17 of Latino families.	That's changed.	Now bodegas18 have become bars by and large, and real estate19 offices are springing up almost as much as the20 bars are. So that's how the market is going.21 But I just want to tell you my22 experience.23 I'm a teacher and there' s no way I24 could live in my neighborhood now doing the work25 that I do.	I teach in a GED program at Lincoln10 
2	College in the Bronx.3	I want to tell you that as part of4 my job I teach these young people how to write5 essays.	d a lot of my students are single6 mothers, some of them are teenagers that have7 dropped out of the school.8	I gave them an essay question.	d9 the essay question was, what' s your opinion on10 this proposed increase that the Rent Guidelines11 Board is voting on?	d it was a good question12 because people feel strongly about it.13 A lot of my students, as I said,14 have a lot of responsibilities.	But I became15 aware that for some of the young mothers in my16 class, one in particular, we' ll call Maria, who17 pays over $1,000 a month rent in the Bronx and18 has a couple of kids and works during the day.19 It's a big deal for her to get - - to20 get a eight percent increase, that' s big deal.21 That can make a difference between her buying22 shoes for kids or not.	d so I just want to say23 that these seem like small - - it may seem like a24 small issue, but there' s many Marias, there's25 many of them in New York City.9 
2 I would simply - - my rent is not3 bad, I have to be honest.	As I said, I couldn' t4 live in Manhattan otherwise if I had to pay5 market rate and I'm grateful for that.	But I6 just want you to remember all the people that are7 not in the position that I am.8 Thank you.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .10	(Audience participation.)11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Matthew Shotkin,12 Matthew Shotkin.13 A VOICE:	At least that guy was14 honest.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to keep16 quiet, quiet.17 Go ahead.18 MR. MATTHEW SHOTKIN:	Good19 afternoon.20 And it's finally wonderful to meet21 the man behind the legend, Marvin Mark Up Markus.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'm a Giant fan.2 3	MR. MATTHEW SHOTKIN:	Do I have to24 hate you?25 Just thinking, I live in an
2 apartment that's rent controlled, it's the3 Bozard, 307 East 44th Street and4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It's rent5 controlled you're saying.6 MR. MATTHEW SHOTKIN:	Yes.7 And my - - my rent was lowered just8 recently and not raised.9 I don't know why other people's rent10 is being raised, Maybe it's because of the fact11 that its cheaper to live in a doorman building12 than it is to live in a high rise coop or condo,13 because a doorman building offers less services14 or amenities than a coop or condo does.15 Please, please, please don't raise16 other people's rent.	The City has enough trouble17 with it.18 Thanks for your cooperation in this19 matter.20 Any questions?21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good job.22 Go Giants.	Go Giants.23 MR. MATTHEW SHOTKIN:	This is a24 message, don't raise our rents!25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, Mr.2 
2 Shotkin.3 Clare Dockery.4 MS. CLARE DOCKERY:	Hi.5 My name is Clare Dockery.	And I6 live in a rent stabilized apartment on the Upper7 West Side.8 First, I wonder whether there is any9 point in my being, or any other tenant,10 testifying?	Has a decision about how large rent11 increases are going to be already been made? In12 any event, there are a few points I would like to13 make.14 Because of ever escalating rents,15 caused by RGB decisions and the lack of Home Rule16 for the New York City Council, New York City is17 losing many young people, as well as middle and18 working class people.19 They are being forced to live and20 work in the suburbs or move to other parts of the21 country.22 My classic story is my former boss,23 an MSW, and her husband, an MBA, had twins and24 therefore needed to move.	They were unable to25 find an apartment in Manhattan or Queens that
2 they could afford and now they live in Ohio.3 Young people in my neighborhood are4 sharing apartments, three in one bedroom, four or5 more in two bedrooms .6 Some institutions are offering a7 housing stipend to teachers that will teach in8	the City.	Young families are forced to move9 when they have children.	My own building is10 becoming a combination of older people living in11 rent stabilized apartments and younger, transient12 people living in market level apartments.13 Hostels are starting to report14 nursing shortages because of a lack of affordable15 housing .	My own housing costs have risen to 3116 percent of income not only because of RGB granted17 increases, but because of major capital18 improvement increases which pay owners for19 maintaining their buildings.20 It is beginning to sound like the21 housing emergency after World War II that caused22 rent control and then rent stabilization .23 Housing is a right, not a luxury.24 Those who supply housing are entitled to - all25 folks are entitled to - a decent income, but9 
2 those who supply necessities should not expect to3 make huge profits.	Net income has gone up for4 owners, while net income for renters has5 decreased.6 In addition, owners are not7 maintaining their buildings.	Tenants and8 neighbors can supply citywide statistics but in9 my own building, despite many, many complaints,10 the front door does not always lock and sometimes11 the outer door cannot be opened so you can't get12 in or out.13 I would also like to make an appeal14 for repeal of the Urstadt law, a return of Home15 Rule to New York City.16 The New York State Legislature17 enacts all housing laws for New York City - from18 vacancy lease increases to whether the City19 Council approves the Mayors' appointees to the20 RGB.21 Legislators from upstate do not22 understand or much care about New York City23 housing.	And New York City residents have little24 influence on them but do have influence over the25 City Council.2 
2 The income of building owners is3 increasing, the income of renters of decreasing.4 To keep New York affordable to middle and working5 class people I ask for no rent increases this6 year.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Perfect.8	Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Anthony Tyrone.11	MR. ANTHONY TYRONE:	Good evening,12 to Mr. Chairman, Mr. Markus and to Members of the13 Board.14 My name is Mr . Anthony Tyrone and I15 am the Chairman of 300 West 46th Street Tenants16 association .	I was here last time.17 We, the tenants of 300 West 46th18 Street say no rent increases that the Rent19 Stabilization Board has proposed for rent20 stabilized apartments.	These increases will have21 a devastating effect on tenants of rent22 stabilized apartments.23 Many tenants who work are literally24 living paycheck to paycheck.	SRO rent25 stabilization tenants are already squeezed beyond12 
2 their means, even five percent increase.3 Landlords and owners and tenants4 have been running amuck especially when tenants5 have had to report violations.6 Mr. Markus, please explain why7 landlords should receive an increase in rent when8 they often fail to comply with City, State, and9 Federal laws.	Owners have often been fined and10 violated codes over and over again.11 Whatever happened to the rights of12 the tenants, paying tenants? Sometimes these13 tenants have made good- faith complaints and still14 have to pay these stiff increases.15 Now, what I'm trying to say again is16 that owners continue to get rent raise and rent17 hike and they have violations.	It is a crime for18 some of these landlords that have violations and19 will not fix repairs.20 For six years a tenant doesn't have21 a stove and he' s been fined by DHCR.22 Now DHCR has very narrow laws, but23 what should happen is whoever's the Governor or24 the next Governor should reinforce these laws to25 these agencies because they are not, they are not2 
2 having these agencies to penalize these landlords3 out here.4 DHCR, guess what, on July 13th5 regarding the same thing, six years this landlord6 has not complied to the order.7 Now, who' s going to compensate these8 tenants?	Who' s going to compensate the tenants?9 Somebody' s going to compensate me for six years10 with no stove and causing me to be a diabetic.11 (Audience participation. )12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Dahila Duperroir.13 MS. DAHLIA DUPERROIR:	Duperroir.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Sorry.15 I'll just call you Dahlia.16 MS. DAHLIA DUPERROIR:	Good evening,17 ladies and gentlemen.18 My name is Dahlia Duperroir.	I'm a19 West Side tenant activist and community leader,20 as I have been told. I am also a member of21 Community Voices Heard.22 I attended a conference yesterday of23 the Commission on Economic Opportunity and how to24 combat poverty in our communities.	Well, guess25 what, it starts here now, today.2 
2 You on this Board have been3 appointed by the Mayor.	You represent an elected4 official, not yourselves.5 I strongly suggest that you6 reconsider your actions and decisions in light of7 the fact that the news announced this morning8 that forty percent of the residents of this City9 are of low income, and that one has to be very10	wealthy to afford to live here.11	There is no longer a middle income12 class as we once knew it.	This is telling you13 Board Members take heed on what you are doing to14 the people of this City.15 You are also under the misconception16 that SCRIE covers rents for seniors, it's not17 worth the paper its written on.	It freezes18 rents, and depending on how long ago the19 individual applied, it can help.	Those who are20 becoming eligible, it's not worth anything to21 nothing.22 These increases have to stop. There23 must be a freeze in rents.	Our jobs are24 outsourced.	Employment hasn't risen, it's just25 the unemployed have moved to public assistance12 
2 and other programs and are taking jobs earning3 less.4 You Board Members are the5 contributors to the increase of homelessness and6 poverty in this City.	This Board should be7 abolished as is.	Our elected officials should8 abolish the Urstadt Laws and give us back our9 city home Rule now and stop passing the buck.10 It's a shame that you can only think11 of your own vested interests and not of how your12 decisions affect others.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jadwiga Lendo.15 MS.

I checked with someone16 from who have complaint to Department of Housing17 does not know.18 The landlady is above the law.	She19 was told to by a judge in - - okay. The landlady20 is above the law.	She was told by a judge in21 2004 to remove wood trim from around bathtub and2 2	replace it with tiles.	She doesn' t plan to do23 it.24 Isn't there a law requiring owners25 to do some improvements after owning the house23 
2 for 49 years?	Some profits should be used to3 make repairs.	Please do not increase profits for4	greedy landlords.	I understand it's a business,5 but it deals with people' s rights.6 And I also got brought something to7 show you.	Please don't get scared.8 This is what I deal with everyday9 (indicating.)	It's the rodent from my - - on this10 table, these things about two years ago an11 incident when I was speaking with the owner.	And12 actually, my owner was here because she was13 speaking.14 And I would be glad to not hear this15 thing.	I kill this everyday.	I wake up and I16 look at my ceiling or under the floor and I see17 something passing from the basement.18 I live on the first floor of the19 owners.	The owners occupy the apartment on the20 second. It doesn' t bother them.21 A VOICE:	What is it?22 MS. JADWIGA LENDO:	It's a23 centipede, house centipede, comes from the24 basement.	When it's alive it's almost two inches25 long.10 
1	4 7 52	Anybody want to see it?3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No.4 You come in second for the best5 argument of the day.6	We have a picture.	What's that?7	MS. JADWIGA LENDO:	You have a8	picture of it? Oh, that' s right.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And what is10	that?11	MS. JADWIGA LENDO:	Same thing, a12 different one, just one like that .13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Are you14 done?15 MS. JADWIGA LENDO:	Yes.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 Where did you say you live, in18 Bushwick?19 MS. JADWIGA LENDO:	No, no, no. In20 Greenpoint.	The owner was right here speaking.21 It's eight family house.	She said I'm the only22 one who pay because I got punished for23 complaining so the other tenants are not24 complaining.	I'm the only one.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I see.12 
2 Well, that' s the first time that I3 can recall that we had both an owner and tenant4 from the same building in the room.5 (Audience participation.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Kathleen Lyons,7 you here, right?

KATHLEEN LYONS:	I live in an14 SRO building on the Upper West Side.15 Unfortunately I live there for twenty years only16 because the rents in New York City have gone up17 so quickly I never thought I would be there that18 long.19 I used to live in a - - I have a20 room, four of us.	Like the room is very small. I21 forget, the length of a bed, I mean really22 standing room only.23 And we went through a tremendous24 amount of harassment the last few years when they25 converted to tourist hotel.10 
1	4772 Now my landlord does not need an3 increase.	He owns ten hotels with some of them4 are luxury hotels.	He has a lot of illegal5 students and illegal tourists.	I feel sorry for6 them coming there.	And I mean they have7 renovated the hotel as much as it was before it8	was just horrendous.	I mean somebody went out9 to go out and film in the place, tremendous10 amount of money, he would not take it because he11 was too embarrassed for him.	But they have12 increased it. It's gotten better, but there is a13 lot of problems and harassment sometimes.14 I was recently diagnosed with15 cancer, and my mother sent me money to go to the16 doctor.	And twice they lost the money. My mail,17 they throw out the mail.	So I had to pay a lot18 of money because I was very lucky that I had19 family that can help me with my hospital bills20 otherwise I would have been on the street.21 There are three people on my floor22 that were diagnosed with cancer.23 I had - - I was lucky I could stay24 with a relative to be able to afford my hospital25 bills, I could not have done it if I stayed9 
2 there .	The kitchen was abominable, it's3 unsanitary.	I just don't know - - I just don't4 know how society can - - it is judged like how  it5 treats the least, the poorest and to - - every6 year the rents go up and I worry people, you7 know, hardships that people have.8 I know a cousin that has a very good9 job on Wall Street and he cannot afford to live10 here in the City.	And he moved.	And he has a11 very good living.	And I just don't know what I12 can do or anyone can do.	They feel hopeless and13 helpless . It's just, I don't know what to say. I14 mean everybody has told the truth and it's a15 despicable, it's a terrible situation.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	In your SRO, are17 the other units, some of the other units rented18 to tourists or not?19 MS. KATHLEEN LYONS:	Yes, they're20 rented to tourists, they're decontrolled.	I have21 a friend who's a yoga teacher and a message22 therapist who wanted to get into the building,23 there' s no affordable housing and she couldn't do24 it, they refused her.	They don't rent to new25 tenants.2 
1	4792 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	But they do rent3 to - - sorry - - they - -4	MS. KATHLEEN LYONS:	They rented5 to tourists and who are unsuspecting and it's not6 a great place to stay for a hotel, I mean to see7 New York.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where is it?9 MS. KATHLEEN LYONS:	It's on 88th10 Street .11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	88th?12 MS. KATHLEEN LYONS :	Yes, between13 Riverside and West End.14 You know, I have a niece, she'd like15 to go to school here in New York.	She can't16 afford the rents, she just can't afford it.	I17 know many people that are in that same position .18 They just can't afford it.	I mean after paying19 tuition I mean, how many colleges or universities20 in New York have free tuition?	I mean that' s a21 part of the situation.22 But I mean it's so much added23 expense, salaries are not keeping up with the24 increases in the rent, people can't afford them25 at all.10 
2 There's a woman out front, she begs.3 She goes out into the street and begs for the4 leftovers, you know or to pay for her rent and5 food.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Any7 questions?8 (No response.)9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Irving Lemonie .11	MR. IRVING LEMONIE:	Here.12 Good evening, ladies and gentlemen .13 I don't have a prepared speech.	I'm14 not going to be here for very long.15 And just want to say I have listened16 to landlords complaining about their problems.	I17 haven' t one landlord say that they are entitled18 to a fuel pass-along which my landlord gets every19 month with his rent .20 I also haven't heard any landlords21 complain about their turnover.	Whenever a tenant22 leaves and they are rented, they are getting at23 least two and a half times as much rent than24 putting in a sink or they put in a cabinet and25 they keep get increases, and when they second12 
1	4812 tenant moves out, they get a further increase.3 Landlords - - I don't know how many4 of you gentlemen are from the Real Estate Board,5 but how come no one ever mentions that landlords6 are entitled to many increases when apartments7 are vacated?8 And I don't think you should9 consider giving rent increases to landlords if10 they would only be honorable and show their books11 and let tenants see how poor they are.12 I wish you all a good evening.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 Question.15 You pay a fuel pass-along you said?16 MR. IRVING LEMONIE:	Pardon?17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You pay a fuel18 pass-along?19 MR. IRVING LEMONIE:	Yes.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You lived in a21 rent stabilized or rent controlled?22 MR. IRVING LEMONIE:	Yes,23 stabilized.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. It doesn't25 make any sense.2 
2 You said you are paying fuel pass3 along?4	MR. IRVING LEMONIE:	Am I not5	supposed to pay a fuel6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I don't think7 so, I don't think you're supposed to be paying a8 fuel pass- along.9 The last fuel pass- along was 2510 years ago.	Maybe it's a unique circumstance.11	MR. IRVING LEMONIE:	Where do I find12 out about that?	Who do I inquire to see about13 that?14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Why don't you15 call our tomorrow and we' ll try to straighten it16 out.	If they're entitled to it, we' ll look at17 it.

Geraldine.14 MS. GERALDINE SCALIA:	Hello.	Hi15 I'm Geraldine Scalia.16 I don't have a script prepared that17 well.18 Everything is askew and everything19 is propped up and everything is mixed up now.20 I'm mainly going to respond to a lot21 of things that I heard, plus from my own22 experience.23 I feel like I've been dealing24 adversely with my landlord and landlords for the25 past 24 years.10 
2 Talking about repairs, Ms. Adams was3 asking is anybody - - are agencies mandated.	I4 have, for example, 67 violations in my apartment.5 Two years ago I think the judge came when I was6 in court and I actually got a rebate from him.7 I think at one point he said my rent wasn't worth8 more than $100.9	Everything is askew.	A box with a10	toilet can be considered $1500 a month.	Imean11	everything is very mixed up now .12 HPD, hundreds of people doing13 nothing.	They are not held accountable.	My14 landlord, I call HPD and I said what happened to15 this violation?	What happened to that violation?16 Oh, it's not in the record .	The landlord paid17 HPD off to remove the violations, not for making18 the repairs, but to remove the violations.19 I have many docket numbers with20 DHCR, multiple, multiple.	When it got to the21 point that it couldn't be resolved, I got a22 letter from DHCR saying it had to be settled23 through an Article 78, that' s through the court,24 which would require me to hire a lawyer.	Iam of25 low income .12 
2 Talking about low income and middle3 income, according to Bloomberg, middle income is4 an annual income $85,000, that is what is5 considered middle income in New York.6 I don' t know how many of you make7 that.	So I'd say most of us probably are under8 $85,000 which would put us in the lower bracket.9 Again, there' s no Section 8 housing10 left available. No one can make application or11 those applications closed in 1997.12 Warranty of inhabitability.	When13 the landlord does make repairs, they are most14 often in an unworkmanlike fashion.	My landlord15 has said that I demand that my place be16 renovated, in fact, ten stories.	He writes17 letters and sends them both to DHCR and to the18 City fabricating lies, saying that I destroyed19 this, I destroyed that.	He's finding any excuse20 in the book to get me out of there.	Fabricating21 stories that I leave trash in the hall, that I'm22 doing this and that.23 I will fight to stay and keep my24 rent affordable, that' s no way to live. I can't25 go away, I'm afraid I'm going to get a letter2 
2 from the landlord.	What kind of life is that?3 But where can I move?	I mean where can I afford?4 Do I tell people in Cooperstown,5 Upstate New York what their rents should be? Why6 should people in Albany decide how high the7 guidelines for our rents?	Do I tell people in8 Syracuse what is right and what is wrong in terms9 of their tenancy and their rent laws?10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Could you wrap11	up.12 MS. GERALDINE SCALIA:	Where did13 that go?14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where do you15 live?16 MS.

GERALDINE SCALIA :	Between21 Mott and Mulberry, 51 - - I don' t really want to22 give my address.2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, you've24 alleged corruption and I've been informed by a25 lawyer here that I should report this to the24

For all12 of the legal services organi zations in Manhattan,13 there's only - - you're in Manhattan, ma'am?14 MS . GERALDINE SCALIA :	I am, indeed .15 I'm a - -16 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	With all of our17 organizations, our sister organizations	and my18 two offices in Manhattan, there's a combination19 of about 22 housing attorneys .	And typically20 they're always in triage mode.	And that's how we21 have to do our intake because the demand it much22 too great .23 But for every one tenant that we 're24 able to represent, we have to turn six away . And25 that was a study that was done in 2002.12

DIANE WESTON:	Good evening.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good evening.15 MS. DIANE WESTON:	Good afternoon.16 I'm here again after seven years. I17 come here every year and I'm an activist.18 I live on the East Side.	I'm at 51519 East B lst Street. I have nothing to submit other20 than the fact that I had a landlord who is no21 damn good.22 Now, for seven years, and I mean23 seven - - since he took over the building in 1999,24 I have to pay water tax, MCI charges, okay, and25 I'm not just talking about myself, I'm talking4 
1	4912 about many people I know that are many different3 coalitions, because I'm involved in quite a few.4 My landlord, and I wouldn' t repeat5 his name, I don't know too many people in this6 room to know, they might have him, has not7 honored HEAP, but yet he gets a grant from HEAP,8 but I received no heat.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	He gets a what?10 MS. DIANE WESTON:	A grant from11 HEAP.12 The repairs are to die from because13 we have nothing but what' s called new slave14 labor.	And the new slave labor in this country15 does not know how to repair which means the16 landlord is profiting because you can tell17 someone, listen I want you to shut their heat18 off.19 These people are beholden to the20 landlord because they're here to make a couple of21 hundred dollars a week so they can send their22 money back to their country called Mexico.23 It's all about profiteering.	It's24 all about giving them increases.	As a matter of25 fact, I have received a renewal lease, I said10 
2	I'll be damned if I sign it.	What did I do, I3	went and I received counsel on the West Side.	I4	said let me know.	I heard it's improper.5	Let me go to the East Side, let me6 seek counsel on the east side.	Well, it was7 well, Diane Weston ended up for seven months in a8 court with a very, very good lawyer from Lenox9 Hill Neighborhood House because I'm involved in10 that area and I live in that area.11	Did I win?	Yes.	Did DHCR honor me?12 Yes.	Thank God, but this man, my landlord needs13 to be checked out.14 Now, I had information pulled up on15 him from someone's computer.	He has not be run16 by anyone.	And he lives in Westchester, that' s17 where his home is.	He knows nothing about what' s18 going on here.	Now that you people in Albany19 because landlords and real estate developers have20 sued certain people so they can get tenants to - -21 in rent stabilized to an eight and a half22 increase for a two year lease, which is absurd.23 Check the conditions, please, of all24 the apartments in New York to see what the25 landlords are doing and let them open their12 
1	4 932 books.	Because we are honest people.	We come3 here to testify every year and there' s a reason4 why we testify.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you .6 MS . DIANE WESTON :	I request zero7 increase .8 Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you.11	Mr. Lesko.12 MR . J .G . LESKO:	Good evening.13 My name is John Lesko.	I'm a14 decorated Marine Veteran from Vietnam.	I live in15 the neighborhood.	I want to speak my whole16 letter, because more have spoken.17 Strangely enough when I was18 discharged honorably from the Marines in '73, I19 used my GI Bill to study real estate at the20 University of California .	And the key thing that21 I learned about income-producing property is22 something called market capitalization rates.23 Then I was taken on by Cushman &24 Wakefield and worked there in Manhattan .	I25 worked on sales, and when it first went up for12 
2	sale years ago.3	However, I do think, my feeling is4 from listening to all the people testify that5 I've been hearing this argument for years and6 years and I never testified prior to this, that7 - - that it is incumbent upon the Board to provide8 market capitalization rates for each community9 board in the City.10 When you have absentee landlords,11 when you have people living inside homes that12 they can't afford, you have different13 capitalization rates on each different14 income-producing property.15 And then you have - - you have - - and16 within each building there are different, you17 know, you have stabilized - - you might have two18 stabilized apartments, one control apartment and19 the other one is $4800 a month.	One guys pays20 $200 for a regular flat, the next tenant pay21 $4800 for the same flat. But the regular flat22 where he' s paying $200 looks like bomb, you know,23 that's because you - - we all know - - basically24 that' s what I'm saying.25 If I don't see those results, and I4 
2 live on a pension because I wounded during the3 war.	I honestly, I know a few fairly decent4 attorneys and I think it would be wise for the5 tenants of this City to file class action civil6 suit using the Freedom of Information Act and to7 demand the market capitalization rates for each8 and every income-producing property in the City9 of New York.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11	(Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay, sir.13 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And then do what14 with it?15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No, the first16 gentleman was about to get up.	In the lighter17 shirt, yes.18 And the other gentleman is next or19 if you want to cede your time to the other one, I20 don't care. You go first .21 Give us your name, please.22 MR. DERRICK SHELTON:	Shelton,23 Derrick Shelton, at the Commander Hotel, 240 West24 74th Street, West Side of Manhattan .	240 73rd25 Street, West Side of Manhattan, A/K/A, otherwise12 
2	known as the Temple .3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The temple, we4 know that, Ann Cunningham, the Temple .5 MR. DERRICK SHELTON :	She lives6 there .7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS.	Well, I know.8 Well, we know, we identified her with that.9	MR . DERRICK SHELTON:	Yes, sir.10 I'll try to be brief .11 There are several key issues here. I12 think the most important of which is that the13 management style that' s being used in our14 building, the commander, a/k/a, the Temple, is15 being used around the City.16 The previous owner who still I think17 still has some partial of ownership through a18 coalition, has purchased a run of approximately19 18 hotels or SROs, including the Martha20 Washington, the - - not the Beacon, I'm sorry, the21 one on 78th Street and Broadway, one on 77th22 Street in Broadway, and 173rd Street in Broadway.23 But the tactic is being repeated24 around the city, that is to say, that we live in25 separate and unequal quarters .10 
2 As tenants are bought out or pushed3 out or harassed out, the units are taken off the4 market and then held off the market for a time5 period, renovated, put back on the market as6 above the threshold of rent stabilization, above 7	the $2000.8 And then tourists are brought in as9 transient guests.	These guests get separate and10 unequal rights above the actual tenants or the11 New Yorkers who support the City.12 For the transients, they get13 separate lodging rooms.	And my building, as I14 said, they have separate lodging rooms with15 marble baths, and showers and work out rooms or16 gymnasiums that the tenants actually don't have17 access to.	It's behind a combination lock, an18 electronic combination lock.19 They get special services at the20 front desk.	They get car service or the front21 desk will call for the car service for them.22 Carry their bags up to, not only to the curb, but23 all the way down to Broadway, approximately 18024 feet.	And the list goes on.25 They have separate - - they took our8 
2 old laundry room and they turned it into a3 storage room for bassinets, cots and double beds4 so that when the Europeans show up, they can5 actually request item extras in their rooms as6 they need, but the actual New Yorkers, the7 tenants that have been living there, like myself8 for over 14 years, can't access these same9 facilities in our own building.10 It's interesting to note that the11 RGB own records of meetings from two years ago12 show that when landlords renovate their buildings13 their return own capital or their ROI, return on14 investment, is 31 percent so landlords have taken15 advantage of investing in their own buildings and16 are profiting from them.	However, this Board17 deals these same landlords who invest in their18 buildings and renovate, the same increases they19 give to landlords who don't renovate.20 So the guys who renovate generally21 don't need it, they're doing funny things to earn22 extra money.23 My unit is - -24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Wrap up.25 MR. DERRICK SHELTON:	Yes, sir.
2 I was just going to say that3 currently there are 38 class A, 90 class B and4 five Class c  violations on this building that5 date all the way back to 1988, of which 24 are in6 my own unit which is an un renovated unit.7 The whole building was put up for a8 condominium conversion with false documentation9 and condominium conversion stating that my unit10 was renovated with a kitchen, it has no kitchen,11 with two air conditioners, it has no air12 conditioners, it's not renovated.13 When we - - the condominium plan was14 yanked, when somebody found out that we had a15 tenant action going back to 1996 - - 1997 for16 diminished services, which we won, by the way17 with DHCR after a seven-year battle.	It's now18 under appeal by the landlord, the condominium19 plan was pulled off the market, but no one20 investigated the fact that while were required a21 hearing under something called the Mitchell Law,22 the building was actually sold, that is to say,23 the building and its units cannot be sold under a24 condominium offering as a security on file with25 the Attorney General, New York State Attorney2

Not only was3 the unit sold, the entire building was sold.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap5 up.6 Well, let me ask you a question.7 You have transient, you know,8 tourists there you say.9	MR. DERRICK SHELTON:	Today.	Twenty10	- - I counted twenty coming in today.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you familiar12 with our "proviso ' that says if over a certain13 amount of units are rented to transients, that14 any rent increase we might adopt for SROs is not15 valid?16 MR. DERRICK SHELTON:	You mean we17 get a rent - - we get an exemption from rent18 increases if they have so much warehousing.19 There used to be a 25 percent proviso about ten20 years ago, and then went up to a forty percent21 and then it went to a fifty percent. I think it's22 now at 70 percent proviso.23 I was going to ask this Board to24 drop it back down to the old 25 percent proviso.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It works the
