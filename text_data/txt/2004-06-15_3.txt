I constantly feel , as the risk of being3 melodramatic , I constantly feel as if there' s an4 icy hand clutching my heart. Every time the  phone5 rings I die a thousand deaths until I pick it   up.6 Every time I go to get the mail ,7 I die a thousand  - - I say a prayer before  I go  to8 the mail box.9 The fact is democracy is for  the10 rich only at the expense of the  poor.11 (Audience participation.)12 MS. MOIRA JAFFIN:	The truth of13 the matter is maybe they don' t kill poor people14 but they just let them fall by the wayside.   It's15 bett er off	they're better off putting a  bullet16 into them.17 The fact is	as I said, they18 are just waiting to attack  us.19 I'm asking the Rent  Guidelines20 Board to help us get back on our feet and   enjoy21 the democratic system because democracy, if  it22 doesn' t work for everybody, it shouldn' t work for23 anybody.24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 
2 MS . MOIRA JAFFIN:	The point is3 most  of the people here  - - most  of the people4 a lot of the people have work experiences that   I5 do, they' re on their knees in chains with nooses6 around their necks.7 It 's only fair that the8 landlords are on their knees in chains  with9 nooses around their necks.10 I'd like to add one more  thing.11 I heard on the radio today that they are  talking12 about their extra expenses . They should have13 extra expenses. They should take some  off.14 On my floor alone - - first  of15 all , ACP Realty owns all the apartments.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to17 wrap up.18 MS. MOIRA JAFFIN:	I will.19 They pay pennies on the dollar20 for the apartments. They just sold an  apartment21on my floor,a three- bedroom  apartment , for22$1,350, 000 .23That 's not enough for them.24CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25MS. MOIRA JAFFIN:	All right.
13382(Audience participation.)3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Bernard4Connaughton.5 MR. BERNARD CONNAUGHTON:	H , I6 My name is Bernie  Connaughton7	and I'm a tenant. I live on East 3rd  Street.8	And I've lived here for  about9	eighteen years in the neighborhood.10 I am very grateful to live  in11 New York City. I too love New York City and   there12 is not a day that goes by that I'm not  grateful13 for the little studio apartment that I  have.14 I recently got a notice for  a15 Major Capital increase for improvements on   the16 building. My building was sold two years  ago.17 On top of the 7 percent  increase18 last year my rent is steadily going  up.19 But I'm just here today to  tell20 you that my experience is varied. I'm a   school21 teacher. I could not live in the apartment I  have22 now if I tried to rent it today. The woman  that23 lives upstairs from me pays $600 more per  month24 than I do because her apartment was  recently25 renovated.10 
1	3392	Like many of the other  people3 that spoke here before me, I - -	I'm a worker. I4 don' t know what else to say. I'm not rich.  I'm5 not wealthy. I never will be. I know  that.6 My other job, I have a job  on7 Friday' s. I work at Holy Name Center for the8 Homeless on Bleecker Street. I have  regular9 contact with homeless men who, many of whom  used10 to live in SROs on the Bowery. But that' s no11 longer accessible  to them. They have  - -  the12 Bowery has become	the bodegas have closed and13 upscale restaurants and bars have moved in.   The14 neighborhood	is rapidly changing.15 So today I just want to  say16 that , in closing, I just want to say I wonder17 I'm hearing our voices. I wonder do we make  a18 difference. Do our voices count?19 And to me20 (Audience participation.)21 MR. BERNARD CONNAUGHTON:	I've22 listened  - - so that 's my question, do our  voices23 count and does the system really  control24 everything.25 Please, no rent increases.7 
2 (Audience part icipation.)3 MS. HOLDER:	Question .4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder.5 Sir, there' s a question. Sir,6 there' s a question.7	MS. HOLDER:	Sorry.8 Thank you for your testimony.9 You said that you recently  found10 out that there' s going to be an MCI applied to11	your rent . Could you tell me how much that is?12 MR. BERNARD CONNAUGHTON:13 Thirty- five dollars a month.14 MS. HOLDER:	That 's per room?15 MR. BERNARD CONNAUGHTON:	Yes. I16 live in a studio. I have one  room.17 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.18 And how long have you lived  in19 your apartment?20 MR. BERNARD CONNAUGHTON:21 Fifteen years. And I've been in the neighborhood2 2	for eighteen.23 MS. HOLDER:	Okay. Thank you.24 MR. BERNARD CONNAUGHTON:	Thank25 you.23 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Dahlia3 Duperroir. Is that bett er?4	MS. DAHLIA DUPERROIR:	Yes.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 MS. DAHLIA DUPERROIR:	The7	second try.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.9 MS. DAHLIA DUPERROIR:	Good10 afternoon.11 Sorry about that. Is  this12 better?13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.14 MS. DAHLIA DUPERROIR:	Good15 afternoon, ladies and gentlemen of the  Board.16 My name is Dahlia Duperroir  and17 I live in the northern part of Clinton, which   is18 bett er known as Hell' s Kitchen.19 This city is in a crisis  of20 unemployment . It 's very high and affordabl e21 housing is at a low.22 If this Board keeps  increasing23 the  rent to market	- - to make  landlords wealt hy,24 and even those that are slumlords that don' t25 deserve the increases because they don' t give  the10 
1	3422 services needed , it will have priced the middle3 and working lower- income classes out of the4 market.5	This City was built on the6 blood , sweat and tears of the working classes,7 whether middle or lower income . And all were8 immigrants from other countries that  migrated9 here for a better life.10 Since 9/11, jobs in this  City11 have been less and housing has been rising , and12 the homelessness has risen . It 's a shame that13 greed has clouded compassion for those  working14 classes .15 If property values have16 skyrocketed, it has been to your doing with  the17 rent increases, not the people of the  City.18 Remember, it has to increase taxes . Taxes are19 paying for the homeless  shelters.20 This Board has chased and  are21 continuing to chase families out of the  City.22 Those that cannot afford to invest in their  own23 homes, those that cannot double and triple up   in24 apartments to survive, those that cannot cont inue25 to pay for high rentals wind up in shelters or   on6 
1	3432 the streets, being the so- called burdens of3 taxpayers.4 Some of these people do  still5	manage to keep their jobs but can't afford  the6 outrageous rents that this Board blindly  has7 imposed upon the people of the  City.8 What will the Governor and  the9 Mayor do when they have  - - when they   themselves10 have to bus their own tables, clean the streets11	after the people that work at those positions12 have been chased from the City because it 's no13 longer affordable  - -14 (Audience participation.)15 MS. DAHLIA DUPERROIR:	to16 stay in it?17 New York City, where are we  as18 New Yorkers going to go? That is the question   I19 ask the Board because these increases  are20 steadily going up and they don' t come down.21 You' re chasing the working class out of  this22 City.23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 The next speaker is Joann  Ross,12 
2 followed by Grace Hovey, our friend  Sylvia3 Fields, and the Reverend Frederick  Norman4 Marshall.5 Joann Ross .6 MS. JOANN ROSS:	Hello!7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	H . I8 MS. JOANN ROSS:	Pleased to9	meet you.10 Anyway, I am a tenant in  a11 resident hotel ,  SRO resident  hotel . Resident12 hotels, like mine, are extremely important  to13 this City. They were the place where the  young14 people who would first come into New York  to15 start their careers could live at a  reasonable16 rent and not have to get involved in getting   an17 apartment with all the fixtures and the gas  and18 electricity and everything, because everything   is19 provided in a resident hotel . You just pay  your20 rent and everything comes.21 They also are important to  the22 older generation  that are leaving  - - their23 families are gone and they want a smaller  place24 and don' t want to bother with an apartment.25 And also they have the in-10 
2	between people.3	I moved into my hotel in  1980.4 And over the years I have seen most of the SRO5 and resident hotels disappear. They  have6 disappeared in the form of turned  into7 condominiums, co- ops, student residences and  now8 luxury tourist hotels.9	That' s what my hotel has now10 become. Since	'98, my landlord convert ed the11 hotel into a tourist hotel  only.12 When  I moved  into my hotel , we13 had about ninety- five percent occupancy of14 resident long- term tenants, I mean peopl e that15 lived there ten, twenty, thirty years. I've   now16 lived in the place twenty- four years.17 This landlord  in  ' 97 started18 renovation. We only had about  twenty- five - -19 about twenty to twenty- five percent because  the20 other landlords in between had done everything,21 every mean trick in the book to get us out  and22 move us out. And then they warehoused the  rooms.23 So they didn't need the rents  if24 they could warehouse the rooms and refuse to   rent25 them.10 
2 Now this landlord is getting3 big, big money for these rooms, the ones  that4 were left that he slightly renovated , getting5 really fantastic , anywhere from about $165 for6 the smallest room up to about $450 a night.  And7 that 's plus all of the taxes that goes with it.8 Plus all the little extras like $12.95 if  you9 want to run a movie  - that ' s for each showing  -10 or for the use of the Internet or for the use  of11 the phone. The tourists pay a lot of money  to12 him.13 And $10 a night for an animal ,14 if you bring an animal with  you.15 So he wants to get us out and  he16 is trying in every way possible to try to get  us17 out. And he does not deserve any rent  increase.18 He doesn' t really need it from us. He is getting19 so much from his tourists.20 And he doesn' t give any21 services. He' s still harassing us, no repairs,  no22 services, constant belittling us, telling us  that23 we can't - - he doesn' t even want to see us in the24 lobby or anywhere. He doesn' t want the tourists25 to know that we exist.2 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Wrap it up.3	MS. JOANN ROSS:	And this is4 the way we have to live.5 And we can't move out. And  the6 reason we can't move out is because we  can't7 afford to move.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you9	covered by the proviso?10	MS. JOANN ROSS:	I'm sorry?11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Were you12 covered last year by the  proviso?13 You know we have a14 MS. JOANN ROSS:	I don' t know15 what you mean.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	In your17 apartment , in your residence we have  - -  the rent18 increase for SROs, for hotels, has a  cutoff19 point.20 MS. JOANN ROSS:	Yes, I know.21 My landlord is not allowed  to22 get that increase because the rooms  are23 warehoused. But he still told all the tenants,   or24 a lot of the tenants, the ones he thought  would25 be gullible enough to pay it that are left , that12 
2 they had the increase. And they were, gullible and3 some - - and a lot of them paid  it because   they4 are so scared of this landlord who is so mean  and5 so rotten. He doesn' t care about the law, the6 courts or anything.7 He just - -8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.9 But you' re covered10	MS. JOANN ROSS:	Yes.11	CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	- - by the12 proviso .13 MS. JOANN ROSS:	I didn' t pay14 the increase.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	But some16 people - -17 MS. JOANN ROSS:	But a lot of18 the tenants did19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I understand.20 MS. JOANN ROSS:	- - because he21 scared them into paying it.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I understand .23 Thank you.24 MS . ADAMS:	Question.25 MS. JOANN ROSS:	Yes?12 
1	3 4 92	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.3	MS. ADAMS:	How many units are4 there all together in the building where you  are5 and how many are SRO units?6	MS. JOANN ROSS:	Well ,7	originally when I moved in, there were 418  units.8	But with the renovation	well , actually he9 built  some more because he built  three  - - a10 couple of floors on top for more tourist  rooms.11 So it 's about 425 rooms all12 together. And there' s about fifty resident13 tenants. That 's not the exact number. I'm making14 a guess. About fifty of us left  now.15 MS. ADAMS:	Fifty?16 MS. JOANN ROSS:	We' re down - -17 so many have died because of the bad situation   in18 the last five years because of this  landlord19 abusing us and, you know, a horrible  situation.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What hotel is21 this?22 MS. JOANN ROSS:	This is On the23 Av Hotel. They advertise24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	On the Av.25 MS. JOANN ROSS:	- - as being a9 
1	3502 luxury place to come to.3 But you ought to check out  the4 second and third and fourth floors where we   live.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right. I6	understand.7	MS. JOANN ROSS:	Anyway, so8 many have died that it 's down maybe to ten or9 fifteen percent of the rooms occupied now  by10 residents.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That 's the On12 the Av, it 's actually Off the Av.13 MS. JOANN ROSS:	Well , actually14 the doorway is off the Av, but they want to be   on15 the Av. They were going to get an address,  the16 Broadway address, rather than the 77th  Street17 address, but the post off ice wouldn' t let them.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I understand.19 Okay. Thank you.20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Grace Hovey.22 MS. GRACE HOVEY:	Hello! Good23 afternoon.24 I have to say that I stand  here25 dumbfounded. I live in an SRO. I've lived   there8 
1	3512 for the past seventeen years . I live at 166 West3 75th Street.4 And aren' t you aware of the fact5 that you cannot get into an SRO in the  City6 anymore, that the days of SROs apparently  are7 finished?8 I have a tenant living next  to9 me who pays quadruple the rent that I  pay .10 Weren' t SROs established for lower- income people?11 Or as it exists now, solely the upper  middle12 class can afford to move into an SRO .13 The woman next to me has  the14 same exact square feet that I have. She  pays15 $2400 a month . I pay $685 . And, by the way, he is16 going to be putt ing in for a Major Capital17 Improvement . And he does have a restaurant that18 he just put into	onto the ground floor . So he19 also has a commercial building, you  know,20 commercial increase there as well .21 I mean it' s outrageous. Okay.22 Another thing that is very23 strange to me is the fact that we do have to   pay24 the rent increase . I paid it last year . And if25 you guys pass it again this year, I will have   to2 
2 pay.3 Now, why is it that the  landlord4 deserves more rent when he is obviously making   a5 killing?6 (Audience participation. )7	MS. GRACE HOVEY:	SROs don' t8 exist in the City anymore.9 The tenants deserve not to  be10 cheated and that 's what 's happening. If you enact11 a rent increase on SROs, that 's simply what you12 are doing at this point.13 Thank you.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 (Audience participation. )16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sylvia17 Fields.18 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	How do you19 do, Mr. Markus and  Panel!20 I've been coming here for  a21 couple of years and I really wasn' t going to  come22 today, Mr. Markus, because whatever we say  means23 nothing. You already  - -24 (Audience participat ion. )25 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	- - have what8 
2 you want to give and it means  nothing.3 (Audience participation.)4	MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	But the only5 reason I came today, Mr. Markus, is because  we6 have a date. Did you make reservations for   dinner7 tonight?8 I pay $1100 rent and I only  get9 $1040 Social Security. See, I lost weight.  I10 can't afford to eat - -11 (Audience part icipation.)12 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	- - because13 I have so much rent.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You look15 good. You look good.16 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	Never mind.17 Did you make a reservation in the restaurant18 where there's a lot of  food?19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You know,20 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	Because I'm21 hungry tonight.22 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	- - I'm going23 to be all night.24 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	So what25 happened?5 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You'll have3 to wait until it 's over.4	MS . SYLVIA FIELDS:	So what5 time? I 'll wait for you.6 (Laughter.)7	MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	I ' ll wait8 for you. I 'm hungry.9 (Audience participation. )10 MS . SYLVIA FIELDS:	What time?11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I think we' re12 talking about 11:30.13 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	I'll wait 14	to 11:3 0. Don't15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sylvia, I16 know you don't mean it because you're going  to17 miss the bus back. So  - -18 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	Well , I'll19 bring my bus along.20 (Laughter.)21 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	No. You' ll22 send me home with a limousine. I never was in  a23 l imousine.24 (Audience participat ion. )25 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	I never15 
2 rode a limousine.3 Listen, I'm willing to  oblige.4 (Laughter.)5 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	But6 seriously,  I think that you people  - -  I don' t7 know what to say. I can't afford to pay the   rent.8 And I'll have to move. I'll move into  your9 house - -10 (Audience participation.)11 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	- - because12 I have to - - I really can't afford to pay the13 rent . It 's crazy.14 And we are paying so much  money15with MCis andwith everything else, it really  is16a disgrace.17Let Mayor Bloomberg come to  my18apartment andlive the way I live and he' ll see19what it is, what it is to live with a low   income.20So I don' t know what to say. All21I can sayI'msorry you disappointed me for22dinner. Igotall dressed up to go to dinner  with23you.24(Laughter.)25MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	I'm very
2	sorry.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I appreciate4	it.5	MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	Yes. Okay.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thanks.7	MS . SYLVIA FIELDS:	But ,8	listen, consider  - -9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'm going to10	go to Brooklyn.  Where  - -  Ocean Parkway  and where?11	MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	I'll make12 you dinner. Come to my house. I'll make  you13 dinner.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ocean Parkway15 and where?16 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	Neptune17 Avenue . Corner of Neptune Avenue.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Neptune.19 Okay. I know where it  is.20 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	Yeah! It 's21 around where the aquarium  is.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I know where23 it is. I grew up there, you  know.24 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	You come up25 to my house and see because  - -12 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Not too far.3	MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	see my4	house and see the rent that I'm  paying.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'm coming.6	MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	Come.7	Anytime.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' re going9	to Nathan' s.10 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	I don' t11 care. I like  frankfurters.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.13 (Laughter.)14 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	What ever.15 Okay. Thank you very much.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Reverend19 Marshall , Reverend Frederick Norman Marshall.	Is20 he here?21REVERENDFREDERICKMARSHALL:22Yes.23CHAIRMANMARKUS:Okay. Good.24He' scoming.25REVERENDFREDERICKMARSHALL:
2 I'm an eighty- year old World War II veteran with3 little income  - -4 (Audience participation .)5	REVEREND FREDERICK MARSHALL:6 - with little income but from which I pay  sixty7 percent in rent .8 Needless to say I have little  or9 no monies to have my clothes cleaned or  to10 purchase needed food  or medication.	I go to bed11 hungry several evenings per month . And it is  the12 same experience  for thousands of elderly .13 I'm presently involved in  a14 street ministry and it has come to my  attention15 that thousands of our young people have had  to16 quit college or move to New Jersey or  Connecticut17 because they could not pay the crippling rents   in18 New York City.19 Many are living four or five  in20 a one- bedroom apartment , and most of them have21 had  - - most of them had their heart  set  on22 teaching in public schools after graduation .  They23 are now possibly lost to New York  City.24 Rome, Athens, Babylon and  many25 other cities of the then known world  increased6 
2 their rents beyond their citizen' s ability to3 pay. They included folks of lower and  middle4 income. These cities fell from their  previous5 world leadership.6 Let 's remember to hear today, he7 who fails to learn from history is doomed  to8 repeat it.9 Like myself ,  thousands upon10 thousands of New Yorkers are facing hardship  with11 rents that they are unable to pay. And  monies12 we cannot afford any type of rent  increase.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,14 sir.15 (Audience participat ion.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me give17 you our next order. It 's going to be Vincent18 Castellano, Paul Podhaizer, Sabato Noto, and  Rosa19 Maria De La Torre.20 Mr. Castellano.21 MR. VINCENT CASTELLANO:	Good22 afternoon.23 I've been an observer of  this24 Board for more than fifteen years and a member  of25 the Board for five.2 
2	You can tell how popular I  am.  3 I realize that everyone  comes4 here to complain about problems you can't  fix,5 problems with SCRIE or Section 8 or  public6 assistance or housing court or HPD, the list  goes7 on and on.8 But there are problems you  can9 fix. You have the power to correct at least  some10 of the inequities and injustices within  rent11 stabilization. If you lack the will to do  so,12 pl ease say so. But please don't insult our13 intelligence by saying you lack the  power.14 I would like to reference  your15 publication,	"Housing NYC 2003 , 11        page 110,16 Appendix D- 2 says that there are approximat ely17 140, 000 stabilized apartments in New York City18 that rent for less than the cost to  maintain19 them .20 This year' s report indicates21 that the cost of maintaining	an apartment in the22 outer boroughs  -  that 's the other side of  the23 River for you Manhattan types - is approximately 24	$476.00 a month.25	Perhaps someone could explain  to
1	3612 me the reason for the public policy to keep   rents3 below the cost of mandat ed maintenance. How  does4 that achieve anything you want to  achieve?5	It may be good politics, but I6 thought we were here to talk about public  policy.7 You could correct this  inequity8 with just five hands raised on Thursday. But   if9 that is too much to ask, if instant justice   is10 too unreasonable, how about a public  member11 believing	in the principle of fairness to make  a12 proposal to begin to correct this  inequity.13 Another inequity is called  rent14 skewing. Perhaps the bankers and lawyers  never15 heard of it and don' t understand it , but Andrew16 can explain it to you. In short , large  apartments17 turn over, or I should say large apartments   that18 don' t turn over for many, many years have  their19 rents lag far below market.	In fact , they lag far20 below any standard of  reasonableness.21 This book again, page  118,22 Appendix D- 3 , says there are 32 , 000 stabilized23 apartments that have had the same tenant for  more24 than thirty- four years . I think that' s older than25 some members of the Board.6 
1	3622	(Audience participat ion. )3	MR. VINCENT CASTELLANO:	The4 same table indicates that 200, 000 apartments have5 had the same tenant for more than twenty  years.6 I'd like to make a  suggestion7 for a proposal8 (Audience participation.)9	MR. VINCENT  CASTELLANO:	- - for10	your consideration. That is if you can hear  me.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.12 MR. VINCENT CASTELLANO:	For13 any apartment occupied by the same tenant  for14 more than twenty years with a monthly rent  of15 $600 or less, there shall be a  supplementary16 increase  of  $50 per month provided	- -17 (Audience part icipation. )18 MR. VINCENT CASTELLANO:19 provided	- - two provisos.20 (Audience participation. )21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.22 MR. VINCENT CASTELLANO:	The23 apartment has at least two bedrooms as  determined24 by DHCR , the tenant of record is less than  sixty-25 two years of age.12 
2 No attempt here to punish  senior3 citizens, no attempt to add a  supplementary4 increase to small apartments. The purpose is  to5 attack rent skewing.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 (Audience participat ion.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell.9 MR. LUBELL:	Mr. Cast ellano, how10 else do you suggest that we exercise our  power11 and the power that we do have to rectify  problems12 that you just raised in connection with  rent13 stabilized apartments?14 MR . VINCENT CASTELLANO:	You15 know, since I wasn' t prepared for that question,16 I don' t have a great answer.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	That 's good.18 (Laughter.)19 MR. VINCENT  CASTELLANO:	Can I 2O	try?21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oh, sure.22 MR. VINCENT CASTELLANO:	I23 mean - -24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' ll assume25 it 's not a good answer because you said it wasn' t21 
2	a good answer.3	MR. VINCENT CASTELLANO:	All4	right .5	You know, I think the Board  has6 to consider the fact that the Manhattan market ,7 which most of you are more familiar with,  is8 fundamentally different from the outer  borough9 market.10 There was a new mover study  done11 several years ago which said that on  average12 Manhattan apartments, upon vacancy, were  getting13 more than a twenty percent  increase. Twenty14 percent is the statutory standard. So they  are15 getting more than that.16 Whereas in the outer boroughs17 the average increase upon vacancy is about  eight18 percent.19 What does that mean? It means  on20 average the rents in the outer boroughs are  close21 to market , but on average the apartments in22 Manhattan  are not , upon vacancy  anyway.23 So there are all kinds of24 supplements you can add to the outer  boroughs25 which really don' t apply to the Manhattan  market  .6 
1	3652 I mean  the net  operating income ,3 the monthly net operating income for the  average4 apartment in Manhattan is higher than the  average5	rent in the rest of the City .6	You know, it ' s t ime to address7 this issue that one policy does not fit  the8 entire City.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you,10	Mr . Castellano.11	(Audience participation .)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mr . Paul13 Podhaizer.14 Are you Mr . Podhaizer?15 MR . PAUL PODHAIZER :	Yes .16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you.17 Welcome .18 MR. PAUL PODHAIZER:	Mr .19 Castellano is a tough act to follow. I've  watched20 him sitting up there for so many years .21 But , anyway, my name is Paul22 Podhaizer . I 'm  Chairman  of  the Brightwater Towers23 Tenants Council located in Coney Island .24 I also represent Sylvia  Fields,25 2940 and 3000 Ocean Parkway, two buildings  of12 
2 nine hundred tenants, recently sold by the  Trump3 family for millions in profit.4 The Board' s proposal	for a 3 to5 5.5 and 5 to 7.5 percent increase is  highly6 unwarranted.7	Facts are , if you were to8 object ively review and compare the landlords'9 costs against profit for the past twenty  years10 and the current equity, you would honestly  have11 to conclude that the cumulative overstated  Rent12 Guidelines Board increases amount to  probably13 over forty percent. Therefore, tenants should  be14 reduced, the rents should be reduced and  not15 raised.16 (Audience participation.)17 MR. PAUL PODHAIZER:	The high18 vacancy increases have resulted in  rents19 exceeding $2000 monthly and the loss of  thousands20 of regulated apartments. This has  greatly21 increased the landlords' income and  equity.22 The newspapers report daily  on23 the unparalleled boom in the real estate  market.24 A 6/11/04 Post headline25 graphically illustrates these facts, and Iquote:8 
2	Boom Time, Riding Real  Estate  to Riches. "3	I therefore state that real4 estate is the most lucrative business  today.5 Now I would like to address  the6 five public members .7 It is to your credit that  you8 have accepted Mayor Bloomberg' s appointment  offer9 to perform a difficult public service. I  ask,10 despite all the authentic statistics available  to11 you to assist in your decisionmaking, why have12 you passed unwarranted  high rent increases?13 Is it true the newspapers,14 politicians  and smart scuttlebutt unequivocally15 lay the final rent decision on the  Mayor?16 If this were true, I cannot17 believe that five successful non- political people18 like yourselves would willingly place  themselves19 in a position to be thought of as a public  lackey20 for the Mayor .21 I, therefore, ask the  following:22 Are you against rent23 stabilization and rent  control?24 Do you think middle- income25 renters should be afforded  increased protection?4 
2 Do you want a city consisting  of3 only rich and welfare?4	To you, Mr. Markus, I say,  sir,5 show true chairman/leadership.	We are proud6 people. Some are veterans who offered their   lives7 to this country. If we could afford the rents,  we8 certainly wouldn' t be here screaming.9 A reminder, one or two  percent10 may be the cost of a cocktail for you.  However,11 to some renters it may mean the loss  of12 nutritious food and medical  necessities.13 (Audience participat ion.)14 MR. PAUL PODHAIZER:	I hope and15 pray - -16 (Audience participation.)17 MR . PAUL PODHAIZER:	I hope and18 pray after your final decision you can go home,19 look in the mirror, face your family and  friends20 and say I made the right , just and fair decision21 for tenants, landlords and the future of  middle22 class housing in New York  City.23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. PAUL PODHAIZER:	And I25 thank you for your time.5 
2	(Audience participation.)3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,4 Mr. Podhaizer.5 Sabato Noto.6 And let the record reflect  that7 I don' t drink. So no cocktails.8 Mr. Noto.9 Go ahead.10 MR. SABATO NOTO:	Good11 afternoon.12 I'm a small property owner.  I13 live in the building I own. I do most of the  work14 myself and I have a full- t ime job to help me.15 During the prior year the  Rent16 Guidelines Board Price Index was approximately   1717 percent , but yet I was only offered a rent18 increase of 4.5 or 7.5 percent .19 So although my expenses20 increased by 17 percent , my increase in rental21 income was effectively only 3 .75 because most22 people accepted two- year options so only some  of23 my tenants were affected by last year's  increase.24 I should be granted 4.5 or  7.525 percent	increases to make up for the prior year' s10 
2 shortfall , let alone the new Price Index increase3 for this current year.4 I have six tenants in my  rent5 stabilized building. Four of those tenants  earn6 over $100,000 per year.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where is your8	building?9	MR. SABATO NOTO:	On West 80th10 Street .11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.12 MR. SABATO NOTO:	Four of those13 tenants make, as I said, over $100,000 per  year.14 Two of those four own homes out of the City  with15 little or no mortgage on them. They can afford   to16 do this because they've been getting, one of   them17 for ten years and one for twenty- five years, have18 been getting substantially very small  increases19 over the years.20 But the other two tenants that21 don' t earn over $100 , 000, one of them has over a22 half - million dollars in the  bank.23 A VOICE:	How do you know?24 MR. SABATO NOTO:	I know that25 for a fact.10 
2	(Audience participation.)3	MR. SABATO NOTO :	There' s no4 doubt , I'm human, I underst and some of the people5 I've heard speak here today, that legit imate6 rent - stabilized tenants, older tenants on fixed7 income cannot afford huge increases .8	But there could be a review on9 an individual basis of specif ic peopl e with real10 problems . I can understand that.11 (Audience participation.)12 MR . SABATO NOTO:	We small13 property owners need an increase to help  cover14 the costs.15 My tenants and many other rent -16 stabilized tenants are laughing all the way  to17 the bank.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 (Audience participat ion.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Rosa Maria De21 La Torre, Barbara Kermode, Kam Metcalf , Thomas22 Diana .23 MS . LINDA RIERA:	My name is24 Linda Riera, R - i - e- r- a.25 And the reason why she asked  me9 
2 to stand in for her is I'm third generation  from3 Chelsea in Midtown Manhattan. As you can see  by4 my shirt , it 's exactly where they want to put the5 new Westside Stadium, down the block from  my6 apartment.7 When I was raised in  Chelsea,8 when I was born there fifty- two years ago, it was9 a blue- collar neighborhood.	It was factories . It10 was tenements. We had a bathtub in the  kitchen11 and everybody was happy.12 Now it has been decided,  because13 of the deterioration in rent laws and  everything14 else, that it 's a good idea to get tenants that15 can pay for, that blue- collar workers can pay.16 And so landlords have  basically17 thrown up their hands and let conditions  worsen18 to the point where if you had an alternative,  you19 left Chelsea.20 It 's where no one wanted to21 live, right on the edge of Hell 's Kitchen, which22 is now so gentrif ied it ' s called Clinton .23 (Laughter.)24 MS. LINDA RIERA:	Now if you25 wanted to come back to Chelsea where I was  raised2 
2 and still remain, you can't afford it. My  sister3 can't afford to live in the apartment we  were4 raised in.5 Right now I was the last  tenant6 to remain in my building. They disassembl ed my7 building where I was the only apartment  that8 remained. For two- and - a-half years I lived there9 with a stairway and me because there is   nowhere10 to go.11 And they rebuilt the  building.12 Everyone there pays $4800 a month rent except   for13 me because my father- in- law moved into my14 apartment in 1945 when they got him from   Puerto15 Rico.16 What I'm saying to you is  the17 rent increases are driving peopl e from their18 homes. I grew up with families that now live   in19 homeless shelters. There was a time where  you20 could move to the outer boroughs. Well , you'd21 bett er think of Ohio because you can't afford  the22 outer boroughs anymore.23 (Audience participation.)24 MS. LINDA RIERA:	So I have25 decided, like many others, to stay exactly   where2 
2 I am. Affordable housing should be considered  a3 basic human right.4 (Audience participat ion. )5	MS. LINDA RIERA:	I consider it6	so.7	(Audience participation.)8	MS. LINDA RIERA:	I come to you9 humbly in the tradition of Ms. Jane Wood, who  we10 lost this year. I'm part of her Coalition.  Now11 that the older generation of activists  and12 advocates are gone, don't think we are  going13 away. We were well - trained and we know how to14 bring our point to you.15 We don' t beg you for a rent16 freeze because we know that is not something  that17 we should beg you for. You' ll never give a18 rollback. We are saying that if you  are19 responsive to the human beings who are  coming20 here today to pass on information to you so   that21 you can have an informed decision to be made,22 only a rent freeze is acceptable to the  tenants23 of the City of New York.24 (Audience participation.)25 MS.

2(Audience participation.)3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Barbara4Kermode.5Barbara, are you here? There  she6is.7MS. BARBARA KERMODE:	My name is8 Barbara Kermode. I'm a small property owner   with9 my boyfriend , Sabato Noto. We live in the10 building and co-manage it  together.11	A VOICE:	We can't hear you.12 MS. BARBARA KERMODE:	Okay. I'm13 going to start again.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.15 MS. BARBARA KERMODE:	My name16 is Barbara Kermode. I'm a small property  owner17 with my boyfriend, Sabato Noto. We live in  the18 building and co-manage it  together.19 The issue I would like  to20 discuss today is the Price Index of  Operating21 Costs which the Rent Guidelines Board uses  to22 decide rent increases. I would like to point  out23 how far from the truth some of these numbers  are24 in our particular case.25 One component of the Index  is12 
2 real estat e taxes. The percentage	index used by3 the Rent Guidelines Board is 16.2 percent . Our4 reality is quite different . When we bought the5 building two- and- a- half years ago, our real6 estate tax was about $25,000 per year.  This7 coming tax year, two- and - a-half years later, our8 tax will be $37,000 per year. That is a  489 percent increase in two- and- a- half years .10 But even more alarming is  where11 our taxes are projected to go. Due to  a12 reassessment because of the recent purchase,  our13 real estate taxes are projected to go to  $82,91314 per year. This will take .t ime, of course, because15 by law now the real estat e tax can only go up16 eight percent per year and a maximum of  thirty17 percent over five years.18 But eventually our taxes  are19 projected to rise from about $25,000 per year  to20 almost $83 ,000 per year . That is a 232 percent21 increase.22 A second component of the  Price23 Index of Operat ing Costs which is totally24 inaccurate in our case is the fuel  cost25 component . The Rent  Guidelines  Board  estimates2 
2 fuel costs to have decreased by 2. 8 percent. Our3 building uses #2 fuel oil for both heat and  hot4 water.5 Now, everybody is well aware  of6 what has happened to the price of oil lately.  The7 numbers I will quote you compare 2002 and  2003 .8 In 2002, our fuel oil bill was  approximately9 $5500 for the year.  In  ' 03 the number was  $7,000.10 That is a 27 percent increase from '02 to '03 .11 And these numbers do not fully reflect the  severe12 oil price increases of late .13 To conclude, as far as the14 operation of our building is concerned , two very15 important components of the Price Index  of16 Operating Costs - real estate tax and  fuel17 costs  -  are  severely understated.18 Therefore, I am asking the  Board19 to please keep this in mind when it makes  its20 decision on fair, equitable and  representative21 rent increases this year.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 MS. BARBARA KERMODE:	Thank24 you.25 (Audience participation. )2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quest ion.3 Ma' am, ma' am, there' s a4 question.5	MR. PAGAN:	I 'm just curious.6	How many apartments in your  building?7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Six .8 MS. BARBARA KERMODE:	There' s9	six besides ours.10 MR. PAGAN:	And how many are11 stabilized?12 MS. BARBARA KERMODE:	Are what?13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Stabilized.14 MS . BARBARA KERMODE:	Six.15 MR. PAGAN:	All of them?16 MS. BARBARA KERMODE:	Yes.17 MR. PAGAN:	Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .19 Okay.20 Kam Metcalf.21 MS. KAM METCALF:	Hi!22 When I came today, I was  told23 that personal testimony is better. And I didn' t24 really know that .25 But what I have to say is what  I10 
2	want to say.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. We hope4 that what you have to say is what you want  to5 say.6	MS . KAM METCALF:	I don' t7 appreciate your jokes actually. I think this is   a8 very serious matter .9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.10 MS . KAM METCALF:	My name is11 Kam Metcalf and I live in Chelsea,  Manhattan.12 My first Rent Guidelines  Board13 meeting was May  10 , 2004 . At that meeting  the14 rent range was sprung upon the group. It  took15 everyone off - guard and was bulldozed through as16 far as I could see to everyone' s confusion and17 surprise.18 And the low end of this  range19 was set higher than was  expected.20 In the words of The New  York21 Times the next day, quote, for most of the  last22 decade rents for stabilized apartments have  gone23 up a few percentage points in keeping with   low24 inflation and to a lesser degree with  annual25 surveys measuring	landlord costs and incomes,10 
2 close quote.3 To my great shock and dismay  the4 majority of public members of this Board  voted5 this range through.6	And, by the way, from what  I7 understand , the rent increase this year will be8 based  largely on an " if , " the lead paint hazard9 costs, that they are high. My own building , with10 approximately ninety rent stabilized units out  of11 450 , is two years old. There are no lead paint12 hazards. For how many old buildings is  this13 hypothetical	cost actually necessary?14 But my purpose today, in being15 here today, is to charge the public members  of16 this Board - Betty Phillips Adams, Gale  D.17 Kaufman, Elizabeth Lusskin and Martin Zelnik -  to18 fulfill their obligation as just that , public19 members,  and  approve  a low percentage	increase ,20 figuring an increase is even necessary,  lower21 than the low end of this hurriedly passed  range.22 Again I quote The New  York23 Times, of the City' s 3 million dwelling units,24 about 2 million are occupied by renters,  close25 quote. That 's your public.7 
2 A vot e for any kind of increase3 would not be truly representing the public   you4 were appointed to  serve.5 If you don' t vot e as your6 public' s representative, you shouldn' t be on that7 Board in this capacity.8 (Audience participation.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 Thomas Diana.11 After Mr. Diana, Jose  Jorge,12 Melvyn Trepper, Steven Cross and Chuck  Gedensky.13 A VOICE:	What number of tenants14 are you up to?15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	90, number16 90. Mr. Jorge is number  90.17 MR. THOMAS DIANA:	Anot her year18 we play the same game. The Board spends  thousands19 of dollars calculating every nuance of  price20 changes to determine that the average operat ing21 cost in New York City is $676. That 's from your22 own page  19 of your own calculation  - -23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 MR. THOMAS DIANA:	adjusted.25 So I've already done the math for  you.10 
2 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Okay . I3 appreciate it.4	MR . THOMAS DIANA :	Okay?5	Yet you set your minimum at  only6 $214, supposedly to provide housing for a  single7 adult  on welfare .8 Let them get a roommate   -9 okay? - and raise the rent to $428 a month,  which10 is still $111 cheaper than the $539  operating11 cost of an apartment in Brooklyn.12 The same politicians who  have13 doubled our property  taxes, quadrupled our water14 bills and failed to provide suff icient public15 subsidized housing come here to rail against  rent16 hikes for below- cost apartments which are often17 cheaper than the few that they have  actually18 created .19 How many apartments have  they20 provided for an operating cost of $846  in21 Manhattan?22 Directors of the so- called not -23 for-profit groups do get a salary . Their staff24 does get a salary. Why not a landlord? Ask  them25 if their operating costs are over $652 in  Upper6 
2 Manhattan. How much is their government  grants?3 Persons over sixty- two in Queens4 seem to think that the base cost of $557  -5 okay? - is cut in half because they had  a6 birthday. I wish they would tell the  insurance7 company that has charged me almost $3000 more  a8 year that that was so. I wish they would give  me9 that discount.10 I have dozens of copies of  the11 Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption, the  same12 as I had last year . Only one tenant stopped and13 asked me for it. One tenant out of three  tenants14 that came here last year . Okay?15 Yet none of the tenants  this16 year are going to ask me for a copy of this . Why?17 Because a lot of them are hiding  income.18 (Audience participat ion. )19 MR . THOMAS DIANA:	According to20 The New York Times they've arrested 336   tenants21 in the last ten years for that same practice .22 (Audience participation.)23 MR. THOMAS DIANA:	Hiding24 income .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The New York2 
  2 Times is3 MR. THOMAS DIANA:	Instead of4 facts, tenants and Board Members shamelessly  rely5 on every racist stereotype that works to  their6 advantage. Okay? Everyone has been paying  for7 college for twelve years, yet no student has  ever8 graduated.9 (Audience participation. )10 MR. THOMAS DIANA:	Let 's not11 play the stereotype race card, the senior's   card12 and the percentage game.13 (Audience participation.)14 MR. THOMAS DIANA:	Apartments	- 1516 Thank you.17 MR. THOMAS DIANA:	Apartments18 below cost require a large real dollar  increase.19 The rent surcharge should cut in to match  your20 own rent cost of  $676 a month.  That 's your cost ,21 not ours. Okay? They should receive a  $5022 surcharge. Okay?23 Why should tenants who  are24 paying for their fair share have to pay even   more25 for an apartment?16 
2 (Audience participation.)3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 (Audience participation.)5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Jose Jorge,6 are you here?7 MR. JOSE JORGE:	Yes .8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 Welcome back .10 MR . JOSE JORGE :	My name is Jose11 Jorge. My name is Jose Jorge . I am an SRO tenant .12 (Audience participation. )13 MR. JOSE JORGE:	I came here14 today to testify against any rent increase .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Quiet .16 MR . JOSE JORGE :	I came here to17 test ify against any rent increase which I believe18 my landlord doesn' t need .19 The reason is that my hotel  is20 being  illegally  converted  into  apartment , luxury21 apartment , studio . All  the increase  for the22 improvement go to the high price. The  regulators23 as soon they change in the SRO hotel  for24 apartment or single room, no more tenant .25 If you want to go there,  you2 
2 have to buy condo or what ever. That 's what we see3 the change now. There' s no more leasing in4 Manhattan. You can't get a lease unless you go   to5 Upper Manhattan.6 The City landlords have  taken7 over the City. I live in this City for  forty-8 five years and I have seen the  changing.9 (Unintelligible) because the10 landlord , the NCA and the Rent Guidelines Board11 increase the renter, and people like myself ,12 retired , only live in Manhattan ten percent in13 SRO hotel. We only get Social Security  payment.14 And the Social Security is nothing if a  huge15 increase in the rent.16 This year the Social  Security,17 the increase will be very  little.18 So I don' t think that you will19 be able to raise this year the rent because  too20 many people here that , even before, like myself21 for forty- five years, working $1 an hour. That  is22 what my salary was when I came here to this   City23 forty- five year ago, $1 an hour. So my Social24 Security is nothing to challenge the rent and   the25 cost of living.2 
1	3872 So for you to keep  increasing,3 increasing	(unintelligible)4 Please don't increase the  rent.5 Protect the hotel like myself.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 (Audience participation. )8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Melvin9	Trepper.10	MR. MELVIN TREPPER:	Hello!11	I own a six- family building in12 Bushwick, Brooklyn.13 A VOICE:	We can't hear you.14 MR. MELVIN TREPPER:	I own a15 six- family building  in Bushwick, Brooklyn.16 I want to say a few things.  I17 don't have time.18 My costs, for example, to hire  a19 plumber or an electrician or a carpenter  are20 going to be the same costs that if I had a  good21 building in Manhattan, except I can't achieve  the22 kind of rents that they have in  Manhattan.23 And I want to offer a kind of  -24 - I want to offer a few  examples.25 Last year I had to replace  two12 
1	3882 hot water tanks in my building. So I went to  Home3 Depot , the cheapest place I could find, and paid4 $1600 to put in two hot water tanks in  the5 building.6 Those tanks are going to have  to7 be replaced around every three to five years in  a8 multi - family building. They are not eligible9 either for J51 or for MCis because in order to  be10 eligible for those kinds of increases or  tax11 benefits, a plumber has to file it in  the12 Building Department. And the hot water tank,  all13 you do is you take out the old hot water tank  and14 move the other one in.15 In order to file it , they told16 me it would be about another $1500. So it doesn' t17 make economic sense to file  it.18 So that 's a cost that doesn' t19 show up in your annual increases of repair  and20 maintenance  expenses because it occurs every21 three to five years. I think that should  be22 factored in, those items which are not eligibl e23againfor MCIor J51 but are really, in effect ,24majorcapitalimprovements. That 's number one.25Number two, I bought  this
2 building  in foreclosure  in  1    96. About  four or3 five of my tenants  - it 's a six- family building	-4 have washing machines. What happens with  a5 washing machine  is that  - -  I use up an awful6 amount of water in this building with  these7 tenants because most  of  - -  all two-bedroom8 apartments, most of the tenants have  children.9 And there' s an awful lot of water that gets10 consumed.11	And while the annual increase12 may be only 5 .5 or 6.5 percent , the total13 absolute cost is much higher than a building  in14 Manhattan where most of the people go out to  work15 and they come home only in the  evening.16 So that also - - I 'm talking17 about not only the average annual  increase ,   but18 also you have to factor in for variables  like19 this where the tenants may have children,  where20 they want to do a wash, they just throw one  shirt21 into the washing machine because they're  not22 paying for it .23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.

I'm a Vice Chair for  the13 Metropolitan Council on Housing as you know.14 And normally I would have  come15 here and spoken in general terms about the  rent16 increases and things that I notice as a  housing17 activist.18 Today I'm actually here to  speak19 about my own personal experience. I don't  know20 where Vince Castellano gets the figure of  rent21 stabilized apartments under $400, around  $400.22 I - -  longevity, right?  I moved  into my apartment23 thirty- two years ago. It was $175. The percent24 increase of my rent has been 225 percent . I'm25 still a lucky person. My rent is still  under12 
2 $600. I'm also a lucky person in that  I'm3 employed. I have a nice part - time job. If I'm4 able to earn the rate that I'm earning now,  I5 might make about $24,000 with my job and  my6 freelance work for which I incur some expenses   in7 my house.8 Okay. Fine.9 But remember what Lenora  Hemsley10 said about rich people don't pay taxes,  the11 little people pay taxes. I'm here to tell you   the12 little people pay taxes on our little incomes   so13 that my rent as a percentage of my after- tax14 income is now more than 37  percent.15 On a little income the  dollar16 figure is not high when you have taken away  your17 37 percent.18 On the other hand , these rent19 increases, a 3 percent rent increase on a  $60020 apartment is not what it would be on a  $40021 apartment. Your dollar figures keep getting22 higher and they keep getting to be a bigger   and23 bigger bite out of what 's left to us.24 Now, I don't know if anybody25 here , have you noticed with the deregulation  of2 
2 electricity, has your electric bill gone  down?3 Mine has not gone down. Mine is going  up.4 My phone bill has gone  up.5 No, he didn' t even set the6 clock.7	My phone bill is going up  in8	some absurd fashion.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Then you're10	lucky.11	MS . BONNIE PIGALLE:	Okay.12 Yeah, yeah. I am a lucky  person.13 Every month  there  is either - -14 you know, my pathetic health insurance that 's15 just enough to keep me from being thrown  out16 you know, to die in the street like a dog if   I17 have to go to the hospital.18 (Audience participation.)19 MS. BONNIE PIGALLE:	Yes, I20 have health insurance. I pay $339 a quarter  for21 it . So, you know, every three months that 's going22 to come up. On another t ime it 's going to be23 something else, an emergency visit to the  dent ist24 because you can't keep a middle- class job with  a25 broken front tooth. You have to go to  the12 
2dent ist.Right?3So when these folks are  talking4about dothey have to deny their kids food,  the5 answer is yes. They have to deny their kids   food.6 All right?7	Me, I make my lunch  everyday8 because I can't possibly afford to buy a   lunch9 out . But already the interior dialogue when  I'm10 walking through the food store, I can't  afford11 that , I can't afford  that , who could afford  that ,12 I can't afford that.13 Right?  It's already  like that .14 It 's already like that. I eke it out with the15 milk they put out for the coffee at work. I   can't16 drink coffee anyway because  I have stomach17 trouble for which I can't afford the  medication.18 And I'm lucky.  Okay?19 What does a median income  of20 $31,000 mean? It means that half of the people  in21 rent stabilized housing make less than $31,000.  I22 would be willing to bet you that a fair   number23makeless than I make and already pay more  rent24thanI pay.25Okay?
2 Now, I pride myself on my3 ability to pinch a penny until it screams.  Okay?4 I make my lunch. I make my supper . I make my5	breakfast. I don't eat out at all .6 I rarely go to a movie. There' s7 like - - there' s nothing, there' s nowhere left  to8 go.9 You know, I checked out , what 's10 this increase going to be. It 's approximately the11 cost of my lunch. So I'm going to leave my  lunch12 here. I'm going to leave my lunch here .13 (Audience participation.)14 MS . BONNIE PIGALLE:	What I15 want to know is since you also know that  the16 median income of the landlords is $61,000,  what17 makes you imagine it 's a good idea to take lunch18 money from peopl e whose income is less than19 $31,000 and give it to people whose income  is20 doubl e that?21 It 's social engineering all22 right. What kind of social engineering is  it?23 (Audience participation.)24 MS. BONNIE PIGALLE:	What kind25 of social engineering is it? What are you  doing6 
2 here?3 We have been long overdue for  a4 freeze. You are all coming off 4  percent5 increases. We've had them for years. My rent  has6 gone up forty percent  in the last ten years when7 landlords'  incomes were going up  - what  is it?  -8 thirty percent. Their incomes are going up;   our9 incomes are going down.10 Why are you taking our money to11 give to them? I feel like I'm being held up in   an12 alley, dragged  into an alley  - -13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. BONNIE PIGALLE:	- - and15 held up.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 MS. BONNIE PIGALLE:	The fact18 that you do it with a fountain pen and not with   a19 gun does not make it feel any  better.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 Chuck Gedensky.22 MR. CHUCK GEDENSKY:	I'm a23 small property owner from Queens. I provide   an24 essential service to many tenants in the City  of25 New York and that is  shelter.2 
13 9 62There is also  food , there is3alsoclothing, the essentials for one to live  by4eachday.5(Audience participation.)6MR. CHUCK GEDENSKY:	If you go7intothe supermarket , the price of milk goes up.8 The proprietor of the supermarket increased  the9 price of milk recently by 15 or 20  percent.10 If you go into a store and  the11 price of fabrics and materials goes up,  they12 increase it by 10, 15, 20  percent.13 What we are asking for today  is14 basically an increase to subsidize the costs  that15 we are experiencing today . It 's not about the16 cost of a dentist . It 's not about the cost of a17 phone bill.  It ' s about the cost of running  a18 building.19 The majority of the peopl e20 sitting here today and speaking, a lot of  them21 are senior citizens and I hope that  everyone22 lives to a 120. But they have an advantage.  If23 the rent goes up, they have one of the  most24 the best program the government offers,  Senior25 Cit izen Rent Exempt ion.8 
2	(Audience participation.)3	MR. CHUCK GEDENSKY:	It 's a4 very easy program to administer. If you  qualify,5 if your income qualif ies, you will get it. If you6 are making too much money, you won' t get it.7 That 's true.8 (Audience participation.)9	MR. CHUCK GEDENSKY:	Inflation,10 the cost of running buildings is not always   in11 touch with the cost of the general inflat ion of12 the economy. And right now the cost of  running13 our buildings with the increases in fuel and  real14 estate taxes and the cost of materials to run   the15 building  far exceeds the inflation rates.16 I have tenants who are paying  me17 $572, $636 a month for three- bedroom apartments.18 It just doesn' t keep up with the cost of running19 the building.20 I want to keep the services up.21 I want to keep a good  building.22 There' s a woman over there that23 says why did you buy it. I bought the building   to24 provide a service.25 (Audience participation.)10 
2 MR. CHUCK GEDENSKY:	Each year3 that the Rent Guidelines Board, in order for  me4 to provide  the service,  if the increase  - -5	(Audience participation.)6	MR. CHUCK GEDENSKY:	- - the7 cost of ut ilities go up, I have to ask for an8 increase in the rents that I'm  receiving.9	(Audience participation. )10	MR. CHUCK GEDENSKY:	Non-11	payments,12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.14 MR. CHUCK GEDENSKY:	- - aged15 buildings, these things all come into play   in16 running the buildings.17 And, again, I have yet to  go18 into housing court and see a senior citizen  get19 evicted. You go into housing court , you don' t see20 the senior citizens. There are programs there   for21 them.22 (Audience participation.)23 MR. CHUCK GEDENSKY:	If24 anything else, I have young families who  need25 these  larger  apartments but because	- - I have12 
2 tenants who would move to smaller apartments  but3 they can' t afford to. They are paying $636 a4 mont h for a three- bedroom apartment , one person5 occupying it , where I have families with two kids6 living in one- bedroom apartments.7 But the system doesn' t allow8 them to move into another apartment .9 So if the rent could go up  in10 proportion to what the expenses are of  running11 the building, I think we would have a  better12 relief for families, for landlords, and we  would13 have better housing in the City of New  York.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 (Audience participation. )16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next four17 - we' re up to 97 - - the next  four speakers  are:18 Ricardo Jimenez, Manuel Castro, Mina  Hirschberg19 and Janet Henne.20 Ricardo, is that you?21 And it 's 5:15 now. At six22 o'clock we are going to switch to two  minutes.2 3	MR. RICARDO JIMENEZ:	My name24 is Ricardo Jimenez.  I am live at 260 West  l O O th25 Street.24 
2 I come here to tell you I  live3 260 West  l O O th Street , Leland Hotel. I live there4 for twenty- five years.5 And I have many problems  with6 the owners. One year ago I thought there' s a lot7 of changes and I love animals. And I was  very8 sick for tachesis. I have tachesis over  here.9 Microbe pneubitis is the name of the fungus   that10 kill anybody.11 And I go to the hospital.  They12 use four kinds of penicillin to take it out.   You13 know it's every expensive.14 And I come here to tell you  to15 vote to bring	(unintelligible) and kill the16 changes.17 Five years ago too they  attack18 me, the securities, they attack at the night.   I19 had the police over here. They attack me.  The20 owner told me he got a license to use a  gun.21 Understand? That 's what I come22 to tell you to help me because I am now sick.   I23 have operations on my brain, you know, for24 accident.25 That 's it. Thank you very much.2 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3 (Audience participation. )4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Castro,5	Manuel Castro.6	Mr. Castro, are you here?7 (No response.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mina9	Hirschberg.10	You here? Is that you?11	MS. MINA HIRSCHBERG:	My name12 is Mina Hirschberg. I reside at The Hudson  Hotel,13 an Ian Schrager property.14 We have close to a hundred  and15 fifty SRO tenants still living at The Hudson  and16 the rest , of course, are people, you know,17 visit ing.18 I've been living at The  Hudson19 Hotel for forty- five years. Now, it 's20 understandable that we are not supposed to  be21 harassed. But I am being harassed  daily.22 I live on a guest floor. I'm  not23 on an SRO floor. So, therefore, the guests  are24 very curious about me.	"What are you doing here? "25 You know, like I have to apologize for  living.12 
2	Now I am eighty years of  age,3 you know, and I 've been working since I'm4 sixteen . And I refuse to be harassed on this5 basis. They listen in at my door. They l isten in6 when I get up at night. They listen to when I  go7 to the toilet , when I get up in the morning.8 The maids are curious about  me.9 What is this? What kind of world do we l ive in?10 I've done a lot for people,  more11 than they ever did for me . And why am I being12 treated like this? I'd like to  know.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 MS. MINA HIRSCHBERG:	Thank15 you.16 (Audience part icipation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Janet Henne .18 MS. JANET HENNE:	Chairman, the19 last time I was here at the last hearing  I20 assumed it was a given that you were  impartial.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Excuse me?2 2	MS . JANET HENNE :	I was hoping23 and feeling, and hoping that you would  be24 impartial , this whole  Panel .25 The last hearing I was here  I23 
1	4032 was sitting over there. I was attacked by  a3 landlord representative  verbally  and physically.4	I looked at you, Chairman,  to5 see if you would do anything. You did nothing  and6 when you finally did something, you told  the7 person to shut up and told me to shut  up.8	I sat there like Gandhi. So  I'm9	not too secure in feeling that you are  impartial.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.11	MS. JANET HENNE:	Now, what I'm12 going to discuss is the harassment , the lack  of13 services that we are  getting.14 I live in Queens. My  landlord15 calls it a luxury building. We get no repairs.  We16 get no services.17 Is this included  in their  - - the18 increase in the money they are making? No, it 's19 not.20 We are getting less  there.21 Tenants are being insulted when they ask for   a22 repair, a simple repair. Our building  is getting23 filthy. There is nobody cleaning  up.24 I think that 's certainly a large25 part of their income. I know that the average  is12 
2 supposed to be forty- five percent they' re making,3 which doesn' t seem to be enough.4 But you add in the lack of5 services, let 's make i t	sixty percent. And you6 don' t fe e l that 's enough7	And as I said, I live in  Queens.8 A studio is going for $1300. And your ceiling   can9 fall on your head , too bad. We might get to it a10 month later is the  attitude.11 And you're listening to12 landlords who are crying. My landlord is one  of13 the largest  - -  is probably  the largest landlord14 of rent stabilized apartments. Bert passed away   a15 billionaire.  The family is still billionaires.16 So should we cry? Should  we17 suffer? Should we be paying rent until we have   to18 move out? We actually have empty apartments   now19 because people can't take it. They can't  stand20 it . They're leaving.21 But senior citizens and  the22 people who have families, they're stuck,  they23 can't leave.24 People are leaving and buying25 houses. People are leaving the state . People  are8 
2leavingthecountry.3You are destroying New  York.4Thank you.5(Audience participation. )6A TENANT:	We meet again. It7 seems that I come here every year and all I  know8 is say raise the rent. All they know is raise  the9 rent , not what they deserve. Why don't the10 landlords show their books and see what  they11 deserve?12 (Audience part icipation. )13 A TENANT:	All they want to14 know is can they get me and raise the rent ,  raise15 the rent.16 I just spoke to a woman out17 here, a landlord. And  she said I paid  - -  I took18 my place from for my mother. My increase  went19 from one, say, two percent to a thousand  percent20 increase in her property. My former  landlord21 (Audience participation.)22 A TENANT:	And where are they23 getting them? The landlords	and the rent24 control is giving rent.25 Mr. Lubell is sitting here.  His7 
1	4062 side kick came here . So he said speak over here3 and not stand there, Mr. Castellano, like he  did4 last year.5	I 've got a - - I got a rent. I6 hear all year rent , rent , rent. I'm a veteran.   I7 fought in the war. And what do I come back  to8 this big rent increases. No, it 's unfair. It 's9 not right. It shouldn' t be done .10 You people know you shouldn' t.11	(Audience participation. )12 A TENANT :	Are you people going13 to go home to your children today and say,  look,14 we did the right thing? You didn' t do the right15 thing. It should be zero,  zero.16 Once in a while give us a break .17 We are entitled to a break once in a  while.18 I know the story you got.  I'll19 tell a story . In Nazi Germany the landlords went20 out and kicked out the tenants and they  say,21 well , it 's my job . Are you going to be the same22 way to be Nazi Germany and say it 's our job to23 raise our rent? No, you shouldn' t do that . You24 know you're not right.25 The landlords of the City of  New12 
1	4072 York are getting fat off the people here and  we3 don' t want it to happen again.4 We need new people. The only  two5 people here are the same two people  who6 represent. They don' t represent. They represent7 the money of the City of New York . We represent8 the people who live here, who want to live  here.9 We don' t want to move .10 (Audience part icipation. )11 A TENANT:	We want to stay here.12 We want to be part of New York. We want to  be13 part of	and bring our children here  too.14 So, please, have a heart.  When15 you go into there today say to yourself , listen,16 it 's enough, we have enough. We got to have a17 decrease  in rent , not  an increase.18 I leave you with two words in19 the Jewish saying, and I leave it to you  now,20 "vivala shir, " how much is enough enough.21 (Audience participation. )22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Councilmember23 Christ ine Quinn.24 COUNCILMEMBER  CHRISTINE QUINN:25 Hello!2 
1	4082	My name is Christine Quinn and  I3 represent the 3rd Council  District.4 Let me state for the record5 that , given the affordability or lack thereof of6 rent ing an apartment in my district and in New7 York City, the vitality of the real  estate8 industry, the costs of maintaining	real estate9 versus the profits gained by owners, and  the10 Price Index, there is absolutely no way  that11 owners should benefit from the proposed  rent12 increase of 3 to 5 percent for one-year  leases13 and 5.5 to 7.5 percent for two-year  leases.14 As a result , I am calling for  a15 rent freeze. All economic indicators point to  the16 need for relief for tenants who year after  year17 endure the hardships of skyrocket ing rents and18 plummeting wages.19 It is becoming increasingly20 difficult for tenants to pay all of their  bills21 and pay for their health care and other  needs.22 The RGB report points to a  523 percent decline in tenant incomes. Rent - to- income24 rat ios are 28.6 percent citywide. The same ratio25 was 20 percent in 1970.3 
2	At the same time  unemployment3 has risen 8.5 percent . Further evidence of the4 crisis of affordability points to the  high5 eviction rates and increasing levels of  non-6 payment petit ion filings.7 Specifically, more than 230, 0008 households in New York City have been evicted   in9 the last ten years.10 In short ,  these  rent increases11 have played and continue to play a crucial   role12 in making New York City the most  unaffordable13 place to live in this  country.14 If you look at the Rent15 Guidelines Board' s mortgage  survey, interest16 rates obviously were at an all - time low. As a17 result of this occurrence, many landlords saw   the18 benefits of these low- interest rates and took19 advantage by applying for new loans  and20 refinancing their mortgages. New loan21 applications were up by 55 percent  while22 refinancings were up 68.5  percent.23 Vacancy and collection  losses24 continued to decline . These loses fell to 3.5625 percent.3 
2 As a result of a 3.56  percent3 drop in vacancy and collection loses, the  New4 York City Department of Finance reported  that5 gaps between registered rent levels and  actual6 rental income fell .7 Similarly, RGB staff found  that8 the operation and maintenance to income ratio  has9 remained at 57.4 percent , well below the 6210 percent ratio that existed thirty- five years  ago.11 Consequently,  landlords' Net Operat ing Incomes12 have risen from an average of 38 to 43 percent  of13 the rent rolls.14 Moreover, Rent Guidelines  Board15 staff has also discovered that the Net  Operating16 Increases rose 18 percent  adjusted for inflation17 from 1989 to 2002. Taking this data into account ,18 it seems that increases in profitability  directly19 correspond to generous rent adjustments by  this20 Board.21 In closing, the increase in  the22 Price Index can be attributed to the increase   in23 the property tax rather than increases in  other24 expenditures.  That  said ,  I strongly believe that25 landlords should not pass the full burden  of2 
2highertaxes on to tenants. The burden should  be3sharedequally by all.4The residential  real estate5 industry is doing very well despite  past6 recessions. Owners should not get another  rent7 increase unless it is absolutely needed. In  this8 case today I do not think an increase is  fair9 and/or warrant ed.10 I strongly urge the Rent11 Guidelines Board to freeze rents at the  rates12 they are presently at.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Zelnik.15 Mr. Zelnik has a quest ion.16 MR. ZELNIK:	Yes.17 I hear in your voice , and it 's18 shared by other people here, the need to  maintain19 the affordability of the existing housing  stock.20 And obviously there is a conflict between   the21 needs of the tenants and there is a  conflict22 between what the landlords perceive they need   or23 the building owners perceive.24 What I don't hear with the  same25 passion, not only today but as a citizen of  New5 
2 York for twelve months a year, I don' t hear the3 passion from the City Council in terms of  making4 sure that new affordable housing is being  built5 in this City.6 I don't hear it from upstate  and7 I don' t hear it from people that are representing8 locally.9 And I just wonder what is  going10 on in terms of the City Council and your  own11 personal agenda in terms of getting  affordable12 housing built in all five  boroughs.13 COUNCILMEMBER  CHRISTINE QUINN:14 Well , I think you're very right that there    needs15 to be a much greater focus on creating  affordable16 housing. And let me just speak to some of  the17 stuff that  I'm doing because  that 's - - you know,18 you will have to ask other Council Members  and19 the Mayor himself.20 First of all ,  in my district21 right now, for better or worse,  it ' s facing  the22 most massive rezoning that the City has   seen23 potentially ever with the Hudson Yards and  West24 Side zoning.25 The City, when they put that2 
1	4132 plan forward, said that it would  include3 affordable housing. Yet there is nothing in  any4 plan that Deputy Mayor Doctoroff or  Mayor5 Bloomberg have put out that actually speaks  to6 what ' s the reality of the affordable  housing  in7 this, the biggest upzoning  ever.8 So one thing that I have done9 and it is part of my agenda and I will  continue10 to do, and did just yesterday at a public  hearing11 at City Hall , is implore, beg the Bloomberg12 Administration  to put something to back up  their13 assert ion that that plan will create affordable14 housing .15 If they think this is the most16 important land use and economic development  that17 they can do, which  I disagree with  it , but  if18 they think that and as a result of that it  can19 create affordable housing, they need to show  us20 how.21 Secondly, in my district  there22 is another rezoning relating to slightly south  of23 the Hudson Yards. Again, the City has said  in24 that that the rezoning will create  affordable25 housing but have not shown us how .2 
2 They've raised the specter  that3 a lot on Ninth Avenue and 25th Street , which is4 publicly owned by the Housing Authority, could  be5 disposed of to a not - for-profit to build housing.6 I've again - and any help from the  Rent7 Guidelines Board would be great - I've urged   them8 to put something to paper and show me where  that9 affordable housing will come  from.10 In addition, the New York  State11 Affordable  Housing Association,  NYSAHA  -  I might12 not have how you say that right - and  ACORN,13 which is an interesting group of bedfellows,  have14 come together and are pushing for an expansion  of15 Mayor Bloomberg' s affordable housing initiative16 in the capital budget.17 Many members of the City18 Council , myself , my  colleagues who  are members of19 the Black, Latino and Asian Caucus are  pushing20 aggressively in this budget process to try to  get21 that to happen, to try to get a bigger part  of22 the capital budget , which the Council and the23 Mayor will pass, dedicated to the creation  of24 affordable housing.25 Because one of my concerns  about2 
2 the small amount of capital dollars that  are3 presently  committed for affordable housing by4 Mayor Bloomberg	- which he should be applauded5 for because we didn' t see anything really6 committed at all for eight years - I'm  concerned7 though because that affordable housing plan,   such8 as it is in the capital budget , if you look at9 it , as controversial	zoning plans are coming10 through  the City Council , when people   complain,11 well , you're upzoning, where' s the affordable12 housing, you are seeing the administration13 saying, well , Park Slope you can have $10 million14 of that , and X neighborhood you can have $515 million.16 And I 'm afraid that eventually17 what 's in there will all be given away to kind of18 decrease opposition to controversial	zoning19 plans .20 We need to be careful we  don't21 give it away that way if it ' s not the  most22 responsible way .23 But , more importantly, to your24 point I think you're right . We need to get a25 bigger part of the capital budget committed   to2 
2 truly affordable housing.3 I also just want to say I  am4 happy to say on the affordable housing front  that5 we did have a victory recently in the  West6 Village where my off ice, working with the tenants7 association, working with the  Bloomberg8 Administration, were able to preserve the  West9 Village Houses,  a Mitchell - Lama, and the  tenants10 association is buying that building  from the11 owners. That' s one small victory.12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. ZELNIK:	If I could just14 make one other15 COUNCILMEMBER CHRISTINE QUINN:16 Sure.17 MR.  ZELNIK:	I guess  comment ,18 and maybe there's a subtlety in terms of  my19 question, the examples that you are giving,   as20 far as I can see , are kind of reactive to  things21 that are being proposed or reactive  to22 situations.23 And  I guess  I'm  asking you - and24 this is not just to you  - -25 COUNCILMEMBER  CHRISTINE QUINN:2 
2	Right .3	MR.  ZELNIK:	- - but to other4 people who come here representing  the Assembly5 and the Senate and so on, is what are you  doing6 on a proactive basis, what are you doing in   terms7 of new ideas and new initiatives, and  really8 putting it out there so that it becomes  the9 headline as opposed to a reaction once a   year.10 COUNCILMEMBER CHRISTINE QUINN:11 Well , that' s a good question.12 I think that in some ways  the13 work that 's being done with NASAHA and ACORN  is14 more proactive  than reactive actually,  although15 it is in response to what the Bloomberg,  the16 first kind of volley by the  Bloomberg17 Administration.	I think in its totality it  is18 actually more proact ive than react ive.19 In addition, there is a20 coalition that 's been formed citywide mostly at21 the leadership of my colleague  Councilmember22 David Yassky, that many of  us, myself	included ,23 have gotten behind. It 's the Campaign for24 Inclusionary Zoning in an attempt to try to25 rework that program more focused on  affordable4 
2 housing.3 I'd be happy at another point  to4 get any suggest ions or advice you could have on5 how to expand that even more broadly to be  even6 more proactive, or other ideas that we could  put7 on the agenda that relate to  that.8	There was some legislation that9 was put forward in the Council around affordabl e10 housing. And there was concern by some of  the11 developers of affordabl e housing that it wasn' t12 exactly on the mark and might not have been  as13 helpful as some of us  thought.14 We are reworking that now,15 sitting with those developers at the table, and  I16 hope that will come out with a package in  the17 near future that will be more on  target.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 COUNCILMEMBER	CHRISTINE QUINN:20 Thank you.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Pagan.22 (Audience participation. )23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.24 Sir, quiet.25 MR. PAGAN:	Councilwoman Quinn,9 
2 there are two issues that I'm very concerned  with3 and I think you probably touched  quickly.4 One was the rezoning and the5 other one is the BSA.6	COUNCILMEMBER  CHRISTINE QUINN:7	Right , right , right.8	MR. PAGAN:	The issue with the9 zoning - - and both of them is the issue that the10 City spends a number, a high amount of  resources11 in getting this rezoning and there' s no return12 for the investment outside of the  development.13 One of the things that , and I14 spoke to both Councilman Yassky and  Councilwoman15 Reyna. And  the issue that  - - maybe one of  the16 things that needs to be done with the rezoning   is17 as we go through it , is that there be deed18 restrictions, either, or regulatory agreements,19 because many of those projects will not be  built20 for many years.21 COUNCILMEMBER  CHRISTINE QUINN:22 Right , right.23 MR. PAGAN:	And by that time24 people forget what the purpose was and the   loss25 of  - - affordable housing  is lost.9 
2	And maybe one of the things  that3 I recommend usually, and I've been a  strong4 advocate for.5	The other one is the Board6 Standards and Appeal . We are finding in7 neighborhoods where affordable housing  is being8 just phased out through BSA; places  where9 affordable housing could be built , in the issue10 of industrial areas as they  change,11 COUNCILMEMBER  CHRISTINE QUINN:12 Right , right .13 MR. PAGAN:	- - where the BSA,14 where the peopl e coming in with - - they buy the15 property one month and next month they say  they16 have a hardship.17 COUNCILMEMBER  CHRISTINE QUINN:18 Right.19 MR . PAGAN:	And suddenly you've20 lost that.21 And there is no recognition  that22 this was bought  under  - -  that there were23 condit ions there already, and the hardship is24 accepted at face value without providing for  the25 issue of affordable housing .6 
2 And I just want to get  your3 thoughts on both of those items .4 COUNCILMEMBER  CHRISTINE QUINN:5 Well just , first off , the BSA, it 's a very big6 problem in my district and particularly  in  the7 West Village portion of my district where we   are8 seeing, you know, BSA, variance, a BSA variance9 approved.10 In the Village we have and  will11 cont inue to fight those on an application- by-12 application basis .13 There is legislation pending in14 the City Council to see if we can replicate   with15 the BSA, that the powers that the Council  has16 with some City planning applications where   we17 have the power, we either think there needs to   be18 more discussion or if there' s concern,19 disagreement or amendments or modifications20 wanted, where we can, what we call , call it   up ,21 where we can have a hearing on  it.22Without the proactive action  it23willgo through without a Council hearing, but  we24havethe right to call it for a hearing .25And there is a piece  of
2 legislation in the Council that would attempt  to3 replicate that for the BSA, which I think  would4 be one helpful thing to prevent this kind of   roll5 forward in a lot of  neighborhoods.6 And it 's a problem as it7 relates, as you said , both to loss of affordable8 housing, but also to the loss of  manufacturing9 districts because what you'll see happening  is  as10 these applications get approved, a lot  of11 residents will sometimes move  into manufacturing12 districts and then the residents  will13 understandably be concerned and annoyed and  mad14 that they live in a noisy place that' s a15 manufacturing	district.16 And then you'll end up  having17 pressure that sometimes can force businesses  out ,18 you know, as well.19 You know, and on the zoning20 point , you know, I think you raise a very valid21 issue that I'm grappling with on a daily  basis22 with the City Council as are many, many of  my23 colleagues about how do you balance the need   and24 the desire for developers for upzoning  and25 increased development with the  secondary2 
1	4232 displacement and other effects that it puts   on3 tenants, and how do you attempt to meet  those4 business needs but in a way that creates  housing5 and doesn' t push people out , the ones who made6 the neighborhood	so attractive.7 And we really need to keep  that8 goal in mind. I don' t have an easy answer to  it.9 But we need to figure it out. I think in some  way10 the inclusionary zoning proposal may be one  way11 to help us start to grapple and find a   solution12 with that.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 COUNCILMEMBER CHRISTINE QUINN:15 Thank you.16 (Audience participation. )17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' ll go to18 the next four:19 Mary Hammann, then  Isabel20 Barrow, Vicky Labosky, Marc  Cusumano.21 Mary Hammann?22 MS. MARY HOMMANN:	Yes.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.24 MS. MARY HOMMANN:	My name is25 Mary Hammann. I live at 350 East 52nd   Street.2 
2 I do not believe that  an3 increase in rents is justified this  year.4 According  to this Board' s own staff informat ion,5 Net Operating  Income for landlords of rent6 stabilized housing increased in the past  fifteen7 years by 18 percent adjusted for  inflation.8 The annual analysis of  rents9 undertaken by this Board is meant primarily   to10 keep apace with inflation and expenses. In  fact ,11 one of DHCR' s own documents describes this12 Board' s mandate  as limited to establishing13 allowable percentage	increases each year, if  any,14 based on " the review of operating expenses  and15 other cost - of - living data. "16 But the vast majority  of17 landlords have persisted	in refusing to open18 their books covering operating expenses so only19 one- half of your mandate can be properly  carried20 out.21 I know some of you are  thinking22 about comparisons with market  rents. But market23 rents are irrelevant to the issue because  without24 rent regulations, the law of supply and  demand25 works only for the landlords in a city in which2 
2 affordable housing is in incredibly short   supply.3 Rent stabilized tenants  are4 probably by and large people who cannot remain   in5 New York City if rents go much higher.  A6 considerable number of us are elderly  with7 extremely  limited incomes.8 Some of us started out  our9 working lives in social service or non- profit10 professions thinking mostly about the nature   and11 value of the work, not about salaries. We  didn't12 imagine then that in our middle and later   years13 we would be completely priced out of  market14 housing, that we would have to fight tooth   and15 nail every year to keep our modest one - room16 apartments. But that 's the way it is in our City.17 I mention these  circumstances18 because we are relatives of yours, uncles  and19 cousins, friends of yours, people you share very20 much with. We may even be you yourselves if   your21 economic fortunes take a precipitous turn in   the22 road.23 Please be careful how you  deal24 with our precarious fortunes.25 Thank you for keeping this2 
2	year' s increase to between zero and one percent.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 Isabel Barrow.5	Isabel Barrow, are you here?6	Yes? Is that you?7 MS. ISABEL BARROW:	Thank you.8 I have a building9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on one10 second.11 Could we  - - excuse me. Could  the12 bus group please leave or keep quiet. If you  want13 to talk, just talk outside.14 Please. Okay. Go ahead.15 MS. ISABEL BARROW:	I have a16 building in the Bronx, eight - family building. And17 my big problem  - -  I have  two big problems.18 One is - -19 A VOICE:	Can't hear.20 MS. ISABEL BARROW:	You have to21 pay attention and then you' ll hear me.22 I have two big problems.23 One of my problem is I  have24 several old people and they' re always cold no25 matter how much heat we give to them. That 's one.10 
2 And my number two, some of  the3 tenants don' t pay the rent on time. When come4 time to pay the bills, I have to pay the bills   on5 time.6 And last year my bill was  much7 higher than before because we have increase   in8 real estate, water, tax and insurance and No.   29 oil. Everyt hing went up between ten and twenty10 percent except the rent , which is very diff icult11 to keep up with the building when there is  no12 money, no income whatsoever.13 My husband and I worked  very14 hard to buy the building. And I feel like  we15 can't afford to keep up with the building  because16 every time we turn around  it 's more  - - first of17 all , the City don't give a break in nothing. And18 now we have so many laws we have to comply  with,19 which is hard for us.20 Okay.21 I don' t mind to pay my share22 when it comes for, you know, to pay the law.   But23 wherever they take from us we cannot put back   in24 the building  because every time - - if the   tenant25 is there and they are rent controlled , rent2 
2 stabilized , and they are paying very little,  it's3 very hard to keep up with the expense and to   fix4 the building, especially in the Bronx  where5 there' s so much drugs and it's hard to find a6 good tenant who pay a lot of  money.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 Question.9 MR. LUBELL:	Ms. Barrow, 10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma' am,11 question. Isabel. Isabel.12 MR. LUBELL:	Where is your13 building located?14 MS. ISABEL BARROW:	In the15 Bronx, it 's by Wakefield. Whit e Plains Road. And16 there' s a lot of drugs going on there.17 MR. LUBELL:	And what are the18 average rents in your building?19 MS. ISABEL BARROW:	Right now20 my tenants, they have two bedrooms, they  are21 paying $500. That' s the highest.22 MR. LUBELL:	And what 's the23 lowest?24 MS. ISABEL BARROW:	The lowest , 25	$230.10 
1	4292 MS. HOLDER:	How many units?3 MS. ISABEL BARROW:	I have4	eight and I live in one.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.6	MR. LUBELL:	Thank you.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 (Audience participation.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Vicky10 Labosky.11 Is Vicky here?12 MS. VICKY LABOSKY:	Yes.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Okay.14 MS. VICKY LABOSKY:	I live in a15 SRO.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on17 MS. VICKY LABOSKY:	I live in18 an SRO at 345 West 86th Street in  Manhattan19 between Riverside and West End  Avenue.20 Now, they are renting  illegally21 to tourists and they are converting rooms in  my22 SRO into tourist rooms. In the SRO where I   live23 you are not allowed to have overnight guests   or24 people by the week. It 's for residents like me.25 And I've been living there for thirteen- and - a-10 
1	4302 half years. Okay?3 So this morning the Department4 of Building inspector came out , and because I  was5 somebody who didn't have to work in  the morning	-6 - and the others who know about this, all of  us7 met , like a hundred  of us, are complaining  - - I8 showed him around. And I showed him an  original9 bathroom and how they are cutting them in  half10 and using the small bathroom for five people   who11 live on the hall and using the bathtub in  the12 bathroom for someone who comes in from vacation,13 to take a vacation. And then they cut a  hole14 through the wall here into this room and that' s  a15 hotel room now.16 And so I showed the  building17 inspector an original bat hroom, I then showed him18 the bathroom right above it which has been cut   in19 half . And then I started to show him the  bathroom20 below it. And then the maint enance man came  and21 said, hey, we want to show you around , you  know.22 So we showed him around as  best23 we could. We also showed him where large   bricks24 are falling off the front of the building   from25 the very top.2 
1	4312 And then he said: okay,  I'll3 make my complaints.4 And then the owner of  the5 building called in and talked to him on  his6 cellphone and said: go in and inspect her   room7 because we want you to inspect her room  now.8 She' s asking you to inspect our building.9 So the inspector said if  you10 want us to inspect her room, you have to call   in11 911 - - no, 311 and get the proper  complaint   to12 inspect her room.13 And he goes: okay .14 So they didn' t do that.15 So then I went to work and  I16 came back. Because I go and come during the   day,17 to and from work. So when I came back from   work,18 I was in my room. And there was somebody  banging19 on my door.20 And so I'm just saying, I'll  get21 to the point. They've already got  twenty- five22 percent of our building being used for   transient23 tenants, these big people on vacat ions when it 's24 only classified for people who live there , not  to25 take vacations.2 
1	4322 And because of that , I don't3 think we should have any rent increase at  all4 because they are charging upward of $75,  $100,5 $125 a night for the SRO rooms that are meant  for6 people like me and low- income people to live  in,7 not to use  - - twenty- five percent  of my building8 is already gone. Okay?9	So here I am at home getting10 ready to go back to work again. Someone bangs   on11 my door. This just happened a couple of  hours12 ago.13 And I go: Who is it?14 He says: This is the  management.15 So I go out and it 's the owner16 of the building  himself  and it ' s the maintenance17 man, one of the main maintenance  guys.18 And he goes: I want to  inspect19 your room.20 I go: no, you cannot inspect  my21 room and I have to go to work, I'm supposed to  be22 there in like twenty- five minutes.23 And he goes: I am allowed  to24 inspect your room and I want to inspect your   room25 now.10 
1	4 332	And I said: no.3	So he kept bothering me.4 And then, finally, because  of5 that I ran to the subway and I was so late  for6 work I couldn' t even go. And so I had to  come7 home and miss work. So I lost money  today.8 I'm being harassed.9 He says: who the fuck do you10 think you are? That 's what he said to me. Okay?11	So you understand what I mean?12 I'm talking to other people who live in the   other13 SROs in the City and I understand this  is14 happening to SROs all over the  City.15 So we've got a whole group  of16 all multi - nationalities in my building, from17 everywhere, and we are all getting together   to18 fight this situation because it 's not right.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, you20 should. And you should talk to Mr. Poe whom   I'm21 sure you know. If not , he' ll help you.22 We have tradit ionally passed a23 proviso which I think helps you in terms of   at24 least the rent increase.25 MS. VICKY LABOSKY:	Once they12 
1	4342 assume seventy- five percent of the building,  they3 can't raise our rent anymore. But they've  only4 assumed twenty- five percent for the people who5 are coming by the night.6 And also it 's illegal anyway.7 They're not supposed to assume any of  the8 building.  It's meant for the people who live9 there.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I understand.11	Mr. Poe can help you on that.12 MS. VICKY LABOSKY:	Okay.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We can't.14 MS. VICKY LABOSKY:	So a zero15 percent increase I  say.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I hear you.17 MS. VICKY LABOSKY:	They're18 already making their money off of these  people.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We hear you.20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Marc22 Cusumano.23 MR. MARC CUSUMANO:	Let 's talk24 about affordable water and sewer costs.  Let 's25 talk about affordable heating  inspection  permits12 
2 and so forth and it goes on and on and  on.3 You had - - somebody  had4 published what the increase was for insurance.   I5 have an underlying policy here, an  umbrella6 policy they call it. It only kicks in after  my7 underlying  insurance kicks in.8 My policy, prior to 9/11  was9 $1200 a year. My present policy - and I have  a10 letter here from Brownstone Agency - will  now11 cost me $3685 for one year with no lead   coverage.12 My taxes, in 2002 to 2003  were13 $40,887 a year. My taxes from  ' 03  to May	' 04 were14 $48,862 a year. That 's for a ten- unit family,15 almost $50,000 a year . That' s obscene. That ' s16 absurd.17 We have become the  collection18 plate for the City of New York because we are   an19 easy target and there is nowhere we can  go.20 When the City needs money,  it21 just raises the landlord taxes, raise water   and22 sewer. My water and sewer costs, last year it   was23 $1520. The prior year it was  $1400.24 Wait a minute . Because there' s a25 ticket blitz in the City of New York, we all   know2 
2 of cases of totally unjustified  tickets. And  if3 you talk about an unjustif ied ticket , try keeping4 your sidewalks clean twenty- four hours a day5 especially around a school or a tin  can6 collection agency.7 Summons for littering have gone8 from $25 last year to $100 now with a maximum  of9 $300 for one littering ticket.  Okay?10 I spoke to a contractor  about11 having some work done, when we talk   summonses,12 and he said - I wanted him to come out to  my13 site. It was 75th Street in Manhattan.  Each  four14 hours he was there he would charge me  an15 additional $100 for the job because he can't   even16 park double and unload his truck without   getting17 a summons. He could be literally unloading  the18 material  from his truck and a parking  enforcement19 agent will put a $100 ticket on his  windshield.20 So that' s another assessment we21 don' t see.22 I want to quote a famous23 economist , Walt Graham, if you know him or  not.24 And what he is very famous for saying is when   you25 have a boat and you have a hole in one end of   the2 
2 boat and it 's sinking, you don't put a hole in3 the other end of that boat to save  it.4 That 's - - I'm on the other end5 of that boat.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .7 (Audience participat ion.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr .9	Schaeffer, Kenneth  Schaeffer.10	Is Mr . Schaeffer here?11	MR. KENNETH SCHAEFFER :	Yes.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay .13 MR . KENNETH SCHAEFFER:	Good14 evening.15 My name is Kenneth Schaeffer .16 I'm here to present the testimony on behalf  of17 The Legal Support Unit of Legal Services for  New18 York City, LSNY, as well as The Legal  Aid19 Society.20 (Audience participation. )21 MR. KENNETH SCHAEFFER:	I have22 copies of our testimony . It was mailed last week.23 But  if by some case you didn' t get it , I  have24 more copies .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have the12 
2packet.3MR. KENNETH SCHAEFFER:	You have4it.5I think they have it up  there.6I just want to start by7 commenting on some of the things that have  been8 said today and at other meetings of this  body9 which aren' t necessarily directly in our10 testimony.11	First thing I want ed to say is12 that in the absence of a preliminary vote  last13 month of a specific guideline, it 's a little  hard14 for us to - - for the public to comment since we15 don' t know what specifically is being proposed.16 And I think that that  was17 improper. It would have bett er for you to put18 something out that people could comment on  rather19 than saying we' re not sure what we are going  to20 do.21 I want to speak a little bit  to22 the purposes of the Rent Guidelines Board   because23 I think there is several different percept ions  of24 what your role is. I believe that the  Rent25 Stabil ization Association has presented a view12 
2 which basically means that you are  narrowly3 limited to protecting their prof its. And I think4 that that 's not really the purpose of the Rent5 Stabilization Law.6 If you look at the statute  which7 created the Rent Stabilization Law, the  purpose8 that is cited in our testimony is to prot ect  the9 public from unaffordable rent increases.  That 's10 why the Rent Stabilization Law was  passed.11 (Audience part icipation.)12 MR. KENNETH SCHAEFFER:	That 's13 why it' s reviewed by the Legislature and that 's14 the law of the land at this  time.15 If you consider that to be  the16 purpose, historically  the Rent Guidelines  Board17 has not done its job in prot ecting the public18 from unaffordable rent increases if you look   at19 the fact that half of the City is paying  thirty20 percent  of their income or more  in rent  -  that 's21 the hardship level. If half of the people  are22 suffering, that 's not a very good pass rate.23 And I also want to remind  you24 that for fifty years that figure was twenty- five25 percent , not to speak of the old , of the recently2 
2 departed, but it was the Reagan  Administration3 that unilaterally changed that figure  from4 twenty- five percent to thirty percent at the  same5 time that they were saying that ketchup was  a6 vegetable and we can use that to cut  school7 lunches.8 That ' s a mean- spirited action9 that hurts the millions of people in New  York10Citythatarestruggling with theirrents.11In 1997, before thelaws were12 weakened , the average profit  for an apartment was13 $250 per month which times twelve months  is14 $3000, times a million apartments is $3  billion15 being transferred  from tenants in New York  City16 to the real estate  industry.17 Now with the Net  Operating18 Income of $342 , the figure is over $4 billion a19 year.20 I wish I had time to talk  a21 little bit about my clients. I work as a  housing22 attorney in the Harlem office, people on  SSI ,23 people who work full - time at minimum wage. These24 peopl e are living in misery.	It's not just those25 people, but it's also the middle class that  are12 
2 struggling with rents.3 And I think it 's really4 incumbent to pass  - -  I think the rents as  they5 are now are grossly inflated , and even  freezing6 them would not do the job, but to add  further7 misery to a City that 's already suffering would8 really be inexcusable.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 (Audience participation.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have a12 question.13 Mr. Pagan.14 MR. KENNETH SCHAEFFER:	Yes.15 MR. PAGAN:	Mr. Schaeffer,16 MR. KENNETH SCHAEFFER:	Yes,17 sir.18 MR. PAGAN:	in reference to19 the special guidelines, the formulation  that20 comes up, usually we look at increases based   on21 the MBR and the increase is usually 150  percent22 or HUD guidelines, whichever is higher.23 Do you have an idea how24 guidelines are set and what is the  difference25 between the Metropolitan  Region Median Income  and10 
2 the Area Median Income and what that Area  Median3 Income means?4	MR. KENNETH SCHAEFFER:	Yes.  5 Thank you.6 I understand that New York  State7 Tenants and Neighbors is also present ing8 testimony specifically looking at that  special9 guideline.10 But in answer to your question11 about how HUD determines that , it 's based on12 something which is very misleading.	It 's based on13 an Area Median Income that is not specific to  New14 York City but includes the affluent suburbs.   And15 that ' s Westchest er, Rockland  and  in Long Island.16 And for that reason the HUD  Area17 Median Income is over $62,000 whereas the New18 York City Median Income - and this comes from   the19 New York University School of Law Center for  Real20 Estat e and Urban Policy, Michael Schill' s21 institute there - the New York City Area Median 22	Income is only $39,000, not  $62,000.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Isn't it24 correct that that has nothing to do with the  Fair25 Market Rent? The issue before us on the  special23 
2	guideline is the Fair Market  Rent.3	The affordable  - - level of4 affordable increase is eighty percent of  the5 Median, you are absolut ely right.6	But the issue, that has  nothing7 to do with our special guideline, nothing8 whatsoever.9	The issue is Fair Market Rent ,10 which is a rent of the total SMSA which is,   in11 fact , brought down by the suburban communities12 where rents are low. So, in fact , that has13 nothing whatsoever to do with the  special14 guideline.15 MR.  KENNETH  SCHAEFFER:	Well ,16 two things - -17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Isn't that18 correct?19 MR. KENNETH SCHAEFFER:	I was20 asked to comment on the  - -21 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Well , isn't22 that correct? I would like to know if that 's23 correct.24 MR. KENNETH SCHAEFFER:	I think25 some - - another speaker will address   that.10 
2	(Audience participat ion.)3	MR. KENNETH SCHAEFFER:	I4 believe  - - I don' t want  to answer that one way or5 the other. I think other  speakers6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The answer7 was totally disingenuous on the quest ion before8 us which is the special  guideline.9	MR. KENNETH SCHAEFFER:	No, no.10 I was asked the question about how  HUD11 (Audience participation. )12 MR. KENNETH SCHAEFFER:13 calculates the Area Median  Income.14 I think the very concept15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How HUD16 calculates the Fair Market  Rent.17 MR. KENNETH SCHAEFFER:18 That 's - -19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Not the Area20 Median Income.21 MR. KENNETH SCHAEFFER:	Okay.22 I mean Fair Market Rent23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. KENNETH SCHAEFFER:	Fair25 Market Rent is an oxymoron in the first  place.10 
2But Iwas justcommenting - -3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'm glad you4thinkso.5MR. KENNETH SCHAEFFER:	- -	I6 was commenting  - -  in terms of the lives of  New7 Yorkers, the rents that people are paying,   are8 unaffordable.

KENNETH SCHAEFFER:	Thank15 you.16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Marilyn18 Berey.19 MS. MARILYN BERCY:	Good20 afternoon.21 My name is Marilyn Berey. I  have22 a six-unit building  in Sunset Park. The  reason23 that  I'm here  is because  - - urging you to24 increase the rent at least fifteen percent . Okay?25 Let me tell you the reason.  Okay?6 
2 You rent the apartment to a3 couple and before you know it , there are six4 people in the unit .5 (Audience participation .)6 MS.  MARILYN BERCY :	They - - what7 they do, they sublease the apartment.  Therefore,8 I get less rent of what the other tenant gives  my9 tenant money. So what is  that?10 You take them to court and  you11 cannot do anything because the court says this   is12 for the tenant.13 And the water, they let  the14 water run like there is no tomorrow, like  we15 don't pay water. And you know the water  every16 year increases.17 The taxes  increase , everything18 go up. It 's ridiculous.19 A VOICE:	Sell it.20 MS. MARILYN BERCY:	If you have21 tenant that , they are supposed to live in the22 apartment and they take it as day care, you  ask23 them, please, have your own insurance to  cover24 that. No, they're  supposed  to - -  they say, well25 I 'm just going to take two kids. When you go2 
2 there and there' s twelve, it 's ridiculous. Okay?3 According to the last guy,  Ms.4 Holder, say, oh, landlord open your books . What5 about the tenant? The tenant doesn' t open their6 books . The tenant doesn' t say look, this is the7 amount of money that I'm getting from all  the8 people. I do because we have to tell how  much9 money we are getting from each  apartment.10 Thank you .11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We are going14 to take a break now, five minutes for  the15 stenographer. We' ll blame everything on you.16 Go ahead. Five minutes.17 (At 6:00 o'clock p.m . there was18 a recess is the proceedings.)1920	*	*	*2122232425
