P R O C E E D I N G    SCHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good My name is Marvin Markus, Chair  of 
 7 the New York City Rent Guidelines  Board.8 I' d like to welcome everybody here 9 to one in a series of public hearings and   public 10 meetings of the Rent Guidelines Board, all  designed 11 to meet our statutory mandate of  promulgating 12 allowable lease increases for the lease  cycle 13 beginning October 1 , 2008 and ending September 30 , 14	2009 .15 This is a public hearing, one  of 16 two.	The next one is scheduled for Monday,   all 17 day, at Cooper Union beginning at ten a. m.18 This one is scheduled to run  as 19 long it takes to hear every  speaker.20 We are cutting off the sign- in at 21 eight p. m.22 Just a couple of  announcements.23 As I just said, there will  be 24 another public hearing.	It' s going to be Monday at 25 Cooper Union at the Great Hall which 7 East  7 th 15 
2 Street.	And if anybody wants to  register,3 212 - 385 - 2934 .	And pre- registration ends on the 4 13 th, which is Friday, auspiciously, at 1 p. m.5 The final vote, as I think most  of 6 the people in the audience know, will be  on 7 Thursday, June 19 th, beginning at 5 : 30 p. m.8 You have several folders, Board 9 Members, and your several amendments in your  folder 10 from the staff and a Community Services  society 11 report that Ms. Adams asked to be distributed,  as 12 well as a copy of the preliminary guidelines  on 13 which we' re holding for you.14 And in addition for the  members,15 there are menus in your folder for the  meetings 16 that are going to be all- day meetings on June  --17 the all- day meeting on June 16 th.18 We' re going to begin, as is our 19 custom, we' re going to alternate owners and tenant 20 reps --21 ( Director Adams entered the Great 22 Hall.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	-- until we 24 run out of one category or the other and  then 25 continue.	So even if some from one category  comes 2 
2 a little later, we' ll slide them in trying to  keep 3 the one- and- one.4 The first speaker will be  William 5 Stanford, Jr.6 And you' ll be able to see here on 7 the contraption that we have here, a red  light,8 green light, et cetera.	The yellow light goes on,9 I think at thirty seconds and then you  have 10 two- and- a- half minutes and that way we' ll try to 11 keep everybody on time.12 Any questions?13 ( No response.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Stanford. Go 15 ahead.16 MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:	First of 17 all, the public will be glad when you step down  as18 the head board member.	Because the last two years 19 in a row you caused heartaches for a lot of   New 20 York City residents.	You feel -- apparently you 21 think money grows on trees.22 Maybe you should get together with 23 the Wayan Brothers since you want more  money.24 Because, as I said before, you' re a bigger pimp 25 than Peter Kalikow.	You and him could pass for 2 
2 King Kong Bundy and Big John Stud. That leaves  your 3 cousin, Bruce Ratner, could pass for your  manager,4 Bobby Heenan.	Okay?5 And I don' t appreciate these two 6 here, Mr. And Mrs. David Schleider accusing  Adriene 7 to holding the Board hostage.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you 9 please speak to the issues, not the  personalities 10 here.	We' d really appreciate that, sir.11 There' s an issue before us which 12 is what should the allowable lease increases  should 13 be.	This is not counting against  your time.	You 14 need to speak to that. This is not a discussion   of 15 the individuals on the board.16 MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:	Oh, excuse 17 me.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So talk to the 19 substance, please.20 MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:	Oh!, excuse 21 me.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' re 23 excused.24 MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:	Yes.	Okay.25 Well, you know, you don' t need any 2 
2 more rent increases because so far I haven' t  seen 3 any change in the last two years along with  these 4 rent increases.5 These owners and tenants say  they 6 need money for  fuel costs.	Okay?	And they don' t7 show their records.	Okay?	That doesn' t make any 8 sense.	They can come here and they don' t show 9 their record.	I mean is there any  particular 10 reason why they can' t show their records?11 If they need money that bad,  they 12 should show their records. They should open  up 13 their books.	It' s like dealing with the MTA.14 Dealing with the Rent Guidelines Board is  like 15 dealing with the MTA Board.16 You don' t want to show any 17 accountability. You don' t want to show any 18 reliability. You don' t want to assume 19 responsibility.	You just do as you please  and 20 that' s it.	You need to think about that.21 Tenants are getting harassed.22 They' re going to Housing Court. Did you forget 23 that?	Maybe because of your unwarranted  decisions,24 all these rent increases are unwarranted and  unfair 25 and it' s got to stop.	It' s really does.2 
2 And this is -- you know, it' s like 3 the last the last two  years alone.	And what did I4 see? A seven- two vote.	That' s outrageous.5 It was my understanding the  Rent 6 Guidelines Board was created almost forty years  ago 7 to help tenants pay their rent, not increase  the 8 rent and cause hardships for them.	But obviously 9 you don' t care.	You just do as you want and  keep 10 us in the dark house.	This is outrageous.	And,11 again, I' m glad they' re absent.	Okay?	Because I12 said this before, they can pass for Mr. And  Mrs.13 Steven Schleider.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,15 sir.16 The next speaker is James 17 Anderson.18 ( Applause.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And Mr.20 Anderson, you need to behave yourself, do  you 21 understand that?	Before I don' t want any comments,22 just when you get to  speak.23 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	I cannot 24 blame you never.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You just 2 
2 behave when you get to  speak.3 You' re on. Let' s go.4 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	I speak about 5 the problem of real estate.	I do not blame nobody.6 Of course, I obey your power, authority and  bosses 7 because you are appointed of the  Mayor.8 People who blame you must stop  him 9 immediately just to declare what happen with  real 10 estate.	You know that everything grow up.	Started 11 with fuel oil, tax, insurance.12 I hear two voices here.	I don' t13 know their name that they says nothing grow  up,14 rent zero.	That means that they are only --  there 15 are two.	They are Mr. Zero and Ms.  Zero.16 Another people go, all right,17 didn' t like talking straight.	So if, you know,18 already that 2002 one gallon cost $ 20 now cost  over 19 $ 130 .	That' s six time and a half more.20 The tax cannot coming down  because 21 all the politician and big shots in the  office 22 increase them salaries.	City first one increase 23 twelve percent, sixty percent for them.	Only for 24 the big shot not for working people and  for 25 commissioners.2 
2 So in this situation tax can  never 3 coming down.	Never.	And we have big criminals in 4 Albany, New York State.	Governor, Lieutenant 5 Governor, Leader, Majority Bruno, another  Silver,6 they don' t care nothing. Just increase their salary 7 and looking for a  reelection.8 So in this situation if  you 9 thinking that I am lie, later ask me question  and 10 declare that I lie.11 I am not lawyer.	I am not 12 professor, legislator, politician, to understand 13 the lie.	I am garbage man.	Clean the building,14 repair the building, give the landlord  still 15 working men.	So cannot lie definitely like  people 16 who first graduated and then step in big  position.17 They elected and they receive  the money.	They are 18 liars.	And we have two liars on  this side.	I19 don' t know their name.	Two liars, this corner.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' re not 21 going to talk about board members.	We' re going to 22 talk about the substance, --23 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	They' re not24 board members.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	-- understand?2 
2MR. JAMES ANDERSON:All right.3Sorry.4CHAIRMAN MARKUS:What do you 5mean they' re not board members?	They are board 6members.7MR. JAMES ANDERSON:Maybe.8CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Just talk 9 about whether or not we should raise rent and  what 10 percent.11 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	We should 12 raise.	We should raise at least  three time.	Fuel 13 become six in here but have  too much.	Let' s see.14 What you decide I' m agree with you.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I appreciate 16 that.17 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Yes.	And you 18 are tough Chairman.	Anybody who blame you, out,19 definitely.	I don' t blame nobody.	I don' t know 20 the names.	I don' t know the names.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That' s good.22 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	And you will 23 see that tax can never come. The fuel we  don' t24 know.	United Nation definitely do not  care.25 Another crooks. So what do  you expected?	Between 9 
2 the landlord and tenant they must straight how  get 3 to understand each other.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 5 wrap up.	Ten seconds.6 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	What is that?7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ten seconds. Six 8 now.9 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Six?	Finish 10 right now on the time. Just ask me  questions 11 because you never ask me  questions.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right.13 Thank you.14 Anybody have questions?15 ( No response.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, Mr.17 Anderson.18 See you next week. I' ll give you 19 another chance.20 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	You break 21 rules.	Continue to break rules.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Jones,23 James Jones;24 Follow by Patrick Siconolfi;25 Alonzo Jordan; and 2 
2 Nick Petras.3 MR. JAMES JONES:	I have some 4 copies that I would like the members to  get.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure. We' ll 6 get it to the staff.7 Mr. Jones, how have you been?  Good 8 to see you again.	Thank you.	Thank you.9 MR. JAMES JONES:	Mr. Chairman,10 recently your response has been strangely  not 11 loquacious in the use of this  word landlord.	The 12 Corporation Counsel, New York City, had no use  for 13 this word in their summary to  Jones.14 The Corporation Counsel' s summary 15 indicates - an applicant - give me - give me   for 16 money followed by $$$$$$.	Applicant owes - quickly 17 whilst tenants not looking, during midnight  before 18 sunrise.19 Applicant approached Chinese or 20 Asian City worker, Brooklyn.	He or she Chinese or 21 Asian worker shall remain nameless.	Wadleigh Court 22 directly faces across 7 th Avenue, Powell Boulevard,23 the Synagogue Building, Ansche Chessed, not 24 pronounced as spelled in the English  language.25 The congregation of Ansche Chessed 2 
2 is now relocated to West End Avenue and 100  Street,3 New York.4 The Roman Catholic Church took 5 over the Synagogue, et cetera.	Wadleigh Court 6 erected in 1912 according to the New York  City 7 Building Department.8 The successors in the Law 9 Department indicate the false affidavit summary  is 10 their response to the applicant' s give me the  money 11 followed by $$$$$$.12 Applicant owes, whilst tenants 13 unaware, quickly give it to me secretly, let us  go 14 back into the closet - you give it to me secretly   -15 no one needs to see you give me the money   $$$$$$16 that belongs to the tenants.17 The Law Department was not  allowed 18 in their building on Church Street during the  days19 immediately following September 11 , 2001 .20 Two hundred thousand pints of 21 human blood were collected immediately.	No one 22 need human blood.	Someone called the police.23 I prayed to God that my  comments 24 are not taken out of context.	I also thank three 25 unknown contributors.2 
2 I thank God; Judge Frank  resigned 3 in February of 2002 .	Postscript - applicant 4 constantly travels in several up- to- date luxury 5 automobiles, multiple luxury automobiles.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, Mr.7 Jones.	We' ll see you next week.8 Thank you.9 Mr. Siconolfi.10 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Good 11 afternoon.12 I' m Pat Siconolfi, Executive 13 Director of the Community Housing  Improvement 14 Program of CHIP.15 CHIP is an association of  small 16 and medium- sized owners of residential properties.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Siconolfi,18 could you speak up because, in fact, the  speakers 19 are trained towards the audience so we' re having a20 little difficulty.21 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Actually,22 it was quite -- quite loud out  there.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, it' s24 not loud this way.25 MS. ADAMS:	It' s not loud up here.2 
2 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Okay. CHIP 3 is concerned that the preliminary guidelines do  not 4 reflect the economic reality of owning  rental 5 property in New York.	This concern has four parts:6 The first concerns the cumulative 7 effect of years of guidelines below the  PIOC.8 The second concerns the unique 9 aspects of the energy environment.10 The third addresses tax 11 situations.12 And the fourth addresses the  need 13 to set some rent support mechanisms in  certain 14 circumstances.15 It has been the practice of  the 16 Board to issue a Price Index of Operating Costs  and 17 then to retreat significantly from such numbers  to 18 set the guidelines.	This guarantees that rents19 will not keep pace with the actual cost  of 20 operating buildings.21 Specifically, the Board' s PIOCs 22 for the years, the five years, 2004 through 2008 ,23 show an actual increase in costs to  operating 24 property of 38 percent.	Yet for the period covered 25 by the last five guideline orders, the  compound 2 
2 effect -- compounded effect of the guideline  is 3 only nineteen percent.4 Accordingly, the guideline 5 increases compensated owners for only half  the 6 cost, the actual cost increase over the  period.7 Energy prices pose a  particular 8 threat to the financial stability of  rental 9 housing. There is conclusive evidence that we  have 10 entered a period of expensive  energy.11 According to the Federal Energy 12 Information Agency, in the ten- year period from 13 1998 through the beginning of this year, fuel  oil 14 prices have accelerated from 31 cents a gallon  to 15 $ 3 . 20 a gallon.16 This is a 1 , 000 percent increase 17 over the period.18 The RGB and its PIOCs, if you  take 19 the fuel component compounded that over the  same 20 period, you get 367 percent, of which, of  course,21 you only recognize, in the guideline, about  half.22 So that' s 180 percent.23 So this is -- this is quite  a24 mismatch.	Actual verifiable fuel increases,25 heating fuel increases of a thousand percent  over 2 
2 ten years.	And the compensatory relief is  180 3 percent.	So it' s quite a mismatch.4 Energy expenditures, as I' m sure 5 you' re aware, are essentially non- discretionary to 6 the owner for a few  reasons.7 First, the service has to  be 8 provided.9 And secondly, shopping for price 10 differentials typically has no effect.	And, of 11 course, you know, conservation, to the extent  that 12 it happens, is in the hands of the end user   and 13 there' s no relationship between the end user and 14 the cost of the energy.15 Onto taxes, which present a16 special consideration.17 Twenty- seven percent of all the 18 expenses, according to your data, they' re the 19 single largest cost in operating a  building.20 In this regard, I think it' s21 important to recognize that in this regard  the 22 owner is simply acting as a collection agent  for 23 the City.	The owner is not making a profit  on 24 taxes or anything like that.25 And I see I' m out of time.2 
2 There are a few more points  I3 would make.	But essentially we would recommend 4 that there be a minimum increase for apartments  of 5 $ 60 a month to compensate for the fuel cost and,  of 6 course, we would want to see renters over  65 7 exempted from that.8 And if you apply this to  the 9 twenty percent decile --10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	If you can 11 wrap you.12 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Twenty 13 percent decile of the lowest rents, you  applied 14 that supplement, I think you would have  something 15 worth considering.	Also consider giving a16 surcharge.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Why don' t you 18 give us a copy of your full  testimony.19 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	I have a20 full testimony.	To whom can I give  that?21 MS. ADAMS:	I have a question.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I' m not 23 encouraging this, but you can come back next  year.24 MS. ADAMS:	I have a question.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.2 
2 Question.	Ms. Adams.3 MS. ADAMS:	I had difficulty 4 hearing you.	I' m sorry.5 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Sorry.6 MS. ADAMS:	But what are the size 7 buildings that you manage or that your  members8 manage?9 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Well, CHIP 10 is an association.	We have about a  thousand 11 members.12 MS. ADAMS:	Okay.13 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	And they 14 tend to be the small and the medium- sized 15 buildings. So without getting into too fine a  point 16 on this, most of our buildings are in the fifty   to 17 a hundred size.18 MS. ADAMS:	Okay.19 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	But 20 certainly lot smaller ones.21 MS. ADAMS:	Okay.22 As you know, the mandate  under 23 which we operate does not allow for  a24 differentiation between managers of small  numbers25 of units and managers of large numbers of  units.2 
2 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Right.3 MS. ADAMS:	You also know --4 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	I wasn' t5 suggesting that you do.6 MS. ADAMS:	I understand.7 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Yes.8 Okay.9 MS. ADAMS:	-- it' s a problem that 10 we' re all trying to solve.11 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Sure,12 sure.13 MS. ADAMS:	And we don' t know the 14 answer to it.15 As your testimony, that I  could 16 hear, also indicated the expenses of  operating 17 anything have been going up much faster  than 18 salaries for most people in New  York State.	I19 couldn' t understand what you were recommending as 20 an increase except the $ 60 per month for a  fuel 21 increase.22 What is the total increase  that 23 you were --24 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Well, yes.25 Actually, you know, I sort of timed out on   that.2 
2 When I was recommending --  first 3 of all, I was pointing out the difference  between 4 the actual cost increases which had  accelerated 5 significantly and what the Board had provided  in 6 the guideline increases.7 MS. ADAMS:	What do you 8 recommend?9 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Recommend,10 on the lowest rent apartments, a minimum $ 60 11 increase.	And on the remainder of apartments,  the 12 guideline increase, in addition to that, that  you 13 give consideration to a fuel cost pass- along 14similar to what' sdone in the rent control  system.15MS. ADAMS:	Thank you very much.16( Applause.)17MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Sure.18CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19The next speaker is Alonzo  Jordan;20Followed by Nick Petras;21Followed by Edwin Daig, D- a- i- g;22Followed by Uzi Evron, I  believe 23it is.24Mr. Jordan has a  statement.25MR. ALONZO JORDON:	I say good 
2 afternoon to the distinguished Chairs  here.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 4 talk up. You need to speak  up.5 MR. ALONZO JORDAN:	My name is 6 Alonzo Jordan.7 Just more or less, this  is 8 food- for- thought for the Chairpersons. I don' t9 know.	Can you hear me?10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Especially 11 if you hold the mike.12 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Sir, just to 13 tell you, we' ve been having a lot of trouble 14 hearing the speakers. I don' t know what the 15 situation is in the audience, but I' ve barely been 16 able to hear anyone who  has spoken.	I think 17 they' re working on it right now, but --18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I don' t think 19 it' s going to be fixed.	They put the second mike.20 But the problem is the speakers are all -- if   they 21 turned one this way.22 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I recommend -- I23 recommend that people speak clearly and slowly,  --24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.25 MR. LANGUEDOC:	-- otherwise we 2 
2 will not be able to hear  you.3 MR. ALONZO JORDAN:	Okay.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. We' re 5 starting all over. Go ahead.6 MR. ALONZO JORDAN:	Okay. Good 7 afternoon, once again to the distinguished 8 chairpersons.9 This is more or less 10 food- for- thought concerning from the State of New 11 York Court of Appeals concerning some  plaintiffs 12 and litigants.13 It says here, the issues for  the 14 owners of a fifteen unit rent stabilized  apartment 15 building may remove all remaining tenants in  order 16 to convert the building into a single- family 17 residence for their personal use without  first 18 obtaining approval from the State Division  of 19 Housing and Community renewal.20 The Lower Courts split on  this 21 question.	It gives a summary here.22 It says, in 2003 and 2004 , I' ll 23 say Jane and John Doe, owners of the  apartment 24 building at 47 East 3 rd Street in Manhattan, served 25 tenants with notices of intent not to renew  their 2 
2 leases and to reclaim their rent- stabilized 3 apartments for occupancy by the by the  owners 4 pursuant to the Rent Stabilization Code  --5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Jordan, I6 think we' ve had testimony actually in the past on 7 this particular case here before the Board.	And so 8 why don' t you -- and it' s going to take you longer 9 than three minutes to read the whole  things.10 MR. ALONZO JORDAN:	Yes. I know,11 three minutes.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So why don' t13 you tell us you believe is wrong or right  about 14 this case, whatever your point of view  is.15 What?16 MR. LANGUEDOC:	We all know about 17 this case.	You don' t have to tell us about it.18 MR. ALONZO JORDAN:	Oh, okay.19 Well, more or less --20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So tell us what 21 you think about the case and why it' s relevant 22 because otherwise you' ll lose your whole time.23 MR. ALONZO JORDAN:	Well, I' ll go 24 from here.	I' ll let you read this for own 25 discretion then.2 
2 But my mother- in- law, who had the 3 privilege -- she' s a senior.	She lived in the 4 housing projects in what was formerly called  the 5 Polo Grounds in Manhattan, 159 th, I think it is,6 and Eighth Avenue in Harlem.7 And when I first got married,  I8 had to wind up living, you know, with my in- laws  in 9 that apartment building and they were  rent 10 stabilized.11 And subsequently they moved out  to 12 the Bronx area out there.	And they have three 13 family home.14 So being the Christian woman  that 15 she is, I thought this was somehow of a   blessing 16 for her to move here, you know, having  a17 three- family house and so forth. But she said no.18 She would rather stay in the Polo Grounds because  I19 think they were paying something like $ 750 a  month.20 And I think they have like  several bedrooms.	I21 remember my wife had a bedroom. There were  several 22 bedrooms.23 So she was more or less in  favor 24 of the rent stabilization.	And, you know, more or 25 less I go from that.	So anything that, you know,2 
2 that could be done to keep the tenants  where 3 they' re at and her being, like I said, a senior  and 4 on a fixed income, was kind of detrimental for  her 5 to move out to pay some $ 1500 or so or double  that 6 for a mortgage, you know.	But I assume because she 7 had a new building and this and that, that  that' s8 what she wanted.	But she said no, I want it.  You 9 know, I was very comfortable where I was at   with 10 the rent stabilization especially being on a  fixed 11 income.12 And then subsequently after she 13 moved, her husband passed away so it was more of   a14 burden to her there.	So that was pretty much all  I15 had to say.16 This I' ll leave to your 17 discretion.	I won' t --18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No, no, no.19 We' re aware of this case.	And it' s not 20 unfortunately, but probably fortunately not within 21 our jurisdiction.	But we' re aware of this case and22 the issues raised by this  case.23 Thank you.24 MR. ALONZO JORDAN:	Okay. Thank 25 you very much for your  time.2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3 Nick Petras.4 MR. NICK PETRAS:	Ready to go?5 My name is Nicholas Petras and  I6 am President of the Community Housing  improvement 7 Program, an association of small and medium  sized 8 apartment owners.9 Among other things, my family owns 10 several hundred rent stabilized apartments,  about 11 ninety percent of which are in  Queens.12 I have an MBA in Finance from  NYU.13 Lived in one of our buildings in Greenwich  Village 14 when I got it.	My dad bought his first building  in 15 1959 and I' ve been in charge of the day- to- day 16 operation of our real estate business for the  past 17 fourteen years.18 I know that many landlords  will 19 discuss surging costs for energy, water, and  real 20 estate taxes.	But I' ve come to testify about 21 something else - the long- term tenant discount.22 We landlords come here year  after 23 year to ask about relief from the long- term tenant 24 discount and almost every year the Board  does 25 nothing.2 
2 I' m asking the Board to 3 acknowledge the problem that the long- term tenant 4 has created for building finances and to enact  a5 minimum increase this year of at least $ 50 for  a6 one- year lease and $ 75 for a two- year lease.7 I think everyone in New York  knows 8 that the longer a tenant has been in a   rent 9 regulated apartment, the better the deal the  tenant 10 most likely has. And savvyer owners of New  York 11 apartments know that the lowest rents in  the 12 buildings belong to the long- term, rent stabilized,13 not rent controlled tenants.14 In 1981 my family purchased  a15 48 - unit building on 29 th Street in Astoria 16 consisting mostly of one- bedroom apartments with a17 total of 127 rentable rooms.	Today, 45 of those 18 apartments are rent stabilized, two are  rent 19 controlled and one is occupied by the  super.20 The average rent in the  building 21 is $ 918 per month.22 When my dad bought this  building,23 the tenants were attempting to get a 7 A24 administrator appointed and were conducting a  rent 25 strike. Well, I guess the striking tenants got  the 2 
2 well run building they like.3 More than a quarter, 13 out of  the 4 47 tenants in the building have lived there  for 5 twenty years or more. This includes only two  rent 6 controlled tenants.7 The average rent for these 8 long- term rent stabilized tenants is $ 627 . 77 a9 month. The average rent for the two rent  controlled 10 apartments is actually higher. Considering the  cost 11 of our debt and our cost of equity, these  tenants 12 don' t cover their proportional costs of running the 13 building. And without passing a minimum  rent 14 increase this year of at least $ 50 for a one- year 15 lease and $ 75 for a two- year lease, these tenants 16 will fall further behind.17 Last heating season, the heating 18 oil for this building cost $ 70 , 964 or $ 1478 per 19 apartment. The previous heating season the oil  was 20 $ 47 , 836 or $ 996 per apartment.21 The one- year difference was 22 $ 23 , 127 or $ 481 per apartment.23 Divide this increase by twelve 24 months and you get $ 40 . 15 which is four- fifths of 25 the minimum increase I' m asking for.2 
2 You can similarly do this for  real 3 estates taxes, insurance.4 The real estate tax differential, 5	$ 915 .6 The insurance differential, $ 736 .7 I' m over the $ 50 I' m asking for already. I' m not 8 going to continue to go line- by- line on my P& L9 statement.	But I' ll say this: The three costs I10 just discussed are the same for all tenants in  the 11 building. That is, the long term tenant in 4 A  who 12 pays $ 593 . 88 per month and winters in Florida 13 incurs the same proportionate cost of oil,  real 14 estates taxes and insurance that the tenant in 6 A15who pays $ 1315 amonth does.16CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17MR. NICK PETRAS:	Exactly how fair 18is that?19CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20We get the point.	Why don' t you 21give us the --22( Mr. Schleider entered the Great 23Hall.)24MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Chairman, may I ask 25a question?

23	a second.456	today.7
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure. Hold on Go ahead. Go ahead.MS. CRUZ:	Thank you for coming Could you tell me and the  Board 
8 the number of years that you think that the  long 9 time tenant discount should be enacted, for  how 10 long that tenant --11 MR. NICK PETRAS:	Well, if you 12 just did a minimum increase -- and, in fact,  the 13 funny thing is, is that you asked about the --   what 14 kind of guidelines you want.15 If you just did the  minimum 16 increase across the board, it wouldn' t matter how 17 long the tenant, you know -- the problem is, is   the 18 skewing of the rents that has been created by  the 19 long term -- long term granting  of 20 lower- than- necessary increases by this Board.	But 21 if you just give a minimum increase, I don' t  think 22 you' d have to qualify it by years.23 MS. CRUZ:	What proportion of 24 your tenants are long term?25 MR. NICK PETRAS:	In this building 8 
2 it' s about -- it' s better than a quarter and that' s3 pretty typical. I could -- I just picked  this 4 building because it' s mostly one bedroom 5 apartments. I could use other buildings in  Queens 6 and come up with pretty much the identical  results.7 MS. CRUZ:	So the majority of 8 your tenants are long- term tenants.9 MR. NICK PETRAS:	Well, twenty 10 percent or 25 .	In this building 25 percent  have 11 been there for more than twenty years. I would  say 12 that the majority have been there for more  than 13 seven.14 MS. HOLDER:	So what' s your 15 definition of long term? I' m sorry.16 MR. NICK PETRAS:	Well, in the 17 case that I was using, I used  twenty years.	And 18 those -- and I just listed costs that went  per 19 apartment on more than $ 57 a month.20 MS. HOLDER:	So you' re asking this 21 Board to add like an additional supplement or a   tax 22 to people who have been in place for twenty  years23 or more?24 MR. NICK PETRAS:	I would simply 25 say pass a guidelines and then - and in my   opinion,2 
2 and I' m going to get shot by the rest of  the 3 industry for saying this, it can be three and  six,4 but if you give us the $ 50 and the $ 75 .	I' m not 5 going to -- and let me just make another  point.6 MS. HOLDER:	No. I just need 7 clarification on what your request  is.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The firing 9 squad has just shown up, by the  way.10 MS. HOLDER:	So you' re saying you 11 want a supplement on those apartment where  people 12 have been in place for twenty or 25  years?13 MR. NICK PETRAS:	No. I' m simply 14 saying that on the renewal lease I want the --   I15 want the higher of, for a one- year $ 50 or let' s say 16 three percent, and for a two- year $ 75 or six 17 percent.18 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.19 MS. LEVINE:	Marvin.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Go ahead.21 MS. LEVINE:	Do you see any 22 benefit?	You know, in co- ops and condos they  have 23 flip taxes, for example, because they want  to 24 discourage people from selling their apartments25 quickly.2 
2 Do you see any advantage to  having 3 long- term tenants in your building in terms of 4 creating a community?	Is there an upside to  that?5 MS. NICK PETRAS:	A couple of 6 things.7 One is, I' m not so sure that' s the 8 reason you have flip taxes.9 And the other thing --10 MS. LEVINE:	That' s the reason 11 why it started.12 MR. NICK PETRAS:	Okay. Well, it 13 seems to be a way that co- ops try and avoid  raising 14 maintenance.15 The -- there is a benefit to --  I16 have -- we have some free market  units too.	And a17 good tenant who' s been in possession for a  long 18 time will necessarily -- when we' re doing the rent 19 renewals, we' ll necessarily give the guy a break 20 because I want to keep him in  place.21 You realize that on a vacancy of  a22 $ 1300 apartment that' s more than -- I mean if I' m23 vacant a month, that' s more than $ 100 .	If I flip 24 that over every year and was vacant a month  every 25 year, I' d be better off renting the apartment for 2 
2 twelve and a quarter than thirteen and a   quarter,3 let' s say, and not having that turnover. So there' s4 certainly a value to that.5 What the Board has given over  the 6 course of its existence is, I think unfair. I   think 7 it' s far more than ever should have been given.8 And, in fact, I remember, I  think 9 there was an article in the Village Voice  several 10 years ago about the skewed rent situation. And  they 11 tried to make the argument that, the author  tried 12 to make the argument that these numbers are  similar 13 in the free market world. And I just don' t  see 14 that. I think that the long- term tenant discount is 15 a lot less pronounced than the free market  world.16 MS. LEVINE:	And you' re quoting 17 from -- you' re citing from your own profit and  loss 18 statements.	The tenants have demanded or  have 19 asked us to talk about opening up books of  the 20 landlords.21 Because you' re citing your own 22 profit and loss statements, do you have  any 23 problems with --24 MR. NICK PETRAS:	I think that' s a25 red herring as an argument  --2 

234	you why.5
MS. LEVINE:	I' m just curious.MR. NICK PETRAS:	-- and I' ll tell Every year I have to file  RPIEs 
6 with the City.	So the City gets the  aggregate 7 data. Everyday I get setups from brokers and  some 8 numbers I can trust and some numbers I can' t  trust.9 I don' t think there' s any great 10 secret about the profitability and the  income 11 characteristics of these buildings. I' ve been doing 12 this long enough to know when somebody' s snowing 13 someone else.14 Now, if any of my tenants want  to 15 come and look at the books for this building,  it 16 doesn' t make any difference to me because there' s17 nothing that' s being hidden.18 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure. Go 20 ahead.21 MS. HOLDER:	So you had talked 22 about that you had, in this one particular  building 23 that you were looking at, you had apartments  that 24 were renting for $ 1300 and then you had these  other 25 apartments that were --6 
2 MR. NICK PETRAS: Um- hmm.3 MS. HOLDER:	--	renting, I guess 4 for $ 700 or something, I mean in the  aggregate 5 though.	And you have been, and your family  has 6 been in this business since the last -- since  the 7 50 ' s.	It seems as if you all are still able  to 8 maintain yourselves. I mean I don' t know --  and 9 then what is it that you' re seeing in terms of  your 10 profitability and --11 MR. NICK PETRAS:	It' s June and I12 still have unpaid oil bills in  the hopper.	That' s13 the difference.14 MS. HOLDER:	Right.	And the same 15 way that those costs have gone up for fuel,  these 16 are the same kinds of costs that have gone up   for 17 everybody.18 You know, the issue that we  have 19 that' s presented to us is how is it we deal  with 20 this given the fact that tenants themselves  have 21 experienced similar increases.22 MR. NICK PETRAS:	Well, I' m saying 23 that the guy who' s paying the $ 573 a month should 24 bear more of the cost than -- at least equal   the 25 cost than the person who' s paying the $ 1300 a2 
2 month. That' s what I' m saying.3 MR. LANGUEDOC:	But why is 4 that -- you don' t -- as an owner, what  difference 5 does it make --6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ron, use the 7 microphone.8 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I' m sorry.9 MR. NICK PETRAS:	Because if I try 10 and raise that $ 1300 person' s rent, they' ll walk 11 down the street.	They' re topped out.	The only way 12 I' m going to get my rent roll up is bringing  the 13 lower end up.14 MS. HOLDER:	But I guess the 15 argument would be, isn' t it -- the argument would 16 be, though that aren' t you able to sustain yourself 17 because you do have these different levels  of 18 rents.19 And so if the revenue that  comes20 in for you is adequate for you to maintain  the 21 building, and you do derive a benefit because  you 22 said that you will give a break to long- term 23 tenants because you recognize there' s a value in 24 longer term tenants, I don' t understand --25 MR. NICK PETRAS:	I just said in 2 
2 my opinion that that value is not the value  that 3 you folks -- and I know that the Board  changes 4 every year.	It' s not the aggregate value that the 5 Board has given over the course of years. It  just 6 isn' t.7 I' m going to give them -- I' m8 going to give -- I would give this $ 1300 person  --9 and mind you, I actually believe that if there  were 10 no rent regulation, the $ 1300 apartment would 11 probably be more like a $ 1200 apartment.	I would 12 give the person a $ 50 , a $ 70 break. I wouldn' t give 13 them a $ 750 break, which is what the example that  I14 gave you is here.15 MS. HOLDER:	But the problem 16 is, is that this Board has to deal with  the 17 universe of a million units and, you know, we' re 18 talking about landlords who may not be like  you.19 And we' re talking about folks who are living and 20 who are in place in buildings where this might  not 21 necessarily be the case.22 And so for you to tell us  that 23 this is what you' re trying to apply as a  blanket 24 guideline --25 MR. NICK PETRAS:	What you' re 2 
2 doing, though is the exact -- is, I think, is   or 3 you' re arguing for, is the same thing that I' m4 arguing for.	You' re just simply saying, look,5 let' s leave them there.	Let' s leave the same 6 number on a percentage basis on everybody  because 7 of some sort sense of fairness that  you have.	And 8 I just don' t understand how it' s fair if the price 9 for operating an apartment -- and I just gave  you 10 three -- three costs.	I didn' t give you 11 maintenance. I didn' t give you the elevator 12 contract. I didn' t give you water, which is  going 13 up 26 percent over the last two  years.14 If that price has gone up $ 57 per 15 apartment per month in this building, I don' t16 understand how you give that person a $ 25  increase.17 I just don' t. I don' t see how it' s fair.18 MS. HOLDER:	But also understand 19 that a lot -- there' s been a lot of testimony  of 20 the landlords or the owners, who come before  us,21 that they value the long- term tenancies.	That has 22 been a lot of the testimony from the owner  members.23 There has been a lot of testimony that looking  at 24 the cost and what happens in your buildings  and,25 you know, when you talk about open your books  and 2 
2 what' s going on, it' s also the case - and we' ve had 3 testimony in one of the previous hearings where  we 4 had expert testimony - where a lot of the   increases5 that you' re asking for still are not going to  make 6 up this gap that you' re talking about. And, you 7 yourself, there still is a  gap.8 So we' re now creating a hardship 9 for tenants that you' re saying still might not meet 10 your needs despite the fact that it seems  like 11 you' re in the red in your buildings.12 You know, when people are  telling 13 us that they have an additional cost for  an 14 improvement of $ 7 , 000 , I don' t necessarily see 15 where an additional $ 50 in each apartment is going 16 to meet that for that person if they' re having 17 these inordinate expenses and perhaps there' s18 another way in which we' re supposed to be dealing 19 with people who are in the business of  providing 20 this housing and what it is and what you need   to 21 afford.22 ( Audience participation.)23 MS. HOLDER:	But the tax that 24 you' re asking on these units just still seems to  be 25 pushing it further and further  --2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.3 MS. HOLDER:	-- from tenants being 4 able to afford it and still not meeting your  needs,5 your inordinate needs that you all are telling  us 6 that we have to take on face on what you   actually 7 say your costs are.8 MR. NICK PETRAS:	Look, I know 9 that there are good years and there are bad  years 10 for everybody.	I understand that.11 But let me say a couple of  things.12 One is, you' ve repeatedly -- you repeated, after 13 I' ve said three times, that I think that the 14 discount, the long- term discount is far too much in 15 my opinion and I' m sure that everybody on the 16 owners side will say the same  thing.17 I don' t -- I think that there is 18 some value to it. Certainly not the value  you 19 ascribe to it.20 The second thing is, is that  I21 don' t see how going up six percent on a $ 1300 rent,22 which is what, almost $ 100 , is -- is -- which I23 probably can' t collect, is more fair than having 24 everybody go up $ 50 for a one- year lease. I don' t25 understand that.	And I don' t think you -- I don' t2 
2 think -- and I know that you' re not testifying.  I3 don' t think it' s been adequately answered.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any additional 5 questions?6 ( No response.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 MR. NICK PETRAS:	Thank you.9 ( Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Edwin Daig.11 After Mr. Daig:12 Uzi Evron;13 Followed by Vajra Kilgour;14 Followed by Lewis Barbanel.15 Go ahead, Mr. Daig.16 MR. EDWIN DAIG:	Good day.17 I -- this is my first  experience 18 ever coming here.	And I guess I should give you  a19 little background about myself ' cause it may make 20 things easier.21 I' m a retired New York City school 22 teacher.	I' ve put in 31 years and retired, it  will 23 be five years this June.	And I was very happily 24 retired.25 But at one time I guess I could  be 2 
2 considered a landlord.	I lived in the Bronx in  a3 family and bought it, bought my brothers  out.4 Fifty- five years I' ve lived there. I bought them 5 out about, well, I' ve been in the City, it will  be 6 six years this October.	So I bought them out  about 7 sixteen or seventeen years ago ' cause I didn' t want 8 the family house to disappear. And I guess it  had 9 too many memories or whatever, but eventually  I10 sold it.11 That' s why I' m not a tenant.12 And I did have tenants. It  was 13 just a two- family house. And I know there' s always 14 two sides to a story.	And I' m glad I' m living in 15 the City.16 But I' m a realistic person. I know 17 what my pension is and things  are changing.	And 18 the middle class is not going to stay in this   City.19 I mean I' m not dressed here to show you  anything.20 But I was also looking already for part- time jobs 21 or other opportunities. I know I can always go   back 22 into teaching but I want to try some  new 23 experiences.24 It' s only fair that I feel that 25 somehow landlords have to open up their books.  You 2 
2 know, if they' re screaming they need such 3 increases, we have to see what profits they' re 4 making. I know when I moved to the City --  there' s5 a lot of dishonestly all around.	I was concerned 6 about Major Capital Improvement for the apartment  I7 moved into. I don' t even want to go through  the 8 whole details of that procedure.	But something was 9 given in my favor but I think it was like a   little 10 token.	And I did, after, I guess, two years  of 11 battling my landlord, I did get a check  with 12 interest of $ 1 , 700 back and my rent was reduced a13 little bit.14 But the point is, what I' m trying 15 to say -- and I think Ms. Levine sort of asked   the 16 other gentleman.	I' m educated.	When I know my 17 rent is going too high, I look around for  another 18 place to go.	You know, I don' t like Florida all of 19 the year but I do like it in the winter. Thank   God 20 my brother' s best friend lets me come down for  two 21 or three months and it' s not that much of  an 22 expense.23 But the way my rent is  increasing 24 it' s, depending on what' s going to happen with your 25 decision, I would say it would be forty percent  of 2 
2 my pension, which I think is a little too high.   And 3 I' ve given up my car in the City.	You don' t really 4 need it.	You know, you have public transportation 5 which is so cheap so you can' t complain about  that.6 So I' m just wondering if you could 7 do anything to keep this City good for  everybody.8 And I' m even more concerned about the poor because 9 I don' t know how they' re going to be able to 10 sustain all these increases.11 ( Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 MR.

They even got a new deal that you can    retire 6 in less time.7 I started when I was  25 .	Too bad 8 it wasn' t 23 ' cause it would have been more 9 beneficial.	I would have been in a better tier  and 10 better off financially.

8 speak into the mike.9 MS. ADAMS:	-- just before you,10 Mr. Petras, --11 MR. EDWIN DAIG:	Yes.12 MS. ADAMS:	-- said that he 13 thought that the matter of getting landlords  to 14 open their books was a red herring issue. And,  of 15 course, you think that they  should.16 Do you have any argument to  his 17 argument?18 MR. EDWIN DAIG:	This, as I said,19 is my first time. I always feel there' s two  sides20 to a story.	I guarantee you there' s probably some 21 landlords out there who are not doing that  well.22 But I guarantee you there' s many that are doing 23 extremely well.24 I mean with this Major  Capital 25 Improvements and the twenty percent vacancy, I  mean 8 
2 it' s unbelievable what they can get.	And I know 3 when I had a two- family house, I didn' t raise my 4 tenants.	When I got a tenant that I really   liked 5 that sort of paid me the rent by the eighth of   the 6 month, even though I begged them for the  first 7 since I had two mortgages, I didn' t raise  their 8 rents for seven years and I had  two mortgages.	I9 did other things, tutoring or whatever so,  you 10 know.11 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Which part of 13 the City do you live  in?14 MR. EDWIN DAIG:	Dyre Avenue.15 MS.

CRUZ:	As an owner, when your 20 heating bills went up, when your electricity  bills21 went up, when your taxes went up, when your  water 22 bills went up, are you telling us that you wouldn' t23 ask your tenants to share those costs to -- or   were 24 you just operating your building at  a loss?	Would 25 you be willing to operate your building at a   loss?2 
2 MR. EDWIN DAIG:	Well, I think 3 it' s different for a two- family, you know, you' re 4 living right next door to you. It was the  family 5 house.	I' ve have tenants that I had take to  court 6 when I gave them a lease because they didn' t  pay 7 the rent.	And the Judge said, do you think  this 8 guy' s going to renew your lease if you haven' t paid 9 the last five months?10 So I was happy to get a  nice 11 tenant who I knew was taking care of what  something 12 that meant to me, you know, ' cause my father 13 inherited it from his aunt when he came over  from 14 Europe when he was real young. And that was  about 15 eighty years ago.	So I didn' t always worry about 16 that.17 I mean, you know, maybe  things 18 weren' t -- six years ago things weren' t that bad as 19 they are now.	But I guess now you never know. It' s20 a different situation.21 MS. CRUZ:	And Mr. Daig, let' s22 assume in your building, I don' t know where it  is 23 that you' re currently living.	It' s --24 MR. EDWIN DAIG:	It sounds nice.25 Central Park West.	But it' s a walk- up.2 
2 MS. CRUZ:	Okay.	That property 3 owner has incurred increases in real estate  taxes 4 that are extremely high. They' re going to be 5 getting a fuel bill that everyone, I think on   this 6 Board recognizes is extraordinary unlike any  types 7 of increases that have occurred in the past  ten 8 years.9 Your property owner is going to  be 10 facing increases in water bills, increases  in 11 utility bills.	Let' s say that now he starts 12 foregoing maintenance because he cannot meet  those 13 basic expenses because his rents are  not 14 commensurate.15 Are you saying that only  through 16 vacancies and only through market tenants,  however 17 few may come, since if you are a rent  regulated 18 tenant, you are not going to move out of  that 19 apartment on Central Park West, that that  somehow 20 is going to make up the  difference?21 MR. EDWIN DAIG:	I really don' t22 know if I understand everything you' re saying.23 MS. CRUZ:	My question is, would 24 you rather live --25 ( Audience participation.)2 
2 MS. CRUZ:	Would you rather live 3 in a well- maintained building in which the owner is 4 collecting rent that is covering his costs,  or 5 where the owner is just struggling in terms of  I6 have to wait until I get a vacancy in order   to 7 makeup the difference to pay the fuel  bill?8 Tell me what you prefer, to  live 9 in a well- maintained building or to live in  a10 building that will begin inevitably to  incur 11 maintenance lapses?	It is just a matter  of 12 economics.	And as a school teacher I' m sure you 13 understand some semblance of economics.14 MR. EDWIN DAIG:	I hope I do.15 That' s why I mentioned the point 16 when I realized that my rent is going up so   much 17 higher and other things aren' t happening.18 It' s really hard for me to answer.19 I know I want something nice. But believe it   or 20 not, I' ve been in that building almost six years 21 and my landlord' s paying -- all right, we' re going 22 to let the cat of  the bag.	It' s a little over --23 $ 1 , 450 is my rent.24 I did win a little decrease  on 25 Major Capital Improvements ' cause he tried three 2 
2 times to sort of say he had to get rid of   garbage 3 in the apartment and the DHCR didn' t go with  it.4 But they didn' t listen to any of my  other 5 complaints or whatever and I wish they would  have.6 I don' t think my landlord,7 considering what I was paying, really took care  of 8 the building.	Finally, tenants told me, I  think 9 they said it was fifteen years ago it was  last 10 painted.	I visited my family in Germany. Came   back 11 and the hallways were painted. It looks like  a12 million dollars.13 I volunteer locally in the  Jewish 14 home in my neighborhood. I see those floors  are 15 spotless. I sort of mention it to the landlord  it 16 would be nice to have floors that look a little   bit 17 nicer, you know.	I think even the young people  in 18 my building, we would even wax the floors  ourselves 19 but he wouldn' t allow that.20 So I mean it' s really not 21 maintained that well. And something that, I  guess 22 dealing with economics, I' ve seen what has 23 happened. I guess my particular landlord  or 24 landlords know there' s ways that they can go about 25 increasing the amount of money in their  pockets,2 
2 and, you know, with Major Capital Improvements  with 3 people moving out and the twenty  percent.4 But the point is they also  know,5 and I think everyone is aware -- I live, as   I6 mentioned, in that area of the City and that' s  very 7 close to Columbia.	So frequently they get new 8 tenants in ' cause they' re looking for students who 9 only stay a year and mama and papa don' t  mind 10 signing that check for $ 1500 for a little studio.11 So it becomes vacant the following year when  the 12 kid wants something else.13 So you people have to decide  if 14 you want to save the City  or whatever.	I think the 15 middle class people -- I want to help those who   are 16 poorer. I don' t mind paying my taxes,	I really 17 don' t, as long as it goes to help other people,  you 18 know, those who are less fortunate. I don' t  like 19 giving it to people on the subway ' cause I don' t20 know what they do with  it.21 ( Applause.)22 MR. EDWIN DAIG:	But I' m too 23 educated.

But let' s not --  we 17 heard you, but I don' t want to debate now.18 Uzi Efron, Evron, excuse me.19 Hold on one second while I  read 20 some names.21 Vajra Kilgour;22 Lewis Barbanel;23 Followed by Domingo Aponte.24 Go ahead, Mr. Evron.25 MR. UZI EVRON:	First of all, I' d15 
2 like to thank you for the opportunity to speak  to 3 you.4 MS. HOLDER:	Speak up.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' ve got to 6 speak into the mike.	That' s good. Close, as close 7 as you can get.8 MS. UZI EVRON:	Okay.	I' d like to 9 thank you, as I said, for the opportunity  to 10 testify in front of you.11 Together with few investors, we 12 own nine buildings in Harlem.	Total 144 13 apartments.	Two years ago or three years,  actually 14 we had about $ 200 , 000 cash flow from the buildings.15 Last year we had about $ 100 , 000 . Next year we are 16 facing about a $ 40 , 000 shortfall based on a five 17 percent increase, if you approve five percent,  and 18 based on what I know I' ll pay in oil.19 I attached all the numbers.20 People talked about here not 21 opening the books. You have all my numbers from  all 22 my buildings there. And next year I am  anticipating 23 to pay $ 160 , 000 more only in energy cost.24 If I divide it to my  144 25 apartments, I got an increase of, or  additional 2 
2 cost per apartment of $ 92 a month.	This is only 3 for energy, not considering taxes that increased  in 4 my specific building twenty percent a year,  water 5 that increased ten or fifteen, and other  expenses 6 that are increased by about four to eight  percent.7 Another problem I have that  was 8 talked about here is low rent  apartments.9 I have thirty units out of my  144 10 which is the twenty percent of my units  paying 11 below six hundred dollars with additional 35  units 12 paying below 900 .	So I' m talking about forty 13 percent of my apartments paying less than $ 900 .14 At four percent increase or  five 15 percent increase on these numbers, you are  talking 16 about a small fraction of the increase I' m  facing 17 only in energy cost.18 So, again, my recommendation or  my 19 request to you guys is an increase of ten  percent 20 for a one- year lease with a minimum of a  hundred 21 dollars.22 Alternatively, if the increase can 23 be a bit smaller, at about seven percent per   year,24 but some kind of a surcharge for fuel cost  that 25 will offset at least a bit of that cost, and   to 2 
2 consider a special interest for $ 600 and below rent 3 -- an increase for this low rent  apartment.4 In the end, I' d like you to 5 remember that bottom line, if we cannot keep  our 6 buildings and generate some cash flow so we  can 7 live on, we will have to force -- be forced to   cut 8 improvements and services.	And at the end, the 9 sufferer will be the tenants.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 MR. UZI EVRON:	Thank you.12 ( Applause.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Vajra Kilgour.14 MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	Hi.	My name 15 is Vajra Kilgour.16 I live in West Harlem, also  near 17 Columbia -- near Columbia University and  other 18 schools.19 I am a long- term tenant.	I' ve 20 been in my apartment for  36 years.	My rent is 21 higher than the average that we cited by  the 22 president of the organization and considerably 23 higher than the lower figure that he  reported.24 It is forty percent of  my 25 take- home pay.2 
2 There are quite a number  of 3 long- term tenants in my building.	And the point 4 that was raised by a board member about the  value 5 of holding communities whole and entire is, in  my 6 estimation, incalculable.7 I helped my neighbors raise  their 8 kids, their grandkids. We' re working on some great 9 grandkids now.10 About -- at one time the  building 11 was owned by the Jewish  Theological Seminary.	They 12 attempted an empty- out which we mostly fought off.13 But about half of the apartments were rented  to 14 students.15 And when the Seminary then  did 16 what they probably should have done in the  first 17 place and sold the building to a private  landlord,18 they maintained a deal with that landlord  whereby 19 they would have apartments leased to  their 20 students. They charged their students a six  percent 21 increase per year.22 And their rents begin anywhere 23 from half as much to maybe twice as much as   what 24 some of the long- term rent stabilized tenants are 25 paying.	So that landlord is obviously doing  quite 2 
2 well.	They do not need a rent  increase.3 They do not do much in the way  of 4 maintenance.	We don' t have clean hallways. We 5 don' t have a good paint job.6 We have rents -- we have  rats 7 partying nightly in the courtyard where the  garbage 8 is because the low- cost garbage containers don' t9 close properly and the rats can easily get in.  So 10 you' ve got rats also running back and forth across 11 the sidewalk all night long out  front.12 And I -- I really -- you know,  I13 heard the landlord testimony and it kind of  reminds 14 me of something I read somewhere, you know,  once 15 upon a time there was a good little wolf who   was 16 horribly mistreated by the lambs.17 When people talk about, it' s not 18 fair long- term tenants, they don' t enter into the 19 fairness of disparate incomes. That' s not an issue.20 When this Board talks about how  we 21 don' t want to solve the social problems of a  lack 22 of affordable housing here because, you know,  those 23 are policy things that need to be  decided 24 elsewhere, the issue of water rates going up  and 25 taxes going up doesn' t seem to be considered to  be 2 
2 a policy issue that ought to be addressed  elsewhere 3 by the landlords, but instead is something  that 4 goes -- is passed onto the  tenants.5 There are Major Capital increases 6 which our landlord got and which landlords  get.7 There are -- they can open their books and they   can 8 get a hardship discount.	I know you don' t look at 9 profitability.	I know you don' t look at violations 10 on buildings.11 I can guarantee you that 12 maintenance will not be improved because  basically 13 it' s what you' re hearing.	Nobody likes to get a14 cut in their salary. I don' t want it. My salary  has 15 been the same since 2001 . That' s not much fun but I16 certainly wouldn' t like a cut.17 Folks' profitability may be going 18 a bit down. That' s what they' re concerned about.19 But, hey, they' re still making plenty of money.20 So what you' re looking at is the 21 human nature thing of I don' t want my profitability 22 to go down.	I want to make ever more and more  and 23 more and more, which is human nature. But it is   the 24 job of this Board to prevent rent gouging and it   is 25 the job of this Board to maintain  stable 2 
2 communities. That' s another part of the charge of 3 this Board.4 ( Applause.)5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 MS.

VAJRA KILGOUR:	This is West 14 Harlem.15 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Seven hundred --16 MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	Right, which 17 is forty percent of my take- home pay.18 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay.19 MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	That doesn' t20 leave a whole lot over.21 MR. LANGUEDOC:	So what would be 22 -- what would be the impact on you of say,   a23 proposed -- there' s been different things discussed 24 already about a hundred dollar minimum  rent 25 increase, for example.12 
2 MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	Well, I3 actually took a two- year lease the last time so I' m4 looking at my neighbors.	Okay?	But the impact on 5 a lot of people -- you know, I don' t know  where 6 people are supposed to take the money out  of 7 anymore.	So, you know, they take it out of   medical 8 care. They take it out of food. They take it   out 9 of, you know --10 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Could you afford 11 a hundred dollar increase?12 MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	No.	And 13 what' s almost more to the point in a way is  that 14 I' m hanging on by a thin thread until I can hit  the 15 senior citizen rent increase exemption.	Because if 16 I can get to that with my rent around $ 700 or so  a17 month, then -- and it continued to work at the   same 18 rate, then I will be able to retire on   Social 19 Security, which is all I got coming, when I' m20 seventy. Okay? Assuming I can keep working  until 21 I' m seventy, I' ll be able to retire.22 I will not be able to live  any 23 more in the neighborhood that I helped to make,  you 24 know, a neighborhood that now suddenly all kind  of 25 folks want to live in.	It' s not that much fun to 2 
2 live in a quasi- dormitory, I' m here to tell you.3 You know, a lot of young folks  --4 MR. LANGUEDOC:	So you could not 5 afford a hundred dollar increase of rent  --6 MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	And neither 7 could be my neighbors.	And it' s not just -- my 8 little apartment is not -- is not the full  extent 9 of my home. My home is my building and  my 10 neighborhood, my block, my community, the  people 11 that I see everyday.	That' s my home.12 MR.

2	name, please.3
MR. LEWIS BARBANEL:	My name is 
4 Lewis Barbanel, B- a- r- b- a- n- e- l, Barbanel.5 I' m President of Barbanel Rose 6 Management. We manage 1500 apartments in the  City 7 of New York.8 I' ve testified in front of the 9 Board on and off for the last ten  years.10 The Board has passed increases11 every year that does not cover our  operating 12 expenses and the basic expenses that can  be 13 universally verified:	Real estate taxes, water,14 sewer, insurance and fuel.	All these things have 15 gone up significantly.16 Real estate taxes went up  25 17 percent in 2004 .18 Water, sewer, up 26 percent.	But 19 when you compound it, it' s closer to forty percent.20 I feel it' s unfair to give increases way beyond  the 21 ability of buildings to carry them when  our 22 increases in rent is significantly lower than  these 23 -- the City and State set for  us.24 Since September 11 th insurance has 25 gone up. It' s almost doubled.	And as stated, that 4 
2 number is a little ironic. They claim that it' s  for 3 terrorism.	But if you want to get  terrorism 4 coverage, you have to pay extra on top of  that 5 increase.6 Fuel, of course, is driving up  not 7 only fuel, but other things such as your labor  cost 8 and your renovations and maintenance.9 Another cost that is something 10 that is not recognized is that the new led law   that 11 was passed in 2004 can be extremely  onerous.12 We have a building that costs  us 13 $ 100 , 000 a year for the last three years in a row 14 for led abatement.	And we know at this point  that 15 the led poisoning is not sourced in the  building 16 but it' s actually sourced elsewhere.17 That is not something you get  an 18 MCI for, not something you get a J 51  for.19 We use the MCI system in order  to 20 improve properties. We buy buildings from  owners.21 We had a 55 - unit building that had 22 400 violations on it. We purchased it and we  MCI' d23 the building to the point we' re down to fifty 24 violations. We made it a better place to live   for 25 everybody.	There is tremendous benefit for the  MCI 2 

2	program.3
We also do MCIs that are  not 
4 things that you get an increase for such  as 5 renovating hallways just to improve the quality  of 6 life for people living in the  building.7 With that, even though I haven' t8 used up my time, I' ll thank you.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.10 MS. ADAMS:	The buildings that 11 you have purchased, when' s the last time you 12 purchased a building?13 MR. LEWIS BARBANEL:	May of ' 07 .14 MS. ADAMS:	May ' 07 .	This was 15 also during the time that the increases passed  by 16 the Board had not met your operating  costs.17 MR. LEWIS BARBANEL:	Correct.18 MS. ADAMS:	I don' t understand.19 Why would you be buying more  buildings?20 MR. LEWIS BARBANEL:	The only 21 reason you buy buildings are futures so you can  MCI 22 the property and you wait for apartments to  come 23 back that are low rents and renovate and  improve 24 them.25 MS. ADAMS:	I see.4 
2 Would you also help me  understand,3 at a time when the increases have not met  the 4 operating costs, where you' ve been making it up.5 MR. LEWIS BARBANEL:	We make it --6 MS. ADAMS:	I mean what have you 7 done in your buildings?	Has the maintenance gone 8 down or --9 MR. LEWIS BARBANEL:	No. The 10 maintenance has not gone down.	We have old 11 buildings that carry the younger buildings. That' s12 really what it is.	So --13 MS. ADAMS:	Explain.14 MR. LEWIS BARBANEL:	-- the older 15 buildings that have been around are able to  carry 16 the younger buildings.	Basically they' re at low 17 mortgages at this point. There' s more income coming 18 off of those.	And even those, at this point,  are 19 not doing the way anyone anticipated due to  the 20 increases cost.21 Fuel this year is absolutely 22 absurd. You know, we' re paying our fuel bills in 23 June. We' ll be paying through August.24 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.25 MR. LEWIS BARBANEL:	You' re 2

( Applause.)MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Chairman, I have CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	A question. MS. CRUZ:	Excuse me.CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Barbanel.
9	We have another question.10 MS. CRUZ:	How do you fund your 11 MCIs generally when you don' t have the rental 12 income to cover it? Do you mortgage the  buildings?13 MR. LEWIS BARBANEL:	How do we --14 when we purchase the property, we put  additional 15 money at acquisition point to do the  capital 16 improvements. And if it' s down the line where we 17 have a property, then we' ll take a new mortgage  in 18 order to do the MCIs.19 MS. CRUZ:	So give me an example 20 of a building that you purchased with the 400 ,  you 21 said 400 violations.22 MR. LEWIS BARBANEL:	Correct.23 MS. CRUZ:	How much money did 24 you have to put into that building in order  to 25 renovate it, bring it up to code and to give   a10 
2 better quality of life to everybody in  that 3 building?4 MR. LEWIS BARBANEL:	It was about 5 $ 400 , 000 .	We did a brand new teardown roof,  new 6 pointing a hundred percent, an elevator  renovation 7 cab and mechanisms, new wiring, a hundred  percent 8 wiring and we put in a brand new boiler to   the 9 property.10 MS. CRUZ:	And how long is it 11 going to take for you to recover that  investment 12 given the MCI system?13 MR. LEWIS BARBANEL:	The MCI 14 system now takes, it' s over 84 months for a15 building- wide MCI.16 MS. CRUZ:	Correct.	But the 17 actual income from the tenants are -- that you' re 18 to be receiving is capped.	For example, no one can 19 pay you more than a certain  --20 MR. LEWIS BARBANEL:	Six percent,21 correct, correct.22 MS. CRUZ:	-- percentage of their 23 rent.24 MR. LEWIS BARBANEL:	And there' s25 another interesting irony. The high rent  apartments 2 
2 in the building we don' t charge the MCI to  because 3 they' re maxed out.	So it is an interesting  irony.4 We never collect the full MCI on a property. With   a5 six percent cap it takes a lot more than 84   months.6 MS. CRUZ:	That' s right.7 Approximately now long, typically 8 does it take for you to recoup your  investment 9 after putting out the cash, the $ 400 , 000 or 10 whatever amount of money that it takes for you  to 11 bring up these buildings?12 MR. LEWIS BARBANEL:	It could take 13 up to ten years.14 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.15 MR.

LANGUEDOC:	Sir, are you 14 eligible for SCRIE?15 THE INTERPRETER:	He' s going to 16 apply again for SCRIE.	He was -- he didn' t qualify 17 last year because of his  income.18 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay.19 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.21 MS. HOLDER:	Sir, you had SAID 22 something about the maintenance of the  buildings,23 the conditions.24 Can you elaborate on what you' re 25 referring to.7 
2 MR. DOMINGO APONTE:	Right now we 3 have the landlord in court.	We did an HP action 4 because the landlord didn' t want to do any repairs 5 in the building and in the  apartments.6 MS. HOLDER:	What kind of 7 conditions?8 MR. DOMINGO APONTE:	His apartment 9 wasn' t that bad because he was doing his own 10 repairs.	Not only the repairs in the   apartments,11 but also in the building he don' t keep  maintenance 12 and he doesn' t take the garbage.	There' s a lot of 13 garbage accumulation in the building to the  point 14 that the Judge from the HP court, the Housing  Court 15 came to the building to inspect last  week.16 MS. CRUZ:	Sir, are you paying 17 rent at this time or is your building on a   rent 18 strike?19 Okay. I understood. I  speak 20 Spanish.21 THE RGB BOARD: We don' t.22 ( Laughter.)23 MR.

DOMINGO APONTE:	You' re 18 welcome.19 ( Applause.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Margaret 21 Interlandi; and 22 Then Deb Howard;23 Then Councilman Yassky.24 Go ahead.25 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	Hi.	My 12 
2 name is Margaret Interlandi and I own a  six- family 3 building in Brooklyn and I' ve owned it for the  last 4 47 years.	It was my parents' and I inherited  it.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You said 47 6 years?7 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	Yeah.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.9 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	My 10 problem is not like most people are  complaining 11 about in this room. I mean I certainly have   empathy 12 for every tenant out there. I can totally  identify 13 with what they' re complaining about.	I feel the 14 same way and I' m not a tenant.15 But I think that the Board  or 16 somebody in this community or whatever, this  State,17 has to go further than this every year. There  has 18 to be some sort of regulations that have to be   put 19 in place that can sort of keep things  under 20 control, otherwise there will be many, many  tenants21 plus landlords who are going to be in very  deep 22 problems.23 Now, as far as the people  who 24 can' t afford to live, well, the City has these 25 units that they go to and they can show what   they 2 
2 earn and they can move  into them.	And I don' t even 3 know how good they are. But I think what  should 4 happen here is that we should try somehow to  get 5 things under wraps.6 We cannot do this every year.	We 7 cannot continue with this pace. It' s not going to 8 work. It' s like a balloon. We' re blowing it up and 9 the landlord is in deep and so are the tenants.   And 10 you can' t expect the landlord to carry everything 11 and you can' t expect the tenants to do  this.12 So I mean somebody out there  has 13 got to listen to something and make some sort  of 14 stability. You cannot keep coming in with  raises.15 It' s not comparable to the average man' s income.16 Not even a landlord.17 ( Applause.)18 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	I mean 19 somebody out there has to  do something.	You people 20 sit here every year and we go through this  argument 21 every year.	But this is not the answer.	It' s22 bigger than you guys. It' s got to be settled at  a23 higher level.24 ( Applause.)25 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	It just 2 
2 can' t go.	It can' t work.3 MS. ADAMS:	We agree.4 Who would you suggest should do  --5 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	Well, I6 think we should start with the Mayor of this  City.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have 8 Councilman Yassky.	He said he' s listening.	He' s9 going to give us a few  answers.10 ( Applause.)11 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	Excuse 12 me?13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No. We have 14 some Council Members coming. We' ll ask them the 15 questions.16 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	Well, I17 think you need to, sir, because it' s unfair.18 People are hurting.	Landlords are hurting with 19 small buildings like my own.	People that are 20 trying to make a living and support a family.   You 21 can' t do this every year. It' s not going to work.22 There' s going to be a breaking point.23 ( Applause.)24 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI: Something 25 has got to give for all of  us.2 

234	appreciate it.5
Thank you for listening to me. CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you. IMS. CRUZ:	Ms. Interlandi, Ms.
6 Interlandi, can you describe, a little bit,  your 7 building and what hardships you' re currently 8 confronting.9 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	Well, to 10 be very honest with you I live in my building   so 11 that eliminates a big hardship. The reason being  is 12 because I' m there. If you have a problem, I' m13 there.	I don' t pay rent because I live there.  So 14 that' s a big savings for me. And I like  my 15 neighborhood and I like my little building  and 16 everybody that lives there likes it.17 But I take a lot of  differential 18 rents because I can' t expect the people that are 19 living there - and I like all of them - to   possibly 20 pay me more. I mean I only have certain --   they 21 only have certain income.22 ( Applause.)23 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	So 24 what' s happened now is that I find myself like I' m25 not -- I' ve got to admit I' m not paying out of my 6 
2 pocket yet. I' m not going to lie to you guys. I' m3 still living rent- free but I feel very bad. I don' t4 care what you come up with. I can' t expect  these 5 people to pay it.6 ( Applause.)7 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	I mean I8 can' t. I have an ugly building.	It' s a clean 9 building but I live there. I' m not just an 10 investor. It' s my home. I go home to it  everyday 11 and I love it.12 So the people that live there  are 13 also the same way. We' re kind of like family. But  I14 cannot expect these people to keep giving me  these 15 raises. It' s impossible. I mean what are we  going 16 to do?	And I can' t have an empty building so 17 something has to regulate here.18 I mean my taxes, as you all  know,19 have skyrocketed.	Let' s not talk about the fuel 20 here. I mean and now the water. What am I going   to 21 do, knock on your door and tell you get out of   the 22 shower? I think that' s a little tacky.23 ( Laughter.)24 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	I mean 25 come on. What' s the solution here? I mean I can' t2 
2 control these things. I can' t do that and  neither 3 can any other landlord and neither can a  tenant.4 Maybe he likes to take a shower, you  know.5 MS. LEVINE:	Do you have a6 proposal for us?7 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	Do I8 have what?9 MS. LEVINE:	Do you have a10 proposal? When you say that something needs to  get 11 done, --12 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	It' s13 always done.14 MS. LEVINE:	-- I want to  know 15 what your proposal is.	Do you have a  proposal?16 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	Yes, I17 do.	I have a  proposal.18 I think that everybody in  this 19 City of New York has to come forward and  realize 20 that the monies that we are being paid here  in 21 taxes and fuel and water and insurance since 9 / 11 ,22 I mean it' s been like forever for these terrorists 23 we' re paying back. Somebody' s got to come forward.24 Somebody out there has got to put the light  on.25 We' ve got to think out of this box.	You' ve got to 2 
2 go further.	You got to start talking to  these 3 people who can do something.4 ( Applause.)5 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	These 6 people can' t do anything. All they can do is  listen 7 to me and listen to them and listen  to him.	But 8 you know what, you' re not doing anything. You' re 9 not doing anything.10 ( Audience participation.)11 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	Not to 12 mention the -- I mean  really.13 MS. LEVINE:	If we could do 14 anything, what would it be that you want  --15 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	Well,16 you' ve got to stabilize the taxes.	You' ve got to 17 stabilize them.18 MS. LEVINE:	We don' t have any 19 authority over taxes.20 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	I know 21 but we' ve got to get together somehow. You' re going 22 to --23 MS. LEVINE:	I agree that we 24 have to get together.25 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	I mean 2 
2 so this is what we' ve got to fight for. If we' re 3 going to fight for anything, we' ve got to come 4 together and fight for the things that matter,  our 5 taxes, our insurances, our water.	We needed a6 water raise?	Come on, guys.7 ( Applause.)8 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	We all 9 need a water raise? We probably got enough water  in 10 New York to flood the City.	Meanwhile now we got a11 water raise.	So now we got to raise it and  then 12 tenants are too cold.	I mean come on. Think  about 13 it.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 MS. MARGARET INTERLANDI:	Think 16 about it.17 ( Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma' am, we' re 19 putting you on this board.	You' re the only person 20 that' s gotten applause from everybody.21 ( Laughter.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	But the minute 23 you get on this board, that' s the end of  your 24 applause.25 Deb Howard, please.2 
2 ( Applause.)3 MS. DEB HOWARD:	That' s a hard act 4 to follow.	She should be running for City  Council,5 huh?6 ( Laughter & Applause.)7 MS. DEB HOWARD:	Okay.	My name 8 is Deb Howard.	I' m the Executive Director of the 9 Pratt Area Community Council.10 We were founded in 1964 as a  group 11 of residents concerned about our neighborhoods  of 12 Forte Green, Clinton Hill, and Western  Bedford 13 Stuyvesant.14 We are a group of tenant and  block 15 associations and we still retain that --  those 16 roots in terms of community organizing and the  work 17 that we do.18 In 1980 we -- to fight  housing 19 abandonment, we became producers of  affordable 20 housing and established a full- time office. And 21 since then we' ve been working with homeowners,22 homebuyers, tenants, landlords, to try to  preserve 23 the affordability in our neighborhoods.24 PAC serves a geographic area  of 25 central Brooklyn, which incorporates Forte Greene,2 
 2 Clinton Hill, Bed Stuy, Prospect Heights, with  a3 strong focus on Community Districts # 2 , 3 and 8 .4 What we' re dealing with in our 5 neighborhoods in terms of gentrification and  the 6 loss of affordable housing for unregulated  tenants 7 has been a major force in our neighborhoods in   the 8 last ten to twelve years.9 Forte Green is still though, and 10 Clinton Hill, still have a median income that  is 11 only $ 24 , 524 . And 71 . 9 percent of the apartments 12 are rent occupied.13 And also in Bed Stuy we  have 14 experienced an influx of gentrification in the  last 15 few years. But the area median income is  actually 16 declined in the recent years since 2004 down to 17	from $ 27 , 000 down to $ 22 , 000 in 2005 .18		The income rate has increased from 19	29 , 000 to 34 . 5 thousand, 34 . 5 since 2005 .20 So what are we working with? We' re 21 working with unemployment rising. We' re working 22 with incomes that have not gone up, but where  costs 23 have gone up horribly.24 In the rent stabilized housing 25 stock that we have, which represents about  23 20 
2 percent of the housing stock, we' re seeing an ugly,3 ugly side to landlords and to the rent  stabilized 4 stock. Because what' s happening in our 5 neighborhoods is that investors are coming in  to 6 purchase the rent stabilized stock as7 under- performing assets. These rent stabilized 8 buildings are under tremendous pressure from 9 harassment to be vacated.10 For instance, in 99 Lafayette 11 Avenue, we had originally 71 units. Of those,  only 12 sixteen original tenants from a year and a half   ago 13 are still there because of the pressure  of 14 harassment to get people out.15 So, yes, there are the long- term 16 landlords who are concerned about their  building.17 Yes, they want to make  some money.	But they' re 18 also stable owners who understand what  their 19 investment is.20 But what we' re seeing now is the 21 ugly rise of predatory equity into our  buildings 22 where investors want to see a return of over  thirty 23 percent in one year. And that has -- the only   way 24 we can do that is by getting long- term tenants  out.25 And so we are -- that is the  real 2 
2 concern that we are seeing now in  our 3 neighborhoods.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 Thank you. Appreciate it.6 ( Applause.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.8 Question.9 MR. LANGUEDOC:	What do you 10 think the Board should do this year in terms  of 11 rent increases?12 MS. DEB HOWARD:	That' s a tough 13 question.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Tough 15 question.16 MS. DEB HOWARD:	We -- as you 17 know, we manage -- we manage low- income property.18 We have 57 buildings that  we manage.	We are seeing 19 the crunch as much something as anyone. We are  a20 little luckier than some in that we do  have 21 built- in reserves for some of our, you know, for 22 operating reserves.	But even --23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do you pay 24 property taxes in your building?25 MS. DEB HOWARD:	Yes.	They' re not 2 
2 nonprofit owners, no.	There' s -- well, certain 3 ones are. The ones that are HDFCs that  are 4 nonprofit are not paying.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Property 6 taxes.7 MS. DEB HOWARD:	Yeah. But 8 generally ours are limited partnerships where  they 9 do pay property taxes.10 Yes.11 MS. ADAMS:	Of the buildings that 12 you manage, are 23 percent of those  rent 13 stabilized?14 MS. DEB HOWARD:	All of our 15 buildings are rent stabilized.16 MS. ADAMS:	But you --17 MS. DEB HOWARD:	I said that the 18 housing stock throughout Forte Green, Clinton  Hill,19 Bed Stuy, is approximately 23 percent  rent 20 stabilized.21 MS. ADAMS:	Okay. Thank you.22 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Do you have an 23 opinion about what the Board should do this year  in 24 terms of rent increases?25 MS. DEB HOWARD:	It' s tough.2 

23	want to answer.45	you because the -- 67
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	She doesn' tMR. LANGUEDOC:	I have to ask MS. DEB HOWARD:	I know, I know. I think that they should be  --
8 from what we' re seeing in our neighborhood, so much 9 pressure is happening to -- with vacancy  decontrol 10 that I think that the rents should stay the same.   I11 mean I think the increases should be the  same 12 because obviously there' s the --13 ( Applause.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Just so I15 understand.	The rent should stay the same  which 16 means zero and the increases --17 MS. DEB HOWARD:	Zero, zero.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	-- and the 19 increases should stay the same which means  last 20 year' s increase?21 We' re going to get an answer out 22 of you.23 MS. DEB HOWARD:	Yes.	That the 24 rent levels should remain the same, not --  no 25 increase at this time.8 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Zero.3 ( Applause.)4 MS. DEB HOWARD:	Yes.5 MS. CRUZ:	Excuse me, excuse me.6 MS. DEB HOWARD:	Yes.7 MS. CRUZ:	How will you be able 8 to maintain the building that you manage with  no 9 increase?10 MS. DEB HOWARD:	Well, we' re 11 finding that the landlords have found other ways  to 12 do that and that' s --13 MS. CRUZ:	No.	Your buildings 14 where, yes, where you manage, where you have to  pay 15 the fuel, the electricity, the water, the  real 16 estates taxes. How will you do it with a   zero 17 percent --18 MS. DEB HOWARD:	We' re working on 19 the draw- downs on operating reserves that we have 20 to -- that we' ll have to do in order to  maintain 21 the buildings.22 ( Applause.)23 MS. CRUZ:	And how long will 24 that cover you?25 MS. DEB HOWARD:	It really depends 2 
2 on the age of the project that we' re working in.  We 3 are working to also restructure a number of our   --4 we have three projects right now that we' re 5 restructuring because they' re reaching the end of 6 their subsidy years so that it' s, you know, it' s7 tough. But I think that so far we' ve been able  to 8 manage under the -- the current -- the way they   are 9 currently, the current rents.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 ( Applause.)12 MS. DEB HOWARD:	And I will say 13 that our average rents, a two bedroom is  about 14 $ 525 . A one bedroom is $ 422 .	We have -- you know,15 so.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	But these 17 buildings - just to be fair - we have   subsidies 18 that have one percent mortgages. There' s been a  lot 19 of City support --20 MS. DEB HOWARD: Yes.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	-- put into 22 these buildings to lower the basis, if you  will.23 MS. DEB HOWARD:	Right.	But I' m24 not here testifying about our buildings. I was  here 25 testifying about the --2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I understand.3 MS. DEB HOWARD:	-- rent 4 stabilized housing stock that we' re seeing 5 throughout our neighborhoods, not the ones that we  6	--7 ( Applause.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I understand.9 Thank you.10 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.11 I have a question. I' m sorry. I have  question.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.13 Another question.14 MS. DEB HOWARD:	Sorry.15 Yes.16 MS. HOLDER:	In looking at the 17 neighborhoods that you all serve and that you  work 18 around --19 MS. DEB HOWARD:	Right.20 MS. HOLDER:	-- thinking about 21 the increase, possible increase that this  Board 22 would vote in, what do you think would happen  to 23 the tenants of Forte Green and of Clinton and  of 24 all the places that you talked about, especially  if 25 we' re talking about a minimum of a hundred  dollars 7 

2	per apartment?3
MS. DEB HOWARD:	A hundred dollar 
4 -- well, because we' re not seeing anybody' s incomes 5 going up, any raise is really going to hurt  anyone.6 I mean the last lady that testified  is right.	You 7 just -- there' s got to be another way.	Because 8 there -- you know, if you raise someone on a   fixed 9 income, I mean let' s also face it that a lot of  the 10 longer term tenants are retiring or close  to 11 retirement. They may have a -- they' re on  fixed 12 incomes.	They might be slightly over the   SCRIE,13 you know, guidelines, and so a rent of $ 750 , 850 is 14 going to be very harmful to  them.15 MS. HOLDER:	And when tenants 16 leave these neighborhoods in Brooklyn, where  do 17 they go?	If they find that they are in  an 18 apartment that' s in a unit that' s unaffordable,19 where do they go?20 MS. DEB HOWARD:	Well, homeless or 21 they move -- everybody is pushing east, you  know,22 it' s East New York. Bushwick is now too expensive.23 Down south, you know.24 ( Applause.)25 MS. DEB HOWARD:	We' re losing --4 
2 we' re losing people in our communities. And I  think 3 the point that the prior woman mentioned that  you 4 know, long- term tenancy, I mean isn' t just about 5 one building, it' s about a community. It' s about a6 neighborhood.	And we' re losing the character of 7 our neighborhood.8 ( Applause._9 MS. HOLDER: Thank you.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Council Member 11 David Yassky;12 He' ll be followed by Nick Pinto;13 Followed by Robert Foster;14 Followed by Albert Corion;15 Followed by Jimmy McMillan,16 McMillian I think.17 Council Member.18 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	Thank you.19 Thank you, Mr. Chair for giving me the  opportunity 20 to testify. And thank you for the referral of  the 21 person earlier. I appreciate it.22 I am here just to make two  very 23 simple points.24 First, I want to say, you' ll be 25 hearing later from my colleague, the Speaker of  the 2 
2 Council, Christine Quinn and the Borough  President 3 here, Marty Markowitz.4 I have reviewed their statements.5 I just want to associate myself 100 percent  with 6 what they will say later.	I think they' ll be some 7 other Council Members here with the Speaker.  I8 could not -- I have a scheduling conflict so   I9 tried to come a little early. But when she  speaks,10 I will be with her, along with the other  Council 11 Members, in spirt.12 The two points I just want  to 13 make, and really it' s an answer to Ms. Holder' s,14 Commissioner Holder' s question, what happens if 15 there' s an increase, people will be pushed out of 16 their apartments. It' s as simple as that.	Any --17 ( Applause.)18 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	And I say 19 this -- I represent right here where we  are,20 Downtown Brooklyn, south to Park Slope, north  to 21 Greenpoint Williamsburg, I say this because I  am 22 seeing it and I have seen  it.23 I think I have one of the  highest 24 concentrations of rent regulated tenants in  the 25 whole City in this district. But in the north  part,2 
2 Greenpoint/ Williamsburg, where I -- where there are 3 a lot of smaller buildings there, the buildings  are 4 not regulated and we' ve seen how rents increase in 5 an unregulated fashion.6 We have -- since I took office  six 7 years ago, we get calls week in and week out   from 8 people who cannot afford to stay in  their 9 neighborhood and are pushed out.10 And Commissioner Holder asked,11 where are they going?	They' re leaving the City.12 You can' t -- you go to a church service any  Sunday 13 in Brooklyn and you will -- when the  announcements 14 come, the person doing the announcements will  say,15 we want to say goodbye to Mr. And Mrs. Brown   and 16 Mr. And Mrs. Smith because they are leaving to  go 17 to North Carolina or Georgia.18 ( Applause.)19 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	They simply 20 cannot afford to stay in  the City.	And that is not 21 the kind of city we  want.22 And point one is, any  increase 23 will push people out of their apartments  period.24 The point two I want to make is  I25 do believe that this process is broken and needs  to 2 
2 be fixed. And I urge you to consider and   to 3 support --4 ( Applause.)5 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	-- the 6 Duane/ Latimer Reform Bill, that I believe would 7 reform the process and restore credibility to  the 8 rent regulation system in this City of New  York.9 And I won' t go through all the 10 points in that bill. I' m sure you' re familiar with 11 them.	It would be a act of courage for the  Board 12 to say, you know, we know that our process needs   to 13 be fixed. And I urge you do to that. I think   that 14 would be just a terrific step for the  City.15 Thank you very much, Mr. Chair,16 and Commissioners.17 ( Applause.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Adams.19 MS. ADAMS:	Have you read the 20 statement that our Chairman issued last  year?21 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	I will review 22 it.23 MS. ADAMS:	No.	I would urge  you 24 to because in it, he too, and we' ve said that  the 25 system is broken and needs to be  fixed.2 
2 In your area, and what  is 3 happening in other parts of the City as well and   is 4 of great public interest, as you well know, what  is 5 -- what is going on where the prices keep going   up 6 on things that we know about, fuel,  insurance,7 taxes and on and on and incomes are  remaining 8 pretty much the same --9 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	Well, here' s10 what' s happening.11 MS. ADAMS:	-- how can we balance 12 that or how is it being  balanced?13 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	It' s -- it' s14 being balanced -- I don' t -- that' s a great 15 question and I don' t want you to hear this  answer 16 as a -- as a kind of  political answer.	But it 17 really is being balanced, the costs are being  borne 18 by the tenants.	They are.	Those are the calls we 19 get in our office all the time for people  who 20 simply cannot afford to stay in their  apartments.21 And you know the numbers as well as I   do.22 MS. ADAMS:	Right. But we also 23 see here that the stock is going down, that  people 24 are --25 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	Well, I will 2 
2say that --3MS. ADAMS:	-- people are being 4harassed out of apartments.5COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	Right. Look,6we' re seeing --you' ve just heard from two --7( Audience participation.)8COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	You just heard 9 from two different landlords, one kind of  informal 10 and one who I gather is, you know, a   regular 11 participant with the City in our efforts to  create 12 affordable housing, that they are not -- they don' t13 want to increase their rents because they  know 14 their tenants can' t afford it.15 You know, we' re not seeing 16 abandonment, I will tell you that. In our --  the 17 district I represent we see property values,  maybe 18 they' ve now leveled off, but certainly they' ve been 19 increasing and increasing and increasing.	So we' re 20 not seeing abandonment.	We are seeing tenants who 21 can' t afford to stay where they are.22 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Can I ask a23 question?24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure. Go ahead,25 Mr. Languedoc.9 
2 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Mr. Yassky,3 assuming that there might be a rent increase  this 4 year, what do you think about the suggestion  that 5 has been made by some people that if people' s  rent 6 are low, already now low, that there should be  a7 minimum increase?	Like say if your, I don' t know,8 rent is below $ 500 , you can be raised by at least 9 $ 50 which would be, I guess ten percent.10 Do you think that would be a  good 11 idea?	What do you think about the  suggestion?12 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	You know, I13 haven' t looked at data.	But my anecdotal sense of 14 folks who I come across are people who are  living 15 in rent regulated apartments with low rents  are 16 people of very -- of  little means.	I do not think 17 they' d be in a position to afford that.18 I say that --19 ( Applause.)20 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	I say that 21 without having reviewed data, but that' s certainly 22 my sense of it.23 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead,25 Risa.2 
2 Speak into the mike.3 MS. LEVINE:	If we were able to 4 vote a zero increase this year, would the  City 5 Council come forward with relief for the  landlords 6 who are badly hurt by that, would there be  some 7 kind of property tax discount, fuel  adjustments,8 water and sewer rates?9 ( Applause.)10 MS. LEVINE:	What would the City 11 do for these, particularly the smaller  landlords12 who can' t afford to run their building with the 13 costs of the Led Paint Law, sidewalk  violations?14 What we' re hearing over and over 15 again is that these are not compensated by  MCI 16 increases and that they can' t afford to manage 17 those buildings.18 What would the City Council do  to 19 represent those people who are also part of  the 20 constituency?21 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	That' s right.22 That' s -- I think you' re absolutely right to point 23 that out. I mean when I say that the system   needs 24 reform, I don' t just mean the Board. I mean  the 25 whole --2 
2 MS. LEVINE:	We agree.3 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	I mean -- I4 mean -- we need to think seriously about all  of 5 those decisions ultimately do affect rents  because,6 of course, they do, water rates do, and  property 7 taxes too.8 And that' s why many of us in the 9 council have loudly called on continuing  the 10 property tax reduction that we implemented  last 11 year even in the face of these difficult  budget 12 times that we' re going to need to find the  spending 13 reductions rather than go back to property  taxes.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It doesn' t15 affect any -- it doesn' t affect any rent stabilized 16 though.	It does not. It only applies to  home 17 ownership.18 Let me -- I would -- Ms. Betty  --19 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	I' m sorry. But 20 I think the -- I mean the rebate is only   owners,21 but the overall rate reduction that we did  last 22 year is across the board.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right. But our 24 numbers actually show assessments have gone up.  So 25 when you look at the burden  --2 
2 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	Agreed.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	But let me 4 briefly sort of explain my statement and we' d  be 5 happy to send it to  you.6 I think --7 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	Thank you.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We don' t9 consider our job easy. I' m sure you don' t consider 10 our job easy either. We struggle just to get  nine 11 members on this Board, the Mayor' s Office does, let 12 me say that.13 And basically we see a model.	And 14 that' s what my statement -- that' s out there and 15 that' s the Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption.16 And the -- two models, Disabled Rent  Increases,17 which basically at their core said, from a  public 18 policy standpoint, the people who should be  making 19 this public policy, which is the State  Legislature,20 and the City Council have said if your income  --21 when rents go up -- which would, quite  frankly,22 make it easier for us to do our job, if you   will,23 if you look at it, which is to look at the   numbers 24 on the easier merits, let' s call it, knowing that,25 that there will be protections for those whose  rent 2 
2 to income ratios go above a certain amount  and 3 whose income is below a certain  amount.4 Now, from our perspective we' d5 love that income to be as high possible and  the 6 rent to income ratio to be as low as   possible.7 So that' s basically what we' re 8 saying. Fundamentally that is, in my opinion, and  I9 believe in the opinion of at least the  public 10 members and probably in the opinion of all  the 11 members, that that is the fundamental reform  that 12 is necessary in this system.13 Because it is a anecdotal sort  of 14 serendipitous system as to who gets subsidized.  And 15 it' s an income transfer, which it clearly does. And 16 there is no income transfer program in the  United 17 States, of any kind that is set by  government,18 other than this kind. And we' re not the only  rent 19 regulated environment, that does not have  any 20 income test.21 So I would say that is where we  --22 our head is at.	So our job could be much  easier.23 Our sideshow, as the Speaker  is 24 about to call it based on the press reports,  would 25 be, you know, would be much more less circus- like,2 

2	let me say that.3
So we hope that you think  about 
4 this. I' m not asking for an answer but I hope  you 5 think about it.6 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	Mr. Chairman,7 no, I respect that.	And I don' t, really for a8 moment, underestimate the difficulty of  the 9 assignment that you' ve taken on.10 There' s -- maybe I shouldn' t say 11 so, but there' s, in the audience, a member of  the 12 CCRB, which seems to be also be in very  difficult 13 assignment. Believe me, these are -- I  understand.14 But here' s what I say:	I hear 15 your vision and what we have in place in the   rent 16 regulation system is crude to be sure, but it' s17 what we have.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That' s19 correct.20 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	And it' s what 21 we have.	And it has -- it has succeeded  in 22 enabling a middle class to stay and a working   class 23 to stay in New York City in real numbers. And   my 24 district has got to be as good an illustration  as 25 any.	We would not have middle income folks in   my 4 
2 district were it not for rent  regulation.3 So I -- you know, I buy that  we 4 need to kind of -- I buy that we could do a    lot 5 better.	But I also -- but I also want to stand   by 6 firmly saying that don' t -- you know, don' t abandon 7 what we got and kind of steady,  significant 8 increases is a gradual betterment of what we  got 9 until we got something better. That' s my only point 10 I would make back.11 I look forward to reading  your 12 statement, Mr. Chairman.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Yassky --15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.16 MS. CRUZ:	-- I hear what you' re 17 saying.	But when the City Council passed that  or 18 proposed that bill -- I think Council Member  Duane 19 is the proponent of the  bill.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	He' s a State 21 Senator.22 MS. CRUZ:	State Senator, sorry.23 In that proposed bill, there  is 24 just line after line of more regulation to fall  on 25 the shoulders of property owners.	And yet what our 2 
2 Chairman is talking to you about are the  two 3 programs, SCRIE and DRIE, that does take  into 4 account this protection for people that need  it 5 that the government should assist while at the  same 6 time enabling the property owner to cover  its7 expenses.8 But that is not in the  proposed9 legislation.	None of that thinking, none of   that 10 rationale is reflected in the proposed  solutions11 that the City Council or the Assembly is  looking 12 at.13 Can you explain that --14 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	Well, sure.15 Look,--16 ( Applause.)17 MS. CRUZ:	Because you have 18 proposed -- you are supporting legislation that  you 19 think is a solution and it is only  further 20 burdening the property owners.21 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	Well, Mr.22 Chair, I don' t want to take -- feel free to cut  me 23 off.	I don' t want to take your time  here.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' re allowed 25 to answer questions.2 
2 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	But I would 3 say -- there' s a lot of good in this bill, in  that 4 bill.	There is a change in the composition of  the 5 Board to make it a true reflection of the   various 6 stakeholders.	I think that' s very important.7 There is the provision about 8 landlords with serious violations not  qualifying 9 for increases, I think is  important.10 I see --11 ( Applause.)12 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	And --13 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Yassky, there are 14 -- there are -- forgive me, but there are so   many 15 legal remedies for people that have violations  in 16 their buildings that another penalty --17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let' s not --18 let' s not -- I don' t think it' s for us to debate 19 the law. Because --20 MS. CRUZ:	But I would like to  get 21 the answer as to why  --22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The other 23 question. That' s fine.24 Go ahead.25 MS. CRUZ:	-- why it doesn' t2 
2 have that kind of thinking.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.4 Councilman Yassky, go ahead.5 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	I think that 6 it does have -- it would make  important 7 improvements. Full solution, perhaps not.	But I8 think it would make important improvements.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, we 10 appreciate it.11 Any other questions?12 Yes, Risa.13 MS. LEVINE:	You talked about 14 the importance of the rent guidelines  for 15 preserving affordability for middle income class 16 people in the City, which I fully agree  with,17 except that we have also heard testimony about  the 18 numbers of rent stabilized units that we' re losing.19 And I would like to look at  some 20 of the causes as to why we' re losing these,  you 21 know, enormous amounts of units to  vacancy 22 decontrol over which we have authority, to co- op 23 and condo conversions to which we absolutely  have 24 no authority.25 And my understanding is that  the 2 
2 impact on affordability is not part of the AG' s3 review of a condo and co- op plan.	So many of the 4 causes as to why we' re losing units is not part  of 5 our purview.6 And I am deeply concerned that  a7 zero increase would incentivize owners to  do 8 everything possible to decontrol as many units  as 9 possible.10 So what -- what do you come  up 11 with, you know, as a City Council Member  in 12 addressing the problem of losing units, you  know,13 weighing against a zero increase?14 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	I recognize 15 the dynamic that you are talking about there  that,16 you know, I see your point about increasing  the 17 pressure towards conversion.	I think that we' re 18 going to see less of that in the  year ahead.	But 19 that' s not a long- term answer.20 MS. LEVINE:	Not as long as the 21 dollar is so lousy against the Euro. I mean  --22 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	Well, we' ve 23 already started. I think we' re already starting to 24 see that.	That' s not a long- term answer to that.25 And, you know, you have at your disposal a lot   more 2 
2 sophisticated kind of resources to answer the  real 3 economics of that than I  do.4 My gut is that the -- on  balance,5 the relief for the many would be more valuable  than 6 the marginal increase and the incentive to  convert.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We appreciate 8 it.	We look forward to a continued debate. And   I9 hope what we suggested last year is part of   that 10 debate.11 Thank you very much.12 COUNCILMAN YASSKY:	Thank you,13 again, Mr. Chair and the Board.14 ( Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Nick Pinto is 16 next;17 Robert Foster;18 Albert Corion;19 Jimmy McMillan, McMillian, I think 20 it is;21 Anthony Conti; and 22 Marilyn Charles.23 Nick Pinto.24 MR. NICK PINTO:	Good evening,25 everybody. Good evening, everybody.2 
2 Thank you for allowing me  this 3 opportunity to express my concerns.4 My name is Nick Pinto.5 In -- since January of 2007 , last 6 year, I purchased and managed my first six- family 7 rent stabilized building.	I did my homework. I8 thought it was a good  idea.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is the 10 emphasis on the word " thought"?11 MR. NICK PINTO:	Excuse me?12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is the 13 emphasis on the word " thought"? You thought it  was 14 a good idea.15 MR. NICK PINTO:	No. I -- and it 16 still is.	All right?17 I have a nice building.	It' s in 18 Bay Bridge, Brooklyn.	Nice building, clean and 19 nice neighborhood.	Nice tenants. No problems with 20 that.21 I' m here today to represent the 22 small property owners that too often go  unnoticed 23 and unappreciated.	I thought that providing some 24 hard details, instead of just percentages, might  be 25 best for everybody to understand.2 
2 I think everyone is aware  that 3 expenses cannot be easily controlled.	Yeah, we can 4 install more efficient oil burners. We can  insulate 5 all the pipes to retain the heat. We can  install 6 water strainers to reduce the water. But all  these 7 improvements are a one- shot deal.8 For the past year, fuel costs  have 9 gone out of control, as you all know, and  there 10 seems to be no end  point.11 Seeing the escalating cost of 12 heating oil, I elected to go to the budget   plan 13 with my oil company. He knows his oil  business 14 well. He also knows and he can estimate  my 15 consumption.16 ( Mr. Schleider entered the Great 17 Hall.)18 MR. NICK PINTO:	On a six- family 19 house, fully attached, I would say it' s about 3 , 000 20 gallons a year.	And my usage, he' s averaged my 21 monthly billing cost at $ 5 . 22 a gallon for a22 budget. That means he' s anticipated a higher cost 23 in fuel.24 Just to give some details.25 In July of last year I was  paying 2 
2 $ 2 . 59 gallon.	In June of this year I paid $ 4 . 399 a3 gallon.	The price differential increases the 4 yearly cost of the fuel by $ 5 , 400 .	That' s on a5 six- family apartment.6 On my six- family building this 7 $ 5 , 400 equates to an extra $ 900 per apartment per 8 year or $ 75 per apartment per month. That' s not 9 percentages, fellas, that' s the real thing.10 I' m using my money to pay for 11 that.	My children also have to go  to school.	I' m12 paying for that.	And I honestly feel for all  the 13 tenants here because they too need to pay for  that 14 at some point, whether now or  tomorrow.15 If this price escalates, it' s all 16 a problem.17 Anyway, if you add to that $ 75 an 18 apartment, that' s just on fuel, you add $ 6 for the 19 surcharge on water and sewer.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Try to wrap 21 up, please.22 MR. NICK PINTO:	Okay.23 Altogether my -- with no 24 maintenance, no nothing on the building except  for 25 the expenses, you get $ 85 per apartment per month.2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So what' s your 3 recommendation, $ 85 --4 MR. NICK PINTO:	My recommendation 5 is that you obviously increase the rent at  some 6 point, but not to the point where the tenants  are 7 really feeling the hurt.	They are hurting. So are 8 the landlords.9 This is a social problem  that 10 needs to be corrected not on the shoulders of  the 11 owners.12 If the tenants need assistance,  it 13 is the responsibility of the City of New York  to 14 provide that assistance, not anyone  else.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 MR.

I live  in 10 the Clinton Hill section in Brooklyn. I live in   a11 rent stabilized building.12 I' ve been hearing a lot of things.13 I want to change what I want to  say.14 But the first thing I want to  say,15 I think everyone agrees in the room that the  Rent 16 Guidelines Board, the changes -- the reform has  to 17 be made. And No. 2 , rent increase should be  nil 18 this year, nothing.	That will start --19 ( Applause.)20 MR. ROBERT FOSTER:	-- we' ll have 21 to start somewhere.	This will start a  controversy,22 of course, with the landlords and with the  tenants 23 it will be favorable.	But what' s happening is the 24 old dollar sign. All the money is  killing 25 everything in this world, especially the City  of 10 

2	New York.3
In my building we have 113  units.
4 My building is bought by Dormitory  Management 5 company investor.	They have bought seven of  the 6 buildings.7 My building alone, there' s 133 8 units.	Forty- five units have been taken over by 9 management.	Out of forty- five units, 35 are paying 10 market rent or better.11 For example, I had a friend  live 12 in the building and is paying two bedrooms. Been  in 13 the apartment for 25 years and is paying $ 800 .14 That apartment has been renovated by the  landlord 15 completely.	At what cost, I don' t know what it  is.16 But that apartment is now being rented for $ 4 , 000 ,17 $ 4 , 000 .	How can that happen?	Twenty percent 18 vacancy law, whatever, I don' t know.19 But you' ve got people moving into 20 these apartments that don' t know the laws of New 21 York.	And we' re a tenant organization and we' re 22 trying to encourage them to do something about  it.23 But this problem exists.24 We have sixty tenants in  the 25 tenant association and some of the new tenants  are 4 
2 with us. But this is a problem. It' s a  major 3 problem. And we' re doing everything we can do to 4 organize not only in our building but in  other 5 areas in the neighborhood.6 But going from $ 800 to $ 4 , 000 is 7 unbelievable. It' s really unbelievable. Outrageous.8 ( Audience participation.)9 MR. ROBERT FOSTER:	Okay.	Now,10 the money thing, as far as we got big  entities 11 buying these buildings in the City. I feel for  the 12 small landlord.13 We had a few small  landlords14 testify tonight. What about these large  landlords,15 all these investors coming in and buying up  the 16 rent stabilized buildings?17 Landlords should open up their 18 books. Everybody should open their books. The  small 19 landlord will benefit from this. The more --  the 20 bigger landlords get all the benefits of  these 21 increases.	At one time there was three years  for 22 rent renewal. Not it' s two years.23 The MCIs have been tacking  onto 24 these -- to the cost.25 ( Audience participation.)2 
2 MR. ROBERT FOSTER:	I' m paying 3 thirty percent of my income for my apartment.  We 4 just can' t afford it anymore. And too many 5 apartments are being lost. Our building is  a6 family- oriented building.	At one time people moved 7 from a one bedroom to a  two bedroom.	But all that 8 is done anymore.9 You can' t have a large family.10 You can' t go from a one bedroom to a two  bedroom.11 You definitely can' t afford to live in these 12 apartments.	So, you know, the neighborhood  is 13 changing and that' s all I have to say.14 I think it' s a damn shame.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 ( Applause.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Albert Corion.18 MR.

Go ahead.MR. ROBERT FOSTER:	Yes, sir.MR. LANGUEDOC:	So you said that

LANGUEDOC:	Do you have any 11 idea what rent these rent stabilized tenants  are 12 charged?13 MR. ROBERT FOSTER:	Well, we have 14 one rent control tenant in the building that' s, I15 think, paying about $ 400 .	Most of the tenants --16 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Rent stabilized.17 MR. ROBERT FOSTER:	Rent 18 stabilized?	Anywhere from $ 500 to $ 900 a month.19 No, I' m sorry. From $ 500 to $ 1200 a month.	Of 20 course, there' s MCI' s and you' ll have the increase 21 over the last few years.22 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay.

2 MR. ROBERT FOSTER:	Yes, sir.3 MR. LANGUEDOC:	What would be 4 the impact on the lower rent paying tenants if  this 5 Board put through a minimum, say a minimum $ 50  or 6 $ 100 increase in rent?7 MR. ROBERT FOSTER:	You have to 8 take into consideration that most of these  people 9 that have been in the building long term are  on 10 fixed incomes.11 You mentioned the landlord fuel 12 cost and various things also.	So, you know, the 13 tenants are feeling high food costs and  various 14 things also.	So you -- it' s a two- way street.15 But I still say -- I still say,  I16 feel strongly about this, the big- time landlords,17 the investors, there the ones who are  profiting 18from this and should carry most of the  burden.19MR.

ALBERT CORION:	Good 20 afternoon.21 My name is Albert Corion and I  am 22 the owner of two small building in  Flatbush.23 I manage my own property. And  I24 must say that I do have a very good   relationship 25 with my tenants.	And whenever I had to increase  my 2 
2 rent, you know, it hurt my heart because I   know 3 some of the tenants cannot afford  it.4 But at the same time seeing  that 5 the operating expense of the building  has 6 skyrocketed, especially in the past year or two,  I7 have no choice but to pass on some of the   increase.8 I usually have to sometimes  sit 9 down and counsel my tenants and point out to  them 10 the increase in the fuel and as to the increase   in 11 if they should have a motor vehicle and they go   to 12 the gas station, what it is  like.13 And it definitely is not easy  to 14 really increase a tenant rent that, you know,  they 15 are on a fixed income.	I can, you know, sympathize 16 with the tenant.	But they will have to know  that 17 in as everything else, the groceries and what  have 18 you, has been -- has been a hardship on   everyone.19 And so as a small landlord I have to mortgage   my 20 building in order to reach my  overhead.21 I needed a roof on  my building.	I22 hadn' t the money. I had to mortgage the  building.23 Now I have to pay the mortgage, plus I have   absorb 24 that increase in the fuel, the water, and what  have 25 you.2 
2 So I would like to know what  could 3 be done.	And if -- I know that it has been said   by 4 the Councilman that we should have zero  increase.5 But if my costs has gone up 300 percent in the   past 6 two years and I cannot get an increase on my   rent,7 what should I do with the  building?8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What increase 9 would you suggest as a fair increase from  your 10 perspective?11 MR. ALBERT CORION:	As a fair 12 increase I should say that on a two- year lease  it 13 should be no less than twelve  percent.14 ( Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 Any other questions?17 ( No response.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 MS.

2 tenants would be able to afford that in  your 3 building?4 MR. ALBERT CORION:	Well, as I5 have said in the beginning, I definitely  sympathize 6 with my tenants and their hardship.	But as a7 businessman I have to look out how would I pay   the 8 taxes on the building, how would I pay the  fuel 9 from the building. That is the question I  would 10 have to ask.11 ( Applause.)12 MR. ALBERT CORION:	Why don' t you 13 ask that? They always talk about the tenant  but 14 what I' m actually going to point out to my  tenant,15 once they get rid of the small landlord  in 16 Brooklyn, so goes the average tenant in  Brooklyn.17 It' s happening in Manhattan. It' s going to happen 18 in Brooklyn.19 So the tenant might feel  that,20 hey, you' re trying to make plenty of money, but if 21 I can' t keep my building, I have to have  someone 22 that want to buy it.	It' s either they' re going to 23 bulldoze the property or get some other  building 24 there and then the tenants in that building  will 25 have to find somewhere else to  go.2 
 2 So we want to be fair to  the 3 tenant but also fair to the  landlord.4 MS. HOLDER:	But I guess I' m5 just asking you in terms of where your building  is 6 and the tenants that you have, do you think  your 7 tenants can absorb that increase, your  tenants?8 MR. ALBERT CORION:	I will be able 9 to do it for their sake and for my sake   because 10 definitely with the oil increase, I cannot  survive 11 the winter or else we' ll have a very cold  building.12 One or the other.	We cannot have it both  ways.13 MS. CRUZ:	What is the average 14 rent in your building, sir?15 MR. ALBERT CORION:	The average 16 rent in a one bedroom in my building it' s about 17	$ 700 , $ 650 to $ 700 .18 MS. CRUZ:	Was is your name 19 again, I' m sorry, I didn' t get it.20 MR.

ANTHONY CONTI:	Okay.	Good 12 afternoon.	How are you?13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good.14 MR. ANTHONY CONTI:	Okay.	I' m a15 -- I' m a smalltime landlord.	I just purchased some 16 properties.17 I own two six- family buildings in 18 Ridgewood. I don' t see the kind of problems I  hear 19 here. I see other problems, other problems such  as 20 the injustice that goes on in the court  system 21 against landlords.22 ( Audience participation.)23 MR. ANTHONY CONTI:	I see totally 24 unfair, frivolous claims made by  tenants25 constantly.	I see people who prevent access  to 5 
2 apartments and don' t allow them to get fixed.3 ( Audience Participation.)4 MR. ANTHONY CONTI:	I mean I5 think probably I' m in the middle class choke- hold.6 I' m somewhere in between.	I think -- you know,  of 7 the remedies to these problems that I hear,  and 8 I' ve never been here before so I never heard  these 9 problems, is low- income housing.10 I mean -- people always talk  about 11 low income housing. I don' t see it being built.  I12 mean I see all kinds of buildings being built  all 13 over the place but not for people that could  pay 14 low rent or, you know, can only pay low rent.   I15 don' t see it.16 I mean if you just  allowed 17 builders to build buildings for people that  could 18 afford it, that would remedy that problem but it' s19 not happening.20 And you talk about land.	Well,21 there' s land everywhere. You go to East New York,22 you go to Bushwick, you go to the Bronx.  There' s23 plenty of land that people could build low  income 24 housing. But it' s just not being done.25 Getting back to some of  the 2 

2	problems.3
I just purchased a couple  of 
4 buildings. I own two six- family buildings. I owned 5 them fourteen years now. I mean it' s an  endless 6 battle just fixing them, maintaining them,  keeping 7 up.8 And, you know, once you start 9 adding all the costs, Sanitation summonses,  putting 10 on new roof, new electric, new heating,  new 11 plumbing, I mean ten years later I' m still  paying.12 And, you know, I' ve come to a conclusion with  my 13 tenants. I tell them what it cost. I find that   most 14 tenants have no idea what it really  costs.15 So I just tell them. I say,  look,16 you know what it costs to do two sheet  rock 17 ceilings?	And then they say, oh, really?	It cost 18 that much?	I said, yes, that' s how much it cost.19 They don' t have the faintest idea what things cost.20 And then when they realize it, then they' re willing 21 to pay the increase in rent. They don' t fight  it.22 They don' t argue about it, you know, but there' s23 just too much injustice to the landlord in  this 24 system.25 ( Audience Participation.)4 
2 MR. ANTHONY CONTI:	Going to court 3 against landlords, it' s totally unjust. You know,4 having been in court, having been in court  against 5 several tenants that are so- called professional 6 tenants, I call them, people who just go from  place 7 to place.	I think that there' s no representation 8 for the small property owner.9 Like that man, Mr. Corion, I don' t10 know where he is, right. This -- I mean  he 11 witnesses what goes on.	He realizes it. I  think 12 most people don' t realize what goes on.13 I guess you have, you know,  the 14 bigtime landlords on one side and, of course,  they 15 could afford to pay.	But us in the middle, we' re 16 stuck in a struggle and it just never ends. It   just 17 -- that' s it.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 MR. ANTHONY CONTI:	Okay.	Thanks.20 ( Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Marilyn 22 Charles.23 ( Applause.)24 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	Good 25 evening, Members of the Board.2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hi.3 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	My name is 4 Marilyn Charles.	I' m from District Council # 37 ,5 Political Action Department.	And I' m here to 6 testify on behalf of our Executive Director,  Lilian 7 Roberts.8 We' re here to speak about our 9 members.10 We represent 125 , 000 members and 11 50 , 000 retirees. Our members serve in over 1 , 000 12 titles in Mayoral and nonmayoral  agencies.13 They are:	Blue collar;14 White collar;15 Professionals;16 School;17 Hospital; and clerical workers.18 They are:19 Patient care associates;20 Janitors;21 Highway repairers;22 911 operators;23 Park workers - lifeguards;24 School lunch aides;25 Crossing guards;2 

23	schools; 4567891011
Clerical workers in hospitals,The Police Department; College assistant;Housing Authority employees; Librarians;Social workers; Architects; Engineers;Food Stamps and Medicaid 
12 Eligibility Specialists;13 Security Guards;14 Gardeners and many more who  work 15 everyday to give the City, the citizens of New  York 16 the highest quality of service.17 As a condition of  employment,18 eighty percent of our members live in New  York 19 City.	Over fifty percent - and that is 15 , 000 DC 20 # 37 members - are living in public housing.  And 21 4 , 500 members of DC # 37 work for the New York City 22 Housing Authority, of those living in  subsidized 23 public housing or rent control or  stabilized 24 apartments.25 On average, our workers make 12 
2 $ 31 , 000 a year. And I tell you we did not get a3 good contract and we still fighting for a  contract 4 as of now.5 The average years of service  for 6 most of our members is thirty years. Many of   these 7 members will retire with a pension of less  than 8 $ 12 , 000 a year. The average pension for our members 9	is $ 11 , 000 to $ 17 , 000 a year.10 Trying to make ends meet for  our 11 members is a daily struggle. Going to  work 12 everyday, many times working overtime, some  by 13 choice, others mandated to do so, does not  provide 14 a cushion but serves as a disincentive  because 15 these additional funds are taxed and spent  before 16 they are received.17 For some time and particularly,18 over the last seven years, we have seen  a19 disturbing trend. Many members are seeking  the 20 union' s assistance at legal proceedings to avoid 21 evictions; who have reached the age of sixty and  is 22 seeking or has a fellow colleague as a   roommate 23 because singularly they cannot afford to pay  rent 24 that is simply too high.25 So instead of preparing for  the 10 
2 twilight of life and retirement, they are  looking 3 at continuing work for the foreseeable future  with 4 retirement not being an option for  many.5 Moving on.6 The huge rent hikes of the  last 7 four years have created financial hardship for  a8 lot of rent stabilized tenants.9 In 2003 to 2004 and the  last 10 couple of years, the Rent Guidelines  Board 11 abandoned the traditional two percent spread 12 between one- year and two- year lease renewal 13 guidelines in favor for a three plus percent  point 14 spread.15 In 2004 to 2007 , the majority of 16 Rent Guidelines Board adopted a rent freeze for  the 17 rent stabilized tenants in Single Room  occupancy,18 occupancy SROs building and hotel.19 On behalf of our 125 , 000 active 20 members and our 50 , 000 retirees, we urge you to 21 support a life with dignity for all New  Yorkers,22 most especially for those most vulnerable and  in 23 urgent need.24 DC # 37 ' s three priorities are:25 1 ), no rent increase.2

LANGUEDOC:	Hi.14 Do you have -- is it fair to  say 15 that a large number of City workers live in   rent 16 stabilized housing and do not have Section 8  or 17 SCRIE or DRIE?18 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	Right.19 MR. LANGUEDOC:	That would be 20 fair to say?21 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	Uh- huh.22 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay.23 MS. ADAMS:	Can you give us a24 number?25 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	The number 2 

2	of?34
MS. ADAMS: Yes. How many.MR. LANGUEDOC:	Do you have any 
5 idea how many people that represents in  the 6 tenants?7 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	It represent 8 that --9 MR. LANGUEDOC:	How many -- how 10 many -- I mean obviously what we' re most concerned 11 about are City workers who live in rent  stabilized 12 apartments and do not have Section 8 and do   not 13 have SCRIE or DRIE and therefore they will feel  the 14 full brunt of any rent increase that is, you  know,15 granted by this Board.16 And I' m assuming that that' s a17 pretty substantial number of City workers that  I18 just want to, am I correct in assuming that;  is 19 that right?20 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	Yes.21 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay.22 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	Yes.23 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Do you have any 24 idea how many people that might  be?25 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	That would 5 
2 be the majority of our 125 , 000 members that do not 3 have Section 8 , okay, and do not have  SCRIE.4 MR. LANGUEDOC:	So a lot of  your 5 members do not have Section 8 or SCRIE  --6 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	Yes, we do 7 not have Section 8 .8 MR. LANGUEDOC:	-- and do live 9 in public housing.10 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	Right.	Live 11 in public housing, right.12 MR. LANGUEDOC:	A lot of them 13 live in rent stabilized housing.14 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	Yes.15 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And are there 16 residency requirements?17 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	Yes. We do 18 have a residency requirement.	And right now we are 19 trying to get Intro 452 to pass through  City 20 Council and we are having to fight, a hard  time.21 MR. LANGUEDOC:	What is that?22 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	Intro 452 is 23 to allow our members to live like in  Westchester 24 and Nassau County or Suffolk County.25 Right now you must live in  New 2 
2 York City in order to work for the City of   New 3 York.4 MS. HOLDER:	So why would you be 5 asking for that Intro 452 ?6 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	We' re asking 7 for that because it is -- the Police  Department 8 they can live out there and also the  teachers.9 MS. HOLDER:	Yes. But is there 10 some other rationale behind that?11 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	Yes. There' s12 a lot of rationale behind  it.13 We' re thinking of giving them a14 broader field in which they can choose where  to 15 live since the housing in New York City  has 16 skyrocketed and most of them cannot afford  it.17 We cannot afford another rent 18 increase because when we fight for a  contract,19 you' re getting like a one percent, two percent. By 20 the time you get your taxes taken out, you' re  back 21 down to where you started so it doesn' t make  sense.22 And the rent today, as you  know,23 it' s all like $ 1 , 200 . We can barely even pay that 24 by the time you do fuel and cost of   food.25 Everything has gone up, skyrocketed.2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair?3 MS. ADAMS:	Do you -- do you  agree 4 that if housing were affordable, that it  is 5 preferable to have City workers living in the  city 6 in which they work?7 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	Yes. If it 8 is affordable.	And that' s what we' re also fighting 9 for for affordable housing.	And it is very 10 difficult to get affordable housing.11 We started to do a program  with 12 the Mayor but it didn' t come through the way  we 13 wanted it to come through so that more of  our 14 members would be able to afford those  apartments 15 and stay in New York  City.16 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.17 MS. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Mr.19 Schleider.20 MS. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for 21 showing up.22 A quick question:	What contract 23 wage increase would be reasonable in your mind  so 24 that you could afford, so that your members  could 25 afford to live in New York  City?2 
2 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	I will say 3 if we can get a contract anywhere between  six 4 percent to ten percent.5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	Thank 6 you.7 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	But that 8 also will be eaten up  with taxes.	By the time they 9 get their paycheck that is gone  also.10 MS. SCHLEIDER:	So would you 11 like to restate what that increase should  be?12 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	If I were to 13 say that increase and would the Mayor give it  to 14 us, I' d be more than happen to say twelve  to 15 eighteen percent, but not the rent to be  increased 16 to that percentage.17 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Can I just ask 18 you --19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	There you go.20 You played that game well.21 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	Thank you.22 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Ms. Charles, can 23 I just ask you --24 MS. LEVINE:	I had a question 25 also.2 

23	another question.4
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Charles,MR. LANGUEDOC:	I think you have 
5 some kind of social services component to  District 6 Council # 37 .	And I' m wondering, do people -- do 7 your union members ever come to you because they' ve 8 been evicted or because they' re homeless?9 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	Yes, we do,10 yes.11 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Do you have any 12 idea, is that a substantial number of people or  how 13 many --14 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	As of last 15 year I know we had about a hundred of our   members 16 were living in the shelters.17 MR. LANGUEDOC:	How many?18 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	About a19 hundred of our members living in shelters,  yeah.20 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Who are living 21 in shelters?22 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	Uh- hmm.23 MS. HOLDER:	A hundred members 24 and their families?25 MS. MARILYN CHARLES: Yes.5 

23	City workers?4
MR. LANGUEDOC:	And they are MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	City 
5 workers, yes. And that' s a shame.6 ( Applause.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One more 8 question.9 MS. LEVINE:	Ms. Charles.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Charles,11 Ms. Charles, one more question.12 MS. LEVINE:	Hi.13 As somebody who lives in the  City 14 and who benefits from the services that you  and 15 your members perform, I want to thank  you.16 You mentioned and then 17 Mr. Schleider asked you about your contract,  that 18 it was insufficient to pay for all of your  costs,19 food, and all your other expenses.20 Were you to get a bigger  increase,21 all New York City residents -- the burden would  be 22 borne by all New York City residents who are  the 23 people who benefit most from your  services.24 Do you think that would be  fairer 25 that you got a salary increase that was paid by   all 5 
2 New Yorkers rather than a, you know, a  rent 3 stabilization guideline that were borne mostly  by 4 one group of people, landlords in New York  City 5 since all of us in New York City do benefit   from 6 your services?7 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	I would 8 disagree with that.	Because when you look at  it,9 when we get an increase in our -- in our   contract,10 before that money can come to us the  government 11 takes out half of it.	And by the time you do  the 12 net -- we don' t work with gross. We work with  net.13 We pay the rent with net. We pay the groceries   with 14 net. You buy your clothing with net. You feed  your 15 kids with net.	You send your children to  childcare 16 with net.17 So therefore, whatever increase,18 you have to think about the amount of taxes  that 19 will be coming out.	And even though that you  pay 20 that tax up front, you think about New York City   as 21 a whole.	Look at how many taxes we pay upon  taxes.22 We don' t just tax -- tax your salary or  your 23 paycheck. But on top of it there' s other taxes.  So 24 food taxes, certain clothing has tax. So we  getting 25 tax upon tax and what happens, you get  nowhere.2 
2 As for the cellphones, don' t talk 3 about the cellphones. Don' t talk about Verizon.4 They have a surcharge. They have a federal tax   -5 help me, please - City surcharge. And all kinds  of 6 surcharge. Come on.7 ( Applause.)8 MS. LEVINE:	So it' s taxes that' s9 the problem.10 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	Taxes upon 11 taxes.	And the more taxes we have, you know,  that 12 is part of the revenue but at the same  time,13 please, can we do something about those  taxes?14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 Thank you.16 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	Okay.17 MS. CRUZ:	One more question.18 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	Oh, boy.19 MS. CRUZ:	You mentioned that 20 there' s a bill to enable your members to  seek 21 housing in the outer counties, in Westchester  and 22 Nassau.23 Do you view that the housing  in 24 those outer counties are more affordable?25 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	It' s just to 2 
2 give them a certain amount of leverage so that   they 3 can check other places to see if it is  affordable 4 for them and how can they live out there. It' s  just 5 to let them see, you know, broader sense than  just 6 being just confined to New York  City.7 It may not be cheaper out  there.8 But it' s just to give them that leeway to  bring 9 them there so that they can go  out.10 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.11 MS. MARILYN CHARLES:	You' re 12 welcome.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 Thank you.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Speaker Quinn.17 Speaker Quinn, we rearranged the 18 order a little bit.19 Speaker Quinn;20 Borough President Markowitz; and 21 Then Council Member James.22 SPEAKER QUINN:	Thank you,23 Chairman.24 Good evening.25 My name is Christine Quinn. And  I2 
2 would like to thank the Rent Guidelines Board  for 3 giving me this opportunity to testify  tonight.4 ( Applause.)5 SPEAKER QUINN:	And I' m here 6 tonight to express my opposition to the  proposed7 rent increases.8 But I' m not here tonight as 9 Speaker of the New York City Council or as a   former 10 tenant organizer. I' m here as one of the millions 11 of tenants in New York City, millions of  rent 12 protected tenants who have witnessed the  widespread 13 displacement of longtime neighbors and  residents 14 because they were literally priced out of  their 15 homes and their neighborhoods.16 ( Audience participation.)17 SPEAKER QUINN:	I' m here -- I' m18 here because the City that give me a home,  that 19 gave me the opportunity to pursue my dreams,  is 20 disappearing before my very eyes.21 In many neighborhoods across our 22 City, rent stabilized apartments are the  last 23 enclave of lower and middle income New  Yorkers.24 But rather than considering themselves  fortunate,25 most residents I speak to live  in fear.	Live in 2 
2 fear of being priced out of their homes. Live  in 3 fear of being forced out of their homes either as   a4 result, with all due respect, of the  predictable 5 ritual before the Rent Guidelines Board or  through 6 potential harassment from those non- law abiding 7 landlords in our City.8 The sad fact is I don' t come here 9 tonight to rail against the proposed  rent 10 increases.	We all know that some kind of   rent 11 increase is sadly a forgone conclusion tonight.  And 12 I suspect that the turnout at the last meeting  at 13 the Great Hall at Cooper Union, if that' s  any 14 indication, the people in rent  stabilized 15 apartments have lost faith in this process and  in 16 this process actually weighing its impact on  them.17 The Rent Guidelines Board has 18 become a sideshow, a predictable display that  holds 19 no true regard either for the residents or  their 20 circumstances.21 ( Audience participation.)22 SPEAKER QUINN:	All of you put in 23 too much time for that  to continue.	This must 24 change.25 ( Audience Participation.)2 
2 SPEAKER QUINN:	We need to change 3 the Rent Guidelines Board from the ground  up.4 That' s why myself, Council Member " Tish" James and 5 others, who are here tonight, are urging  the 6 passage of State Senator Tom Duane and  Assembly 7 Member George Latimer' s Rent Guideline Board Reform 8 Bill.9 ( Audience participation.)10 SPEAKER QUINN:	The bill mandates 11 a number of changes to the Rent Guidelines  Board,12 changes that would make the process fairer  for 13 every tenant in rent stabilized  units.14 It would automatically deny rent 15 increases for a year for any unit with  serious 16 violations.17 It will would restructure the 18 membership of the Board and make sure that  with 19 Mayoral appointments, they had to be approved  by 20 the New York City Council.21 ( Audience participation.)22 SPEAKER QUINN:	Perhaps most 23 importantly, the bill would require, it  would 24 require the use of both income and  expense 25 information when determining whether a  rent 2 
2 increase is warranted.3 ( Applause.)4 SPEAKER QUINN:	The Rent 5 Guidelines Board, as you all know, releases  both 6 the Price Index of Operating Cost and the  Income 7 and Expense Study.	But inexplicably the Board only 8 relies on the Price Index when  determining 9 guidelines.10 When you consider that in  recent 11 data, landlords had net operating income  increases12 of 8 . 8 percent, the rent increases are not only 13 unjustified, they' re basically a financial assault 14 on New York' s renters.15 Affordable housing, as you all 16 well know, is the challenge of  our time.	The 17 cornerstone of keeping the middle class in New  York 18 City a place where people can raise their family  is 19 having affordable housing.20 The Rent Guidelines Board needs to 21 reflect the real world of the New York City' s22 housing crunch, otherwise --23 ( Audience participation.)24 SPEAKER QUINN:	Otherwise the day 25 will come when New York City is really a city   only 2 
2 of the rich.	A city where young people can' t come 3 here to pursue their dreams and a place  where 4 people cannot raise their families.5 I' m urging all of us in this room 6 to change that, to change the Rent  Guidelines 7 Board, as a part of our effort to preserve New   York 8 City for working families in all five  boroughs.9 Thank you for your time.10 ( Audience participation.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Betty, Betty.12 MS. ADAMS:	In your testimony 13 you mentioned that landlords have received and  have 14 gotten an increase of eight  percent.15 Can you give me what the source  of 16 that is?17 SPEAKER QUINN:	What I actually 18 said was that the -- when you look at the   net 19 operating income increase, that that has been 8 . 820 percent, according to the most recent data that' s21 available through the New York City' s Department of 22 Finance.23 MS. ADAMS:	Department of 24 Finance?25 SPEAKER QUINN:	Yes, ma' am.2 
2 MS. ADAMS:	Okay.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.4 MS. ADAMS:	The other thing, with 5 regard to your testimony on the reflection of  the 6 real world, I think, and I' m sure you' re familiar 7 with, the Chairman' s statement of last year.8 And a lot of people have  testified 9 before you and I think we' ve all agreed that  the 10 system is broken and needs to be fixed in a   number 11 of ways.	And that legislation is certainly a  way 12 of doing it.13 But in the meantime, there have 14 been other proposals that have to do with,  you 15 know, taking it apart and looking at  what 16 everybody' s role in it is.17 Do you think that the City  Council 18 is doing everything that it should be doing  with 19 regard to this untenable situation, whether you  are 20 a landlord or a  tenant?21 SPEAKER QUINN:	Well, you know, as 22 it relates to the Rent Guidelines Board, we  have 23 limited legal ability to make change.	A number of 24 years ago, before I was Speaker, I actually had  a25 piece of legislation that, as we understood  it,2 
2 legally kind of was doable based on a loophole,  if 3 you will, in the Urstadt Law. And that bill  sought 4 to give the City Council, among other  things,5 advice and consent over Mayoral appointees to  the 6 Rent Guidelines Board.7 Eventually changes were made in 8 Albany, I guess if you will, that took away  that 9 loophole, that eliminated the Council' s authority 10 to pass such a bill which is why that is now   part 11 of the Duane/ Latimer Bill.12 So I wish there was more we  could 13 do legally pursuant just to the Rent  Guidelines 14 Board.	There' s a lot of prohibitions on that 15 pursuant to Urstadt. If people find ways or  believe 16 there' s legal ways we can do more within the 17 construct of Urstadt, we are more than happy  to 18 consider that and take a look at that legally.  We 19 have not found that.20 ( Applause.)21 MS. ADAMS:	One of those ways --22 SPEAKER QUINN:	I' m sorry. Ma' am,23 I can' t --24 MS. ADAMS:	One of those ways 25 that' s been recommended to us is that the  City 2 
2 Council do more by way of oversight of  City 3 departments that have responsibility for  enforcing 4 those things which lead to poor maintenance  and 5 violations against building owners.6 Do you think that all of the  City 7 departments are doing everything that they can  do 8 in that regard?9 SPEAKER QUINN:	Well, you know,10 recently in an effort to try really focus  our 11 Department of Housing Preservation and  Development 12 on doing better and more targeted code  enforcement 13 work, working with folks at the RSA, working  with 14 HPD, working with a large amount of  tenant 15 advocates in this City, we wrote and passed,  and 16 the Mayor signed into the law, the Safe  Housing 17 Law.18 And the focus of that law is  in 19 addition to tenants' ability to call for  code 20 inspection, to add onto that, the 200 buildings  in 21 the City New York with the greatest number  of 22 violations will automatically receive, on a  yearly 23 basis, a head- to- toe inspection.24 And it will have an inspection  of 25 slightly higher standards than if you just  called 2 
2 for an inspection.	And there' s other provisions in 3 the law that I believe will focus greater  attention 4 on those buildings which seem to be in the  worst 5 physical shape.6 So I think that is one thing  that 7 we' ve done.8 We also recently passed into  law,9 and the Mayor signed, the Tenant Protection Act,  a10 bill that gives tenants, who believe they' re being 11 harassed, the ability to go to Housing court  on 12 that harassment.13 So those are two things.14 But obviously we need to  remain 15 vigilant in our oversight to make sure that  the 16 most is being done. ' Cause part of the overall  work 17 in affordable housing in the City is not to   lose 18 any units.19 There' s a lot of discussion of 20 creating new ones and we need to do that. But as   if 21 we' re creating, we' re losing, we' re kind of running 22 in place.23 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you very much.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider.2 
2 ( Applause.)3 MS. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you,4 Speaker Quinn, for all of your service to the  City 5 and for testifying this evening.6 Just a point of clarification.  And 7 maybe your staff can do the extra research to  help 8 you with this.9 But that 8 . 8 increase that you 10 noted before in the net operating income rate  of 11 growth, if you -- that' s one point in time.12 If you go back even just over  the 13 past four years or five years, you' ll see that the 14 rate of growth of owner income has been, in  some 15 years, a negative, some years a one or two,   a16 nominal growth.	And this just happens to be one  of 17 those years where it' s popped. If you look at  over 18 the past five years or so, maybe it' s three to  four 19 percent growth, certainly something that' s not an 20 outrageous rate of growth in income, especially  in 21 light now that we' re seeing taxes.22 Because we had Martha Stark 23 testify in front of us.	Real estate taxes will 24 probably have a twenty to forty percent  increase.25 Fuel has gone up 53 percent  this 2 

2	year alone.34
Insurance still goes up.Water and sewer rates are still 
5 climbing up yet faster than they have in the  past.6 What' s a landlord to do, in your 7 mind?8 SPEAKER QUINN:	Well, let me say a9 couple of things.10 I mean obviously data in  most 11 cases, is a snapshot in time,  right?12 MS. SCHLEIDER:	But when you use 13 it as a basis for saying that the landlords  are 14 doing great, I have to take that  --15 SPEAKER QUINN:	Actually, what I16 used that data to make a point of was that I   think 17 you need to use broader data in making  your 18 determination.19 My point there was that you  use 20 both a Price Index of Operating Cost and the  Income 21 and Expense Study. You have that  data.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.23 SPEAKER QUINN:	But you only use 24 part of that data in making your decisions.  And 25 your decisions are also a one and two- year snapshot 5 
2 and we' re back here every year looking at data 3 again and making a decision for a year and  two- year 4 leases.5 So we have constant data  every 6 year to look at that so that data is relevant in   as 7 much as you make determination for one year  and 8 two- year leases depending on the tenant' s choice.9 So although I think you' re right,10 trends and decade and a half data is always  useful 11 when you' re making public policy decision. You all 12 are charged with making yearly and two- year 13 determinations. So I think yearly data is  relevant.14 And my point there was you  should 15 use all of the data you have when you set   your 16 guidelines.17 Secondly, on the point of  property 18 taxes, you know, we in the Council and the  Mayor 19 last year, froze the property tax -- last year, I' m20 sorry, took the property tax rate down  seven 21 percent in an effort to try to ease expenses  on 22 everyone who pays property taxes.23 I' d like to see eventually some 24 day in the City, a renter' s tax credit so that  the 25 renters --2 
2 ( Applause.)3 SPEAKER QUINN:	-- not coming out 4 of your pockets, the renters could have money  as 5 well.6 Also, this year in the budget  the 7 Mayor, as part of the Council' s urging, kept the 8 property tax rate at seven percent, you know,  lower 9 than what it was last year. What it will be   for 10 2010 ? We don' t know today. But we do know that' s11 the case for FY 09 .12 Does that mean your bill doesn' t13 actually go up?	Of course, not because assessments 14 is another issue. And that has long been an   issue 15 we in the Council have articulated that we  think 16 there are problems with the way the assessment  laws 17 work.	And stand at the ready to work with  anyone 18 in going to Albany to make changes in  the 19 assessment process so that the way it works  now,20 which seems largely unfair since tax bills  keep 21 going up even when the rate is frozen, to  make 22 changes.23 So we would welcome the 24 opportunity to work with you and others on  that 25 assessment issue which is sadly not in our  power,2 
2 in the power of the State  Legislature.3 On the issue of the water  bills,4 you know, we -- I agree with you and many of   my 5 colleagues do, that the recent water rate  increase 6 was way too high and not  necessary.7 A number of months ago we came  to 8 a decision with the Mayor on a water lease  sale 9 which we believed would help freeze water rates  in 10 the City.	And I believe if you made changes in  the 11 way the water lease payments were structured,  there 12 could be significant savings in not, in maybe  even 13 lowering what we did recently, what was  done 14 recently, certainly not making it any worse.  And 15 that savings would be afforded to everyone who  has 16 to pay them in one way or the  other.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for 18 those answers.	But it doesn' t really help the 19 landlords today who are facing bills that they  paid 20 over the past year or  two.21 But the next point I want to  bring 22 up is on the affordability.23 Over the past five years I' ve been 24 imploring government to expand SCRIE and  --25 SPEAKER QUINN:	And I agree with 2 
2 you. It' s been part of the City --3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- The income 4 thresholds.5 SPEAKER QUINN:	I didn' t mean to 6 interrupt you. I' m sorry.7 But I just want to say that  that 8 has been part of -- both SCRIE and DRIE has   been 9 part of the City Council' s State legislative agenda 10 for as long as I' ve been Speaker and probably 11 before that. It' s an issue we' ve advocated on in 12 Albany.	It was part of our budget response  last 13 year.	It' s something I wish I had, you know,  the 14 pen so- to- speak to change. I don' t.15 But I agree with you.	And I think 16 there could potentially be a much better  organizing 17 effort if we actually went to Albany, you  know,18 elected officials, owners, tenants together, the 19 type of coalition, with all due respect to all  of 20 us, that you don' t see a lot.21 If we went up there together,  that 22 might be something that note was  taken of.	And I23 would welcome the opportunity to help  organize 24 something like that with the owners and with  the 25 tenants and with senior community, with  the 2 
2 disabled community for the next  legislative 3 session.4 I know that doesn' t bring 5 immediate relief but.6 MS. SCHLEIDER:	Can we test that 7 show on the fuel companies first?	Can we test it 8 on the utility companies first?	Can we test it on 9 the Water Board first?10 SPEAKER QUINN:	That' s a good one.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.12 SPEAKER QUINN:	Yes.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The next thing 14 is we heard testimony from District Council # 37 .15 SPEAKER QUINN:	Yes, I heard that.16 Just now I heard that  too.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	What can we do?18 Because I see it more as an income issue  rather 19 than an affordability issue. If you don' t have 20 income, everything is unaffordable, right?21 What can we do to help the  City 22 workers?	What can we do to increase income   rates 23 so that issues like rent, issues like food,  issues 24 like health insurance aren' t so much of an  issue?25 SPEAKER QUINN:	Well, the issue 2 
2 for every City union in the City of New York,   those 3 questions of income and benefits and  everything 4 else are issues which get determined at  the 5 bargaining table and they' re not issues that really 6 we, I think, here at the Rent Guidelines Board  can 7 weigh in in a  way.8 If people, as individual citizens,9 as individual elected officials, want to express  to 10 the Mayor, to the Labor commissioner, to  others 11 that they, as taxpayers, feel that City  workers,12 whatever union they' re in, should be paid more,13 that is an appropriate thing for a New Yorker  to 14 do.15 Because as Ms. Levine said,  you 16 know, their salaries, whatever they then use  them 17 for, are paid for by taxpayers. So folks who  are 18 here tonight who are taxpayers, in  whatever 19 capacity they do or don' t serve in government, if 20 you think City workers should have  greater 21 salaries, whatever union or whatever role they' re 22 in, you should make that case to the Mayor and   his 23 Labor Commissioner, because they are the folks  who 24 do those negotiations.25 We at the Council do not have  a2 
2 role in those labor negotiations.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So we bring your 4 coalition to the bargaining table also.	We put 5 them --6 SPEAKER QUINN:	Well, they' re not 7 going to let us to  the table.	I think it' s a8 little more of a complicated organizing  strategy,9 but one we certainly happy to talk to you  about.10 It' s not a traditional organizing strategy.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Competency in your 12 organizational capacity.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 SPEAKER QUINN:	Well, we' ll test 15 it first at the Water Board, sir, and then  we' ll 16 see where we can go from  there.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any additional 18 questions?19 ( No response.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 SPEAKER QUINN:	Thank you, all 22 very much.23 ( Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Borough 25 President Markowitz.2

MARKOWITZ:	Thank you.8 Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members.9 This is -- no matter what we  say,10 the job you have is thankless. I just want you   to 11 know.	And I for one, --12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You want to 13 thank us.14 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	-- no 15 matter how you vote, I thank you at least  for 16 giving some of your life, some of your time  to 17 this.	That' s for sure.18 Now, having said that, let me  say 19 that recently --20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That' s only 21 because we' ve known each other over -- I won' t say 22 how long, Marty.23 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	But the 24 funny thing is, I remained eternally young. I  don' t25 understand.2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That' s true.3 ( Laughter.)4 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	Anyway,5 recently I stood over with Governor and  Senator 6 Schumer and other officials and tenant  activists 7 and neighborhood groups at Brooklyn' s Starrett City 8 to announce the historic agreement to keep  Starrett 9 City Mitchell- Lama and affordable for at least the 10 next twenty years.11 ( Audience participation.)12 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	We 13 celebrated the preservation of that model  of 14 successful, diverse, affordable, urban living.15 Unfortunately even this monumental victory was  just 16 a drop in the bucket in our housing crisis.  For 17 every affordable unit created, preserved in  this 18 City, several more seem to  disappear.19 Today, rent regulation is the  most 20 important source of the affordable housing for  low 21 and moderate income tenants and critical  to 22 maintaining the ethic and economic diversity  that 23 defines living in Brooklyn and New York  City.24 But as we speak, there is a  panic 25 taking hold in Brooklyn and all over the City  that 2 
2 more and more affordable housing units are  being 3 lost.4 In fact, I' m sure you know that 5 one- third of the City' s nearly 121 , 000 subsidized 6 apartments were lost between 1990 and 2006  and 7 Mitchell- Lama has lost close to 26 , 000 units.8 In the past fifteen years,  over 9 40 , 000 units have been lost due to co- op and 10 condominium conversions. And over 71 , 000 units have 11 left rent stabilization due to, I think, one of  the 12 worst laws ever enacted, vacancy  decontrol.13 No one disagrees that a  good 14 landlord has a right to a fair return.  No 15 disagrees. I must tell you that. And there is   a16 process, as you know, that the owners could  share 17 their books, open it up and to review it. And   if 18 they' re eligible for a hardship increase, then a19 hardship increase they should get.20 ( Audience participation.)21 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	But at a22 time when incomes are often flat, rent  increases 23 are forcing many tenants to pay half of their  net 24 income or more for rent.	You do the math.25 Approximately 43 percent of renters Citywide  pay 2 
 2 fifty percent or more of their income for rent.  And 3 the median income for rent stabilized households  is 4 approximately $ 32 , 000 .5 Where does that leave a family  to 6 live on, our average family? These rents  are 7 driving out the very people that we need for  this 8 City to flourish, our moderate and middle  income 9 residents.10 Ten years ago if I had told  you 11 that tenants of Brooklyn would be paying $ 2000 or 12 more to rent a one- bedroom apartment, you would 13 have been asking me what am I smoking or what I   am 14 drinking.15 But for landlords, today $ 2 , 000 is 16 not a lot of money for the average resident  and 17 they' ll do whatever it takes to get there.18 I don' t think I have to share with 19 you that many owners, if the rents are anywhere 20	near $ 1200 , $ 1300 , $ 1400 a month rent, are 21 renovating perfectly working bathrooms and kitchens 22 and installing new floors, bathrooms, recessed 23 lighting in the living rooms and bedrooms  because 24 then when you amortize that increase of  forty 25 percent, one- fortieth and the vacancy decontrol 21 
2 allowance rent guidelines increases, well, they' ve 3 reached their promised land, $ 2 , 000 of rent and 4 that means rent decontrol.5 Now, middle class and lower income 6 residents are caught between the rent and a  hard 7 place deciding between paying the rent and  paying 8 for other basic living needs. And that' s why I' m9 calling for, what I think is imminently fair  for 10 this year and that is no rent hikes, nada,  zero,11 zilch.12 ( Audience Participation.)13 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	This year,14 this year.15 And I believe that we must  reform 16 the Rent Guidelines Board process. The Board  must 17 be made more transparent and accountable to  the 18 public, stronger tenant representation and a  call 19 for the Board to use, as many of us are going   to 20 share with you, income and expense data rather  than 21 price index determined proposed increase.22 I' ll end on this, Chairman Markus.23 The truth of the matter is that there are  owners,24 there are owners that can demonstrate  hardship.25 They are owners and they have to -- and if they   can 2 
 2 demonstrate that and open their books and show  what 3 they' re paying for all the things that you' ve 4 alluded to, sir, I can say then that a fair and   a5 proper increase would be in  order.6 But I believe, and I think most  of 7 us believe, overwhelmingly, that the owners don' t8 open up their books.	They' re making a very tidy 9 profit. And we have to determine what' s fair, a10 decent profit and at the same time keep those  units 11 affordable so that the City continues to  have 12 housing stock that is available for people that  are 13 wage earners, that are earning regular  pay.14 And by the way, today, that' s not 15	just $ 30 , 000 , $ 40 , 000 , $ 50 , 000 , $ 60 , 000 , $ 70 , 000 ,16 $ 80 , 000 , $ 90 , 000 .	If you live in the City  making 17 $ 100 , 000 and a family of four, believe me, you' re 18 not living on easy street and we' ve got to  make 19 sure that all of these folks have a home in   this 20 great City of New York.21 Thank you very, very much.22 ( Audience participation.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Levine.24 MS. LEVINE:	Thank you so much 25 for your testimony tonight.16 

23	Risa.45
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead,MS. LEVINE:	A couple of things. One of the things you  mentioned 
6 was owners not opening books.	I think most of the 7 owners who testified tonight agreed that they  would 8 open their books.9 So just as a  --10 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	The proof 11 is in the pudding and in  the details.	Okay?	Okay?12 But that' s encouraging. If they say that, that' s13 encouraging.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	They' re 15 sending the books to Borough Hall  tomorrow.16 ( Laughter.)17 MS. LEVINE:	I had some 18 questions about some of the statistics you  cited.19 You said one- third of the City' s20 120 , 000 plus stabilized apartments, subsidized 21 apartments were lost between 1990 and 2006 .22 When you say subsidized, what  do 23 you mean by subsidized?24 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	Well, the 25 apartments that were formerly residents with  SSI 6 
2 and things like that that may have moved out  and 3 others moved in or are receiving Section 8  in 4 particular, section 8 .5 MS. LEVINE:	Okay. And you said 6 43 -- in 2004 , 43 percent of renters Citywide  paid 7 fifty percent or more of their income for  rent.8 You' re including in that market 9 tenants as well as stabilized  tenants?10 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	Yes, I am.11 MS. LEVINE: Okay.12 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	And that 13 comes, by the way, from Tenants and  Neighbors,14 those statistics, which they gleaned from the  State 15 Division of Housing, yes.16 MS. LEVINE:	Because the argument 17 has been made to us that because of  stabilized 18 units in a building, the landlords are  charging 19 more to the market rent.20 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	Well, I21 wouldn' t -- first off, I have to tell you that  the 22 stabilized rents have been going  up regularly.	You 23 know that. They' ve been going up regularly.	It' s24 not as if they' ve been frozen. Every one or  two 25 years their rents continue to  go up.	And the 2 
2 reason why owners -- and I -- you know, I want   to 3 go back to what you said,  sir.4 You know, the bottom line is  that 5 because of the lack of housing period and  because 6 there' s no competition in housing, we' re not 7 talking about a free market here.	There' s no 8 competition in housing because there are no  units 9 really available for the great majority of  people 10 that need them especially those that are in  the 11 non- luxury category.12 Now, most of these buildings, by 13 the way, have no doorman. I want you to   understand,14 have no doorman. Maybe have a half- time janitor, a15 superintendent either half time or shared between  a16 couple of buildings.17 So I want you to know that what  is 18 the price of an apartment, bare level price of  an 19 apartment compared to one that has a  concierge,20 that has a round- the- clock doorman, that has 21 several porters?22 So what I' m saying is I' m just 23 trying to balance out here that the amount of  rent 24 that owners, many owners are getting, for  what 25 they' re providing, it' s not realistic. And one of 2 
2 the reasons why there' s no availability of housing 3 stock in the City, which is not your fault, by   the 4 way --5 ( Audience Participation.)6 MS. LEVINE:	Well, that' s7 exactly what I was getting at  --8 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	Not your 9 fault. Not your fault.10 MS. LEVINE:	-- is that a lot  of 11 the problems that you' re identifying that the 12 people here are so concerned with, which are  very 13 legitimate, and as a New Yorkers I' m equally 14 concerned about them, and there' s nothing we can do 15 about what the market rent, is that 43 percent  of 16 renters Citywide are paying fifty percent  more 17 because a lot of that is market rent tenants  that 18 we can' t address.	We can' t address the MCI 19 problem.20 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	Well, the 21 State Legislature can address that and I hope  they 22 do.23 MS. LEVINE:	Exactly. And I hope 24 that they' re listening.25 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	I hope 2

4 come and testify in front of us they don' t turn  to 5 us and try to abdicate their responsibility on  what 6 they can do to address some of these  problems.7 We can' t fix the MCI problems, the 8 fact that they go on forever and that they' re  paid 9 for for many, many, many years. We can' t fix --  you 10 know, most of the, what you have just  addressed,11 the dwindling housing stock, losing it to co- op and 12 condo conversions, maybe the state law needs to  be 13 changed so that -- so that the impact  on 14 affordability is part of the review at the AG' s15 office.16 Maybe there' s a lot of these 17 different problems that we can' t fix here and we 18 have identified those.	Certainly, the Chairman' s19 statement last year identified many of the  issues 20 that we can' t fix and we turned to you and  we 21 turned to Speaker Quinn and we turned to the  City 22 and State legislators who come and testify in  front 23 of us and give us  some relief.	Because at the end 24 of the day, all we can do is come up with a   number 25 and a number doesn' t fix the problems that are 4 
2 being raised both by landlords and tenants in  this 3 group here.4 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	Ms.5 Levine, I have an answer. And that is that we,   at 6 least on a state level, we have Governor  David 7 Patterson.	We have Sheldon Silver, and  the 8 Democratic Majority and we' re two votes away in the 9 State Senate. Two votes away.10 ( Audience Participation.)11 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	But until 12 that is, you have to issue guidelines this  year.13 ( Audience Participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any -- Mr.15 Schleider.16 MS. SCHLEIDER:	Do you want to go 17 first?18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Cruz.19 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.20 I just want to preface my  remarks21 with a compliment to you, Borough  President 22 Markowitz. I am a Brooklyn resident and I   think 23 that you are a wonderful Borough President. And  I24 wish that you could have term limits forever  for 25 our borough.2 

23	limits.45	limits.6
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No term MS. CRUZ:	No term limits. No term CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And just so 
7 you know, Marty, we' ve known you a long time.  And 8 I' m going to do you a big favor and so is Madga.  We 9 are not going to endorse you for higher  office.10 ( Laughter.)11 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	Thanks,12 Marvin.13 MS. CRUZ:	But I do want to  ask 14 you a question about your proposal of having  owners 15 that are incurring hardships to file a  hardship 16 application.17 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	Yes.18 MS. CRUZ:	I would challenge 19 your office, and this is serious, to provide  me 20 with one hardship application that has been  granted 21 by the New York State Division of Housing in  the 22 past five years.	I would challenge, because I23 know, as an attorney that represents owners in  the 24 City, that every time --25 ( Audience participation.)7 
2 MS. CRUZ:	-- an application has 3 been filed for owners that are incurring  hardships,4 either they languish at the agency or the  standards 5 and criteria are so onerous they cannot be  granted.6 That is not a solution.	The solution is something 7 much more complex.8 But I just want to make that  point 9 to you because you were so articulate in  advocating 10 for it and I think it is a mistaken   point.11 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	Well, let 12 me see if I can just answer  quickly.13 No. 1 , I do not have the numbers 14 of the number of owners that have applied for  that.15 I can only speak for myself.	A16 number of years ago, and it is a number of   years 17 ago, when I was on the Conciliation and  Appeals 18 Board which preceded the State Division of  Housing,19 as it relates to the adjudication of  rents,20 complaints --21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That was a22 number of years ago.23 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	Correct.24 And I can tell you that quite  a25 few owners came in for  hardship increases.	Not all 2 
2 of them got them because they didn' t all  deserve 3 it.4 ( Applause.)5 BORO PRES. MARKOWITZ:	But those 6 that -- but those that made a very solid case,   you 7 would find that the Conciliation and Appeals  Board 8 voted while tenant members, of which I proudly  was,9 and owner reps, voted accordingly.10 So I have no complaint,  no 11 problems about setting up a process in  which 12 figures of owners can be verified without  a13 question and at the same time make the  process 14 somewhat easier and at the same time provide  that 15 kind of relief provided, however, that it can  be 16 authenticated, and that, in fact, it' s real. Okay?17 And that' s the most important 18 thing here that it' s real. And that' s why -- that' s19 why the State Division probably reviews  these 20 things very carefully, I' m sure, because granting 21 rent increases on this basis is one that you  have 22 to take most carefully, yeah.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Go ahead,25 Mr. Schleider.2 

23	Borough President.4
MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you,We had DHCR testify in front of  us 
5 within the past couple of weeks just about  this 6 hardship issue.	And they admitted that it  could 7 take years before a landlord can see any  relief,8 but by that time, especially those that, in  your 9 words, really need the assistance, they' re crushed.10 But I must say, if only  your 11 enthusiasm and personality and passion could  right 12 all these wrongs. If only it could make it  so.13 One thing about your reform that 14 you want to propose, and I see as a   major 15 deficiency, is that it still perpetuates  the 16 one- size- fits all. It doesn' t address that.17 If we had some flexibility and  you 18 could say, all right, these landlords here in  this 19 area, this type of building or this type of  rent 20 structure may not need a full rent increase,  but 21 these landlords over here most certainly  do.22 And I don' t think a landlord needs 23 to open up his books to the extent to show   that 24 fuel costs have gone up, to show that real  estate 25 taxes have gone up, to show that water and  sewer 5 
2 rents have gone up, to show that payroll has  gone 3 up.	It' s almost silly. These are real  hard 4 expenses. These are real hard expenses that  the 5 data presents in independent sources.6 But I think unless this Board  is 7 allowed some flexibility, whatever reform that  you 8 I' m not going to say misguidedly support, but 9 whatever reform that goes through in Albany  or 10 which you' re pushing for in Albany, needs to 11 address this very serious and very real  issue.12 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	I' m not 13 going to minimize what you' re saying and I  think 14 it' s a fair -- it' s fair.	I do know from my  own 15 experience that the number of companies that  are 16 buying rent -- rent buildings, all renters,  is 17 unbelievable. If there were no profits -- let  me 18 tell you, major groups are buying clusters  of 19 buildings all over the City of New  York 20 unbelievably.	I' ve got to tell you, sir.21 ( Audience participation.)22 BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	So I must 23 say, I must tell you that there obviously  is 24 something -- there is -- okay.	Once again, like I25 said, once size does not fit all.	But also, also,2 
2 one kind of building doesn' t fit all either. I  mean 3 to me, there are different buildings,  different 4 levels of services in those  buildings.5 I don' t think we' re going to be in 6 a position here to set exactly what those  rents 7 should be at depending upon  services.8 I came up with an idea many  years 9 ago, which some thought was preposterous. Now,  we 10 have unions, am I right, that negotiate the  wages 11 of your 32 B and 32 J employees. And it seems to me 12 that the only one that doesn' t come to the  table 13 and has no right to are  tenants.14 And it seems to me that if we  had 15 unions to represent our interest at the  table 16 between the building owners and the tenants  that 17 are organized, I think we would hammer out  the 18 proper level of rents and services in each of  those 19 buildings. And that would be fair and that we get   a20 rate -- and that we get an income tax deduction   as 21 well on our rents.22 ( Audience Participation.)23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Again, sir. If 24 only your enthusiasm, personality and passion  could 25 make it so.2 
2( Audience Participation.)3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank 4you.Thank you.5BORO. PRES. MARKOWITZ:	Thank you.6CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good job.7Council Member Letitia James.8COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES:	Yes.9	Good evening, Board.10 On that, I agree with our  Borough 11 President.	And Mr. Marty Markowitz, he  was 12 absolutely fabulous.13 I just want to -- I know you' ve 14 been here long and I stand between a break of   the 15 stenographer and a break and so I' ll be very  short.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It' s okay.17 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES: First,18 let me thank you and welcome you to  Downtown 19 Brooklyn.20 ( Applause.)21 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES: My 22 district begins across the street.	And I want to 23 tell you, I don' t have any prepared comments but  I24 want to speak to you from the heart about what' s25 happening in Downtown Brooklyn.10 
2 And I would hope, Mr.  Schilder?3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Schleider.4 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES:5 Schling. I' m sorry.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Schleider.7 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES:8 Schlang, and Ms. Levine and Mr. Wenk, I would  hope 9 that you would listen to what I have to   say,10 particularly Ms. Levine.11 Thank you.12 ( Applause.)13 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES: What' s14 happening in Downtown Brooklyn is we are -- we  are 15 experiencing, and what I am witnessing is  a16 different type of landlord, an insidious type  of 17 landlord, a predatory landlord who is purchasing  up 18 a significant number of rent controlled and  rent 19 stabilized buildings in Downtown Brooklyn.20 In fact, at recent count,  over 21 thirty buildings in Downtown Brooklyn, which  goes 22 all the way to Bedford  Stuveysant.23 And what they' re doing -- Steven,24 I hope you don' t mind because I can' t pronounce 25 your last name.2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Please. That' s3 fine. I took me years for me to be able   to 4 pronounce it.5 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES: -- is 6 that -- is that what they' re doing is they' re 7 engaging in a pattern and practice of  harassment 8 against rent stabilized tenants. And what they' re 9 doing is relying upon the increases that you  have 10 generously approved over the years as a basis  for 11 eviction.	And what' s happening in my district and 12 all in Downtown Brooklyn is it' s causing a13 demographic shift in Downtown Brooklyn  where 14 Downtown Brooklyn is becoming more  monolithic.15 And, you know, I love and I  grew 16 up in Brooklyn, grew up in Prospect Park  and 17 Prospect Park was my backyard. And I enjoy  and 18 respect and salute diversity. But we are  losing 19 diversity in the City of New York  --20 ( Audience Participation.)21 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES:	--22 and so many low income people.	So many low income 23 people and people of color are leaving New  York 24 City.	And increasingly Downtown Brooklyn is 25 becoming a playground for the rich. That' s not  the 2 
2 Brooklyn and the City that I  love.3 So Ms. Levine, I have a reform  for 4 you. I want to put you out of  your misery.	I want 5 to, in fact, put this Board out of its misery.   In 6 fact, I want to retire all of you and I want   to 7 reform this board. And I want to  --8 ( Audience participation.)9 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES:	And 10 that' s no -- Ms. Adams, you -- I truly  appreciate 11 you and all the hard work that all of you   do.12 You' re hard- working public servants.	But there 13 needs to be some democracy in  this system.	There 14 needs to be some balance in this system.  There 15 needs to be some accountability and  transparency.16 And some have argued, I don' t17 necessarily agree, that this is nothing more than  a18 dog and pony show.	This is a kangaroo court  some 19 have told me.	Some have said that this is just  an 20 exercise in futility. Council Member " Tish," why 21 would you even come down here, that this Board  is 22 heavily weighed towards landlords.	Why would you 23 even come here? This is an annual tug of war   that 24 tenants tend to lose.	Why even bother?25 Well, I was the sponsor of  the 2 
2 bill that the Speaker mentioned earlier, the  Safe 3 Housing Bill. I also cosponsored the  Tenant 4 Harassment Bill and also cosponsored and  worked 5 with Council Member Brewer, on a TCEP Bill  which,6 again,--7 ( Applause.)8 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES:	--9 requires inspections of tenants' -- of landlords  of 10 homes from top to bottom.	And have, in fact, been,11 as a former Legal Aid attorney have, in fact,  been 12 involved in protecting low income and  working 13 residents in the City, all of my career, all of   my 14 career.15 But I also know that you have  got 16 to balance the needs of both sides. And in order  to 17 do that I just urge that you ask landlords to   open 18 up their books.19 I would urge that you use --  that 20 you would bar landlords with serious violations  who 21 benefit from the increases that you  support.22 And basically I would hope  that 23 you would get rid of lease renewals beaus  tenants 24 -- landlords have been using lease renewals  as 25 weapons against the constituents that I  proudly 2 

2	represent.34	would -- 56
And, again, I would ask that  you ( Audience participation.) COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES:	So,
7 you know, in my heart of hearts, I hope one   day 8 they repeal the Urstadt Law and they restore  the 9 power to the City Council. That' s what I' m really 10 hoping for.11 ( Applause.)12 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES: And I13 agree that salaries have not kept pace  with 14 inflation.	Individuals on fixed incomes, their 15 subsidies unfortunately are not meeting the  needs 16 of the City of New  York.17 I also know that the expenses  of 18 landlords have gone up but I also know that  milk 19 has gone up. I know that food has gone up. I   know 20 that groceries have gone up. I know that  daycare 21 services have gone up. I know that everything  has 22 gone up.23 And I know that someone at  some 24 point in time, we' ve got to bite the bullet. And  I25 think this is the time  for landlords.	This year 7 
2 landlords should bite the bullet, make  some 3 sacrifice. No increase.4 ( Audience Participation.)5 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES:	I6 thank you and --7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES:	I9 thank you.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any questions?11 You need a mike.12 MS. LEVINE:	Sorry.13 Two of the items that  you 14 mentioned, bar landlords from serious violations 15 reflecting annual increases and getting rid  of 16 lease renewals. Those are part of the  --17 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES: The 18 proposal, correct.19 MS. LEVINE:	-- the proposal. But 20 we' re not -- I just want to be clear. We are  not 21 empowered to do that as of yet. And we welcome   --22 we would welcome more power.23 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES:	No. I24 understand, but you are empowered to impose no  --25 MS. LEVINE:	But I' m retiring 2 

2	first, right.3
COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES: But 
4 you are empowered not to impose any increase  this 5 year, correct?6 MS. LEVINE: That we -- that  would 7 be something that would be -- that we could  do.8 ( Audience Participation.)9 MS. LEVINE:	But the -- but the 10 -- I just wanted to clarify these two  items.11 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES:	No. I12 understand.	It' s part of the proposal but you do 13 have the power, Ms. Levine.	It' s in your hands.14 All you have to do is vote  no.15 MS. LEVINE:	That' s true.	We 16 also have to --17 ( Audience participation.)18 MS. LEVINE:	We also have to --19 ( Audience Participation.)20 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES:	I21 didn' t mean that.22 MS. LEVINE:	But you also have the 23 power, as part of the City Council, to offer  some 24 relief to some of the landlords and some of  the 25 issues that they' ve raised; is that not true also?4 
2 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES:	And 3 Ms. Levine, landlords have a significant number  of 4 tax loopholes and a number of tax benefits  that 5 they realize each and every  year.6 MS. LEVINE:	Wouldn' t it be 7 better to do -- I mean I don' t want to  get 8 sidetracked from what we all have to do  tonight.9 But one of the people  who 10 testified earlier said something like, social 11 problems need to be corrected not on the  shoulders 12 of the landlords. It' s a City problem. It' s a13 problem that we all share  --14 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES: Right.15 MS. LEVINE:	-- all of us here  on 16 this board. All of the people in the  audience 17 tonight, as the problems of New Yorkers. All  the 18 items that you mentioned, diversity of the  City,19 affordability, preserving the housing stock, all  of 20 those are things that I think every member of  this 21 Board does care about, whether you acknowledge  that 22 or not.23 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES:	No. I24 do acknowledge that. But I also recognize that  --25 MS. LEVINE:	And some of the 2 
2 issues that have been raised in your talking  points 3 about losing units to -- due to vacancy  decontrol 4 and co- op and condo conversion are outside the 5 authority of this Board.6 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES:	I7 didn' t mention co- op conversion. What I mentioned 8 is that the insidious and predatory landlords  that 9 sometimes rely and use your rent increases  to 10 engage in a pattern and practice of eviction  of 11 rent stabilized tenants in Brooklyn. That' s what I12 said.13 And let me also go onto say,  Ms.14 Levine, we all have to shoulder the  responsibility 15 of social problems. We do it each and every  day.16 And so all that I am asking you is that you   share 17 that burden and that landlords share that  burden 18 and bite the bullet this year and accept some  pain 19 and vote no.20 ( Audience Participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 COUNCILWOMAN LETITIA JAMES:	Thank 23 you.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 Appreciate it.2
