18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 With that we' ll begin. Everybody20 who would l ike to speak who called in or didn' t21 call in needs to register  upstairs.22 We are going to go based on  the23 registrat ion numbers and when you sign in.24 And we expect to go, you  know,25 most of the day. At six o'clock this evening  we17 
2 will be cutt ing off registrat ions, not that the3 peopl e who are here need to worry about that , but4 we will make that announcement  periodically5 throughout the day.6	The first speaker is Kristen7	Morisseau.8	MS. KRISTEN MORISSEAU:	H ,  I9	My name is Kristen Morisseau,10 Assist ant Vice President of the Real Estat e Board11 of New York.12 On behalf of the over  10,00013 members of the Real Estate Board of New  York,14 owners, builders, managers and brokers of  high-15 rise resident ial property, I urge the Rent16 Guidelines Board to set realistic rent  increases17 which reflect today' s substantially increased18 costs.19 The preliminary  numbers proposed20 by the Board are not high enough to keep  our21 owners whole. We need reasonable guidelines  that22 ref lect not only this year' s increases in23 operating costs but uncompensated  cost increases24 from last year as  well .25 The RGB' s own Price Index of10 
2 Operating Costs increased by 5.8 percent . Led by3 signif icant fuel price increases and high4 property taxes, apartment owners' expenses  have5 cont inued to grow while rents rose only modestly.6 The RGB' s Income and Expense7 Study shows that owner expenses increased by  12.68 percent this year.9 This past year owners of pre-10 1960 buildings faced unprecedented  costs to11 attempt to comply with the City' s new lead paint12 law. From notif ication, tracking, recordkeeping,13 inspection,  testing  and abatement , owner' s14 responsibilities  come with a great expense. In15 the event of a lead paint violat ion, the cost of16 compliance can be extraordinary. Some of  our17 members are incurring costs of more than  $10,00018 per apartment where lead is  found.19 Owners are also responsibl e for20 the expense of relocating the family  that ' s21 residing in that apartment.22 In addit ion, although the23 weather was warmer this year, we've experienced  a24 tremendous twenty percent  increase in fuel25 prices. Ut ility expenses are also taking a toll2 
2 on owners. Gas cost s have increased 10 percent3 and electricity is up 15  percent.4 Labor costs rose 6 .9 percent5 this year due to increases in the cost of  health6 care insurance.7	Although property insurance8 rates are in a modest decl ine from their all -9 time highs, owners now have to get  separate,10 expensive policies for lead paint and  mold.11	It is very apparent that12 operating costs are rising substantially and  will13 continue to do so.14 This proposed rent increase  also15 doesn' t reflect what we' re seeing in terms of16 assessed property values. Due to lowering  cap17 rates, assessed valuat ions of residential rental18 propert ies in Manhattan grew approximately 1119 percent this year. This makes it even  more20 necessary for the Board to increase rents  enough21 to cover increases.22 Another concern is the older23 buildings under rent regulation that have  fallen24 well below the market. Many have an extremely   low25 turnover which creates a two- tiered housing12 
1	112 market . Next year the PIOC is expect ed to3 increase to 6.7 percent . Unless owners obtain4 higher increases, these buildings will not  be5 able to operate.6	For all of these reasons, I  urge7 the Board to pass substant ially larger rent8 increases for the coming year than it did  last9 year. Our aging housing stock will only fall   into10 disrepair without rent increases to cover  the11 expense increases.12 At  the very least , increases at13 the top of the range under considerat ion are14 essential to maintain our  housing.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 Any questions?17 MS. ADAMS:	Question.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.19 MS. ADAMS:	I 'm Betty Adams.20 Would you give us an est imate of the number of21 buildings that have not been able to operate  or22 went into disrepair over the last year or  two?2 3	MS. KRISTEN MORISSEAU:	I don't24 have that number.25 MS. ADAMS:	Okay. Thank you.24 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Gregory3 Bender, Assemblymember Deborah Glick' s Off ice.4 MR.  GREGORY BENDER :	Good5 morning.6 My name is Gregory Bender.  I 'm7 here on behalf of State Assemblymember  Deborah8 Glick.9 As the Assemblymember10 representing the many rent - protected tenants of11 the Village East to West , SoHo, NoHo, TriBeCa and12 Union Square, I'm grateful for the opportunity   to13 present test imony before the Rent Guidelines14 Board.15 It is always wonderful to  see16 the large number of people who show up to  defend17 af fordable housing and I am proud to have been18 among them during my fifteen years in the  State19 Assembly.20 Under the proposed guidelines21 put forth this year, rent stabilized tenants  face22 increases of 2 percent to 4.5 percent for  one-23 year leases and 4 to 7 percent for two- year24 leases.25 I urge you,  first ,  to reconsider2 
  2 imposing increases this year in light of  the3 recent history of rent increases and  current4 economic condit ions that challenge New York5 City' s middle and lower- income residents .6 I also ask that the Rent7 Guidelines Board use its power, granted by  the8 Rent Stabil ization Law, to pass resolutions9 regarding the interpretation and operation of  the10 Rent Stabilizat ion Law.11 Rent stabilization is New  York12 City' s most successful affordable housing program13 and its continued vitality has helped to  keep14 lower- income and middle- income New Yorkers in15 neighborhoods which, without strong  rent16 prot ections, would have become exclusive enclaves17 of the wealthy.18 The continued affordability  of19 housing in New York City is necessary to maintain 20	the vibrant and act ive neighborhoods which21 strength New York City . The incredible losses of22 affordable housing that the City has  already23 endured from decontrol , owner occupancy and other24 means to remove an apartment from  rent25 protections have already forced too many  New21 
  2 Yorkers out of their homes and  neighborhoods.3 I urge the Rent Guidelines  Board4 to consider rent adjustments in light of  the5 current economic situation in New York City.  As6 the City struggles to recover from the  recession7 resulting from the September 11th attacks and  the8 failed economic policies of the  Bush9 Administration,  wages have not risen at the same10 rates as rents.11 The wage stagnation being12 experienced by many middl e- income New Yorkers has13 been made more difficult by previous year' s rent14 increases which have been as high as 7.5  percent15 in 2004 and 6 percent in  2002.16 Proof that tenants' incomes  have17 not risen to meet these increases can be seen  in18 the finding that rent is consuming  an19 increasingly  larger portion  of New  Yorkers' 2 O	income.21 It is, therefore, crucial that22 affordability be the key criteria used  in23 determining  adjustments to the guidelines24 governing rent increases. For the many  New25 Yorkers who have already received previous  large21 
2 rent increases and whose means are not growing  as3 dramatically, the proposed increases are just  not4 affordable.5 Contrary to the complaints  of6 the landlord lobby, owning rent  stabilized7 housing is a consistently profit able venture.8 This is especially so in l ight of last year' s9 increases which were based upon an Index  of10 Operating Costs that we now know to be  slightly11 overest imated.12 The security that rent13 stabilizat ion brings to the housing market14 ensures that landlords who maintain  rent15 stabilized housing in good condit ion do not need16 to fear high vacancy rates. In this way  owners17 are protected	from the unpredictable ebb and  flow18 of the housing market.19 For these reasons, I urge  the20 Rent Guidelines Board to reject the  proposed21 increases of 2 percent to 4.5 percent for  one-22 year leases and 4 to 7 percent on two- year leases23 and instead vote to have no adjustment this  year.24 Secondly, New York City and25 Manhatt an, in part icular, face a rash of mass2 
2 evict ions wherein landlords attempt to remove3 ent ire buildings of rent stabilized tenants4 through the abuse of the Rent Stabilization' s5 owner- occupancy provision.6 As an important voice of  the7 City of New York regarding the operation  and8 interpretat ion of the Rent Stabilization Law, I9 urge the Rent Guidelines Board to do all it  can10 to prot ect New York City' s dwindl ing stock of11 rent stabilized housing from this very  real12 threat.13 I have seen many landlords14 attempt to and in some cases succeed at  clearing15 their buildings of rent protected tenants  through16 manipulat ion and abuses of the code. In some17 instances, landlords will move through a  building18 and apartment by apartment remove tenants  by19 claiming to need the apartment for themselves  or20 a family member.21 I've also witnessed particularly22 egregious abuses of the provision where  landlords23 attempt to terminate the tenancies of an ent ire24 building by claiming that they will convert  the25 building to a single- family home for their own2 
2	use .3	In my district there is one4 particularly jarring example of this abuse that  I5 would like to highlight.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you7	wrap up? I thought you were almost done  before.8 MR. GREGORY BENDER:	Sorry.9 Basically,  the Assemblymember is10 asking the Board to pass a resolut ion supporting11 DHCR taking over or scrutinizing owner  occupancy12 when it threat ens an entire building.13 I will submit this to this14 gentlemen.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank16 you.17 Maude Boltz.18 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Good morning ,19 Rent Guidelines Board.20 I always come here with just21 what ' s in my mind, which  is that now I am  facing22 the realizat ion of two things.23 I 'm a senior citizen and I 've24 owned this building for twenty- four years . The25 first ten of that I did it in spite of a  lengthy10 
1	182 illness called Chronic Fatigue which kept me  in3 bed for a couple of years, but then spent  the4 next six or seven recovering.5 The building lost money  the6 first two years and gradually I was able to  break7 even. That ' s because most  of the buil ding was8 rent controlled.9 Now I have one rent controll ed10 tenant who pays about $400 a month  rent.11	It was not fun. I got hit with12 everything a landlord could be hit with in  spite13 of whatever I was struggling with:  lead14 abatement , a violat ion for smoking in the15 hallways when I didn' t have a public hallway of a16 nature that fit that design, asbestos possibil ity17 with a guy like a German shepherd banging on  my18 door when I had a statement from the City of  no19 asbestos.20 Tenants complain that even21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The22 microphone  is off.2 3	MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	So the whol e24 thing involved many, many strenuous  situations,25 one of which I thought I was going to  actually24 
2	lose the building once or  twice.3	Now this was crit ical to me4 because I had no income. And, of course, I wasn' t5 gett ing disability because it was not allowed for6 Chronic Fat igue , et cetera. This is a shaggy dog7 story. So don't take notes.8	The end result is that I  managed9 to survive all of this. And after twenty  years10 I'm making a profit . If anybody wants to be11 appointed to look at the books, I'll take you  to12 my bank . I'll be happy to have you look and see13 that I have a zero savings account , no insurance14 and had to give up my car.15 Now, having survived all  of16 that , I'm now making a prof it .17 Now, the tail of the story  is18 that I've lived the life of an art ist and I was19 kicked around by what they call loft kings  who20 owned lofts where you had to live illegally  and21 pray that you wouldn' t be caught. I dealt with22 inspectors there because the landlord was  trying23 to get me evicted. So I know what all of  that24 other side of the story is.25 Now I have a small profit . I'm9 
2 not living in a glorious state. But I have  no3 Social Security of any amount. I depend on  the4 building for my income. And I am a truly  small5 landlord.  I only have  an eight - family building.6 So I get very nervous about7 maintaining  my base . And  I ask you to consider  we8 small folks, we landlords as well as the  big9 ones. I wish  I had thirty - two, forty or  sixty10 apartments, but I don' t. This is what I've  got.11 This is what I live on .12 Thank you.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 You got a question? Maude .15 MR. ZELNIK:	I have just a16 simple question. I don' t know if you' ll have an17 answer for it.18 But since you are a small19 property owner with eight units, do you  think20 that there should be different standards  for21 guidelines for people in your situation who have22 a single building and a limited number of  units23 versus the owners of mega propert ies with24 mult iple apartments and so on?25 Do you think there should be  a2 
2 different standard or a different way of   looking3 at your part icular issues?4	MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	That would5	only seem fair to me.6	I mean  - - and also the fact that7 after I've run this for almost no profit  for8 almost twenty years but managed  just to survive9 and get by, et cetera, now that I do have  a10 prof it , I'm sixty- six years old in July, you11 know, why begrudge me some sort of a  profit?12 I mean also I have to do  lead13 abatement. So what ever I got in the bank is what14 I got to work on to meet those  structures.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where was16 your building  again, Maude?17 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Pardon?18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where' s your19 buil ding again?20 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	It 's in21 Brooklyn.22 MR. ZELNIK:	Are you involved23 with any property owners  associations?24 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	I 'm a member25 of SPONY.7 
2 MR. ZELNIK:	Okay.3 And have you had discussion  with4 SPONY in terms of the impact that the guidel ines5 have on, let 's say, the small property owners6 versus the larger buildings? Have you guys ever  -78	MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Well , I 'm9 sure they are aware of it . I'm sure they   are10 lobbying as best they can for, you know,  those11 people.12 I don' t think very much is made13 of this. I think maybe more people are  more14 comfortable with this. I mean I was  terribly15 busy. I tried to get a mortgage and it took  over16 a year to get a mortgage and I was in  dire17 straits. And I thought I was going to get  a18 mortgage like that . And nobody wanted to talk to19 me. You know, you've got an eight - family, you20 know, like good- bye .21 MS. ADAMS:	Left to your22 devices with nothing else intruding , what would23 you set as the increases in  rents?24 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Well , you25 know, I didn' t give full increases in the past.9 
1	232 I 1   ve pract ically kicked myself	for not  doing that3 when I would get smacked with another  expense4 that was going to empty my pocketbook, in  fact5 did.6 I took out everything I could  on7 credit cards.8 So I would say something like  69 and  8 percent , narrow the gap.10 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Lunetha14 Lancaster.15 MS. LUNETHA LANCASTER:	Good16 morning.17 And thank you for allowing me  to18 sit . I 1   m very  symptomatic  and emotional today.19 And I just have a quick20 statement before I read a speech on behalf of  the21 Center for Independence of the Disabled in  New22 York.23 Frieda Zanes, a disability24 advocate and a member of Disabled in Action,  and25 a Board Member for the Center for Independence  of12 
2 the Disabl ed , fought very dil igently for over3 twenty years for expansion of SCRIE for  people4 with disabilit ies in New York State.5 Frieda was on the list to  speak6 to you today after me. Frieda died in her  sleep7 this morning. And so we are saying even  stronger8 to Mayor Bloomberg please keep your promise.  In9 the name of Frieda Zanes expand SCRIE to  people10 wi th disabilities.11 The statement on behalf of  the12 Center for Independence of the Disabled  is13 written by my colleague, Paula Wolff , the housing14 expert at the Center.15 And  so I ' ll read exactly what16 she wrote.17 My name is Paula Wolff and I  am18 a Direct Service Supervisor at the Center  for19 Independence of Disabled in New York.  CIDNY20 advocates for the rights of people  with21 disabilities and promotes the full inclusion  of22 peopl e with disabil ities into all aspects of23 community life.24 I am here today to test ify to25 the importance of maint aining affordable,2 
2 accessibl e housing for peopl e with disabilities.3 New York City is home  to4 approximat ely 1.8 million peopl e with physical ,5 mental health, cognitive and  sensory6 disabil ities. Many of the consumers served by7 CIDNY who are fortunate enough to have a  rent8 controll ed or rent stabilized apartment rely9 solely on Supplemental  Security  Income,  SSI ,10 which provides them with an income of less  than11 $700 per month or on Social Security Disability12 which usually provides them with an income of  not13 more than $1000 per  month.14 These individuals are forced  to15 spend an increasingly greater percentage of  their16 income, often over seventy- five percent , on17 housing and are frequently forced to  choose18 between paying rent and other  essentials,19 including food or medication. Many of  these20 individuals have occupied their homes for over  a21 decade or more.22 However, if rents cont inue to23 rise, they will be at an increasingly  greater24 risk of losing their homes and ending up on  the25 streets, in shelters that do not meet the  needs2 
2 of their disabilit ies or in nursing homes.3 The situat ion is made even worse4 because people with disabilities under age 62  who5 rely on a very l imited, f ixed income do not6 benef it from the Senior Citizen Rent Increase7 Exemption program, which prevent s rent increases8 from being passed on to the tenant.9 Since many of our consumers10 currently pay over seventy- five percent of their11 incomes for rent , and their rents cont inue to12 climb, without the SCRIE being extended  to13 younger people with disabilities, their  rents14 will soon exceed their incomes, forcing them  into15 nursing homes or shelters, or to remain  doubled16 up with relatives.17 Every indicator before the  New18 York City Rent Guidelines Board this year  leads19 to the conclusion that rents for  stabilized20 apartments should be frozen. All the  following21 facts are taken from reports prepared by the  Rent22 Guidelines Board this year.23 Since 1989, Net Operat ing Income24 for landlords of rent stabilized  housing25 increased 18 percent in real economic  terms,2 
2 adjusted for inflation.3 Testimony of the CIDNY Board , 4	June 15, 2004.5	In real economic terms, adjusted6	for inflation, wages declined five percent	from 7	2001 to 2002.8 Homelessness has hit record9 levels with 38,3 10 people in the City shelters10 every night ,  seventy- seven percent  of them11 families with children.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you13 wrap up? Are you almost  done?14 MS. LUNETHA LANCASTER:	Yes.15 There is no economic16 justif ication for a rent increase this year.17 And I 'll leave it at that .18 And thank you so much for  your19 time.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 Submit the full testimony to the  gentleman.22 MS. LUNETHA LANCASTER:	Yes, I23 will.24 Thank you very much.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We appreciate8 
2	it . Thank you.3 (Audience participation. )4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Silber,5	SPONY.6	MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Good7	morning.8	I'm Jimmy Silber. I'm the Vice9 President of SPONY, Small Property Owners of  New10 York.11 We had our meet ing two weeks ago12 to energize owners to come out to the  Rent13 Guidelines Board hearings. And the message that   I14 was given to deliver to  you, unfortunately,	is15 that small owners this year are  very16 disheartened.  They are very, extremely reluctant17 to attend these hearings because owners feel  that18 their problems  - -  small owners  feel their19 problems are not being addressed by the  Rent20 Guidelines Board process and their  personal21 stories of hardship and difficulties are  not22 being heard by the Board.23 Two years ago, owners24 experi enced the highest real estate tax increase25 in the history of this City. We had a Price  Index9 
2 of 16 .9 percent with real estate taxes exceeding3 25 percent.4 And the small owners pl eaded5 with the Board for relief . The Board issued a6 one-year increase of 4.5  percent.7 Those were extraordinary8 circumstances and owners asked the  Rent9 Guidelines Board to exercise its authority  to10 help reimburse  owners under  diff icult ,11 extraordinary t imes. They asked the Board to pass12 a low rent adjustment . They asked the Board to13 pass a one- year surcharge for a real estate tax14 increase which the Board had done previously  when15 fuel skyrocketed.16 But their pleas went on deaf17 ears. And as a result , owners' economic18 deteriorat ion, small owners in part icular, has19 worsened.20 This year those figures are21 borne out exactly by your data with the  Income22 and Expense data that shows that Net Operat ing23 Income declined by 8.7 percent , the highest ever,24 and costs increased by  12.6 percent  .25 The huge tax increase of  20032 
2 has created a serious hol e in the budget for3 small property owners in this  City.4 No one can argue that the  Rent5 Guidelines Board process has not leaned  over6 backwards to protect tenants from oppressive  and7 excessive rents.8	Since 1990, the one- year9 increase has not even reached 3 percent a  year.10 But this process has failed to reimburse  owners11 that are hit by extraordinary circumstances  and12 extraordinary expenses. That is the failure  of13 the system.14 And that is why small owners  are15 discouraged and feel that it means nothing  for16 them to come out.17 We have a system of providing  a18 rent subsidy without any effort whatsoever  to19 determine if the recipient of that subsidy  is20 even in need of receiving the benef it.21 And the burden of providing  the22 subsidy falls solely on the shoulders of  the23 individual man or woman who owns the  building,24 not by the government.25 We need increment al increases9 
2 each year to make up for that horrible year  of3 2003 ,  and  that  tax increase has been permanent.4 It wasn' t a surcharge.5	So what small owners were6 looking for in the 4.5 that the Board  granted7 that year was to maintain at least 4.5 for  the8 next few years to help owners get back on  their9 feet and make up for these horrible expenses  of10 taxes.11 But what we saw last year  was12 the Board decreased the one - year increase to 3 . 513 percent and the proposals this year are  even14 lower.15 So that is why I have to  deliver16 to you the message that owners are complet ely17 discouraged and reluctant and they are  probably18 are not going to come out in large  numbers19 because they don' t feel that what they say here20 has any meaning.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, Mr.22 Schleider.23 Welcome back. I haven' t seen you24 this year. I thought you lost your  ticket.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Good morning.6 
2	Thank you for your test imony.3	A quick question. The  small4 building owners are being discouraged saying  that5 the rent increases aren' t keeping up with their6 expense levels. Is your constituency  feeling7 pressure to sell their buildings to converters   to8 get them out of the rent stabilizat ion laws, to9 become co- ops or condominiums?10 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	The11 composit ion of our membership  is basically people12 who live in their own buildings. Most of us  have13 inherited our buildings. So we've been there  for14 years. They are our homes, they are our   families'15 homes.16 And we are not speculators17 trying to make a lot of money in real estat e and18 then move on to something  else.19 But what we' re finding - - what20 I 'm  finding out is that people my age , who are  in21 their 40s and 50s, who are now gett ing into their22 upper years, are not thinking of leaving  their23 buildings to their children. They are  thinking24 that , you know, when the retirement age comes,25 they' re leaving. They're probably going to leave4 
2 New York and they are not going to pass on  their3 buildings .4	I have	my building, I'm a5	third generat ion owner of my building. And when  6 my t ime comes that I 'm not going to manage   it7 anymore, it 's going to be sold. And it will8 probably be sold to a  converter.9 And you see - - I think that' s10 the message that this City is sending to  the11 small owner, is that it ' s not worth it to stay   in12 the rental housing for the long  run.13 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, Mr.15 Lubell .16 MR . LUBELL:	Mr.  Silber, what is17 the average age of the buildings in  your18 organization,  these small buildings? Your19 building obviously is how  old?20 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	It was built 21	in 1930.22 Most of the buildings are  turn-23 of - the- century buildings, the older buildings.24 MR. LUBELL:	Are there any25 addit ional - -22 
1	342	CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Turn- of - the-3 last - century, not this century, the last one;4 right?5	MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Right . I 'm6	still in the 1900s.7	MR. LUBELL:	Are there any8 addit ional costs that are acquired by reason of9 the age of the bui ldings in your constituency?10 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Tremendous11 costs, and we bring this up every year, that  this12 is one of the fallacies of the Price  Index13 because it may measure the hourly increase that  a14 plumber would charge for one year to the next ,15 but it doesn' t at all capture the fact that the16 owners of older buildings will have to call  a17 plumber twenty percent more from one year to  the18 next because they have more leaks, because  they19 have old pipes, and their expenses go  up20 tremendously with old buildings.21 And that fact is not  tabulated22 at all by the Price Index. And that is one of  the23 aspects of this process that really hurts  the24 small owner because  it ' s by and large the  small25 owner that has a small older building and  is8 
1	35  2 trying  - - you know, it 1    s rough just ice and you3 are trying to give an increase for every type  of4 situation in the City.5 And it 1   s the small owner that6 falls through the cracks. And it 1   s the small7 owner that is the least likely to  survive.8 And if we are trying to  preserve9 rental housing, I think we have to address  that10 fact. Otherwise everybody is going to  convert11 their buildings.12 MR . LUBELL :	What are you13 requesting on behalf of your  membership?14 MR . JIMMY SILBER:	We wanted to15 see the increases of 4.5 and 7.5 maintained	last16 year. We wanted to see that for at least three  or17 four years for the real estate tax increase to  be18 absorbed by owners.19 So last year it was decreased  by20 3 .5. I would say maybe average it out , 5.5 and 21		8.5.22 MS. ADAMS :	Question.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes .24 MS. ADAMS:	How many members in25 your association?22 
2	MR. JIMMY SILBER :	We have3	about 250 members in all the boroughs.4	MS . ADAMS :	Okay .5 And has there been any change  in6 the level of membership	say over the last two or7 three years?8	MR. JIMMY SILBER:	It 's been  9 declining.  Owners have  - - as owners get10 discouraged and they sell their buildings,  of11 course - -12 MS. ADAMS:	How many?13 MR . JIMMY SILBER:	I don't have14 an exact number . Say five to ten percent.15 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you .16 A VOICE:	More  than that , Jimmy.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Any other18 quest ions?19 MS . HOLDER:	Yes, I have a 20	quest ion.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder.22 MS. HOLDER:	How many units are 23	there that you own?24 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Pardon me?25 MS. HOLDER:	How many units do24 
2	you own?3	MR. JIMMY SILBER :	My family4	owns a building that 's a hundred units.5	MS. HOLDER:	I 'm sorry. I didn' t6	hear you.7	MR. JIMMY SILBER :	My family8 owns one building that 's a hundred units. It 's9 divided between six family members. So  me10 personally I own eleven percent of the  building.11 So I own eleven units.12 MS . HOLDER :	And  where  is your13 building located?14 MR . JIMMY SILBER :	It 's in15 Greenwich Village .16 MS. HOLDER:	What percentage of17 the units in your building are  deregulated?18 MR . JIMMY SILBER :	I would say19 twenty- five percent .20 MS. HOLDER :	Of the entire21 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Right .22 MS . HOLDER: - - 100 units?23 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Are exempt.24 MS . HOLDER:	Okay.25 And are you finding in the  whole8 
2 building , not just the portion that you have an3 interest in, in the whol e building are you4 finding that in the last two years with  the5 spread of one and two- year leases that tenants6 are  - -  that your tenants are entering  into one-7 year leases or are they still opting for  two-8 year leases?9	MR. JIMMY SILBER:	My tenants10 tend to take one-year leases. I think that 's not11 the norm citywide, but for some reason that  is12 the scenario in my building. I think they go  for13 the lower increase.14 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	That ' s15 recently or  - -  recent history  or always?16 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	It's been17 consistent because, you know, the Guidel ines18 Board , since 1990, the average one -year increase19 was 2 percent . It varied  from 2 to 3 percent.   So20 I think tenants started to feel like , you know,21 that 's kind of like the range that it's going to22 be and why pay 4 percent for a two- year lease23 when they can pay 2 percent and the next  year24 they' ll be paying 2 percent. They don' t feel like25 the rates are going to go up so excessively  in10 
2 any one year that they would be encouraged  to3 take a two - year lease.4	That 's how I read it in my5	building.6	Also peopl e are - - you know, in7 my building people are more interested now  in8 looking at buying and they don' t want to lock9 themselves into two- year rental agreements. They10 want to stay more flexible and be able to get  out11 of a lease if they find something they want  to12 purchase.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Zelnik.14 MR. ZELNIK:	I always15 appreciate hearing you testify because I  think16 you really represent the segment of  ownership17 that is not necessarily getting the best deal  in18 terms of rent guidelines.19 And the way you describe  the20 housing ,  I 'm familiar with the housing  stock you21 describe. You know, it 's unique in terms of its22 age and the frequency of repairs and the  fact23 that it 's turn- of - the- century, last century, and24 so on.25 And also it 's unique in terms of7 
2 the small number of unit s that you can't amortize3 a lot of expenses over thirty or forty  units.4 And this is something I guess  I5 raise with you each year and I raise with  other6 small property owners, how would you, if  you7 could , you know, with your infinite wisdom and8 experience, how might you recommend to this  Board9 an adjustment of rent guidelines so that  they10 might perhaps uniquely reflect the needs of  the11 small property owner versus the more  commercial12 owners who own mega properties and multiple  units13 and so on?14 What guidelines would you see  or15 what  adjustment s would you see for peopl e, let ' s16 say - and I'm going to pick an arbitrary number     -17 -  that have  ten units or less, in these  smaller18 or older housing stock that obviously needs  a19 different kind of TLC?20 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Well , we21 have so many owners with different  size22 buildings . We have owners with six units, ten23 units, twelve units, fifteen units. And  we24 discuss this a lot. We think it ' s not  fair for  us25 to pick the unit designation because if we  say,2 
2 okay, everybody with ten units or less, you  get3 an extra percent , what about the woman who owns a4 building of eleven units and has just as  many5 problems as the person with a building with  eight6 units? She feels left out.7 So it 's a very difficult8 question to answer. The common thread of  our9 owners is that they - - most  of them own  one10 building and most of them live in  their11 buildings.12 So if you pass a guideline  in13 that direct ion, maybe you would capture more of14 our owners, if you passed a guideline for  an15 individual who lived in his building, he  was16 entitl ed to an additional one percent increase.17 To me the way to correct this18 situation is to look at the peopl e who are19 receiving the subsidies and stop giving out  the20 subsidies, rent subsidies, to people who don' t21 need it.22 When we have an owner who has  as23 ten- unit building , who works day and night to24 support the building, and she has a  wealthy25 lawyer living in the building under  rent2 
2 stabilizat ion, who has a house in the Hamptons,3 who drives with his Mercedes every weekend  while4 she's doing repairs on the apartment  building,5 and that 's what really hurts the small owner.6 That ' s what is disheart ening.7 And  it ' s not fair because those people don't  need8 rent subsidies.9 And if you could eliminat e that10 in justice, I think then the rents would  equalize11 and small owners by and large, you know,  would12 not have the difficul ties that they have.13 But we are giving out a  subsidy14 willy- nilly without any effort being made to see15 if the people that we are giving it to even  need16 it . That to me makes no  sense.17 MS. ADAMS:	So you're talking18 about a legislature change in terms of what  this19 Board  is charged to do? That 's the only - -20 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	That would21 require2 2	MS. ADAMS:	That' s the only way23	to correct the unfairness.2 4	MR. JIMMY SILBER:	That would25	require State legislat ion.
2 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any4	additional quest ions?5 Yes, Ms. Lusskin.6 MS. LUSSKIN:	One of the things7 that the reports ident ified this year is an8 increase in the problem of collections of  rent.9 And this seemed to be that that was  something10 that was part icularly affect ing the smaller11 owners.12 So I was wondering what  bigger13 increases  - -  if your owners part icularly in less14 affluent areas are experiencing  collection15 problems, how does a higher rent help  them?16 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Well , it17 depends on the area of the City. Each, you  know,18 area in New York I think is its own  special19 subset of real estate. And in some sect ions20 owners don' t collect the stabilized increases.21 Rents are at market. They can't get any  more.2 2	But there are plenty of  areas23 where the rents are so low that a 3  percent24 increase on a $200 apartment is  virtually25 worthless to the owner also. That 's $6 a mont h.23 
2 That 1    s $70 a year.  If the owner calls a   plumber3 once during the year for a repair in  that4 apartment , he 1   s in the red in that apartment  .5	So I don 1   t think there is a  harm6 in your giving a higher increase because a lot  of7 the owners aren 1   t going to be able to collect it8 because the market is affecting the area  where9 they have their housing.10 But what you 1   re doing  is you 1  re11 helping the small owner whose rents are  really12 low who can collect more and who deserves  to13 collect more.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,15 Mr. Silber.16 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Thank you.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Victor Bach.18 (Audience participat ion. )19 MR. VICTOR BACH:	Good morning.20 Last April I testified before21 the Board and made several points of which  the22 Board was probably already  aware.23 First , that rent  regulated24 apartments are the major source of housing  for25 New York 1   s 700,000 approximate poor and near-6 
2	poor households.3	Secondly, that the rent burdens4 they carry are extraordinarily high. We all  know5 that.6	And , thirdly,  that  their outlays  7 after rent leave them with less money than  they8 had before , with little money spent on other9 basic necessit ies - food , clothing ,10 transportat ion and the like.11 The question that we need to  ask12 and that I 'm raising and trying to answer this13 morning is are these just the harsh real ities of14 poor renters in New York City? Is it the same  as15 it has always been or is it gett ing worse?16 To answer that question we  did17 an analysis of the last four HVS surveys over  the18 decade from 1993 to 2002. And those are detail ed19 in the accompanying report called "Making the 20	Rent .1121 In brief , the analysis shows22 that , indeed , the situat ion has been getting  much23 worse for poor renters in New York City. If  you24 look at renters as a whol e , whether they live in25 subsidized ,  regulat ed or unregulat ed rental21 
2 housing, their median contract rent burdens  rose3 from 53 to 57 percent of income over the  decade.4 The proportion paying at  least5 half their income rose from 55 to 65 percent  of6 poor renters.7	Now, that ' s all three rental8 sectors considered. And there is a hierarchy  in9 terms of rent burdens. Rent burdens in  subsidized10 housing , of Section 8 housing  and the like ,11 Mitchell - Lama rentals, those burdens are clearly12 lower on the average than those in  regulated13 unit s or unregulated unit s. And the highest rent14 burdens are generally in the unregulated  sector15 as you would  expect .16 But what we found was that ,  in17 fact , the situation is rapidly worsening in the18 regulated sector. That 's where the greatest19 accel eration in rent burdens is happening to the20 point that rent burdens for poor renters  in21 regulated housing are approaching those of  rent22 burdens for similar renters in the  unregulated23 apartments.24 Very brief ly, the figures are25 that median contract rent burdens in  regulated8 
2 units rose from 57 percent of income in '93 to  623 percent by 2002.4 Of the proportion paying at5 least half of their incomes it soared from  666 percent of poor renters to 74 percent . That was7 only slightly lower than the score for  poor8 renters in unregulated units in 2002 where  779 percent paid at least half of their incomes  for10 rent.11	Even more alarming is to look at12 after- rent income per person in the household.13 Over the ten years looked at in constant  dollars14 purchasing power after- rent income shows that15 rents for regulated, rent - regulated tenants are16 eat ing into the income gains they've made over17 the decade, leaving them with less money to  spend18 on other basic needs for each household  member.19 I won' t bore you with the20 figures now under limited time , but this is a21 recipe for disaster for the poor tenants  that22 obviously you should try to take into account .23 We often characterize these24 hearings  as a conf lict , as a kind of annual25 confl ict between tenants and owners in which12 
2	neither party is likely to be satisfied. But  for3 poor tenants this is more than an annual ritual .4 This is now a matt er of survival . And we have the5	figures here to present to you if you want to  go6 into further detail at all .7 Thank you.8 (Audience participat ion .)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any10	questions?11	Yes. Mr. Zelnik has a question12 for you.13 MR. ZELNIK:	I just have one14 question.15 In the last paragraph of  this16 report that was just given to us, you  are17 indicating to the Rent Guidelines Board that  you18 would suggest keeping the guidelines to a  minimum19 this year as opposed to everybody else who  is20 talking about a rent  freeze.21 I'm just curious as to where2 2	your minimum might be.2 3	MR. VICTOR BACH:	Well , if I24 speak for the const ituency of poor New Yorkers25 that Community Service Society is most  concerned24 
2 about , obviously  I ' d like to see rents frozen.3 And that 's what I would recommend.4 I understand some of the unf air5	pressures on owners in terms of property  tax6 burdens. While homeowners get rebates, I  think7 some of those pressures may be real .8 But I would urge the Board to9 keep the guideline increases, if not to  zero,10 then certainly to a minimum.11	MR. ZELNIK:	Do you have a12 number of minimum that you would target at  this13 point?14 MR. VICTOR BACH:	No.
1516	minimum. 1718 good number.
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:MR. VICTOR BACH:
Zero is yourZero is a
19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And maximum.20 Go ahead. Ms. Adams.21 MS. ADAMS:	Yes.22 Would you just refresh me.  You23 know, one of the probl ems that we have is that24 the economy is get t ing better. And we look at25 lots of numbers.18 
2 Would you restate for us what ' s3 happening to peopl e who are most likely to be in4 stabil ized housing and their incomes over the5 last five years?6 MR. VICTOR BACH:	Yes.7 Well , actually,  the trends we8 examined were  from  ' 93 to 2002. And  one might9 well ask if that 's still the case.10 And both Mark Levit an and I11 argued at the hearings at which we presented  some12 data that the situation in 2005 is no doubt  worse13 because we know rents have been  increasing,14 clearly the guidel ines have been proposing15 increases, whil e incomes, part icularly for low-16 wage earners, have remained  static.17 So we would think that in  200518 when the next HVS data comes in, a  similar19 analysis will indicate even a more  disastrous20 situation for low- income New Yorkers.21 MS. ADAMS:	And you also, of22 course, noted in your study that the costs  of23 maintaining	decent housing have gone up as  well.24 Wi th regard to the owners' cost25 of managing rent stabilized housing, is  there8 
2	anything you can tell us about  that?3	MR. VICTOR BACH:	Well ,4 actually,  I 1    d better  stick to the HVS data which5 really doesn 1  t get into that.6 But I would assume there  have7 been some increases in those costs and no  doubt8 you will take those into account .9 But I think the thrust should  be10 at keeping the increases low. Unt il there are11 changes in the way our rents are regulated  and12 stabilized , that look at the real survival13 problems of the poor and near poor renters,  I14 think it 1   s best to keep the guideline increases15 to a minimum.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, Mr.17 Schleider.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for19 your testimony.20 How would your organizat ion help21 to expand the SCRIE program, or would  your22 organizat ion come up with an alternative program23 say for the less aff luent , the poor of the City?24 MR. VICTOR BACH:	Well , as I25 understand it , any attempts to expand the SCRIE4 
1	522 program beyond adjustments to the income  level3 for eligibility have failed in Albany -  attempts4 to expand SCRIE to the disabled, attempts  to5 we 've looked at proposals to expand SCRIE to low-6 income renters.7 We think it 's worthwhile8 pursuing. The question is whether it would  ever9 happen in Albany.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11	Thank you, Mr. Bach.12 MR. VICTOR BACH:	Thank you.13 (Audience participat ion. )14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr . Korman,15 Ed Korman.16 MR . ED KORMAN:	Good morning,17 Mr. Chairman and Members of the  Board.18 I'm Ed Korman, Executive Vice19 President of the Small Property  Owners.20 Firstly, may I ask how the  Board21 measures the Price Index of Operating Costs?   I22 would have to say that propert ies that do not23 submit an RPIE are not included in  your24 calculat ions and these propert ies are in the low-25 income, high density areas.12 
2	I don 1   t think the Board  is3 taking into account the small propert ies with4 about four to twenty units, which make up a  big5 majority of the New York City housing.  Their6 locations,  such as Bushwick,  Ridgewood , South7 Bronx are all high density areas that are  watched8 by insurance companies and they could have and  do9 have six to eight or more peopl e in a two- bedroom10 apartment .11 The real estate tax  increased12 1.2 percent on top of last year 1   s 18 .5 percent.13 Did you take into account the effect on the  real14 estate industry and the escalation of  the15 assessments? So that the percent age that you saw16 as an increase I don 1  t think is real ity.17 Insurance companies went  14.718 percent . I have  a six- family in Bushwick. A19 number of admitted companies have pull ed out of20 the area. My broker had to insure me with a  non-21 admitted company. Did you ever hear of  American22 Safety Indemnity Company? I wish I did  because23 the premium went from $3267 up to  $5300.24 Ut ilities, you say it 1    s .825 percent increase from last year . Last year I paid3 
2 Amerada Hess $.55 a therm for gas plus the  cost3 to KeySpan for delivery. The price went  during4 the year at the height of the season to over  5	$1.22 a therm.6	If an owner has high costs,  the7 only way we can pass them on is through  rent8 guidel ines. Service companies I 'm sure received9 similar increases and just passed the  increases10 on to us, the small owner that is having t rouble11 as is.12 Plumbers, electricians and13 carpenters have no mercy on anybody. They  have14 New York City licenses that we need. And  now15 their costs have increased again due to the  EPA16 mandates within the lead  law.17 Water; the DEP is instituting  a18 new program.	Instead of frontage, it is  the19 multi - family conservation program, which will20 increase water costs in a six- family house on a21 per unit basis. Right now a six- family house,22 which I'll give you an exampl e , is paying $210023 to cover water, and with this new program will  go24 to over $3000 billed on a per unit basis. That 's25 over a 45 percent	increase. That 's if you can7 
2 qualify for their program which has to cost a  lot3 of money to qualify for.4	The new lead law; the City5 Council didn' t do their homework but passed a6 bi ll against the better judgment and advice of7 City agencies that know the present law is  quite8 effect ive. Have you any idea what this is costing9 owners? If they have insurance, 14.7 percent is  a10 dream. Another log for the	'70s and	'80s11 abandonment.12 Did the Rent Guidel ines Board13 take a decrease in rents for Section 8        housing?14 The rents decreased by as much as twenty  percent.15 Affordable housing is needed  but16 not on the backs and pockets of the small  owners .17 Everybody  has  to share it .18 I don' t think you know how many19 people are really living in each  apartment20 because I have about sixty apartments and I  would21 say about twenty of them I don't know how  many22 people  are living there , using utilit ies, heat ,23 fuel to heat hot water and the cost of  water.24 Thank you.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where are5 
2	your buildings?3 MR. ED KORMAN:	I have them in4 Ridgewood , Bushwick	the Ridgewood - Bushwick5	area.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You own how7	many?8 MR. ED KORMAN:	Six.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Six. So about10	ten on average, ten units per  building?11	MR. ED KORMAN:	At the average12 it goes from six families, I have a thirteen  and13 a fourteen.14 MS. HOLDER :	I have  a question.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.16 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you for your17 testimony.18 How many units  - - you said about19 sixty?20 MR. ED KORMAN:	About sixty,21 yes.22 MS. HOLDER:	How long have you23 owned your building?24MR.ED KORMAN:I started to25get in theindustryin 1984, onebuilding	1988 ,
2 another one - - as - -  I was a general  contractor.3 And as I saved my money and I knew I wasn' t going4 to be able to work all my life as a  general5 contractor, I started to make investments and  it6 took the years until I got up to where I am  right7 now .8	MS. HOLDER:	What would you say9 are the ranges in the rents for your units, for  a10 one - bedroom	- -11	MR. ED KORMAN:	For one-12 bedroom? Well , let ' s take a one- bedroom and two13 because I don' t know the exact breakup of it.14 My lowest rents are about  $500.15 My highest rent - I have a two- bedroom that has16 been redone because of the new laws, the  EPA17 laws, which I had to invest roughly about $18 , 00018 to comply with. I could exempt that apartment   for19 over $2000 cost , but the most I can get for that20 apartment is about $1100.21 MS. HOLDER:	And during your22 time as a landlord  - - or perhaps  I should23 rephrase that.24 In the last couple of years as a25 landlord have you been able to impose  the12 
2 increases that this Board has voted in on  your3 tenants?4	MR. ED KORMAN:	Well , I keep up5 the registered rents.6 And I do have a number of7 preferent ial rents simply because when you are in8 our area we have a lot of people that are  in9 public programs, such as Section 8. And they  will10 - -  HUD mandates  certain rent maximums  for a one-11 bedroom, two- bedroom, and you can only get what12 they mandat e if you want to take them on.13 And once you have some Section  814 peopl e in your building , you generally have to15 take on more.16 MS. HOLDER:	And do you have any17 deregulat ed units in your buildings?18 MR. ED KORMAN:	No, I don't.19 And I could only get what the traffic will  bear.20 And , unfortunately, there are a lot of peopl e21 that don' t have jobs. I guess it 's a  vicious22 cycle that we' re paying the real estate taxes,23 high water costs, which is going back to  the24 tenants, which come back to  us.25 And we've got to find a way  to5 
2make ita palatabl e industry because I have a3feel ingthat the	'70s and	' 80s are coming back.45There' s a lot of new real estatebeing built right now. And you know real  estate6is a hotitem.7What about the exist ing peopl e8where - -the houses where our tenants live  and9 that we own that are assessed at a higher  rate10 because of the values that are going on in  the11 industry and we' re not gett ing any more?12 If our houses were worth13 $200 , 000 for argument  sake , they are assessed14 more now like $400, 000 because Donald Trump and15 all the other big guys are getting big  increases16 for the value of their properties.17 And this is what 's hurting all18 of us. We must come to some agreement. The  City,19 the State, the Feds, as well as the  Rent20 Guidelines Board, owners and tenants have to  get21 together to equalize the rents.22 Don't take all the money  from23 our backs and we won' t have to ask for help to do24 it .25 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.9 
2CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3(Audience participation.)4CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.5Yes.6MR. PAGAN:	Just for my own7 information, you have a number of properties  in8 Ridgewood , Bushwick.  How  far are they  from, let 's9 say, Wyckoff Avenue?10 MR. ED KORMAN:	They' re just11 all around Wyckoff. I have one between  Wyckoff12 and Willougby, between Wyckoff and St.  Nicholas.13 I have one Central Avenue. They' re all generally14 around that area.15 And one other point , if I  may16 make  it , I know I 'm over my timeframe, we  are17 being hit - -18 MR. PAGAN:	You' re not on the19 clock .20 MR. ED KORMAN:	Oh. I 'm sorry.21 MS. HOLDER:	You' re answering22 quest ions.2 3	MR. ED KORMAN:	Oh, I 'm sorry.24 We are being hit with  recycling25 fines. The tenants are not working with us.  We24 
2 have - - the government  isn 1   t working with us.3 I have one building on Central4 Avenue where a strip of buildings,	I think there5 are four or five six- family buildings that went6 into default . HUD took them back, gave them to7 HPD. And they are under the administration of  a8 third party who really doesn 1   t care. His    garbage9 is piled up to the sky.10 And I 1  m on Community Board #4,11 the Sanitat ion Committee for Community Board #412 in Brooklyn. And no matter how much we  complain13 for them to clean up their act , that affects us.14 When the wind blows, it comes across. I get  all15 the debris.16 And I approached Code17 Enforcement	and I said , 11  what 1   s going on? 1118 11  Well , we have to do our job. 1119 I said , 11  well , what is your2 0	j O b ? II21 11  The job of Sanitat ion Code22 Enforcement	is not to help the people. Our job23 says we  only write  fines, tickets. 1124 And we are being affected  by25 this. And all of these little things add up,  sir.21 
2	And we 1   ve got to come to a happy   medium.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 Councilmember Eva Moskowitz .5 (Audience participat ion. )6 COUNCILMEMBER  EVA MOSKOWITZ:7 Good morning.8 Thank so much for this9 opportunity to testify. I just walked in  about10 ten minutes ago.11 And I don 1   t doubt that you hear12 from small landlords who have their own  very13 valid struggles.14 But I do urge you to take  the15 big picture here. And I just want to say I 1  ve16 been coming before the Rent Guidelines Board  now17 for six years . And,  frankly, I don 1   t feel that18 you hear the majority of the testimony  before19 you. I don 1   t  find that much changes and you   start20 to feel like it 1    s more of a dog and pony    show21 than a body which is listening to the concerns  of22 New Yorkers.23 The bottomline	is that , in my24 view, we need home rule because we can 1   t continue25 to operate - -4 
2 (Audience part icipat ion .)3 COUNCILMEMBER  EVA MOSKOWITZ:4 - in a system where we don't have  basic5 determination over a public policy matter.  We6 cannot hold elected off icials like Joe Bruno7 accountable here in New York City when we  can't8 vote for them.9 But I just wanted to share  with10 you that over the course of my six years  in11 off ice I 've always, of course, dealt with tenant12 issues . But in the last year- and- a- half to two13 years I have heard and have been working on  the14 most heart - wrenching  stories from tenants . I15 really think things have gotten  conspicuously16 worse in the last two  years.17 My off ice deals with tenants18 whose landlords are aggressively litigat ing to19 destabilize  their apartments.20 I deal with ent ire tenants21 associations  in which tenants are struggling with22 not only rents going to market , but everyday23 harassment that they  experience.24 The economy clearly is not25 keeping up with the demand of the real  estate2 
2 industry. More than a quarter of  tenant3 households devote more than fifty percent  of4 their incomes to rent. Rents cont inue to increase5 whil e tenant incomes remain static.6 This body must pay attention  to7 that dilemma and you must act accordingly.8 And I haven' t seen that in the9 last six years since I 've been in public life.10 I treasure the rent stabil ized11 apartment that I grew up in and share with  my12 husband and three children. I live in a  one-13 bedroom apartment . To be middl e class in14 Manhattan is a very tenuous situat ion. And I do15 earn a good living. But that doesn' t mean that16 it 's easy to survive in New York City.17 It is incredibly diff icult to18 survive even if you are middl e class. People ask19 me if I 'm saving for my three kids to go to20 college. I say, " college? " I 'm saving for them  to21 go to nursery school . I'm not up to college. I22 don' t know what I'm going to do when I get to23 that point.24 To be middl e class in Manhattan,25 as I said , is a very  tenuous situation.  I  can2 
2 only imagine how anxiety- provoking	it is to face3 yet another unaffordabl e rent increase or worse4 the loss of one' s home.5	New York City in general , and6 Manhattan in particular,	is becoming entirely7 unaffordable  for working  families, seniors living8 on fixed incomes.9	In Resolution 797, which I10 introduced in February, I urged the  Federal11 government to adjust the poverty level to  reflect12 local cost of living. In that resolution I  wrote13 that "New York residents struggle with a  unique14 set of economic circumstances. " We are not l ike15 the rest of the nat ion.16 Today I 'm here to urge you to17 consider these unique circumstances and not in  a18 knee- jerk fashion raise rents.19 Thank you for your attention  to20 this matter. Please do not drive out hard -21 working New Yorkers from the Manhattan and  New22 York City real estate market .23 Thank you very much.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any25 quest ions? Ms. Adams.10 
2	(Audience part icipation. )3	MS. ADAMS:	Thank you for your4 testimony.5 I 'm  sure you are very familiar6 with the legislation under which we operate  and7 that you know what we can and cannot  do.8	Do you have recommendat ions on9 that , or have you done other things over the past10 six years to change that?  Because  it ' s a dilemma11 that I think everybody on this commission  feels.12 COUNCILMEMBER  EVA MOSKOWITZ:13 Well , I have worked very, very hard to repeal the14 Erstadt Law so that we are not in this situat ion15 where we are unabl e to really have a level of16 maneuverability.17 But that 's not to say you're18 powerless. I mean you do adjust the  rent19 increases and how much you do is up to  your20 discret ion.21 And my experience is whether  the22 fuel prices go up or down, the rents go up , raise23 the rents. And  I really think that 's  unfair.24 Now,  I don' t want to be25 completely unsympathetic to the small  landlords9 
1	672 who have a host of dilemmas. But you've got a  lot3 of big real estate interests that are  simply4 trying to get the highest price  imaginable.5 And my view is that - - I'm a  New6 Deal Democrat in this sense. It 's appropriate for7 governmental bodies to step in and provide  some8 sort of safety net for people. This is a  long9 tradit ion in America and it 's a tradit ion that10 has to be guarded not only for the poorest of  our11 residents, but in a City like New York there  is12 no moral reason why we should exclude the  working13 class and even middle class from that level  of14 protection.15 We need it.16 I grew up in New York City  in17 the 1970s when we had massive middle  class18 flight . That is bad not only for the social19 fabric of the City, but for the City' s fiscal2 0	health. We must keep New York City a place  which21isnotexclusively for the rich and  famous.22Thank you very much.23(Audience participation. )24MS. ADAMS:	I had a quest ion.25I think you would find a lot of
1	682 peopl e on this Commission very sympathetic with a3 lot of tradit ions of the country and that sort of4 thing.5 One of the dilemmas that we  face6 that you have probably wrestled with also is  that7 we cannot separate out the, quote, good  landlords8 from the, quot e, bad landlords, of which we all9 probably have different def initions of that.10 I am sure that when Mr. Lubell11 and Adriene look at landlords, that they are  not12 looking at the same people. One' s talking about13 one kind and one' s talking about the other.14 The same thing goes for  the,15 quote , good  tenants  and , quote, bad tenants.16 The legislation does not  allow17 us to make diff erences so that we are all18 probably  in agreement with you that something19needsto be done to help the good landlords,  the20smalllandlords,  if that ' s what good means to21you.22What are your recommendations  on23that?24A VOICE:	Open their books.25COUNCILMEMBER  EVA MOSKOWITZ:
2 You know, look, there are clearly in  every3 instance - -  I mean everybody is human. So  that4 there are clearly people who are not playing  by5 the rules on both sides of the  equation.6	But your duty, it seems to  me,7 is to think about the big picture. And you  cannot8 escape the fact that we have a quarter of  our9 tenant population spending fifty percent of  their10 income on rent. That 's just an undeniable fact.11	And so in my view you have to12 pitch your numbers to that undeniable  reality.13 And you can't go around thinking about the  good14 landlords and the bad  landlords.15 We have a rent regulated  system.16 The landlords knew that they were part icipat ing17 in that system and have gotten  enormous18 advantages, part icularly the bigger landlords,19 from that system.20 I don' t see landlords,21 parti cularly the big landlords, crying poverty  in22 terms of not making money.23 I think that this body has a24 moral obligation to keep New York City a  place25 that is affordable. And what ever steps you have12 
2 to take to do that you must do. I think you  would3 be derelict in your duty if you did not do that .4 (Audience part icipation. )5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Next6 quest ion.7 Adriene .8	MS. HOLDER :	Thank you so much9	for your test imony.10 And also as, in my real  life11 job, I am the attorney in charge of the  civil12 division of the Legal Aid Society and I'm  very13 proud of the stance that you and others  have14 taken in terms of the repeal of Erstadt  that15 affects so many of  - - well , it affects New  York,16 but it has a devastating impact on what we  are17 able to do here and what the City is able to  do18 in terms of controlling its housing  stock.19 I 'm interested though in going 20	to the personal , because  I really would  like  to21 look at it , this issue , and you said that   you22 live in a rent stabilized  apartment.23 In your building what percentage24 do you think of your building , or do you know, is25 deregulated?21 
1	712 COUNCILMEMBER  EVA MOSKOWITZ:3 Well , it ' s grown exponentially over the last , you4 know, since 1997 . You know, I don' t have  the5 exact figures, but anecdotally I would say  that6 more than sixty percent of the apartments are  now7 out of rent stabil ization .8	And, you know, it 's the East9	Side. You know, they can get $3700 per  apartment.10 But I pay a lot of taxes to  the11 City. And  I would  - - when I sit on the Finance12 Commi ttee and I see who pays the taxes, frankly I13 think the City of New York wants my tax,  hard-14 earned tax dollars.15 And , you know, it ' s hard to16 afford a two- bedroom apartment in the district17 that I live in. It 's just - - you know, I   already18 don' t go out to dinner. I don' t go on vacat ions.19 I need to have a certain amount of child  care.20 It 's very challenging.21 And , again, I want to  make22 clear,  I earn a good living. It's not  - - and23 there are people in far worst circumstance than  I24 am. So I don' t want to hold myself out as - -   you25 know, I have it easy compared to other peopl e.10 
1	722 MS. HOLDER:	We' re just trying3 to see where we actually seem to make  a4 difference in terms of what we are doing. I  know5	too well , in terms of being a tenant member here6 with David , you know, what this impact has meant7 and that affordability in our view has not  been8 taken that seriously.9 But it 's interesting because it10 is the idea that , you know, in New York City as11	the Board , as a group, it seems that landlords'12 concerns are always taken much more seriously  and13 that it 's not even a balancing act.14 And I'm not saying that it  even15 should be, but it certainly does not appear  to16 be.17 So I'm just interested in  terms18 of the landlords, raising rents, that  it ' s  really19 making a difference for them. And I would  argue20 that in buildings where there is a lot  of21 deregulated units, where they can ask what  the22 market bears, that those folks aren' t necessarily23 interested or need to have those kinds  of24 increases that the Board has been giving,  which25 have been extremely high in past  years.12 
1	732	COUNCILMEMBER EVA MOSKOWITZ:	I3 mean my view is that the system is broken from  a4 variety of perspect ives and we really need much5 more fundamental reform.6 And I know that you' re limited7 unt il we have a change in Albany.8 But I 'm very dedicated to  that9 change because I just don' t think that we can10 keep going on as it is.11	MS. HOLDER:	I agree with you.12 But I don' t	actually don' t agree that we are13 so limited. I think we tend to - - some - -   it's14 been an argument that we are so  limited.15 It ' s true that there are things,16 like a change in the law that limit severely  what17 the City Council can do in terms of actually,  you18 know, part icipating in this debate. But we are19 not that l imited and hopefully this year we will20 be able to do something that 's a little bit more21 fair to tenants2 2	COUNCILMEMBER EVA MOSKOWITZ:	I23 hope so.24 MS. HOLDER:	- - that really need25 some considerat ion of affordability.23 
2	I thank you for your testimony.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any4 additional quest ions?5 (Audience participat ion. )6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 COUNCILMEMBER  EVA MOSKOWITZ:8 Thank you very much for your t ime.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Michael11 Mc Kee.12 Good morning.13 We should make that movie14 announcement about cellphones. Put it  on15 vibrator, vibration, if you  can.16 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	I don't17 know how to do that . I can't figure that  out .18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Give us the19 phone. We' ll have our staff try to help you.20 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	I've got it21 on vibrator.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You know23 we' re always helpful .24 MR. MICHAEL Mc KEE:	We know25 that .7 
2	Good morning.3	My name is Michael McKee.  My4 testimony is here. It ' s quite lengthy. I 'm not5 going to read it for obvious  reasons.6 But I want to make a couple of7 comments about some of the issues that are  before8 you as well as some related  issues.9	First of all , I want to tell you10 how  - -  I mean  I was really shocked and sad this11 morning to come here and learn that Frieda  Zanes12 had died this morning in her sleep because  she13 was one of the leaders of the Disabled in Act ion.14 And she's test ified before you many times . And15 she was on the list. She was one of the  very16 early peopl e this morning.17 And for twenty- five years she18 has fought along with several of us to expand  the19 SCRIE program to tenants with disabilities  who20 are not elderly.21 And I want to say right here,  it22 is not the State Legislature that is the  problem.23 It is the Bloomberg Administration.	The only24 reason this bill was not passed in Albany,  we've25 been told flat out by the State  Senate10 
2 leadership ,  is because  the City has  for three3 years put out a memo in opposition to  expanding4 the SCRIE program to non- elderly tenants with5 disabilit ies saying the City cannot afford it ,6 despite the fact that Mayor Bloomberg made  a7 campaign pledge four years ago that he  would8 support this,9	And at the same t ime Mike10 Bloomberg	is trying to get to a step- up bill to11 expand the income eligibility in $1000 per  year12 increments which he has put into Albany and  has13 put it in the City budget to fund an increase   in14 the SCRIE eligibility threshold to $29,000  after15 five years, which we ,  of  course,  favor. Certainly16 the income eligibility threshold should  be17 raised.18 But it's really galling and it19 makes me very angry that the Mayor has  basically20 refused to support this very fair cost - effect ive21 measure that would make such a difference  in22 peopl e's qual ity of l ife.23 And I hope you convey that24 message back to City Hall.25 I want to talk about two things .10 
2	First of all ,  I want to thank3	the four public members - Ms. Adams, Ms.  Kaufman,4	Ms. Lusskin and Mr. Zelnik - who joined the  two5	tenant members last year in freezing rents  for6 SROs and hotels. We really appreciate  that.7 (Audience participation. )8	MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	We hope9	that you will do that again this  year.10	(Audience participation.)11	MR. MICHAEL Mc KEE:	We hope12 that you will do it again this year and we  hope13 you will expand that rent freeze to  include14 apartments and lofts.15 It is time.16 (Audience participation. )17 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	It is18 just ified. It is necessary.19 And I'm not going to go into  why20 it ' s justified. You can read my testimony.  I  hope21 you will.22 But I want to talk about  two23 other things if you can bear with me for  one24 moment.25 A three percentage point spread ,12 
2 cut it out , guys. This is clearly designed to3 force more tenants to take a one-year  lease4 renewal because they find the two- year lease5 renewal unaffordable .6	I can't tell you how many of our7 members have told us in the last two years  that8 they've taken for the very first t ime in their9 history of being rent stabilized tenants,  they've10 taken one-year lease renewals because they  can't11 afford 7 .5, they can afford 3 .5.12 The other thing I want to13 ment ion is the special guideline. And I 've14 attached to my testimony the same statement , the15 same factsheet , the same recommendat ion that  we16 have presented to this Board since the year  2001.17 You have taken a step in  the18 right direct ion by going back to a percentage19 above the rent controlled rent that is  more20 realist ic , although we think it ought to be   fifty21 percent or something like that above the  Maximum22CollectibleRent , not  above the Maximum Base23Rent.24But by including fair market25rents underSection 8 in this formula you are
2 making it impossible for many tenant s moving into3 formerly rent controlled apartments to file  Fair4 Market Rent Appeals. And that is clearly  the5 intention.6 So take out the Sect ion 8 stuff .7 It doesn' t belong  there. And , please,  if you8 would  like to discuss  the special guideline  -  I9 know this is something that nobody pays  any10 attention to and the number of tenants who  move11 into deregulated apartment s who file Fair Market12 Rent Appeals every year is minuscule. And we  talk13 to people all the time who are afraid to file  a14 Fair Market Rent Appeal.15 People moving into, you  know,16 apartments  that  are supposedly  deregulated , it17 sounds to us like they are really still  rent18 stabilized but , you know, because they didn' t do19 the work, et cetera , people  say if I file  a20 challenge and I lose, he won' t renew my lease. I21 can' t tell you how many times we hear this.22 We would like to discuss  this23 with you individually or in small groups if  you24 would  like. But , please , pay  some attention to25 the special guideline and understand what  you're2 
2 voting on.3 Thanks very  much .4 (Audience part icipation. )5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any6	addit ional quest ions?7	MS. HOLDER :	Yes . I have a8	question.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Who is that?10	Adriene?11	MS. HOLDER:	Yes.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms . Holder .13 MS . HOLDER :	Mike , I thank you14 for your testimony today.15 What do you think about  the16 number of units that we are seeing where there  is17 a signif icant number of the apartments that are18 deregulated? Do you think that perhaps we  should19 give special consideration  at not increases  in 20	those types of buildings where landlords are  able21 to charge market rents?22 MR.  MICHAEL McKEE :	Well , you23 know, we know that the off icial number that is24 included in the staff report that you  received25 has got to be so low as to be laughabl e.21 
2 And ,  in fact , I understand that3 Dr. Ellen	(phonetic) and Andrew Bevich	(phonetic)4 of Queens College are at the moment doing  an5 analysis of how many apartments have been  lost.6 And Andrew Bevich told me last week that in  a7 three -year period ,  from 1999 to 2002, they8 believe a minimum of 50, 000 apartments were9 deregulated through vacancy decontrol  and10 possibly as many as  90,000.11 We were hoping that they  would12 finish that analysis in time for these  hearings13 but they did not.14 But , you know, it's - - look15 around you. I mean - - and it ' s not just16 Manhattan. This is happening in the Bronx.  We've17 seen apartments in the Northwest Bronx  where,18 even though the market will not allow  the19 landlord to collect $2000 a month, they  are20 getting $1100/$1200 a mont h, and the tenants21 moving into those apartments have no rights.  They22 don' t even have a right to an automat ic lease23 renewal .24 So it ' s happening more  and more.25 And you've done this with  SROs2 
2 and hotels. You have adopted provisos in  those3 years when you have enacted rent increases  for4 them. And I'm hoping this year you will not , that5 you will do another rent freeze. You've  enacted6 provisos over the years that if a certain  number7 of apartments are not rent stabilized , because we8 know what SRO landlords are doing, then there  is9 no rent increase.10 And you can do the same thing11 for apartments and you should.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any13 addit ional  - - on the handicapped  situation, I14 just  - -  I appreciate what you're saying.15 But I think that it is also  true16 and fair to say that every mayor for what ever17 reason since the adopt ion of the Senior Cit izens18 Rent  Increase Exempt ion - -  and I go back thirty19 something years to the HPD people,  including20 myself	- -  has chosen to oppose  the expansion.21 So just to set the record22 straight . It is  my understanding	- -2 3	MR . MICHAEL Mc KEE:	Well , I24 have some history here too,  Marvin.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	I know you24 
2	do. We have a similar history I  think.3	MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	I was a4 member of the Temporary State Commission  on5 Rental Housing which issued a report in 1980  to6 the Legislature. And one of the  recommendations7 in that report , twenty- five years ago, was to8 expand the SCRIE program to include the  non-9 elderly disabled.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.11 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	And it is12 true that previous administrations	have opposed13 this. But you know what? They didn' t officially14 oppose it. They didn' t put out a memo in15 opposition . It was a whispering campaign: oh, we16 can't do this - this is what legislators  would17 tell us - because the City can't afford  it.18 We never had official opposit ion19 until the last year of the Giuliani regime  when20 it looked like the bill was going to pass,  and21 all of a sudden, the City of New York put out  a22 memo in opposit ion.23 And despite his campaign  pledge24 of four years ago, the Bloomberg  Administration25 has put out a memo in opposition for three  years.4 
2 They haven' t done one this year and we' re still3 negot iating. But you know what? We' re negotiating4 wi th some horrible budget beancounters from the5 Office of Management and Budget who only look  at6 the bottomline.7	And , again, I want to tell you8 that the mayor is proposing a bill to step up  the9 income eligibility for SCRIE for elderly whil e10 not allowing disabled people.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Have you12 reached an agreement as part of  these13 negot iations on a definition of disabled14 because	- -15 MR . MICHAEL Mc KEE:	That ' s not16 the issue. The only issue now, the City wants  a17 lower threshold , a lower income threshold for18 people with disabilit ies, lower than $24,000,19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Lower than - 2021 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	- - even22 though the overwhelming majority of peopl e who23 would qualify are at the SSI , SSDI level .   And24 they' re saying we won' t agree to $24,000.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.21 
2 MR. MICHAEL McKEE :	They were3 proposing to leave out Veterans, for exampl e , but4 now they've given in because the  Senate5	Republicans said no way .6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You can well7 appreciate at this point , just given our role,8 our inst itutional role, forgetting about our9 individual predilections, we would love to  have10 it .11	MR. MICHAEL Mc KEE:	Because12 it 's so overdue and it makes  so much sense and  it13 would cost very l ittle.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me say15 that between 1974 and 1979 HPD, because  those16 were the years I was there , or HCA, not HPD,17 advocated the addit ion of , you know, SS18 disabled at some def initional level , which was19 always one of the issues too, inclusion. And , you  20	know , you' re still dealing with  budget.21 So this Board , I would  say,22 although we don' t pass resolutions, I think it23 would make our life easier, and certainly in  my24 opinion,  without  talking  to the Board , would be25 fair .21 
2 MR. MICHAEL Mc KEE:	I wish you3 would convey that message to City Hall in  the4 next few days5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Who are you6	dealing with?7	MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	- - because,8	you know, the session is  over.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Who are you10	deal ing with at City Hall?11	MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	Anthony12 Croll e.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Anthony.14 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	Special15 Counsel for the Mayor, otherwise known as  the16 Mayor' s fixer.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What 's his18 name?19 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	Crolle, C- 20	r- o- 1- 1- e.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.22 Go ahead.23 MR . MICHAEL Mc KEE:	He, by the24 way, is sympathetic. It 's the Off ice of25 Management	and Budget  that ' s stopping this.21 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead Mr.3	Zelnik.4	MR. ZELNIK:	Just one comment5 and one quest ion, or not even a quest ion.6 But if you could provide us  with7 a copy of the Mayor' s letter of opposit ion or8 provide me - -9	MR. MICHAEL Mc KEE:	Oh, sure.10 They haven' t put one out this11 year yet .12 MR. ZELNIK:	Okay. Or - -13 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	They're14 hoping - -15 MR. ZELNIK:	- - the one last16 year.17 MR . MICHAEL McKEE:	Pardon me?18 MR. ZELNIK:	Did they issue one19 last year or the year before?20 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	For the21 last three years.2 2	MR. ZELNIK:	The latest one that23 you - -24 MR. MICHAEL Mc KEE:	We have it.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where are you23 
2	physically there?3	MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	Say it4	again.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	In terms of  6 the Assembly and Senate, are you  actively7 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	The8 Assembly has passed the broader bill . We've9 already submitted a compromise bill that  cuts10 back on the def inition to a degree but  it ' s11 something we can live with.12 And the Assembly has said13 absolutely. The Senate has said absolut ely but14 only if the City drops its opposit ion.15 So the problem is not Albany.16 The problem is City Hall.17 MR . ZELNIK:	And this is just18 one comment. I want to address this to my  fellow19 Board Members  as opposed to - - well , everybody  is20 here, and that is, Marvin has indicated  this21 Board doesn' t pass resolut ions.22 And I would suggest that  this23 Board in this situation warrants  - - should ,  in24 fact , pass resolutions  even if they are just on  25	paper.6 
2(Audience participat ion. )3MR. ZELNIK:	I would like to see4us takepositions that may or may not have  any5impact ,but I think we should do it  anyway.6CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Yeah. I mean7I think- -  I would urge every member to8 individually indicate they are a member of  the9 Rent Guidelines Board. Personally I don't want  to10 set the precedent , but I think we can, you know,11 individually tell whoever, both our elec ted12 legislators and leaders, whatever we  want.13 But I can assure you, just  given14 our role, forgetting about our individual , it15 would be the easiest thing for us to  support.16 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	Well , even17 the real estate industry supports it  quite18 logically.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.20 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	You know,21 it makes sense for everybody and it would  not22 cost the City a lot of money.23 The off ice of - - I mean the24 independent Budget Off ice estimated that after25 five years the maximum cost of this program  for8 
2	the City would be $14 mill ion.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How much?4 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	$145	million .6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.7 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	That 's a8	max . It could be less.9	MS. HOLDER:	I would just like10 to say that as part of an advocacy community  that11 works on this, when people keep looking at us   and12 saying what is it that you all are doing, as  part13 of an advocacy community who works really  hard14 with the community, the tenants, legislators,   I15 think it is very important and I would like  for16 the Board to take seriously the fact that as  a17 Board we could make resolutions, we could  make18 these statements saying that we have looked  at19 the data, we understand what the issues are,  and20 we want to join in the  debate.21 The idea that there are  other22 things that can be done to relieve  these23 pressures being felt by folks in our  community24 and by the tenants, there are equally  other25 things  - and I'm a tenant member, but  I will   also10 
2 say this - there are other things that can  be3 done to relieve the pressure on landlords.  They4 are not my constituency, my constituent  base.5	But I will say this, is  that6 when  - -  there are good  landlords out there. And7 understand that I have made a career off  of8 advocating and litigating on behalf of  City,9 State and Federal housing programs and looking  at10 things that  are happening , when there  are good11 landlords  -  can be  government landlords,12 inst itutional landlords and individual13 landlords - we so applaud the good  responsible14 ones because we want our tenants and  our15 neighbors to live in adequate  housing.16 So no one is against that.17 But what could happen is  not18 happening. And this Board could take a first  step19 to say that there are things that can happen  to20 relieve the pressures on  everyone.21 But , again, we can say  this,22 that a lot of these programs that are up and  the23 City does have control of , we are all appointed24 by the Mayor and we should make these  statements25 to him individually but collectively as a  body,6 
2 as the Rent Guidelines Board.3 And I think most of us would4 agree that it is necessary and I think that  we5 should do it.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.7 Thank you.8 (Audience participation. )9 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	I will10 let me just say one more thing. I  honestly11 believe , we bel ieve that the Mayor does not12 himself  know what ' s going on on this issue.13 And when I heard about  Frieda14 this morning, I wasn' t planning to talk about15 SCRIE. But I was so angry, so frustrated at  the16 obstinacy of City Hall on this issue, which  is17 just  so common sense , we don' t really think the18 Mayor knows what 's going on in this thing.19 So I'm asking you, Marvin  and20 the rest of the Board , get the message   across.21 There are only another four or five days of  the22 session in Albany. This can be done .23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I will24 deliver it.25 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	Thank you.10 
1	932 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Marvin,3 quest ion.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead , Mr.5	Schleider.6	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you,7	Michael , for your testimony and the words.8	The $14 million figure that  you9 relayed to the Board, how many apartments,  how10 many households would that  help?11	MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	Well , I'm12 sorry I don' t remember. It 's a few thousand.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	A few thousand.14 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	But we do15 know that in terms of SCRIE there are  many16 elderly tenants who qualify that do not  apply.17 And, of course, there are  all18 sorts of administrat ive probl ems.19 One of the probl ems with SCRIE20 is that the people who administ er it for the City21 hate it. They think everyone' s a fraud. They22 think everyone falsifies their income  statements.23 And , of course , there are some instances   of24 fraud.25 But you know what? It ' s like - -12 
2 and this is part of the opposition that we  are3 getting to expanding it to peopl e with4 disabilities,  there is an administrat ive concern5 about how you define who is disabl ed.6 And I think we've addressed  that7 and we've addressed it in a very responsible  way.8 And as I said , we draft ed a compromise bill which9 we have now given to the City and  the10 Legislature . When  I say  "we, "  I'm talking about a11 coalit ion that includes CIDNY, Center for12 Independence of the Disabled, New York,  Disabled13 in Action, Tenants and Neighbors,  Coal ition for14 the Homeless. A bunch of groups have been  working15 on this issue for the last couple of  years.16 And I've been working on it  for17 twenty- five years.18 But it's19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I think it 's20 longer than that you've been working on it .21 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	Well ,22 you're actually right. It was my mot ion to23 include it in the Temporary State Commission   on24 Rental Housing Report. And I'm sad to say that   it25 passed by a 6- 4 vot e with the four landlord2 
2	members of Commission voting against it.  And that 3	was 1980 .4 But it 's a few thousand5 apartments. I can get you the Independent  Budget6 Off ice analysis7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We will do8 that. We will provide the Board Members,  our9 staff wi ll provide the IBO report.10 MR. MICHAEL McKEE:	Thank you11 very much.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.13 MS. HOLDER :	When do you think14 we can get that?15 MR. MICHAEL Mc KEE:	I'm sorry?16 MS. HOLDER:	The Chair said that17 the staff would provide for it. When do you  think18 we can get that?19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Excuse me?20 0	MS. HOLDER :	When do you think21 that we can get that?22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	When we get23that ? We' ll getit to you tomorrow by e- mail , or24I mean today ifwe finish early. Obviously we25won' t .
2	Well , we can make - - well , we3	have nobody in the off ice.4	Patrick Siconolfi .5	MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Good6	morning.7	My name is Pat Siconolf i . I'm8 Executive Director of CHIP, the Community  Housing9 Improvement Program. CHIP represents small  and10 medium- sized owners of rent regulated properties11 in New York City.12 Thank you for the opportunity  to13 address you.14 My comments will focus on  two15 aspects of the rent - setting process.16 The first point concerns Net17 Operating Income. The Board issued on May 2 ,  200518 a prel iminary version of the Income and Expense19 Study .20 Among its findings is that  the21 average owner net operating income had  declined22 by 4.5 percent. This is a remarkable and  alarming23 finding.24 More troubling, however, was  the25 updat e to the Income and Expense Study issued  on8 
1	972 June 2nd which shows, after applying  corrected3 data, a 9.1 percent decrease in  NOI.4	Context is important here.5	First , this decline is the worst6 result in the fifteen years that the IES  study7 has been produced.8	Second , it 's the worst ever9 negative NOI - - it ' s the first ever negative  NOI10 during the same period.11 Specif ically, as a regulatory12 body, you control the cash inflows to  this13 industry, an industry that has just experienced  a14 very large drop in NOI. This places an   enormous15 publ ic policy on the Board.16 How can the Board respond  to17 this unprecedent ed situation? Your deliberations18 as a regulatory body must address the  larger19 economic environment and not impose a clamp   on20 rates in the face of such a dire economic  result.21 A clamp on rates in this context means  the22 setting of any rates which do not reflect  the23 actual increased expenses experienced by  an24 agency.25 It is not in anyone' s interest ,9 
2 neither the owners nor the tenants, to ignore   the3 underlying economic forces at work. An   industry4 whose cash flow is prejudicially  restrict ed while5 its expenses are not will suffer declines  that6 will affect the quality and avai lability of7 housing.8 And this brings me to my  second9 point . Government remains in a patt ern of10 cont inuing to impose costly mandates on the11 residential real estate industry. The RGB is   one12 part of the larger government edifice, and   while13 the RGB restricts cash flow to the  industry,14 other parts of the same edifice are  mandating15 increased expenditures.16 To not address these  inherently17 contradictory imposit ions of the same government18 places the rational basis of the rent - setting19 process at risk.20 Thank you.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,22 Mr. Siconolfi.23 Any quest ions? Go ahead , Mr.24 Lubell.25 MR. LUBELL:	We have been2 
2 advised that eleven percent of the housing  stock3 is distressed housing.4 Among your members do you  find5 any with distressed housing and any that  are6 marginally	- - that advise you that they  are7 marginally  distressed? And could you comment  on8 that?9 MR.  PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Well , I10 think CHIP members are something of a  cross-11 section of the industry although we tend  more12 toward the smaller and the medium- sized.13 And , yes, there  is a portion of14 our  membership	-  I couldn' t tell you an exact15 percentage	- but there is a port ion of our16 membership that does suffer in the way that  you17 ment ion.18 And I think it ' s important to  go19 back to that piece of the testimony. I mean  there20 are enormous upward pressures on the industry   so21 that the cash flows out are accelerat ing22 extensively.23 I mean just to cite one, you may24 be aware that the water board is, the New  York25 City Wat er Board is in the middle of a five-year2 
2 rate increase program that will increase rates  to3 the industry, wat er and sewer, by about 364 percent .5	Now, you know, that ' s an6	enormous burden that has to be  absorbed.7	And , again, it 's being  done by8 the same government edif ice of which you are a9 part.10 You know about two years ago  the11 18 percent  increase in taxes.12 And these are alarming  numbers.13 When you have this kind of increase in each  of14 the areas that makes up the composite of  costs15 and you compare that to the in- flows which you16 regulate , you can see that  there is a  very17 dramat ic mismatch between those two.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any other19 quest ions?20 (No response.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Thank23 you.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jennifer25 Stewart - Page. Is she here?8 
2 MS. JENNIFER STEWART- PAGE:	Good3 morning.4	CHAIRMAN MAR KUS :	Can you5 hold  - - hold it , Ms. Page. Just take the mike  out6 of the sleeve and hold it in front of  her.7 MS. JENNIFER STEWART- PAGE:8 Good morning.9	My name is Jennifer Stewart -10 Page. I am a consumer and volunteer for  the11 Center of Independence of the Disabled of  New12 York, CIDNY.13 Thank you for granting me  this14 opportunity of speaking to you about  something15 that significantly affects others like me.  With16 your permission I'd like Ms. Lancast er from CIDNY17 to read the remainder of my test imony.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.19 MS. JENNIFER STEWART- PAGE:20 (Through Ms . Lancaster.) I am a fifty- three year21 old woman who was a Federal employee for  over22 sixteen years.23 From January 2001 to January24 2004, I worked for the Defense  Contract25 Management Agency as a contract  administrator.10 
1	1022 I find it very hard to survive3 with a fixed income and various  financial4 increases . The largest one happens to be the rent5 increase.6 After being diagnosed with7 sporadic ,  progressive,  degenerat ive spinal8 cerebellum ataxia, I'm unable to work any  longer.9 I moved into my current  studio10 apartment in the Queenswood Apartments	in March,11 2004. I received my first rent increase on  April12 1, 2005. My rent increased from $989 to $1073 .6113 per month.14 Recently I received a15 registration  form from Queenswood Apartments that16 stated that I paid a monthly rent of $1023 .61. I17 can only assume the difference of fifty  dollars18 per month between the aforement ioned amounts is19 due to the fact that I changed my annual lease  to20 a month- by- month contract. The change in my21 financial situation has negat ively impacted my22 life both socially and  economically.23 I cannot afford to either  clothe24 myself  or go to places  I once did.  Furthermore ,25 my children give me $200 a month so that I  can2 
2 meet my expenses.3 The only way I could resolve4 this situation was for me to agree to live  with5 my daughter, her husband and their two  children6 in Georgia.7	So next month, July, because of8 rent increases I have to move from New York  City9 to Georgia. Regrettably, due to  unaffordable10 housing, I am compelled again to leave New  York11 City to go to live wit h my daughter and her12 family.13 Gone will be the independence  I14 tried so hard to maintain, the City of New  York15 that I have come to love, the friends  and16 neighbors and the volunt eer work that helps me to17 give back to society.18 But I have no choice. I have  to19 move on.20 I am here today because I  know21 that many with disabil ities are experiencing a22 similar hardship and the problem seems  endless23 and they may not have the alternat ive I do.24 I hope there is some resolution25 to the probl em before it gets much larger.8 
2	Thank you.3	CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Thank you.4 (Audience part icipation. )5 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Question.6	Liz.7	MS. LUSSKIN:	Thanks very much8 for coming here today.9 It 's always very sad when people10 leave New York who have contributed so much  to11 the City and would continue to do  so.12 And one question I had is,  if13 the SCRIE program, the changes that are  being14 proposed now, had been in effect , would that have15 helped your part icular situation? I don' t mean in16 terms of your income limit , but  in terms of   the17 increases, would that have been able to keep  you18 where you are , or is this a problem that rent19 increases would have affected you  anyway?20 MS. JENNIFER STEWART- PAGE:21 Definitely.22 I find that the SCRIE program23 would be a wonderful asset for people  like24 myself , especially  in my  age group, because  I25 don' t think there are many, if any, programs out8 
2 there for people like the group who are disabl ed.3 We are kind of chopped out.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Queenswood is5 a rent stabilized  - - because  I know there is  a6 Queenswood Public Housing Project I think.  This7 is a rent stabilized building you live  in?8	MS. JENNIFER STEWART- PAGE:	I9 know my rent is supposed to be stabilized , but10 I'm not sure of others.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right. Okay.12 Thank you.13 Any addit ional quest ions?14 (No response .)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next18 speaker is James Peyton.19 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	My name is20 James Peyton. I spoke here a few years ago.  And21 I'm going to continue the same thing because  I22 believe it is necessary.23 There are many peopl e here that24 have legit imate problems, tenants. And I am a25 small landlord/owner.9 
2 But we cannot expect the3 landlord to bear the burdens of peopl e that4 cannot afford the rent.5	Now, let me say this. In6 Manhattan, Upper Manhattan, around say  139th7 Street , they've recently built the Pathmark8 Building there.9	THE REPORTER:	Speak louder .10 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	Okay.11 In Manhattan12 Loud enough?13 - - there has been recently  built14 a new Pathmark. Above the Pathmark there was  a15 big very large sign saying luxury  apartments,16 luxury in that area. And I think most of us  are17 familiar with  it .18 I 'm a small landlord/owner,  a19 small dwell ing owner. So my thing with this is20 how can the small landlord bear the burdens  of21 people that cannot afford the rent? It 's22 impossibl e. This is actually a destruction.23 In the same area there have been24 many small landlords destroyed. Where does  the25 property go? Pathmark owns part of it . Other big10 
2	businesses are coming in taking a part of  it.3	So when these people speak4 they may have legitimat e probl ems, I don't doubt5 that. But the fact of it is how many of them  can6 afford the luxury apartments.7 A VOICE:	None.8 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	Yes. Exactly9	right . None.10 Now, but the little guy like me11 we are pushed out . So where do you go?12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	That 's the14 quest ion. Let 's face it. That is the question.15 Let 's face it. Let 's face the question: what 's16 going to be done that should properly balance  it17 so that the small landlord can survive and  these18 people can survive?19 A VOICE:	Open your books.20 (Audience participat ion.)21 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Sir, sir,22 address us.2 3	MR. JAMES PEYTON:	Okay. Good.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You can25 respond to that.24 
2 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	Open the3 books. So let ' s look at that.4 We all know that gas has gone up5 tremendously. I don't believe anyone has went  to6 a gas station and asked them to open their  books.7 A VOICE:	We don' t have cars.8 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	Oh, you9	don't have cars.10 Food has gone up. I think we  do11 buy food. How many have gone to a store and  says12 let ' s show the books? No one.13 But here are poor landlords14 struggling and losing their buildings. And  all15 throughout Upper Manhattan it 's a fact. No one16 has said ,  hey, you know, anything  that is17 tangibl e in bringing about survival for the small18 landlord.19 Now, if we are going to look  at20 this and look at it sensibly, it is a diff icult21 task and I do understand your difficulty in  it22 because there are borderlines and I'm  familiar23 wi th them.24 But at the same time guys  like25 me have to survive. And  if I don' t survive ,  you10 
2	won' t - - they won' t either.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 Question. Where is your5 building?6	MR. JAMES PEYTON:	I beg your7	pardon?8	CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Where' s your9	building?10 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	Upper11 Manhattan.12 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	It 's one13 building?14 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	One15 building.16 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	And how many17 units?18 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	Eight units.19 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Eight units.20 Okay.21 Any other questions?22 Yes, Mr. Schleider.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you, Mr.24 Peyton, for your testimony.25 A quick question. If there was  a10 
2 broader  government  subsidy program  that would ,3 similar to the SCRIE, exempt the poor tenancy  in4 your neighborhood from building	increases, that5 the landlord could then offset other  expenses,6 would you and your other landlords in the area  be7 in favor of a program like that or  multiple8 programs l ike that , shifting the burden from9 those tenants most at risk back onto  the10 government	instead of onto your shoulders?11 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	SCRIE does12 have its values. But at the same time that  money13 does not come directly to the landlord. It  will14 go for taxes.15 Now, the small landlord has  need16 of finances for when bills are paid and gas  and17 taxes are up 18.5 percent. You see where I 'm18 coming from? He needs liquid money, money that  he19 can use for bringing about whatever is  necessary.20 And I myself don' t want to live21 in a shack and none of my tenants live in  a22 shack. The building	is well kept and I intend it23 to be that way.24 But I cannot cont inue to - - let25 me just quote, for exampl e. One of the  tenant ' s2 
2 rent is two hundred sixty some dollars. He' s been3 there since the building.4	MR. SCHLEIDER:	How large an5	apartment?6	MR. JAMES PEYTON:	He has a7 complete apartment , one- bedroom,  bath,8 everything .9 So where do we go from here?  And10 I 'm  trying to simplify  it  so you can really see11 what we are facing, that small landlords have  a12 problem . These people have a probl em. I 'm not13 going to say that they don' t.14 I 've worked for the City for15 twenty- eight years . I'm retired. So look at me. I16 have no other income. I mean it 's - - I don' t  want17 to lose a building.	I put a lot into it .18 So I have a problem. They have  a19 problem. And you have a  problem.20 And what are you going to  do21 about the problem?22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead . Ms.23 Lusskin.24 MS. LUSSKIN:	Mr. Peyton, I just25 want to say we heard testimony earlier that a  lot7 
2 of small owners don 't feel that we l isten and so3 it 's not worth coming down.4 But we do listen .5	MR. JAMES PEYTON :	Sorry . I  6 can't hear you.7 MS . LUSSKIN :	I'm sorry .8 We were told earlier that a  lot9 of the small owners feel it ' s not worth   their10 t ime coming down because we don't listen.11 I want to thank you for coming12 down . We do listen . The testimony of the small13 owners is very helpful and illuminates a lot  of14 things that we don't necessarily get from  the15 stat istical reports .16 So I just want to thank you  and17 I remember your testimony several years ago as 18	well.19 So thank you for coming.20 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	Thank you .21 May I just add one thing?22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Sure .23 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	That one24 thing would be this, and I know this is sort of 25	rough, but for one year 5 percent , two 8.19 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay .3 (Audience part icipat ion.)4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sharon5	Hightower.6	MS.  SHARON HIGHTOWER :	Good7	morning.8	My name is Sharon Hightower.  I9 am a consumer at the Center for Independence  of10 the Disabled of New York, also known as  CIDNY.11	I formerly worked for the12 Federal and New York City governments as  an13 Environmentalist ,  Census  Enumerator,  Examination14 Proctor and Mail Handler from 1980 through  2000.15 My career afforded me a comfortable  life.16 Unfort unat ely, the many tasks I did took their17 toll on my health . I am now trying to recover18 from the effec ts of Post Traumatic Stress19 Disorder,  Degenerative  Disk Disorder  and  skin 2 O	disorders.21 My fixed income barely meets  my22 basic needs. Out of $810 a month, I have to  pay23 out $760 for rent and now more than $40  for24 electricity because the landlord no  longer25 furnishes heat in the winter, although it  is21 
2 technically included in the rent . I have no money3 for clothes and other necessit ies.4 I am thankful for food stamps  of5 $147 per month even though I can barely  afford6 any meat. I run out of food money in two  weeks7 and so I have to go to soup  kitchens.8 When I renew my lease in five or9 six mont hs, where will the additional money for10 my rent increase come from?11	I have no one but myself to12 depend on for shelter . I tried having a roommate13 in the	'90s, but she stole my identity and credit14 cards and I had to get an order of  protection15 because she was physically  abusive.16 My health further declined as  a17 result of this experience. My credit history  was18 destroyed so I can't move into another  place.19 I am a forty-nine year old20 single female who needs to live in a place  where21 I also feel some degree of safety. My building  is22 not the best , but there are places that are much23 worse.24 People who are disabled and25 economically disadvantaged  are still human beings12 
2 and deserve to have affordable housing with  no3 further rent increases that are ridiculously  out4 of reach even for the working  class.5	Thank you for your attention.6	(Audience part icipation.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 Hal Brill .9 And then we' ll take a ten-minute10 recess after Mr. Brill to help the  stenographer.11 MS. SHARON HIGHTOWER:	Is there12 anything else that you would like to ask  me13 perhaps about this?14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I don't think15 so.16 MS. SHARON HIGHTOWER:	Are you17 sure? I just want you to know that I live in  the18 Bronx. That 's the reason why the rent is at this19 cost.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.21 That 's the reason what? I didn' t 2223 MS. LUSSKIN:	The rent is at24 this cost.25 Af t er Mr. Brill , we will take a23 
2 ten- minute recess until ten after twelve.3 Mr. Brill4	MR. HAL BRILL:	H ,  I5	I'm Hall Brill from Algamar6 (phonetic) Realty .7 And it 's no secret . You don't8 need a carnival barker to tell you that the  best9 deal in town is a rent stabilized  apartment.10 What? How can that be?11 Rents are supposed to rise  with12 the market , aren' t they?13 The whispers, the hushed14 remarks, what 's going on here? Sssh! Sssh! A rent15 stabilized apartment  is becoming  available.  It ' s16 a steal! Grab it.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is this a18 play?19 MR. HAL BRILL:	What ' s that?20 It ' s just a little speech I made.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.22 MR. HAL BRILL:	It certainly is23 a steal.24 How did this happen?25 It happened because there is  no6 
2 low rent supplement. It happens because  the3 increases year after year do not even keep  up4 with expenses. Forget about any sense of  market5 forces.6 Why are landlords  subsidizing7 tenants? Why do the tenants who live in  our8 buildings the longest have the lowest  rents9 regardl ess of their abil ity to pay? Because the10 rent increases are too low.11 They've always been too  low.12 These are the facts on the13 ground year after year, meeting after meeting.  We14 need higher guideline increases now . We need to15 increase the increases.16 Thank you for your t ime.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 (Audience participation.)19MR. LUBELL:	Where is your20building?21CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where' s your22building?23MR. HAL BRILL:	West Side of24Manhattan.25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One building
2	or - -3	MR . HAL BRILL:	One building.4 And all the apartments are either rent stabil ized5 or rent controll ed. I have no decontrolled6 apartments.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How many8	units?9	MR. HAL BRILL:	Twenty- eight .10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Twenty- eight.11 Okay. Thank you.12 Actually we will take one  more13 before we go into recess.14 Regina Shanley, are you here?15 MS. REGINA SHANLEY:	Yes .16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.
1718 afternoon.
MS. REGINA SHANLEY:	Good
19 My name is Regina Shanley. I 'm a20 rent stabilized tenant in the  Sunnyside/Woodside21 section of Queens.22 $666 , some people  can spend that23 amount on a dinner with wine at a  good24 restaurant . Some people can buy a suit with it.25 Most people I know wouldn' t buy either of those18 
2 but could spend it easily on just everyday  items.3 I'm on Social Security4 Disability. I receive $666 a month to live  on.5	Even with food stamps and6 Medicaid that is almost impossible. It is  a7 constant struggle.8	It frustrates me. It angers me9 and it embarrasses me to come here every year  and10 talk about my financial situation. Except it  is11 not just my situat ion. There are thousands of12 people on disability with the same probl em.13 It seems as if no one cares.14 Politicians pay lip service to want ing to help ,15 but do nothing. When Mayor Bloomberg  campaigned16 for office, he said he was in favor of  passing17 SCRIE for people on disability. Af ter he was18 elected, he flip- flopped and is now against it .19 The Rent Guidelines Board  hears20 me and other tenants talk about the diff iculty of21 paying steadily increasing rents, but just  keeps22 passing them.23 What may seem like minor24 increases in prices to some peopl e have a major25 impact on many people, myself  included.9 
2 Right now after I pay rent  and3 utilit ies I have about $35 to $40 a month . With a4 four percent	increase in rent , this will become5 about $10 to $15. I don't know how I will be  able6 to see my doctors or brush my teeth  with7 toothpaste . And I ' l l have to give up flossing . I8 won' t be able to call my mother who is ill and9 l ives in Seattle.10 So whil e I am frustrated , angry11 and embarrassed  speaking about  it ,  I will12 continue to because I am fight ing for my13 survival.14 I hope this year you members  of15 the Rent Guidelines Board will listen,  will16 realize the impact you truly have on many  lives17 and will vote for a rent freeze .18 Thank you.19 (Audience participation. )20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The proposed21 legislation on extending SCRIE to the  disabled22 would cover you; is that  correct?23 MS. REGINA SHANLEY:	Yes, it24 would .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.2 
1	1212	Thank you.3	Okay. We will be in recess until4	ten after twelve. It 's now twelve o'clock.5	(At 12:00 o'clock noon there was6	a recess in the proceedings.)7	(At 12:15 o'clock p. m. the8	proceedings were resumed.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next10	speaker is Antonio Crassides. Are you  here?11	Antonio Crassides?12 MR. ANTONIO CRASSIDES:	Yes.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.14 Crassides, go ahead.15 You don' t have to start . We are16 going to get the Board Members here. Hold on  one17 second.18 Following Mr. Crassides will  be19 Vajra Kilgour. Okay. Those are the two:  Mr.20 Crassides and then Vajra Kilgour. And then  I'll21 announce more names.22 You can start . The Board  Members23 are filing in.24 MR. ANTONIO  CRASSIDES:	I 'm the25 owner of a six- family house in Woodside, Queens.12 
1	1222	Out of six apartments,  three3 peopl e , three tenants, didn' t pay me  the rent4 yet . I have to wait unt il the end of the month to5 get paid.6 How am I going to pay my7 expenses? I have to pay gas, I have to  pay8 electric , I have to pay  the plumbers,  the9 electricians. I don' t even afford to have a10 super. I do it myself . I'm seventy- seven years11 old. I have to clean up always the garbage  which12 the tenants, they don' t even have the respect to13 recycle, I mean the recycles from the  garbage.14 Therefore, I have to go through it because I  took15 tickets, violations  from the City of New York16 because in my neighborhood  the Sanitat ion17 Department goes through the bags and they see  if18 there are any recycles. I got two tickets  for19	$50.20 I cannot afford this. I don't21 blame the tenants. I mean they have the  right2 2	too, like	but I mean what about me?2 3	I invested in this house for  so24 many houses. How will I survive? That 's the25 answer I would like from you  people.24 
2CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Why are these3tenants payingyou at the end of the month?4Because5MR. ANTONIO CRASSIDES:	Because6they said thatthey cannot afford it.7CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	This is true8every month orjust this month?9MR. ANTONIO CRASSIDES:	Every10month.11MR.LUBELL:Where isyour12building,sir?13MR.ANTONIOCRASSIDES:It ' s in14Woodside.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Woodside.16 And these units are rent17 stabilized?18 MR. ANTONIO CRASSIDES:	Rent19 stabilized. I even have a SCRIE tenant  over20 there , SCRIE tenant. She has - - somebody - -  she21 rents a room to a tenant , a friend of hers, and22 she pays her a certain amount of money. A  SCRIE23 tenant.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So she has a25 boarder or something?15 
2 MR . ANTONIO CRASSIDES:	A3 boarder, right.4 For - - that 's all I have to say.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.6	Schleider.7	MR. SCHLEIDER:	What are the 8 rents in your building that you are  charging9 these tenants?10 MR. ANTONIO  CRASSIDES:	See , I 11	have - - the most is $1000 - -  $1100.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And how large of13 an apartment is that?14 MR. ANTONIO CRASSIDES:	Excuse15 me?16 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	How large - -17 MR. ANTONIO CRASSIDES:	It 's a18 two- bedroom.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Two- bedroom.20 Most of the21 MR. ANTONIO CRASSIDES:	I22 have  - - out of the six apartments  I have three23 preferent ial rents because if they are too high I24 cannot afford  - -  I mean  I cannot rent higher.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And the lowest12 
1	1252	rent you have?3	MR. ANTONIO CRASSIDES:	The4	lowest rent is $367.5	MR. SCHLEIDER:	The ones who6 have diff iculty paying you each month, where7 would those rents be?8	MR. ANTONIO CRASSIDES:	Excuse9	me?10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Those rents are11 where? The low end or the upper end , the ones12 that have diff iculty paying you each month?13 MR. ANTONIO CRASSIDES:	I mean14 one is around  $1100 - - the ones that are   about15 $1000. One has $1011 and the other one is  $1012,16 something like that.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So even though18 you mark rents up as high you think you can,  if19 someone is willing to rent at that level , they20 still can't make  that rent .21 MR. ANTONIO CRASSIDES:	They22 cannot pay  the rent , yes.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So you are not24 able to collect large increases on  those25 MR. ANTONIO CRASSIDES:	I1  m10 
1	1262 telling you, I mean there are three  apartments3 that they cannot collect. I had to take  one4 apartment , one tenant to the court because she5 wouldn' t pay me the rent for three months. I had6 to wait every month to pay a certain amount  of7 money for arrears first to pay the  rent.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any9	addit ional questions?10	(No response. )11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 MR. ANTONIO CRASSIDES:	Thank13 you.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Vajra15 Ki lgour. Are you here?16 (No response.)17 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	All right . We18 will call the name again because she didn' t come19 back  from the break yet .20 Faith Steinberg.21 MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	Good22 afternoon.2 3	One of the wise Greek24 philosophers,	I don't remember which  one , said25 that we can judge a society by the way it  treats24 
2 its elderly, its children and its infirm. I  think3 that many of the Panel Members would get very  low4 grades.5	At the open hearings in May  I6 could not believe that I heard one of  the7 landlord members, and he knows who he is,  say8 that landlords are not welfare agencies,  or9 something to that effect.10 First , it is not only  welfare11 recipients who are clamoring for  affordable12 rents . Working  middl e class and lower- income13 peopl e are in need of housing.14 Secondly, it is common  knowledge15 that young peopl e corning out of college have to16 move in with their parents.17 Also, art ists who want to take18 in what' s left of this great City' s vitality and19 who have helped make this a great City are  unable20 to afford to live here.21 Our Mayor thinks that he has to22 go to great lengths and open unnecessary  stadiums23 to bring business to the City and create jobs.  By24 building affordable building, businesses  would25 come to the City and that would  create6 
  2 construction and long - term jobs. I guess  that 's3 just too simple and reasonabl e for our City4 planners .5 I would like to remind and6 stress to the majority of the panel that  housing7 is a basic necessity of life. Your votes  reflect8 a lack of understanding of this very vital issue .9 We are not dealing with10 merchandise	and prof it margins. We are dealing11 wit h real l ive human beings who deserve better12 understanding and , heaven forfend, maybe a little13 compassion.14 I would also like to thank the15 panel for the exorbi tant rent increase which now16 makes me eligibl e for SCRIE. But I am having a17 struggle with my landlord , who has contempt not18 only for the tenants but for the law as well ,19 just to obtain the necessary  leases.20 And I would also like to comment 21	on the stories of these poverty- stricken small22 landlords. No system is going to  accommodate23 everybody. But it seems to me that there are  more24 peopl e needing affordabl e housing than there are25 small landlords.22 
1	1292 And if my landlord is an exampl e3 of a small landlord , he has six buildings that be4 bought on the Upper West Side in the 1950s  and5 '60s. He is now a billionaire. He is so poor  he6 had to buy a home in  Westchester.7 So I think that the Board  should8 be thinking of the greater good. There are  more9 people in need of housing than there are  poor10 landlords who can always get hardship claims  if11 they really wanted to.12 They say, they complain it 's13 very hard to get a hardship claim. It should  be14 hard. Why should it be made  easy?15 Thank you.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 (Audience part icipation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We do have a19 question. Mr. Lubell has a  question.20 MR. LUBELL:	I'm being accused21 of making a statement that I didn' t make. I22 finally want to set the record straight. I  quoted23 a leading  tenant  representative , Timothy  Collins,24 who said you're not a welfare agency and  I25 recognize  that .2 
1	1302 So when I made the statement , I3 made it very clear that I was quoting a  tenant4 representative who had made that statement .5	MS. FAITH STEINBERG :	Mr.6 Lubell , I didn' t mention  any names and that  is7 not what I heard.8 Thank you.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. That 's10 okay. That ' s fine.11 Mr. Collins did say that when  he12 testified at our private hearing.13 Daniel Andrejczuk.14 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCZUK:	I don't15 know if I should repeat my name again. I can  do16 that . Daniel Andrejczuk, a landlord, an owner.17 I would like to just refresh  to18 all of us that tenants and landlords we  are19 facing lifetime increase, cost of living .20 Wherever we go, we see prices  higher.21 And as a landlord we feel  this22 especially . For example, for oil to heat and23 provide hot water, at the same time last year  I24 had to pay for oil No. 2 $1.35 and today  same25 del ivery for per gallon is $2.10 . So you see6 
1	1312 seventy- five cents is different in payment .3 Electricity  came up , repairs,4 insurance, real estate taxes. Water and  sewerage,5 for example , I received  last year $2 , 859. Just6 yesterday I received bill to pay this year  water7 and sewerage $3 , 168.8 And rent , what can you do if you9 have tenants that pay $396, $155.50? You can  do10 so much.11 And we need really increase.  For12 the last five years the landlords/owners,  they13 were neglected by the panel , by the City. We14 didn' t have proper increase .15 Therefore ,  I believe  that you16 will take into consideration that the price  of17 oil is raising constantly and will not be  lower .18 And we may pay  - -  it may happen that we may  pay19 wintertime $3 .00 or more per gallon . How can we20 get money from them?21 The landlords, we don't have22 subsidy from the City like tenants. They have  so23 many agencies, so many programs to get help  to24 pay rent , but no help for the landlords who have25 to do it on our own.2 
2 This is business. We have  to3 maintain our business.4 And I understand the  tenants,5 they  - -  some of them you heard  them complaining6 that they were working for so many years and  they7 have so and so, only pension.	I understand it 's8 true. But what did they do? What did they do  the9 years? Did they thought  - - were they thinking   in10 the front , ahead , what kind of future will  be11 when they get older?12 I was working seven days a week13 only and I 'm still working seven days a week14 only. My workday is twenty hours, sometimes  even15 more. And I don' t complain to no one because16 that ' s the real ity to run my building.  I have to17 subsidize. I have to work on the side to  keep18 building running.19 My building is a very hot  area.20 The apartments, l ike I just mentioned , on the21 free market , $2100 ,  $2300. And  small owners are22 disappearing in this neighborhood day- by- day.23 They' re coming bigger.  They built  a lot of  - - you24 heard that 's a very hot spot ,25 Williamsburg/Greenpoint , which they're rezoning2 
2 right now. The prices  - - unbelievabl e for  prices,3 for properties.4	And the small landlord,  they5	cannot afford to keep it up.6	Therefore, I'm asking and I'm7 telling I believe that this year it will refer  to8 two sides, if the rent increase will be for  one9 year lease renewal 6.5 percent , for two years,10 9.5 percent.11 (Audience participat ion.)12 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCZUK:	And13 also I propose that there will be surcharge  for14 every rent below $900 on renewal , one year lease15 wi ll be surcharge $30 and two-year lease renewal16 $45.00 surcharge.17 Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Wait.19 How many units do you have?20 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCZUK:	Eight21 units.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' re in23 Williamsburg/Greenpoint?24 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCZUK:	Yes.25 MR. PAGAN:	Where in7 
2	Williamsburg?3	MR. DANIEL ANDREJCZUK:	Excuse4	me?5 MR. PAGAN:	Where?6 MR . DANIEL ANDREJCZUK:	North7	side.8 MR. PAGAN:	What ' s the address?9 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCZUK:	It 's10 around 50th, north side.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank12 you . Thank you, sir.13 (Audience part icipat ion. )14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is Vajra15 Kilgour here?16 Thank you, sir.17 Did she come back? Yes. Okay .18 How are you doing?19 MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	I've been20 better .21 As you recall , last year I  put22 my lunch into evidence but I can't do that  this23 year because I have stomach troubl e and I can't24 afford the medicine.	So I have to keep some food25 in here.10 
1	1352 But you wouldn' t want lunch3 anyway. It ' s very small and  extremely4 unint erest ing. It ' s the best I can do.5 But I wonder how you manage  to6 keep voting  these  increases. Anybody  - - the7 lowest increase anybody could have gotten as  a8 percentage over the last three years is  79 percent. Other peopl e have paid 10 percent. Now10 you are looking to add even more .11 You look at the statistics that12 come out about families that have $30 a week  per13 family member left over after - - is it a month or14 a week?  - - after they've paid the rent. And   I15 wonder, well , does that just not seem real to16 you? Does that seem like - - well , that can't   be17 real. That 's not even like half a dinner. That18 can't be real . People can't be living on that.19 So we vote to lower that to  $25.20 That won' t be real either. It 's just a statistic.21 I don' t understand what22 mot ivates you to do this, you know. A couple of23 years ago Mr. Lubell said very angrily, well , I24 was very poor, I grew up in the Bronx and I  was25 really poor.2 
1	1362 And then I think, well , maybe he3 really just hates his family. Maybe that 's why4 he' s devoted a lifetime to injuring peopl e just5 like them, l iving in circumst ances just l ike6 theirs.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You know, we8 don' t need any ad hominem comments . We really9 don' t .10 So, pl ease , just address the11 Board. You don' t need to address individuals.12 You' re not helping your case by addressing13 individuals in a derogatory  fashion.14 MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	Well ,15 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	You' re not .16 You' re not.17 MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	Okay. Okay.18 Okay.19 But I think - - but I don' t think20 it ' s part icularly him because I think - -21CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Well , you22mentionedhim.23MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	All right.24Let me make my point .25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You can
1	1372 address your point in the abstract , anything you3 want .4 MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	You' re5 taking up my t ime, Marvin.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' ll give7 you the extra time.8 MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	All right.9 I'll address the entire Board  then.10 I mean basically all of us,11 saving our native ancestry, came	people came12 to this country and they were lucky if they  had13 the clothes on their backs and were not in  some14 condit ion of servitude or other.15 And I wonder, you know, how  you16 can sort of side with the people who  then17 proceeded to exploit them to the max . You know,18 what  is that? I don' t get it. I don't get  it.19 I mean I think it's a kind of20 tragedy of lack - - it ' s not just lack of  human21 solidarity, but lack of family solidarity  to22 think that you would side with the same  people23 basically who exploited all of us, you know,  one24 time or another.25 And I don' t - - I think that all2 
2 the peopl e here  - - I mean if the peopl e here3 would stand up that have been injured by  these4 rent  increases over the years  - -  everybody who5 has been injured by these rent increases over  the6 years.7 (Audience participation. )8	MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	Are they9	real to yourselves? They look real to me .10 The majority of them aren' t here11 because they're working the two and three jobs  to12 try to pull together that  rent.13 There was a misstatement , and  I14 won' t say who said it , since you said not to be15 ad hominem, but there was  a misstatement	with16 regard to tenants not being here because they  are17 not so distressed  about the  rent .18 The tenants aren' t here because19 they're working. It 's a complete reversal of what20 happens with the landlords . Among the landlords,21 the small landlords come, they give you test imony22 that is, quote unquote, helpful. I don' t know how 23	helpful it is to say there is somebody  paying24 $250 in his building when that person is  either25 rent controll ed , which you have no control over,24 
2 or they are a hundred and thirteen years old  and3 they're on SCRIE. So he' s gett ing the tax break.4	But if there is a rent5 controlled person paying $200, some odd  dollars,6 then either the person hasn' t appl ied for the7 increases or there are too many violations  in8 their building.9 That testimony is helpful  only10 for the purposes of orchestrating a self -11 deception around what it is that you are  really12 doing.13 The rich landlords, the14 landlords that actually  - - what 's at stake here15 is the new BMW for the managing agent , which is16 the level in between. They're not here. They' re17 not here.18 These other landlords can19 absolutely get a hardship increase. It 's20 disingenuous to imagine that somehow they' ll be21 injured by a rent freeze. All they have to do  is22 open their books, they get a hardship  increase.23 I don't get , you know, this24 level of self - decept ion and this lack of any25 sense of the reality of the impact of this  on5 
2	millions of people .3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to4 wrap up.5 Thank you.6 (Audience part icipation.)7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Roberta8 Bernstein, followed by Adele Bender, followed  by9 James Anderson.10 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Good11 afternoon.12 I first want to say that this  is13 probably the most civil meeting that I 've seen  in14 all the years that I've been attending. And  I15 thank you . I really believe that you are16 listening to what peopl e have to say and it17 really is appreciated.18 And before I start my  testimony,19 I need to correct some data that Jimmy  Silber,20 Vice President of the Small Property Owners  of21 New York, gave you. I believe that Betty  asked22 him how many members we had and he said  two23 hundred and fifty. And when he told me that , I24 said, oh, my God , Jimmy, how could you possibly.25 No, we have about 1, 000 members and that is the8 
2 real figure and it has been that figure .3 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.4	MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	And I5 am Roberta Bernstein, President of the  Small6 Property Owners of New York. And my owners  are7 the small guys that are going to be very  impacted8 by the guidelines you are going to  pass.9	We are the guys that are in10 trouble, at risk.11 One of the factors in the12 guidel ines that weighed very minimally was the13 real estate tax. You know, I don't know what  the14 populat ion of the buildings was that was included15 in that final one percent. But for most  owners16 the actual dollars they are paying in real  estate17 tax represent  -  I know this is true for me  -  4018 to 48 percent of the total rent  roll.19 And pol itical pressures forced20 City Council. I was well aware of the  behind-21 the- scenes machinations	that forced a lot of City2 2	Council people who were opposed to that  182 3	percent hike a couple of years ago to vote  for24 it .25 But some of the very same people24 
2 come here and ask you not to pass your  rent3 increases.4 We are really up against a  very5 difficult wall right now. The City Council  passed6 a lead law which really seems more punitive  to7 owners than curat ive towards lead paint . And8 there is no calculation to allow for the  very9 high cost of abatement .10 So if an owner has, say, a11 bottoml ine of $20,000, $14,000 more a year to pay12 in real estate tax, another $10,000 needed  to13 abate lead in a part icular apartment	- and, by14 the way, another $6 , 000 to $10,000 in fuel oil   -15 what is he to do?16 I have some suggestions which17 may be strange and probably beyond your  purview.18 Can you pet ition City Council to19 set aside funds for owners to borrow against  and20 pay an interest rate to abate lead paint , or21 perhaps have the City Council buy bulk oil  so22 that the owner who doesn' t have enough rent money23 to pay for that oil for his tenants, that he  can24 then buy that oil from the City with no  penalty?25 I bel ieve you are not seeing a2 
2 lot of owners here today because truly  the3 feedback that I 've gotten from my members is they4 don' t think that it 's really going to help.5 And tenant leaders will tell  you6 that the low rent adjustment was a poor tax.   It ' s7 anything but . The data has  shown that  those8 tenants who occupy low- rent apartments are not9 necessarily impecunious. They are just very,  very10 lucky.11 So you really have a very,  very12 hard job, as usual , ahead of you to balance the13 needs of the very poor tenants who, by the  way,14 the government should absolutely help , and to15 help those of us who are really a  shrinking16 ent ity who supply the affordable, decent , safe17 housing of New York and to live in it and be  part18 of our neighborhoods.19 Thank you so much.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any21 quest ions?22 Yes. Mr. Schleider has a23 quest ion.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for25 your testimony . And the strategic oil reserve2 
2 concept is quite interesting.3 Can you or any of your members4 maybe bring up any other types of plans  that5 could be used as a safety net for landlords  that6 the government should work on, should enact ,7 pet ition City Council?8	MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	I will9 have a brainstorming	session with my most active10 members and we will be very, very happy to  get11 that to you within a few weeks.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You think13 that 's a viable stopgap measure or it could be14 the long - term solution to have broader municipal15 subsidies for landlords when the tenants  can't16 meet their rent payments?17 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Yes. I18 think that something like a rent stamp would  be19 in order. Certainly there are a lot of  tenants20 who do need help , unlike  - -  I hate to say this21 because  it sounds bad , but  I know a lot of22 tenants who are test ifying here today are no23 longer working due to a physical disability  or24 whatever other reason. I know of owners who  are25 crippled who go to work.9 
1	1452 Maybe it ' s work ethnic. I don' t3 know. But the bottomline	is, yes, there should be4 subsidies for the poor tenants who cannot  afford5 rent for whatever reason.6 We need - - I don' t personally7 believe in a lot of government intervention.  But8 I do believe in government with a heart  when9 necessary. So there should be some safety  net10 someplace.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Lusskin.12 MS. LUSSKIN:	Has SPONY taken a13 position on the extension of SCRIE to  the14 disabled and the increase in the income  tax15 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Not16 formally. May I say personally that I think it 's17 a wonderful	idea.18 MS. LUSSKIN:	Well , it would be19 helpful on this issue if perhaps SPONY  spoke20 officially.21 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Well ,22 usually we work by consensus of  committee.23 But , as I say, I 'm going to call24 a special committee meeting	for this purpose, for25 ideas to present perhaps to City Council to  ease12 
2 the burden of owners and t enants alike because I3 think we are in this together, tenants and  the4 owners. Both want the same thing for the  most5 part .6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 Any other questions?8 Mr. Pagan.9 Go ahead , Ms. Adams.10 MR. PAGAN:	You go first .11 MS. ADAMS:	The matter before12 the City Council , have you done that before or13 this is something that you are going to  do?14 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	I15 thought  I would ask you to do  it .16 I have met with City Council  on17 various issues and they have been very, very  good18 to me and l istened , but  it doesn' t go anywhere ,19 at least in this City Council.20 MR. PAGAN:	Thank you for your21 presentation.22 Just a quick. You brought up  a23 couple of good ideas. And I 'm wondering have you24 approached HPD in reference to the  oil?25 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	No.10 
2 Actually it occurred to me as I was writ ing my3 speech.4	MR. PAGAN:	Okay.5 And the other one was from  the6 lead paint because my understanding is that  you7 have some responsibil ity under the lead -based8 paint bill that should be discussed.  Maybe9 economic	(unintelligible) like SPONY probably  in10 better shape.11 But the other issue that  comes12 up and maybe within SPONY where you  could13 borrow	where a fund could be set aside  for14 emergency issues where , similar to what Action15 does - and let me explain what  it is - where    two16 or three owners get together and  guarantee17 somebody' s borrowing	from that part icular issue.18 Those are ideas that are  out19 there. Maybe like looking at different  ideas,20 probably set up funds to do that for  that21 part icular issue.22 Because I think it 's a great23 idea. We have done that in  my neighborhood	for24 tenant associat ions where we set up what we call25 building survival funds for when they do  have5 
2some probl em, you couldlend them and they would3pay back. Mostly it wasoil delivery in the4wintertime so that theycould pay that .5 But what we did within  the6 organization, and maybe the organization is  the7 best place to have that rather than the  City.8	MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Where9	do you get the funds from?10 MR. PAGAN:	In our case we11 fundraise for that.12 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	I see.13 Because I must tell you a secret . We have a hard14 time getting our members to pay their dues,  which15 are minimal .16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Zelnik.17 MR. ZELNIK:	Just one more18 comment in terms of that brainstorming	session19 you are planning. I hope that you might  include20 as an agenda item the issue of how the  Rent21 Guidelines Board might address the small  property22 owner in terms of building type or size, if  that23 could be part of your discussion.24 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	That25 old quest ion. Okay. Yes. Absolut ely.10 
1	1492	Thank you very, very much.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 Adele Bender.5 (Audience participation. )6 MS. ADELE BENDER:	Okay.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on one8 second.9 Will be followed by James10 Anderson,  followed by Jason Haber.11 Okay, Ms. Bender. Good to  see12 you again.13 MS. ADELE BENDER:	I'm back as14 they say.15 Adele Bender from JPAC,  Joint16 Public Aff airs Committee for Older Adults, a17 member of the Older Women' s League and various18 tenant organizations.19 I always write up the testimony20 and  I change it because	- - according to the21 things I hear.22 They seem to be addressing  SCRIE23 a lot , which is one of the things that the Joint24 Public Aff airs Committee for Older Adults has25 certainly been lobbying for both in Albany and  in8 
1	1502	this City.3	And what I do understand , and4 I 've been hearing from many of the seniors,5 especially one woman that I even spoke  to6 yesterday, a senior citizen in her eighties,  it7 seems that the Department for the Aging, there  is8 a big backlog of applications for SCRIE. So  in9 the meantime the increases keep coming  through10 and these people are waiting to get  their11 applications processed.12 And there seems, as I say, to  be13 a big backlog on it. Somebody had just told  me14 there' s been a lot of reshuffling down there and15 maybe  that ' s one of the reasons.16 But in the meantime these17 elderly people and vulnerable people have to  keep18 paying increase upon increase. And maybe if  you19 peopl e would l ike to help us and see what you20 could do for these people to see that the  process21 is being speeded up.22 I also understand that Betsy23 Gotbaum, our Public Advocat e , is trying to24 promote some type of legislation to speed up  this25 process. You know, it' s very, very important .
