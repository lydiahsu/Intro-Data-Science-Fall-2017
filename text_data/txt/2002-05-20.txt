I am5	Cairman of the New York City Rent Guidelines6 Board.7 I would like to welcome you  all8 to this public meeting of the Guidelines  Board9 where we' re going to attempt to promulgate10 draft guidelines for a series of  issues11 including  rent - stabilized  apartments, loft12 guidelines and rent - stabilized hotels.13 This is one in a series  of14 hearings and meetings.15 Today is a preliminary vote,  as16 I indicated , on May  20, 2002.17 We expect to have a public18 meeting where we will take some  invited19 testimony on June 4, 2002.	That will be in the20 morning at 9:30 at the Department of  City21 Planning.22 Then we will have a full- day23 public hearing taking public testimony on   June24 26, 2002.

VISSER:	Good evening.21 Those of you that have  agendas,22 the Board is first going to look at  proposed23 guidelines for rent - stabilized apartments.	The24 Board will be looking at the adjustments  for25 one and two-year renewal  guidelines.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2 The renewal increases  for3 apartments have been adopted since 1968  and4 they have ranged from 2 percent  for a one- year5 lease and 4 percent for a two-year lease to  116 percent for a one-year lease and 14 percent   for7 a two-year lease over the 30 -plus year history.8 The last amount adopted for  one9 and two-year renewal guidelines was for 410 percent for a one- year lease and 6 percent  for11 a two- year lease last year in Order No. 33 .12 The Board will also look at  the13 vacancy allowance, which has been adopted   from14 1968 to 1996.	Since 1997 the Board has  not15 adopted its own vacancy  allowance.16 The vacancy allowance has  ranged17 from 5 percent to 15 percent.	The last time18 the Board adopted a vacancy allowance was  in19 1996, Order No. 28, and that was 9  percent.20 The next item the Board  will21 look at is the  supplemental adjustment.	That22 was first adopted  in 1983.	And it was adopted23 from 1983 to '89 and from '94  to 2000.	The low24 rent supplement has ranged from $10 on  rents25 of $200 or less up to an adjustment of $15   onROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2 apartments renting for $500 or  less.3 The last time the Board  adopted4 a low- rent supplement was in Owner No. 32 in5 2001, and that was $15 on apartments  renting6 for $500 or less.7 The next item will be the8 minimum rent , which was first adopted in 19999 and last adopted in 2000.	And that was a10 provision that raised rents to $215 after  all11 adjustments had been  applied.12 The last  time , again,  the Board13 adopted that was in 2000 in Order 32 , and that14 was $215 minimum rent.15 Finally, the Board for,  under16 rent - stabilized apartments, the Board will look17 at a sublet allowance, which is a provision  that18 allows an additional allowance when an19 apartment  is sublet.20 That was first adopted in  1997,21 last  adopted in 2001.	It 's ranged from O22 percent in 1999 to 10  percent.23 And the last time the  Board24 adopted a sublet allowance it was in Order  No.25 33 , and it was  10 percent.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2 And then we will move  forward3 with lofts and hotels.
45	of order.6
MR. PAGAN:	Mr. Chairman, pointI just want to know how long  do
7 we have to speak - - how much time we have    to8 speak when we' re making a motion?9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Firstly, I10 don' t see any limit to the Board members,11 although I may give you a nudge at some  point.12 But I am happy to have the Board members   speak13 as long as it takes if they feel they  have14 something useful to add.15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.17 I guess, do we have anyone  who18 wishes to offer a motion?19 Mr. Castellano.20 MR. CASTELLANO:	At least we' re21 operating on the assumption that we' re going  to22 get an opportunity to go first this year since23 historically the owners and  tenants24 (Audience participation.)25 MR. CASTELLANO:	- - historically ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2	the owners and the tenants have traded  going
3 first at the preliminary hearings.4 we didn' t go first.
Last year
5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	As I6	understand it , the informal rule	it doesn' t7 make a difference to me	the informal rule is8 almost like the kickoff at a football  game.9 You flip a coin.	Whoever goes first has a10 right to go first.	Whoever' s turn it is has the11 right to go first.12 So I am told , based on that13 precedent , that the tenants have the right to14 go first and ceded that right to the  owner15 reps.16 Would the owner reps like  to17 take them up on that?18 Or else we can go to public
19 reps. 2021	receive? 2223
MR. LUBELL:	They've elected toCHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Correct.MR. LUBELL:	So we' re prepared

24	to kickoff . 25
But supplement ing Mr.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.
521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2	Castellano' s motion, we have traditionally3 spoken for a limited amount  of time.	And we4 are prepared to do that.	And I think that5 changing the game plan at this time would  put6 us at an unfair, in an unfair  position.7	We were prepared to speak, as  we8 have traditionally,	for approximately 209 minutes.10 So I suspect that rather  than11 have one side filibust er when another side,12 where we could if - -13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I think, I14 will try to be fair and make sure  everybody15 gets the right minut es.16 But I think if you guys want  to17 go first , 20 minutes seems ample time to make18 the arguments.19 I would urge others who make20 arguments to be as concise and as pithy  as21 possible.22 MR. CASTELLANO:	In that case,23 with your permission,	I would go first.	I will24 try to be pithy, whoever he might  be.25 There are certain - -ROY ALLEN &   ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
1234 have objection.
11CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Concise.MR. CASTELLANO:	Well , now we
5 There are certain misconceptions6 that have been perpetuated here because it 's in7 the best interest of some people to do  so.8 For example, we' re not raising9 rent or talking about raising rents on  one10 million rent - stabilized apartments.	That is11 not true.12 There are hundreds of  thousands13 of rent - stabilized apartments right now at14 preferent ial rents.	In other words, at market15 rents.	What we do here today and again in  June16 will have no impact on the rents paid for  those17 apartments.18 I have heard incessant  testimony19 that the PIOC, the price index of  operating20 costs, is the key factor in determining  rent21 increases.	Tenant advocates have said it , so22 it must be true.23 I notice they didn' t say it last24 year when the PIOC was  8.7 percent.	Last year25 they created a different argument and the  rentROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
1	122 increase was only 4 percent.3 Tenant advocates this year have4 become schizophrenic .	They give us a dozen5 reasons why the PIOC is a flawed measure  and6 demand that it must  be discarded.	Yet , they7 use it as the primary justificat ion for  lower8 guidelines.9 I guess mathemat ical consistency10 is too much to ask for.11 The PIOC is a useful12 measurement , but it is limited.	The13 fundamental assumption of the PIOC is that " If14 everything else is held constant , " then  a15 change in prices will predict ultimately  a16 change in costs.17 That is the theory.	But we know18 that everything else is not held  constant.19 For example, Local Laws 11  and20 38 prescribe new ways to do  all jobs.	So by21 definition everything was not held constant   and22 the fundamental assumptions of the PIOC  start23 to break down.24 In fact , every year government25 dictat es new and ever more expensive ways to  doROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2	old jobs for the benef it of the public health3 or safety or political advantage and that  also4 attacks the fundamental assumpt ions of the5 PIOC.6 The weakness of the PIOC is7 illustrated perfectly this year.	The PIOC8 suggests a rent decrease in a period where  the9 consumer price index is 2 and a half  percent.10 And real incomes of tenants, real incomes  of11 tenants were up 6 percent.12 (Audience part icipation.)13 MR. CASTELLANO:	Those are the14 statist ics.	Chuckling doesn' t change the
15 facts. 1617 is falling.18 this morning. 19
   The PIOCs says the price of oil Yet , I spent $1.59 for gasolineThe PIOC says insurance is  going
20 up 16 percent , when we know that it has gone up21 34 percent  since January.22 The major components of  the23 PIOC  - taxes, administration,	insurance  - each24 show the largest increases in more than  a25 decade.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2 The core PIOC measures  the3 change in prices of the nonenergy related  items4 property owners buy.	It represents 75 percent5 of the total market basket of goods  and6 services.7	From 1994 to 1999, in those six8 years the core PIOC varied between 2 and  39 percent.10 In five of those six years  the11 first year rent increase was just 2 percent ,12 the lowest increases in the 30 -year history of13 the Board.14 Since then the core PIOC  has15 broken through the resistance level , as16 technical analysts might say.	In 2000 it was17 3.8 percent , the highest  since 1993 .	In 200118 it was 4 percent , the highest since 1992.19 This year it is 5.4 percent and next year  it20 is forecast to be 5.2  percent.21 The conclusion is inescapable  to22 anyone who wants to look at the facts and  not23 the polit ics.	The core PIOC is broken out  of24 its boundary area.	It is increasing and that25 increase is accelerating.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
 2 For the past two years  this3 Board has authorized first -year increases of  44 percent.	The case for larger increases  this5 year is bett er than it was for the last two6 years.	Sensible increases are needed this  year7 to acknowledge this long- term statistical8 trend.9 My colleague will follow up,  Mr.
10 Chair. 11
MR. LUBELL:	I just want to
12 emphasize some of the points that Vince  made.13 First ,  addressing  my fellow14 members of the Board, costs are not the same   as15 prices.	We all know that your costs can  rise16 substantially, even if the prices for goods  and17 services go down or rise moderately.18 We know the price index as  one19 measuring tool.	It's not a measure of20 prices  - -  it is a measure  of prices, although21 somewhat imprecise.	It does not measure actual22 costs, especially for owners of  older23 buildings or buildings, as Vince pointed  out ,24 undergoing Local Law 11 repairs or lead  paint
25 abatement.
It doesn't capture a myriad of ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.
521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2 administrative  costs; costs for recycling,3 annual DHCR registration fees, compliance  with4 fire safety regulations, building  registration5 fees and oil tank registration  fees.6 Most importantly, it does  not7 compensat e owners for the high- flying fuel8 costs for the prior two years when fuel  costs9 rose by 35 percent and 55  percent.10 During that period the  Board11 moderated  those fluctuations as it always has.12 Certainly for the past , I think it 's 17 years,13 this may be my 17th year, the Board has  always14 moderated  those fluctuations both ways with15 rent increases that are far different from  that16 fluctuation.17 Last year there was a  price18 index increase of 7.8 percent and  8.719 percent	- - rather two years ago, 8.7   percent20 last year.	Owners can never recapture  the21 costs of those dramatic increases, and  those22 dramatic  increases which included those23 dramatic increases of fuel .24 Actually, when we look at the  I25 and E data along with the price index, as  wellROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue , 17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
1	172 as a lot of other information that we  receive,3 it clearly shows that there has been  a4 disturbing three-year trend of inflation  of5 operating expenses .	And that appears to be6 getting worse .	The core operating expenses,  as7 Vince  mentioned , has  increased  from 3 .8 in 20008 to 5.4 percent in 2002 .9 The costs involved in10 maintaining	resident ial real estate don' t11 necessarily track the costs of  the CPI.	Real12 estate taxes is a prime  example.13 Real estate taxes are  probably14 the largest expense, single expense of  most15 buildings  in our universe.	And those expenses16 rose 6.6 percent this year.	And since it17 constitutes, real estate taxes  constitute18 approximately 20 percent of the budget of  the19 City of New York  - - is that correct , sir?20 MR. RUBENSTEIN:	Yes.21 MR. LUBELL:	We know that the22 budget has a signif icant deficit.	It 's not23 getting any better .	We can anticipate that24 real estate taxes will rise next year  and25 probably rise the year  after.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2 Insurance costs have soared  with3 a reported 16 and a half percent rise that  is4 at odds with all reported increases and all  the5 information that has been furnished to  us.
67 naturally  
And as these costs rise, they and continue to rise , they   
8 naturally assume or should assume a  greater9 weight than the basket of costs to  owners.10 This isn't getting any better next  year.11 The result is that net  operating12 margins fell.	Operating  ratios continue to13 rise, jeopardizing what we should very much  be14 concerned with, and that is the health of  the15 housing industry.	And that 's not only in the16 core of Manhattan, what is emphasized  outside17 of core Manhattan.18 Meanwhile,  real inflation19 adjusted wages showed a 6 percent increase  in20 2000 cont inuing the gains of the 1990s.	The21 number of households on public assistance,  we22 know over the years, has declined23 dramatically.	And there was little change  in24 housing court eviction  actions.25 And finally, please, let 's not ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2 wave the flag of homelessness, which is  a3 social - economic problem that is really4 irrelevant to rent increases.5 Finally, don't bury our6 dwindling housing stock deeper in the  hole7 because of what you have heard about  core8 Manhattan and isolated neighborhoods  in9 Brooklyn, where rents are actually  coming10 down.	We read what we see in the  newspapers,11 rents in core Manhattan are going down .12 In fact , those stories about13 core Manhattan certainly don't apply to many  of14 the side streets of the upper East Side,  the15 West Side or large portions of core  Manhattan .16 And it certainly doesn' t apply to the vast17 majority of our rent - stabilized housing in18 Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx where most  of19 our renters live in aging housing  stock.20 So if we don't want to lose  that21 housing, if we' re going to be foolish and shoot22 ourselves in our big toe, then we will not  pass23 an appropriate guideline .24 Mr . Chairman, following your25 agenda,  I am proposing  a ,  I am prepared toROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2 propose a guideline for the first item that  we3 have, and I will move at a subsequent  period4 when we get over the first item, to discuss  the5 other items.6 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	By " first7 item" you mean Item 1 or Item 1  A?8 MR. LUBELL:	Item 1 A.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.10 MR. LUBELL:	It would just be11 too cumbersome to do all the items in  one12 basket.13 On that basis, I think that  in14 order to preserve our housing and in view  of15 what I said, I move this Board to pass  a16 guideline of 5 percent for a one-year  lease17 renewal and 8 percent for a two- year lease18 renewal.19 (Audience participation.)

9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:10	Mr. Pagan?
Okay.
11	MR. PAGAN:	Mr. Chairman.12 Thank you.13 Once again, we come together  for14 the purpose of voting on an increase that  would15 decide the fate of rent - stabilized tenants for16 the fiscal year beginning October 1,  2002.17 This year we have a chance  to18 correct the inequities of past increases  that19 were more than generally to cover owners  extra20 costs.	Costs were lower than  prior years.	We21 have heard in almost every report  and22 presentation given by our staff and others  how23 operating a building has become profitable  over24 the years.	Mortgages are very affordable  and25 at a very low interest rate.	There is noROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2 reason to believe that this scenario  will3 change soon.4 At the April 16th meeting  we5 were informed that from 1999 to 2000 , the6 income expense report rental income rose  6.27 percent.	We approved a 2 percent for one  year8 and 4 percent  for two years in 1999- 2000.	So,9 actually it was higher than what we approved   in10 the guidelines.	It indicated that many of  the11 increases a tenant received in 1999 to  200012 were more than double those approved by  this13 Board.14 These increases are coming  from15 areas that owners indicate that are hard  to16 get , such as MCis and vacancy rates.	When17 other kinds of increases, such as  commercial18 notice services or charges, are added to  total19 income, it rose to 6.5 percent for the  year.20 Our actions account for less than half of  the21 increases in rent income for the  building.22 Well they mean so much for the tenant that   has23 to struggle to make ends  meet.24 Overall , net  income rose by 3 .525 percent ,  a number higher  than the  consumerROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2 price index.	The year 2000 was also the  only3 one in the past five years that  temperatures4 were below normal.	And even with increasing5	fuel costs, it was remarkable how prof itable it6 was.	Fuel carries a weight of between 8 and  127 percent of the cost of maintaining  an8 apartment.	In reference to normal, in the  past9 30 years what is considered normal  temperatures10 for the heating season, as well as all  year11	round, have continued to rise.	In other words,12 it 's been warm.13 Unless there is a major  climatic14 change, chances are that normal  temperatures15 for the coming years will continue to go up.16 And we see the big ice break over in the   South
17 Pole. 18
The projected  increase in fuel
19 costs are always projected	in the return to20 normal  operating winter temperatures.	As21 stated before, it has only happened once in   the22 past five years.	We should be making23 adjustments for climatic changes since  the24 increase that we passed based on returning  to25 normal year after year only makes the problemROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2 of unfair rent increases higher since we' re3 always compounding the increases year after4 year on numbers that we have, that have  little5 relevancy.6 Maybe one of the things that  we7 should be happening  is using regressive8 analysis to come to a number that  approximates9 average, instead of taking an average of  recent10 temperatures,  that captures temperatures that11 is higher than the past five  years.12 Sounds good for budgeting,  but13 it's not fair for those who have to  pay.14 On April 23rd we went over  the15 Rent Income and Affordability Report.	We16 conf irmed what we knew; new York City's economy17 was bad.	That the economy long term,  together18 with the events of September 11th, made  the19 worst for the residents of this  City.20 Inflation was held at  2.121 percent.	Jobs were lost and the number  of22 people in temporary housing rose to a  record23 31,000.	The vacancy rate was 3 .19, in 1999.	A24 bad situation for renters  became worse.	29.825 percent of families in rent - stabilizedROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
1	262 apartments make less than 15,000 per  year.3 At that income a family is  only4 able to afford rents of 375 per mont h.5 The truth is that after  Social6 Security, Medicare and taxes there is  little7 left for rent.	Once a rent is paid, food is  a8 luxury.	Health services, as well as  clothing,9 is difficult to get.	Approximately  20 percent10 of the families use more than 50 percent  of11 their income for rent.	Almost 47 percent of12 families pay more than 30 percent of  their13 income for rent.14 I wonder how many of us on  this15 Board could survive under such conditions.16 It takes someone making  a17 minimum wage 131 hours a week to  pay rent.	A18 person has to earn over $19.10 over a 40- hour19 week to afford a typical two  bedroom.20 I am sure we on this Board21 believe that the average working person in   a22 service industry making that much haven' t  seen23 many advertisements hiring persons at a  local24 hamburger joint for that amount of  money.25 I haven' t seen it.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175

521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
2 historic moment  in New York City.	This is3 truly a historic moment.4 What we have before us is  an5 opportunity for the Rent Guidelines Board  to6 actually do what it is supposed to do, what  it7 is mandated to do.8 We have before us a number  of9 studies that have been prepared by us, for  us10 by experts of the Rent Guidelines Board  staff.11 And what is it from  those12 reports that we know?13 We know that there are  certain14 mandates that require that these studies  be15 made.	And this is what they tell  us.16 According to Sect ion 26 - 510 of17 the Rent Stabilization Law, the Rent  Guidelines18 Board is required to monitor the  economic19 conditions  facing rent - stabilized  housing in20 New York City.	The Rent Guidelines Board21 conducts research projects, including an annual22 analysis of financial information submitted   to23 the New York City Department of Finance  by24 owners of rent - stabilized buildings.25 And what do we know for the 2002 ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2 Income and Expense Study?3 We know that the study  uses4 2000, year 2000 real property  income and5 expense filings describing  conditions and has6 major findings from 1999 to  2000.7 What we know is that  rent8 collections grew by  6.2 percent.	Gross income9 grew by 6.5 percent.	Operating  and maintenance10 costs grew by 8.4 percent.	And net operating11 income grew by 3.5 percent.12 We have also the 2002 Income  and13 Affordability Study.14 What this Board knows is  that15 according to Section 26- 510 B of the Rent16 Stabilization  Law, requires the Rent Guidelines17 Board consider relevant data from the  current18 and projected costs of living indices  and19 permits consideration of other measures  of20 housing affordability  in its deliberations.21 What we know from the  200222 Income Affordability Study, which reports on23 housing affordability and tenant income  by24 examining economic factors, such as inflation25 and job growth, household income and  housingROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2 costs, housing and welfare policies,  eviction3 proceedings,  homelessness,  usage of emergency4 assistance  and other indicators.5 What we know is that there is  a6 decline  in gross  City  product , increasing7 unemployment rate and increase in the number   of8 homeless in city shelters and increasing  wages9 in 2000  - - however, we're  experiencing a10 decrease now.11 This year is historic, as I  said12 earlier, because we' re taking into13 consideration the tax here in New York City on14 the World Trade Center on September  11th.15 What is it that we know  from16 that?17 We know that there is  projected18 job loss of over 150,000 jobs for this  city.19 We know that the national recession  just20 impacted us strongly here in New York City  and21 cont inues to do so.	The City has already  lost22 21 , 000 jobs.	The unemployment  rate has23 increased and homelessness  has worsened.	The24 tragedy of 9/11 may cost New York City  10525 billion over the next two years.	And aROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
1	312 signif icant drop in tax revenue and jobs is3 seen.4 What we have seen as members  of5 this city, as citizens here, what I have   seen6 in my capacity as an attorney with the  Legal7 Aid Society working in disaster centers on8 Worth and Chambers Street and at the   Salvation9 Army is the, we see a lot of middle  class10 individuals who have been affected.	We know11 already too significantly the impact of  this12 kind of economic devastation on low income  and13 the extremely poor of New York  City.14 But I have given advice to  and15 have tried to render services for middle   class,16 a growing segment who is finding themselves  in17 housing court for the very first time; a   number18 of folks who have lost their jobs and  can't19 make ends meet.20 I am talking about people who  we21 say we want to stay in  the city.	I am talking22 about school teachers whose husbands or  other23 wage earners in the household were impacted  by24 the economic fallout of September  11th.25 I am talking about other service ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
1322and emergency  service individualswho have lost3members of their families and  arehaving4trouble making ends meet.5I am talking aboutall the6individuals in New York City  thatlive in7rent - stabilized housing.8 I am not talking about even  some9 of the others who have had a devastating  impact10 to their lives.	But of those who have lived  in11 rent - stabilized housing we see a lot of them in12 trial offices at the Legal Aid Society,  legal13 services, we see growing numbers of  them14 seeking some kind of advice, who all of  a15 sudden qualify for our services when before16 they did not.17 There is devastation.18 We are at a historic moment  here19 in New York City.20 How are we supposed to  keep21 school teachers, firemen, service  industry22 workers, folks who pick up your mail , people23 who deliver your Faxes, how are they  supposed24 to stay in New York City under  these25 conditions?ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
1	3 32	(Applause.)3	MS. HOLDER:	I am sorry that my4	colleagues think homelessness	is a
5	social - economic problem.  6 problem.
But it is a real
7 Homelessness in terms of8 individuals has a real human cost to it that  I9 know people year in and year out have testified10 to this Board on.	But also understand this,  as11 the pool of homeless individuals  increases,12 what it is is a spiraling or, I say, a race   to13 the bottom.	Because it means that there  are14 other middle class and low- income folks that15 are taking their place downward.	It 's a16 downward  economic trend.17 So homeless  families and18 children don' t just represent themselves.	They19 represent the condition New York City is  going
20 towards. 2122
And what have we seen lately? We've seen record numbers  of
23 homeless  in municipal shelters.	As of January24 2002 we know that 31,000 homeless  persons25 staying in shelters include 13 , 000 children.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
1	342 Homelessness increases.	We see3 9 percent  increase in adults in city homeless4 shelters during the first four months of  the5 fiscal year 2002 and 22 percent  increase in the6 number of sheltered families during the  same7 period over a prior year, to  6,4748 individuals.9 Homelessness increases.	We see10 that 8 percent have increased their number  of11 days that a family stays in temporary  housing12 to an average of almost  11 months.	And there13 is a slight increase in the number of  families14 relocated to permanent housing, but ever  so15 slight.16 The cost of homelessness17 services to New York City  is exorbitant.	The18 cost to provide services to homeless in  200119 was $956 million.	That 's 493 million for20 emergency shelters and services, 128  million21 for homelessness prevention programs and  12222 million for permanent housing for homeless.23 It 's real.24 Although it may be considered  a25 social - economic problem, it is a real issue notROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2 only for the individuals but for all of us  here3 in New York who have to deal with making  sure4 that our neighbors are protect ed.5 Lastly, the 2002 Mortgage  Survey6 shows, which we know Section 26 - 510 B 3 of the7 Rent Stabilizat ion Law requires the RGB to8 consider cost and availability of financing   its9 deliberations.	We understand that there is  an10 increase in New York loan value.	There is no11 change in refinancing activity.	And lenders12 saw an increase in nonperforming	loans and13 foreclosures.	Vacancy  losses increased14 although collection losses remain  stable.15 In regards to the lenders seeing16 an increase in nonperforming	loans and17 foreclosures, other respondents to the  survey18 it was noted that this represent ed less than 119 percent of their total loans to rent   stabilized20 buildings.21 All and all , the facts support a22 rent decrease of 3 .5 percent for a one- year23 lease and  1.7 percent  for a two-year  lease  - -24 1.75 for a two-year lease.25 Never in the history of the Rent ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2 Stabilization Board have they ever given  rent3 order, increased renewal orders for less than  24	and 4 percent.	I say at this time, at  this5 historic moment in New York City history,  if6 not now, when?7 Are we going to have a  policy8 here at the Rent Guidelines Board, are we  to9 think that we are public servants looking  at10 studies and looking at information and  thinking11 that at no time would there ever be  a12 confluence of any type of economic indices  or13 social and political  and real - life economic  - -14 tenant - resident indices that would demand that15 there be increases of less than 2 and  416 percent?17 Can we expect that owners  will18 always be able to depend on getting  increases19 at no longer than 2 and 4  percent?20 I submit not this year.21 Let 's understand that it is our22 mandate to come here year after year and  look23 at the information that 's before us.24 This year I look at the

2	MR. CASTELLANO:	I am going to3 vot e against this basically because it is so  at4 variance with the core PIOC of 5.4  percent5 that it really does an  injustice.6 One of the statistics that  was7 quoted recently, a few minutes ago, that  rents8 went up 6 percent and change and  maintenance9 and operation went up 8  percent.10	Owners have been  dramatically11	increasing the amount of maintenance on12 buildings.	The condition of the housing  stock13 in New York City has improved dramatically.14 Even the Census Bureau has taken note of  it.15 And that' s because the industry has been16 healthier in recent years.17 Unlike my colleague, we  have18 enough difficulty predicting  next year's tax19 rate.	I don' t think we' re in a position to20 start predicting  the weather or the cost of21 oil.22 And ,  you know,  considering the23 comments that after the rent is paid food is  a24 luxury, I think it would be easy to escape  or25 forget that at the moment there are more  NewROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175

521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
2	So let me get this straight.3 Approximately eight months after the attack on4 the World Trade Center, they're  still5	predicting job losses.	Miraculously, they have6 not materialized.7 Yeah, they have materialized ; 8	about 20,000, not  150,000.9	Using the attack on the  World10 Trade Center as a rational to lower rents   is11 just absurd.12 You know, I come from  Rockaway.13 And Rockaway suffered a, paid as high a  price14 in that attack as anybody in New York City   in15 terms of human costs.	There is no16 relationship.17 And as far as rents going  down,18 I would suggest that why don' t we consider19 rents going down when the consumer price index20 goes down.	Costs go up every year.	Owners pay21 a collection of those costs to provide  decent22 housing to the  citizens.23 So I am going to vote  against

MS. HOLDER:	Yes.
4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.5 MS. HOLDER:	I would actually6 have to agree in some ways with my  colleague,7 Mr. Castellano, believe it or not , when he  says8 that a lot of New Yorkers are  actually9 working.	I have a lot of clients who  actually10 are working.	They actually have two, three  and11 four jobs and they still can't make the  rent.12 (Applause.)13 MS . HOLDER:	Governor Pataki14 told us several years ago that he' s created a15 lot of jobs here in New York City, but they   are16 low income, service  sector jobs.	And folks17 have to have two and three and/or four of  them18 in order to pay the rent.	So of course they19 are not going to show on the unemployment20 rolls.21 The other number of people  who22 don' t show up on the unemployment  rolls are23 those folks who have actually fallen off  and24 are no longer being counted because they  no25 longer are collecting any type of  unemploymentROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2 insurance or any other type of benefits  that3 would allow them to remain visible to us in   our
4 economy.5
I don' t think the World Trade
6	Center disaster is absurd.	I think it shows,7 however, what economic indices there are  going8 to be in the future looking forward as to  what9 it is we can expect in terms of folks'  real10 income, in terms of folks' real ability to  pay11 and what the City economy is going to look   like12 as compared to the national  economy.13 Times are tough.	We are here14 today and we acknowledge that fact and we  have15 reports before us that really do support  that16 there would be some type of understanding  of17 those economic  realities to individuals.18 I also would just like to  say19 before I hand the mike over, that we' re  talking20 about individuals in rent - stabilized housing21 who have already experienced  unprecedented22 increases  in previous years.	If what people23 are saying is that they regret what they  have24 done in previous years in terms of  the25 increases that were voted upon, well , I thinkROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2	the folks should admit  that.3 But to the extent that we  have4 come here today, we know what is our  mandate5 today, and given what folks have  experienced,6	that net operating income for owners is,  puts7 them in a great , superior position for the8 short and long term, I think we know what  is9 incumbent for us to do.10	(Applause.)11	(Audience participation .)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Pagan.13 MR . PAGAN:	I will try to keep14 my remarks short.15 One of the things that I hear16 every year that I have been here is that  the17 income has not kept up with the expenses  and18 the expenses for the owners have been  much19 higher every year.	And the way it comes out20 there have been mounting  losses year after21 year.22 Well , the thing is that the net23 operating income has been keeping from going  up24 year after year.	So there is something wrong25 with that logic.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2 Two, we look at the , this  is3 from my personal experience.	I work for a4 nonprof it organization.	We do manage and we5 service tenants  and  in rent - stabilized6 buildings as well as we represent them  in7 organized buildings.	What I have been getting8 to in the last year or two is a number  of9 persons trying to buy buildings that  apparently10 have no value because of the rents are  supposed11 to be low but they are willing to take  that
12 risk.13
Now, the other thing  that
14 happens, they are being offered  tremendous15 amount of dollars for buildings that  originally16 had  very little value.	So the wealth  - - we17 never talk about wealth and wealth  creation.18 If somebody bought a building ten years  ago19 they' d sell for a million dollars today.	And20 that 's happening in the City.21 So when you look at the22 ownership of a tenant apartment housing  you're23 looking at two ways of making money, or  three24 actually.25 One, there' s nice net operating ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175

2	income.3
Two, you could borrow against
4 that building because it keeps increasing  in5 value.	You could borrow and utilize  it.6	Third , you could sell it and7 still make a good amount of  money.8 So when we' re looking at things9 that 's hurting owners, it really is not hurting10	that much, because they keep on wanting to  buy11	additional buildings.12 Now I haven' t seen tenants that13 are going out of one building to move  to14 another for one simple reason.	As soon as they15 move to the other there is a 20  percent16 surcharge on vacancy allowance, in addition to17 whatever additional income.	So you're not18 going to move from one building to  another19 knowing that your rent is going to go up  and20 that you're not going to be able to meet  it.21 Those are the problems that  I22 see.23 Thank you.24 (Applause.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell.

5 Okay.6 I make a motion for a7 two-year  - - a 2 percent  one- year lease and 58 percent two-year lease.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there a11 second?12 Am I allowed to talk  first?13 The reason  I make  that , number14 one, is I do believe that despit e some of the15 discussion here that the Rent Guidelines  Board16 is in times of serious inflation to mit igate17 the swings on the way up.	If you look at the18 history of the Board in the last 33 years,   they19 have, in fact , done that.	And in times of20 disinflation, which you can discuss whether or21 not we' re looking at , the PIOC or the core22 PIOC, what ever it is, there was some modicum of23 disinflation in this particular year.24 So I am convinced that we  should25 be at the low end of the scale, which  isROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
2 historically  2 percent , given  particular,  you3 know, last year's level it's not a  significant4 decrease.5 On the 5 percent for a  two-year6 lease, my belief is the reason that that  makes7 sense is that I believe we are entering  into8 somewhat inflationary times when you look  at9 the price index of operating costs and  the
10 major components.11 are:
And those part icular aspects
12 Number one:	Insurance, which is13 going up significantly.	I am not quarreling in14 any way, shape or form with the findings of   our15 staff in doing the PIOC but , in fact , insurance16 volat ility is taking on increasing17 signif icance.	And we' re in this insurance18 cycle of signif icant rate increases for all19 kinds of property; home owner  property,20 residential , multifamily  property, commercial21 property, et cetera.22 Two:	A second major, a major23 component of PIOC is real  estate taxes.	And I24 fully expect , given the significant and25 difficult budgetary issues facing the City  ofROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
2	New York, that either this year or  the3	following year there is likely to be a real 4 estate tax rate increase.5 (Audience participation.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	If you look at7 several other components,  including the fuel8 component , which clearly went down in the9 history of volatility in that , in fact post  the10 date- to- date or year- to-year dates that we have11 looked in our survey, in fact , costs have gone12 up.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So I believe15 that we should create a situation where  there16 is a slight disincentive to take a  two-year
17 lease. 18
Therefore, I make a motion  for
19 a two and a five-year  lease.20 Any second?21 (Audience participation.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any second?23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. RUBENSTEIN:	Second.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Rubenstein ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175

15 motion? 16
Yes, Mr. Pagan.
17 MR. PAGAN:	I just quickly want18 to refer to volatility.19 In the past , it happens every20 year, there is always an issue that tends to   go21 beyond or go out of norms.	Most of the time22 it 's fuel.	In the past , every time we had a23 fuel issue that it went up , we would go 7, 8,  924 percent	increase.	The next year the fuel  would25 come down and for three years we had  zeroROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
 2 changes in the PIOC; yet , we kept going two and3 four.4 (Audience participation.)5 MR . PAGAN:	So by taking into6 account volatility and taking that as an  issue7 every year and trying to give  additional8 increases in rent because of that , I think9 we' re doing a disfavor to the renters, because10 that , in the future that will change also.11 There will be a time that it will come  down.12 At that time we' re not going to receive a13 lower, a negative rent increase.	So I think we14 should stay away from things that are  very
15 volatil e. 16171819
(Applause.)CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder.MS. HOLDER :	Thank you.I would have to agree with my
20 colleague, David Pagan .21 I just don't understand why,22 when it 's to the advantage of the owners that23 we will take into consideration these type  of24 volatile variables, but we don't seem to  make25 any type of adjustments when it comes and  itROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175

This is our time to4 make those kinds of correct ions.5 And in light of the  other6 economic indices that are before us, I  cannot7 vote in favor of this particular  motion.8 Thank you.9 (Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any additional11 debate on this motion?12 (No response.)

So I just want to make it  clear19 that the motion, for all these motions  the20 language before you will be adopted with  the21 appropriat e modif ications, meaning the numbers22 inserted based upon the Board' s action tonight23 with the respected alternatives  presented.24 If we want changes in the  actual25 text , we will have to talk about that also.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175

17 Vacancy Allowance for18 Apartments; do I have a motion on  that?19 MR. LUBELL:	Yes.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell.21 MR. LUBELL:	I move that where22 the rent charged paid September 3 0, 2002 is23 less than 500 an additional 20 percent  be24 permitted	in addit ion to that provided by the25 Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1997 over  theROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2rentcharged  on September  30 , 2002.3The reason for that is that  we4haveheard testimony from, for example, HPD,  as5wellas others.6HPD, Mr. Schultz, testif ied that7 the City pays, the costs to the City is $450  a8 month to maintain an apartment ; that 's9 exclusive of insurance, real estate taxes  or10 overhead.	If you added that , quote, overhead11	it ' s another $5500 per unit per year .12 We also have heard  testimony13 that if you were to look at smaller  buildings14 in New York, the large number of  smaller15 buildings of 11 to 19 units, we' re not even16 talking about six to ten- unit buildings where17 it 's even worse, the costs in Manhattan, in18 upper Manhattan,  to maintain these buildings  is19 between 430 and 520- some-odd dollars per month.20 Knowing that you have  these21 costs for large numbers of buildings, we' re22 saying, we' re moving  for a defined vacancy23 allowance for apartments renting less than $50024 of an addit ional 20 percent vacancy allotment .25 (Audience participation .)

MR. CASTELLANO: CHAIRMAN MARKUS:
Second.Mr. Castellano
7 MR. CASTELLANO:	Mr. Chair,8 could I speak to the motion?9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure you can.10 MR. CASTELLANO:	In addition to11 my colleague' s argument in favor of this12 motion, I would like to add that the  mysteries13 of arithmetic of small numbers, when you have   a14 rent of $500 a month, 20 percent increase  is15 only 100 bucks.16 (Audience participation.)17 MR. CASTELLANO:	It 's still18 below the cost of operating and  maintaining19 that apartment.	It is still below the cost  of20 the average apartment in New  York City.	And21 simply given the percentage	increase for these22 low- rent apartments is unfair to the owner who23 has  already been burdened	- -24 (Audience participat ion.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
2 MR. CASTELLANO:	It's unfair to3 burden this owner additionally who has already4 been burdened with this low- rent apartment that5 he, in effect , has to subsidize throughout  the
6 tenancy.7
So I think, even at the worst ,
8 if the apartment was at $499, 40  percent9 increase would only bring that apartment up  to10 $700 a month, which is still , by all11 definitions in the rest of the world, a  very12 affordable rent.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.15 This is not a debate.16 This is a not a debate.17 MR. CASTELLANO:	So I would like18 to second my colleague' s motion.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, Mr.20 Pagan.21 MR. PAGAN:	The problem I have22 with this motion is that , again, this is a23 regressive tax.24 (Applause.)25 MR. PAGAN:	We' re charging the ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2 people who least can afford it a higher  amount ,3 a higher increase.4 In other words, somebody  is5 paying 500, they will have another 100 on   top6 of the 500.7 Now, if the numbers that the  RGB8 did before in reference to rent  affordability,9	and indicating that 27 percent of the  families10 can only afford 375 , and that over 47 percent11 of the families, their rent is higher than   3012 percent of their income, which is just ,  it's13 putting them at risk of not being able to   eat.14 I mean, we have to make15 choices.	The choices are not pretty.	I think16 that' s a terrible way of dealing with people17 who have limited  income.18 Thank you.19 (Applause.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead , Mr.21 Lubell.22 MR. LUBELL:	I am not proposing23 a low- rent supplement.24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Vacancy. ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
2 MR. LUBELL:	This is a vacancy.3 This is when the apartment becomes vacant  and4 that low- rent tenant - - we' re not getting  into5 a debate.	We debated that many, many t imes.6 Low rents don' t mean necessarily low incomes,
7 generally don' t mean that.8 talking about that.
But we' re not
 9 (Audience participation.)10 MR. LUBELL:	My proposal is with11 respect to an apartment that becomes  vacant.12 (Audience participation. )13 MR. LUBELL:	It is not an14 imposition on the tenant who is occupying  that
15 apartment. 16171819
 (Audience participation.) MR. PAGAN:	Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.MR. PAGAN:	Again, here is the
20 probl em.	Instead of having a 20  percent21 increase, he is suggesting that the  apartment22 when it becomes vacant increases by  40
23 percent. 2425
 (Audience participation.) MR. PAGAN:	In other words, 
ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2 we' re not talking about $1,000	about $100,3 we' re talking about $200 .	So, in no time we4	will hit the higher numbers that we will  take5	that from decontrol.	It looks like next year6 we will be looking at 700, because 500,  there7 will be no $500 units.8 I have a problem.	We are taking9 affordability out.	We' re asking people to move10 into the City to provide a service and we' re11 going to take away the affordable units  by12 increasing the rent , that initial rent that13 they' re going to pay.14 This is a service.	Most people15 who provide  services are essential to the  City,16 and they' re low wages.	It 's diff icult to pay17 rent when 27 percent of the families now  cannot18 afford	can only afford $375.	So we are19 asking them, you know, 375, that' s all you can20 afford, but we' re going to ask you to pay  $700.21 I think this is something  that22 we' re looking in the future, somebody is going23 to say :	What were those people thinking  about24 when they passed such an adjustment.25 Thank you.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175

(Audience member escort ed fromCHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Go ahead , Mr.MR. CASTELLANO:	Mr. Schultz
10	from HPD testified before the Board that  the11	expenses of HPD, just operating and maintenance12 expenses for an apartment are  approximately13 $450 a month.14 As Mr. Lubell mentioned  earlier,15 they do not pay for insurance, taxes or  water16 and sewer.	But you can make that adjustment ,17 you're talking about an average cost  of18 providing  basic  services  for an apartment ,19 between $550 a month.	Some number in that20 vicinity.21 It seems to be contrary to  good22 public policy for this Board to tell  owners23 that they must maintain apartments below  their24 cost of operation.25 The purpose of a low- rentROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
2 supplement was to give owners the added  income3 at the low end of the rental scale so that  they4 could rationally provide adequat e services to5 those apartments.6 I fail to see the logic of7 mandating  required services and then mandating8 that the owners cannot achieve revenues to  pay9	for that.	There have been  arguments  - ­10 (Audience participation .)11 MR.  CASTELLANO:	- - that an12 owner can charge the person next door more13 (Audience participation.)14 MR.

There is no use for this.22 It has already accomplished what the  landlords23 wanted under the Koch and  Giuliani24 administrations.25 It 's outrageous that we should ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175

Indeed, if they have been vacated  only12 once during that period.13 If they have been vacat ed once14 during that period there may be an increase  of15 20 percent.

Mr. Chair, I
22 would like to make a  motion.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.24 Let me make it clear to all  in25 the audience, that all these items will  beROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2	considered again at the  final meeting.	This is3 a public process in order to vet and  provide4 for discussion of ideas that the Board has  and5 specific numbers.6 This is not the final  number.7 All these items, if there is a motion at   the8 final meeting, can come up  again.9 Go ahead.10 MR. LUBELL:	Members of the11 Board, we have discussed this in the past  ad12 nauseam it seems like.13 Upon a subletting, when a  tenant14 sublets, and a tenant has a right to sublet  for15 two years within any four-year period of  time,16 the tenant is entitled to a 10 percent   increase17 for furnishing.	If there is no furnishing  it18 would seem likely that the tenant is  not19 interested in coming back, so the tenant  should20 not be permitted to  sublet.21 If the tenant is subleasing,  the22 tenent is getting a 10 percent  increase.23 Therefore, I propose, as we  had24 last year, that upon subletting there be  an25 allowance in the amount of 10 percent to  theROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175

12 have adopted this in recent years, except  when13 somebody was allowed to create enough confusion14 about this issue that some Board members  would ,15 in effect , decide to vote against it.16 This is an imminently  reasonable17 allowance.	It 's been upheld by the courts.18 The courts have, in some cases have said that   a19 tenant leaving curtains in the windows  entitles20 the tenant to the get a 10 percent  allowance21 for providing	furniture.

2	Pagan.3
MR. PAGAN:	Just quickly, in
4 reference to this particular mot ion, there is5 no extra cost to the landlord for having  a6 sublet.	He does have to approve it but  there7 is no extra cost.8 The probl em, a lot of the time9 there are people who have to relocate  outside10 of the City for a short period of time, up  to,11 whatever the law allows.	You have to go12 somewhere else.13 And now we' re asking to make it14 extra difficult by adding another 10  percent15 added to that lease when there is nothing  that16 is being gained by the landlords at that  time17 by having someone else pick up the cost for  a18 short period of time.19 So I have a difficulty  with20this.21CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, Mr.22Lubell.23MR. LUBELL:	Two responses to24that.25One response is:	We shouldROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 FifthAvenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2 permit the tenant to profit by 10  percent.3 And the second things is:	Yes,4 indeed, the owner does have a  cost.5	The owner has to make sure  that6	the person who is living there is a  reasonable7	tenant.8 (Audience participation.)9 MR. LUBELL:	The owner cannot10 unreasonably withhold its consent and  therefore11	will require some information about the12 subtenant who is moving in  there.13 (Audience participation.)14 MR. LUBELL:	The owner has that15 responsibility at least to his other tenants .16 So there is a process  involved17 in this.	And that process does involve an18 expense.	Like a lot of other  administrative19 expenses, at least this one should be able  to20 be recaptured by the  owner.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Pagan.22 (Audience part icipation.)23 MR. PAGAN:	I just want to24 answer the items that Mr. Lubell  mentioned.25 In reference to a prof it , the ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
2	problem is that , is the use.	The 10 percent is3 for the use of the tenant 's furniture for that4 period of time.5 If you had to go out and  rent6	furniture, it 's going to cost you a lot more7 than 10 percent that they're being  given.8 That 's something that we don' t take into9 account.	This is a fraction of the actual  cost10	that somebody else would face.	It allows the11	new tenant to come in and be able to move at12 that place without having to rent  additional13 equipment  somewhere else.14 In reference to the cost , yeah,15 there may be a one - time cost , small cost for16 those things.	But you don' t have a recurring17 cost on a regular basis that increases the  cost18 to the owner.	So I don' t see why an additional19 10 percent  is necessary.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Calling the21 question.

15 of operating hotel SROs and lofts is not  the16 same as an apartment building.	Hotels and SROs17 provide rooms.	In many cases there is a18 congregate bathroom and kitchen facility,  not19 in all cases.20 Hotels are supposed to provide21 all the services, such as linens and  towels.22 The rooms in many of these facilit ies are very23 small.24 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	David , we' re25 talking about the loft  guidelines.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175

I want to make a
4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	For lofts and5 rent - stabilized hot els?6 MR. PAGAN:	Yes.
7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:8 Go ahead.
Okay.
9 MR. PAGAN:	The rooms in many of10 the facilities are very small , running from11 seven and a half feet to ten- by- ten.	The rents12 are between 50 square feet to 100 square  feet13 per year.	Compared to an apartment that  runs14 below 20 square feet.15 The residents of these  units16 come from all walks of life.	In the hotels,17 about 50 percent of the residents are whit e,18 many with limited income.	The other 50 percent19 are made up of people  of color.	Most of the20 residents are single adults, but for many  it 's21 the only home they  know.22 Hotels are slowly turning  to23 transient populations	for the purpose of24 increasing their income.	The income of such25 tenants tend to be over $100  per night.	A muchROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
2	higher figure than for a permanent  tenant.3 SROs are converting to  hotels4 for the purpose of attracting the tourists  and5	transient residents.	For the same purpose  the6 hotels are renting for transient , their income7 per night is over 100.	Today very few hotels8 and SROs house only permanent  tenants .	As per9 tenants that I have spoken to, hotel  services10 are not provided to the permanent  tenants.11 These changes are evident by  the12 number of nonharassment	certificat es being13 filed every year .	The number of residents14 using these facilities continues to  decline.15 There is no core relationship between the   rent16 increase and continuous erosion of  the17 permanent tenant.	Earnings for the operators18 come from transients.	As soon as it 's19 possible, they tend to convert the  facilities20 to that use eliminating permanent  residency21 when an opportunity arises.22 In the short run, there is  no23 easy answer to change what is happening  and24 it 's beyond what I believe is our mission.25 There may be a time when such facilities  wouldROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
2 be recognized for the good it provides  and3 government  will then address the preservation4 of such facility.	There is no evidence that5 they merit increases .6 For the lofts, owners  provide7 little service to the tenants.	Residents
8 provide their own heat and hot  water.9 no sense to give them an increase.
It makes
10 For that reason, I move  that11 there be no increases for, in this class  of12 tenancy as a whole.13 Thank you.14 (Applause.)

18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:19 Mr. Lubell.
Okay.
20 MR. LUBELL:	I think that21 lumping lofts together with hotels and  SROs,22 the logic doesn't make  sense.23 Mr. Pagan spoke about the  small24 size of SRO and hotel  rooms.25 We all know that most lofts are ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
1	102  2 at least 1,000 square feet or  more.3 We've all heard and read  about4 the recent case where this woman had a loft   on5 Spring Street.	It was, I believe it was  in6 excess of 2000 square feet , and for many, many7 years she was paying $85 a  month.8 This is not applicabl e to - -9 lofts are a totally different animal  from10 hotels and SROs.11 So, I make a friendly motion  for12 an amendment	- - or friendly amendment  to at13 least separate the lofts from hotels, which  we14 have done for the last 16 or 17 years  and15 probably before then as  well.16 MR.

8 So- called Special Guideline.9 Anita, do you want to explain10 that to us, please, for the  record.11 MS. VISSER:	The Board is12 considering the Special Guideline which is  used13 to calculate a new rent for a unit that  moves14 from rent control to rent  stabilization.15 The Special Guideline has  been16 adopted since 1974 and has ranged from  various17 formulas from 15 percent above the MBR plus  the18 adjustment  for fuel , to 35 percent  above the19 maximum collectabl e rent plus fuel, to the20 great er of a combination of a percentage above21 the maximum collectable rent and a  percentage22 above the maximum base rent plus  fuel.23 Last year's order the Special24 Guideline was the great er of the maximum base25 rent plus 150 percent , plus the fuel adjustmentROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2	or HUD' s fair market rent.
345	Castellano.6
MR. CASTELLANO:	Mr. Chair? CHAIRMAN MARKUS:		Yes, Mr.MR. CASTELLANO:	This
7 formulation that we adopted last year  was8 largely the result of a proposal that  came9 about two or three years  before that.	And I am10 proud to say I had something to do with  it.11 This particular probl em is one12 where an apartment has been rent  controlled,13 which means that the apartment has been  rent14 controlled  for 59 years consecutively and now15 is going to enter the rent stabilization  system16 for the first time.17 One of the major problems  with18 this kind of an apartment is that an owner  has19 to select a first rent.	Up until this20 particular  formulation was suggested a  few21 years ago, virtually every time the  owner22 selected a first rent that rent was  challenged23 in court.	That challenge the owner had  to24 defend at the HCR.	The tenant did not have to25 pay for an attorney, but the  owner did.	AROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
2	challenge at the HCR could easily cost  four or 3	$5000 .  4 So we were taking an owner  who5 was saddled with rent control 55 years  after6 World War II ended  - -7 (Audience participation. )8 MR. CASTELLANO :	which was9 the reason for rent control in the first  place.10 (Audience participation.)11 MR. CASTELLANO:	This gave the12 owner the ability to select a number certain,  a13 number that could not be challenged in court ;14 that was adjusted for the size of  the15 apartment ; that was adjusted for the utility16 circumstances of that apartment ; and that the17 owner could pick a number that was  determined18 by HUD and not be subject to a challenge by  a19 tenant and be saddled with another  $4,00020 expense to prove that number in  an21 administrative tribunal.22 I would like to propose that  we23 adopt last year 's language for the Special
24 Guideline . 25
CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Do we have a ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC .
521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York   10175
2secondonthat?3MR. LUBELL:	I second it .4CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.5Any discussion?6Go ahead.7MR. PAGAN:	Quickly.8 I think that the problem  with9 the Special Guideline is that we' re assuming10 that all those years that the owner never  took11 advantage of what 's given to them, they' re able12 to raise the rent 7 percent per year, that' s13 even higher than the rent  guidelines.14 (Audience participation .)15 MR. PAGAN:	Now we' re also asked16 on top of that to do  additional increases.	The17 chances are that these apartments are now  going18 to be decontrolled  in many  - - it will , we' re19 looking at 150 percent increase.	We' re looking20 at additional fuel adjustments.	We' re looking21 at unaffordability for most of the tenants  that22 utilize these kind of  apartments.23 I have a difficulty with  that.24 I had a difficulty last year.	I have a25 diff iculty many years.	I think that we shouldROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
2 come up with something that 's reasonable, but3 this is very unreasonable.
4	MR . CASTELLANO:5	could  I respond , please?
Mr. Chair,

67	respond?8
MS. HOLDER :	Well, can ICHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well , you can

 9	say something. 1011
Go ahead , Mr.  Castellano .MR . CASTELLANO :	I think Mr.
12 Pagan illustrates the misunderstanding	that13 this provision includes.14 If the owner had taken all  the15 rent increases he was entitled to over  the16 years, this provision would have virtually  no17 increase .	The 7 percent  increase per year is a18 difference between maximum collectable rent  and19 maximum base rent.20 This does not provide for  an21 increase of 150 percent over the  maximum22 collectable rent.	This goes to a number23 certain based upon the fair market rents  of
24 Section 8 . 25
This is the average rent .So a one-bedroom apartment in ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC .
521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175
2 the City of New York, if the tenant pays  gas3 and electric separately, is  $898.4 That is a deregulated  rent?5 That is an onerous rent for  an6 apartment that 's been controlled for 59 years?7 (Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder.9 MS. HOLDER:	This would violat e10 the statutory mandate if it were to  pass.11 Unfortunately, we know what 's going to happen12 and State law - - there are more  and  more13 apartments that are falling out of rent  laws14 and out of control.15 I can't see why we would think16 that it would be a functionous body to  continue17 to do that and go along with what the State   has18 mandated and what the State has  allowed19 themselves to have mandated  and the fair - -   of20 decontrolling rents.21 This is outrageous and  it22 virtually eliminates any fair market  rent23 appeals.24 I would hope that it would  fail.25 (Audience participation.)ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES,	INC.521 Fifth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10175
2 MR. LUBELL:	I move the

CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.The suggestion is that we  read
6 the language so that everybody is clear on  what7 we' re voting on.8 I have to find it.9 I will read this.10 Under Section 26- 513 B 1 of the11	New York City Administrative	Code and Section12 9-E of the Emergency Tenant Protect ion Act of13 1974, the Rent Guidelines Board is obligated  to14 promulgate  Special Guidelines to aid the State15 Division of Housing and Community Renewal  in16 its determinat ion of initial legal regulated17 rent for housing accommodations  previously18 subject to the City Rent and  Rehabilitation19 Law, which are the subject of a  tenant20 application for adjustment .21 The Rent Guideline hereby22 proposes the following Special  Guideline:23 For dwelling units subject  to24 the Rent and Rehabilitation Law on  September25 30, 2002, which become vacant after  SeptemberROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue,  17th Floor, New York, New York  10175

2 Go ahead.3 MR. RIVERA:	Mr. Chair, this4 proposal that I would like to make is done   in5 the spirit of the fact that I think that  over6 the years this area has been less and  less7 understood by the Board and specifically  with8 the impact that it has with regard to the  new9 or the newly rent guideline laws,  particularly10 the luxury decontrol.11 I think that we need more12 discussion because  I think there are, as an13 estimate, about 50,000 of these rent - controlled14 buildings, units rather.	And I believe that15 this is one area where the middle class has   an16 opportunity to remain in middle class17 buildings, if it were made  affordable.18 I believe that the 150 percent19 that we have promulgat ed over the past three20 years have drastically shrunk the opportunities21 for this class of housing to remain viable   for22 the middle class.23 So I am proposing that we have  a24 50 percent increase over the MBR or the  MCR,25 whichever is the largest .ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue , 17th Floor, New York, New York  10175

20 they will go on for years.21 will pay the cost of  that.
