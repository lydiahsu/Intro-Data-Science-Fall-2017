We' ll try her name a little bit later just  in 16 case she' s out at this moment.17 Jabir Suluki? Yes?18 A VOICE:	He' s here.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.20 He' s here though?	We' ll call his 21 name when he comes in.22 Andrieene Knightt. Go ahead. He' ll 23 be next. He' ll be next. He' ll get his chance.24 Go ahead.25 MS. ADRIENNE KNIGHTT:	Members of 4 
2 the Rent Guidelines Board, my name is  Adrienne 3 Knightt.4 I would like to first thank  you 5 for the opportunity to speak today and tell you  --6 VOICES:	Louder. Can' t hear you.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' ve got to 8 talk close, real close.	Hold it. That' s perfect.9 MS. ADRIENNE KNIGHTT:	I would 10 like to first thank you for the opportunity  to 11 speak to you today and to tell you why I feel   the 12 Rent Guidelines Board must approve a fair  guideline 13 this year.14 In 2005 I made the single  biggest 15 purchase of my life, a twelve- unit building in 16 Brooklyn.	When I made this purchase, I had  one 17 goal in mind, to provide safe, affordable  housing 18 to New York City residents.	This just is 19 impossible, however.20 Eleven units are rent stabilized 21 and one unit is rent controlled.	One- third of my 22 buildings pays less than a thousand dollar  per 23 month in rent.	I don' t have the cash to operate 24 the building much less make a living for  myself.25 ( Audience participation.)2 
2 MS. ADRIENNE KNIGHTT:	This year 3 has been the perfect storm of operating  cost 4 increases because everything has been increasing  at 5 once.6 Electricity, water, insurance,7 taxes, you name it, it all went up this  year.8 Since I bought the building in 2005 , I have  been 9 operating in the red.	But now I' m really concerned 10 that I will lose my  building.11 I' m sure you heard here tonight 12 the single biggest factor in my increase  in 13 operating costs has been the ballooning  fuel 14 prices.15 In 2005 the cost of fuel in  my 16 building was twenty thousand dollars.	This past 17 winter was a much different story. I paid $ 29 , 000 18 in fuel bills.	One tenant pays just $ 327 per month 19 in rent.	This means that what this tenant pays  for 20 the entire year won' t cover the fuel cost and 21 utilities for even one month.22 A minimum rent adjustment for 23 tenants like this would help. It won' t solve my 24 cash flow problem but it will take, you know --   I25 will take all the help I can  get.2 
 2 I' ve taken advantage of various 3 grant programs to make essential repairs around  my 4 building like replacing the boiler. Without  these 5 programs there is no way I could have made  these 6 kind of big- ticket repairs.7 My case is simple. Without  a8 minimum adjustment and fair increase I am  in 9 jeopardy of losing my building.10 Here are examples of how my  costs11 have increased:12 According to the Price Index  of 13 Operating Costs, fuel costs have increased 37 . 414 percent.	My fuel has bill has risen from $ 1666  per 15 month to $ 2 , 417 per month.16 My insurance costs have increased 17	from $ 4500 to $ 5300 .18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 19 try to wrap up.20 MS. ADRIENNE KNIGHTT:	Okay.21 Utility rates overall have risen 22 8 . 9 percent and beginning on July 1 , 2008 , water 23 and sewer bills will increase another 14 . 5 percent.24 I have four apartments that  are 25 paying less than a thousand dollars per month.  I18 
2 can' t complete building improvements or major 3 capital projects because I simply do not  generate 4 enough income to cover the  costs.5 Unexpected costs come up all  the 6 time and I am having a great deal of difficulty   in 7 doing the things that I need to  do.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 Any questions?10 ( No response.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 Appreciate it.13 ( Applause.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is Joyce 15 Darwood in the building?	Joyce Darwood? No.16 ( No response.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jabir Suluki.18 Hold on.19 ( Applause.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Followed by 21 Thomas Hillgardner; and 22 Then Council Member Barron.23 Go ahead, Mr. Suluki.24 MR. JABIR SULUKI:	Good evening.25 I work -- I am a member of   the 2 
2 Pratt Community Council. I' m part of the leadership 3 group.	And we work in the Pratt Community  to 4 preserve affordable housing and build diverse  and 5 flourishing communities.6 Since working with the Pratt 7 Community Council I have become an advocate. I   am 8 not a rent stabilized tenant but my neighbors  are.9 And, you know, I lived in Brooklyn all my life   and 10 my community is my home. I am here to support   my 11 neighbors and ask the Rent Guidelines Board  to 12 freeze the rents.13 The other day -- and I' ve seen 14 women and another ladies, people that have been  in 15 their homes for over thirty years in  my 16 neighborhood and they became homeless because  of 17 what the landlords that are purchasing  the 18 building, their strategies moved them out of  their 19 homes and then the people in the neighborhood  end 20 up taking in these people.21 A new landlord purchased a22 building, raised the rent above the woman' s means.23 And I' m asking the Rent Guidelines Board to make 24 sure that the people in the neighborhood do  not 25 become homeless, to freeze the rent this  year.2 
2 ( Audience participation.)3 MR. JABIR SULUKI:	This rent 4 increase in my neighborhood means my  neighborhood 5 changes, my home changes.	My neighborhood may not 6 be able to -- the people will not be able to   pay 7 the rent.	They may be forced to leave. These  are 8 people that I grew up with, that puts the   meaning 9 into my neighborhood to be a  neighborhood.10 ' Cause now I' ll turn to 11 commercial, students or campus ground. Because  of 12 the rent hikes to $ 2000 , $ 3000 , they pay for a13 while and all you see is moving trucks in and   out,14 in and out, in and  out.15 I live in Clinton Hill,  Brooklyn,16 which I know is gone. It' s gone.	I have watched 17 the neighborhood change from the people that  come 18 in, into the people that are  going out.	The 19 interests of the landlord is important to  the 20 people who lives in my neighborhood.	No rent hike.21 Make a freeze on the rent  this.22 I' m -- I' m -- I agree to change 23 but not at the expense of the people that' s  built 24 and put their lives into the  neighborhood.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 
2( Audience participation.)3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thomas 4Hillgardner,is that you?5MR. THOMAS HILLGARDNER:	Good 6evening.7Thomas Hillgardner.8I' m not an owner. I' m not a9 tenant. I' m a landlord/ tenant attorney.	And I came 10 down here because -- and this is the first  time 11 I' ve ever come.	And thank you for hearing me.  This 12 is the first time I' ve come down to address  this 13 Board.14 And I felt compelled as a  matter 15 of morality to come down here because of  the 16 inequities in the rent stabilization system  that 17 are overwhelming the system and are getting rid  of 18 the New York that I grew up and I still live in   and 19 I' ve lived in all my life and that I  love.20 ( Audience participation.)21 MR. THOMAS HILLGARDNER:	When 22 you' re considering how much -- what this increase 23 should be, I think there are several issues  that 24 frequently get slipped by the Board of  how 25 landlords raise the rents without the benefit  of 9 
2 you gentlemen, and ladies and gentlemen.3 MCI increases churn. In fact, I4 believe -- I' ve read the brochures of several 5 landlord law firms where they advertise, you  know,6 you need counsel so we can show you how  to 7 maximimze your rent rolls.8 Do you know what that' s a9 euphemism for? That' s a euphemism for churn. Let' s10 turn this place offer.	We' re going to get some 11 vacancy allowances. We' re going to show you how to 12 not put out to bid a Major Capital Improvement  and 13 give the job to your uncle so it will be -- so   the 14 $ 10 , 000 job will be a $ 30 , 000 and you' ll get to 15 raise the rents.16 This is going on in the City  of 17 New York. Okay?18 ( Audience participation.)19 MR. THOMAS HILLGARDNER:	Now, I20 want to say -- I want to say that   --21 ( Audience participation.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on. We' ve 23 had order until now. Let' s keep the order.24 Everybody will get a chance to speak. There' s  no 25 need to heckle anybody, really.	No boos, no yeas,2 
2 applause at the end, fine. But that' s it. We' re not 3 going to spend a lot on wasting time on boos   and 4 heckling and the rest.5 Go ahead.6 MR. THOMAS HILLGARDNER:	I do 7 agree on one thing that Mr. Schleider said is  that 8 it' s a very unfortunate thing that you' re 9 authorized and required to do here. You' re required 10 to impose a one- size- fits all solution. And there' s11 going to be winners and there' s going to be  losers 12 and it' s going to be unfair to some  people.13 I think you should take  a14 utilitarian approach and try do the most do for  the 15 most people.	I really feel sorry for the  small 16 owners.	The small owners are getting screwed  in 17 this situation.	The tenants are getting screwed in 18 this situation.	And the big owners, they' re 19 moving in.20 They' re advertising prospectuses 21 where -- and big Wall Street money can come in   and 22 take -- and advertise, you know, we' re going to 23 have a twenty ROI, return on investment on  your 24 money. We know how to churn these places. We  know 25 how to work the vacancy decontrol law. We' re going 2 
2 to get the MCI' s in place. We' re going to maximize 3 your money. You' re going to get a twenty percent 4 ROI.5 So after all these years  looking 6 back, there' s probably been some years that this 7 Board has -- should of had a zero increase.  Now 8 we' re -- and it didn' t. It felt compelled to even 9 give in years when there was almost zero  inflation,10 zero cost control, it still gave landlords  an 11 increase.12 This year you should think about 13 instead of just focusing on the indexes  of 14 landlords' cost of operating their building,  you 15 should look at the economics of living in New  York 16 City and being a tenant and whether peoples'  jobs 17 and salaries are going up.18 How much disposal income they 19 have.	How much eggs costs. How much a gallon  of 20 gasoline is. Sure, I know it' s going to be  a21 hardship on everyone.	And I' m urging you to think 22 this year about the number zero to make up  for 23 maybe some mistakes you made in the  past.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 ( Audience Participation.)2

CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any questions? ( No response.)CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.( Audience participation.)CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Council Member ( Audience Participation.) CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One second. He will be followed by  Pete Then Marian Ziemski; and Then I want to remind  everybody 
14 that those who want to speak, the sign- in is  going 15 to be open for another fifteen minutes. If you  want 16 to speak and you haven' t given us a sheet,  the 17 sign- up will be ready in another fifteen minutes.18 Right after Councilman Barron 19 we' ll take Council Member Gioia.20 And then we' ll go to Pete Maresma;21 and 22 Marian Ziemski.23 Go ahead. I' m sorry.24 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	Well,25 let me just say that, you know, I know   these 14 
2 hearings are sometimes an exercise in futility  that 3 you expect us to cheer and boo and by law you   have 4 to have the hearing.	And many of you may not  live 5 the way tenants have to live in  my district.	Many6 of you may not have to suffer the things  that 7 tenants are suffering in our  district.8 But I want to assure you that  as 9 rents increase, we' re looking at a class war, a10 race war.	Race and class is always a  factor.11 Most of you already know that  43 12 percent of New Yorkers are paying over  fifty 13 percent of their salaries in rent. And most of  you 14 know that you have the power to make a   difference,15 to keep it at zero.	Many people are leaving New 16 York City because they can' t afford to live here 17 anymore.	But we are saying we are here to   stay.18 We are going to fight  --19 ( Audience Participation.)20 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	-- by 21 any means necessary the way we have to fight. And   I22 think we probably need to reform this board and  how 23 people get elected to this board.	Because one of 24 the problems we have -- and I said, many people   on 25 the board may not understand the suffering of  our 2 
2 people in our districts.3 You' re looking at people -- and I4 noticed that, you know, when Christine Quinn  comes 5 or Marty Markowitz comes and says zero,  nobody 6 booed.	But then when others come and say  zero,7 then you get a difference, whether it' s a  black 8 person getting up, then the booing  starts.9 But whether we boo or cheer,  the 10 bottom line is that this City has to be  concerned 11 about those who are affected most.	And there are 12 ways.	If we don' t just look at the Pricing 13 Indexing and we look at the incomes and  expenses 14 that people have to deal with in our City, we   could 15 keep this place affordable and landlords can  still 16 manage to make something. But not at the expense  of 17 people in our districts.18 We' re fighting in Starrett City.19 We' re fighting in Meadowbrooks and Emerald Green.20 We' re fighting in Cypress. And most of our 21 developments we' re fighting and we have people that 22 are not going to tolerate  this.23 This City is going to  be 24 unavailable for all of us if those in power don' t25 do the things to bring relief to the people who   are 2 
2 suffering most. Everybody probably said that  you 3 can hear that. And I don' t think you probably  are 4 listening anymore because you' ve been here for so 5 long.6 But I just want to encourage  you 7 to do one thing, that you should use  your 8 conscience in this one. You should listen to  the 9 people that are affected most and do the  right 10 thing.	Keep it flat. Keep it zero. There are  times 11 when this economy is going to turn around and  be 12 beneficial to most of us in this  City.13 This is not the time to  penalize 14 the neediest people in this city.	We have a $ 60 15 billion budget. A $ 124 billion State budget.16 There' s a $ 4 . 5 billion surplus. They' re building 17 stadiums.	Nobody is stopping anybody from  building 18 a Yankee Stadium, a Nets Stadium. They' re going to 19 have a nice home to play sports. But people  who 20 need to live in a decent home, you can' t --  you 21 don' t have the money for.22 ( Audience participation.)23 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON: It is 24 time to do this for the people. So I' m just  going 25 to encourage you, as I wrap up and finish   because 2 
2 my time is up, don' t just treat this as  another 3 hearing were people ventilate it and you heard  them 4 by law and then you go ahead and do what   you 5 intended to do before we even opened up our  mouths.6 So I encourage you listen to the people because  the 7 people are the ones that make this City what it   is 8 today.9 Thank you very much.10 ( Audience Participation.)11 MS. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.13 Schleider, go ahead.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.15 A very impassioned speech.	I' d16 like say to well crafted, but we' ll reserve that.17 The City Council passed the 18 stadium funding.	Am I incorrect on  that?19 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	Keep 20 talking.21 ( Audience Participation.)22 MS. SCHLEIDER:	Two years ago I23 said that the City Council needs to do more,  not 24 just pass money for stadiums, but take that  money 25 and put it back into the renters' pockets ' cause 2 
2 it' s an income problem here, right?3 What about the renters' tax 4 rebate? Why hasn' t the City Council done that?5 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	Talk 6 to your Mayor about that.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Wait, wait,8 wait. You' re the City Council. You come in and  you 9 tell this Board --10 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	Right.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That this Board 12 has the power to do  --13 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	You 14 do.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No, we don' t.16 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON: You 17 have -- no, I didn' t say you have the power  to 18 build stadiums. You have the power to say zero  to 19 rent.	Let me work on my City Council. Let' s make  a20 deal. Let' s make a deal.21 ( Audience Participation.)22 MS. SCHLEIDER:	And you, sir,23 help supplement incomes --24 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON: Let' s25 make -- let' s --2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You, sir, have 3 the power to supplement incomes, which you haven' t4 done --5 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	Let' s6 make a deal.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- year after 8 year after year.9 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	Let' s10 make a deal. I will support, and we have   supported,11 renters' rebates.	We support landlord rebates,12 homeowners' rebates. We' ve done that. I' ve done my 13 job fighting for that in the  City Council.	But you 14 do --15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Not when all --16 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	How 17 are you going to vote?	How are you going to  vote?18MR. SCHLEIDER:	You say you 19voted --20COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	I21voted against those stadiums.	I voted against 22that.How are you going to  vote?23( Audience Participation.)24MR. SCHLEIDER:	But sir, what 25about the rest of your Council  Members?
2 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	Well,3 no. What about you and me, since you' re raising it.4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	How about the 5 rest of the Council.6 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	No.7 You' re raising it.	You' re raising the question,8 right?9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' ve raised the 10 question.11 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	Right.12 So how about -- right  --13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Why doesn' t the 14 Council do something about SCRIE?15 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON: How are 16 you going to vote? How are you going to  vote?17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Why doesn' t the 18 Council do more about DRIE?19 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	How 20 are you --21 ( Overlapping conversation.)22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Why doesn' t the 23 Council vote --24 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	Let me 25 ask you a question.2 

23	is not -- 4
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right. This COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	Wait.
5 Let me answer the question.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Answer the 7 question of Mr. Schleider.8 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON: Right.9 I want to ask you a  question.10 Since you -- sir, since you can' t11 control how your other members are going to vote,  I12 can' t control how my other City Council members are 13 going to vote. I voted against the stadium  money.14 You vote against a rent  hike.15 ( Audience Participation.)16 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	That' s17 what you could do. That' s what you could do.18 ( Audience Participation.)19 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON: You do 20 that.21 MS. SCHLEIDER:	But you don' t22 understand --23 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON: You 24 vote for --25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But you don' t5

CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Steve.Go ahead.	Magda.MS. CRUZ:	Thank you, Chairman. Council Member Barron, I know  that 
7 I speak for all the members of  this Board.	I want 8 to tell you that we all are listening to   the 9 problems that tenants are suffering and we are  all 10 considering that.11 And I think that you should  really 12 believe that because we spend many hours  reading 13 and discussing about all of these  issues.14 And I want to ask you a  question.15 Why do you think that a zero  rent 16 increase will serve your constituents?	Why do you 17 think that increasing -- not increasing the  rents18 at all are going to -- is going to help owners   that 19 are not being able to meet expenses, to continue  to 20 provide services for the tenants, to not want  to 21 sell the buildings to, as some people here  have 22 termed, predatory investors and speculators?23 Isn' t a zero increase exactly what 24 will cause these more serious problems  in 25 affordable --7 
2COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:I' m so 3glad you asked that question.4( Audience Participation.)5COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:No,6 really.	And I appreciate your sincerity,  although 7 I don' t think you can speak for all of your  Board 8 members.9 Let me say this:	I worked very 10 closely with Starrett City, very closely  with 11 Linden Plaza, very closely with Springfield.  Many 12 of those tenants are on  rent stabilization.	And 13 I' m telling you now that the owners, in most of  the 14 housing developments in my district, already  make 15 more profit, more profit than what you think.  Even 16 the ones in Mitchell- Lama who have to stayed there 17 and make six percent profit will not be hurt by   a18 zero increase.19 ( Applause.)20 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON: I' m21 just saying I think it' s a good question you' re 22 raising.	Because, you know, the way owners   always 23 tell us why you have to increase because  their 24 expenses go up. But when does our salaries go  up?25 See, the income of my  community 6 
2 doesn' t go up. You know what the AMI, the  Area 3 Median Income for my neighborhood is, $ 26 , 000 , if 4 that.	$ 26 , 000 . So I' m saying to you what zero 5 does, it gives us a chance to work on   increasing 6 our income.	And the only thing that will happen  is 7 that they will decrease some of the profits  that 8 they' re making.	They will not go out of  business.9 They will not be able to provide  services.10 And they run that -- it' s the same 11 thing the corporations do to us in the  City 12 Council. Don' t raise our taxes or else we' ll leave 13 because it will be too expensive for us to be   here.14 So my colleagues believe that  and 15 don' t raise their taxes. They stay here and they 16 maximize profits. There' s a lot of money to be  made 17 in New York City. And we' re working on some  state 18 legislation and even some things in the  City 19 Council where in Starrett City we' re even looking 20 at increasing the amount of subsidies coming  from 21 the State for landlords.22 Don' t take it out on the people.23 Let the State, the City and the Federal  Government 24 help the landlords, not out of the peoples'  pockets 25 whose income has not been  increased.2 
2 ( Audience Participation.)3 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON: So I' m4 encouraging you to vote for the zero and then  let' s5 work together.	And as you said, sir, I will  work 6 on my colleagues in the  City Council.	I have ever 7 since I' ve been there.8 I voted no for Yankee Stadium,  no 9 for the Ratner Stadium. I' ve got to get more of  my 10 colleagues to do that.	But if you vote yes for  a11 zero income, and if you vote yes for a   zero 12 increase, that' s the beginning of us looking for 13 other solutions other than milking the poor  people 14 of our neighborhoods.15 ( Audience Participation.)16 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	I17 thank you for the question.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One more 19 question.20 Mr. Languedoc.21 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Good evening.22 This is not really so much  a23 question.	But just to respond to one of the  points 24 that' s been made a few times about we' re tired of 25 listening to the different speakers and what' s the 2 
2 point of coming to speak and that kind of thing  of 3 what we heard.4 I know I for one have  been 5 listening very carefully to everything that 6 everyone has said. And I' m not tired. And I7 wouldn' t want anyone who' s going to be coming up or 8 thinking of coming up to speak to think that,  you 9 know -- I' m pretty sure most of my colleagues,  if 10 not all, are paying careful attention to  everything 11 everyone is saying.12 So I don' t want any potential 13 future speakers this evening to feel  discouraged 14 that we' re not paying attention because I think --15 I mean I know I  am.16 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	Well,17 if there' s anything I ever wanted to be wrong in  my 18 life on, that' s one thing. I hope I am wrong  and 19 you are right.	I hope you are really  listening.20 It' s just that we' ve been to so 21 many hearings in so many settings where you say  all 22 the things that make sense, and then when  the 23 meeting is over, boom, we get hit with  increases.24 We get hit with whatever the intentions were  prior 25 to the hearings.2 
2 So that' s -- I hope -- once again,3 I hope that you' re right about that. And I hope  you 4 consider no increases because I think that we  can 5 come together and think of other ways of  generating 6 revenue for landlords other than taking it out  of 7 the pockets for tenants who might be homeless  when 8 they' re hit with these kinds of things.9 ( Audience Participation.)10 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I agree.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 Thank you.13 ( Audience participation.)14 COUNCILMAN CHARLES BARRON:	Thank 15 you very much. Thank you.16 ( Audience Participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Council Member 18 Eric Gioia.19 COUNCILMAN ERIC GIOIA:	Good 20 evening.21 Thank you very much.22 My name is Eric Gioia. I  represent 23 Queens, Woodside, Sunnyside, Maspeth, Astoria and 24 Long Island City.25 It' s a pleasure to be with you all 2 
2 tonight. Thank you all very much for taking  the 3 time and coming down to Brooklyn this  evening.4 ( Applause.)5 COUNCILMAN ERIC GIOIA:	I have a6 prepared statement, which I won' t read. I' ll 7 provide it to the Board and I believe I' ve  already 8 handed it out.	I' ll try not even to use up all my 9 time.10 But I want to make a few  points.11 I was actually -- I was talking  to 12 my sister as I was driving over here tonight.  My 13 sister is a school teacher.	Her husband is a14 Corrections Officer. And she said something to  me 15 that I think is really  profound.16 When we were growing up, we  were 17 actually poor by any definition of income. And  my 18 sister said to me, we were poor but we always   felt 19 we were middle class. And she said, you know,  now 20 she' s a school teacher. Her husband is a21 Corrections Officer. By any definition, they  are 22 actually now middle class.	She said, but she feels 23 like she' s poor.24 And that really is profound, if 25 you think about that. Because there are  millions 2 
2 and millions of New Yorkers who are in my  sister' s3 boat, who are working harder than they' ve ever 4 worked, harder than their parents worked and  yet 5 they still can' t make ends meet.6 Today I issued a report with  the 7 Food Bank for New York.	They have been taking a8 survey over the past decade of New Yorkers  and 9 food. Amazingly enough, 3 . 1 million New Yorkers 10 responded to their survey that last year they  were 11 worried at some point about putting food on  their 12 family' s table.	That' s an extraordinary,13 extraordinary statistic.14 Almost half of New Yorkers  were 15 worried at some point last year they couldn' t  put 16 food on the table and it' s no wonder why. The  price 17 of eggs in the past three years has gone up   64 18 percent.19 The price of bread in the  past 20 three years has gone up 35  percent.21 The price of milk in the  past 22 three years has gone up 22 percent.	But we all 23 know people' s wages have stayed flat.	So when you 24 look at that and you realize that the  most 25 expensive thing in most New Yorker' s life, their 2 
2 biggest expense is their rent, you know that  there 3 are New Yorkers who are making decisions  they 4 should never had to make, not in this city, not   in 5 the country, not in this century. They  are 6 literally --7 ( Applause.)8 COUNCILMAN ERIC GIOIA:	They are 9 literally watering down milk they' re giving to 10 their children because they can' t afford more.11 And so when you look at what  we 12 can control, and what we can do, I think this   is 13 something that we have to do for New Yorkers  which 14 is to hold rents stable.15 And not for a second do I  think 16 every landlord is a bad landlord. Not at all.  I' ve 17 met bad landlords. I' ve sued bad landlords but I' ve 18 also met a lot of landlords who cared deeply  about 19 their tenants.20 But it' s time that we realize that 21 as this City, we are all in this together. And   if 22 we don' t act, people will suffer.23 So I thank you very much for  your 24 time.25 ( Applause.)2 

23	questions?4
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do we have any MS. ADAMS:	One of the problems 
5 that we have is that the quote, good landlords  and 6 the quote, not so good landlords, that we can' t7 make any kind of discretion between the  two.8 Whatever this Board votes as an increase  or 9 stabilization or whatever, applies to  everyone.10 Do you have anything to offer  us 11 that would help us in dealing  with that?	Because a12 lot of, especially the smaller landlords who  own 13 either the buildings that they live or less than  a14 hundred units, are saying that they cannot  continue 15 to do what they' ve been doing with no increase and 16 that' s a real problem.17 ( Audience participation.)18 COUNCILMAN ERIC GIOIA:	It' s a19 great question and a very thoughtful question and  I20 think that' s exactly where this dialogue should go.21 In my district -- and Ms.  Cruz 22 raised the idea of this  predatory equity.	I' m23 faced with that in my district, some  companies 24 coming in and using -- suing a lot of the   tenants 25 saying that their tenancy is not valid, these  kind 5 
2 of blanket lawsuits against everyone in  the 3 building, eighty percent of the folks in  the 4 building.5 And I met with one of  the 6 landlords. And they said to me, you know, we' re  not 7 one of the bad guys. We' ve come in. We' ve fixed all 8 the violations.	And I said, you know, you don' t9 actually get points in my books for following  the 10 law. Like, that' s what you have to do. You  know,11 tenants should have hot water and windows that  work 12 and front door locks.13 And so I think it almost  --14 there' s, I think, a mentality that in order for 15 tenants to live in affordable housing, that  almost 16 by definition they have to live in squalor. And  I17 think that -- so I think we have to move   the 18 yardstick and say that, in fact, tenants have  a19 right to live in clean housing, in housing  that 20 they' re proud of, in neighborhoods they can afford.21 That is what every New Yorker, that should be  the 22 goal.23 And so in terms of what I think  of 24 what is a good landlord, it' s not just a  landlord 25 who' s coming in and making repairs. To me, you 2 
2 know, I guess it' s not just landlords frankly. The 3 level of expectation in this City is  so low.	I4 often think that -- as a politician, people say  to 5 me, well, you' ve been in office six years and  you 6 haven' t gone to jail. God bless you.	And I think 7 it speaks to how low our level of expectation  is 8 that if you look at a landlord and they don' t  have 9 a hundred violations in their building, I mean  that 10 shouldn' t be the norm. And by the way, I don' t11 think actually it is the  norm.12 But I think that -- as I said,  you 13 shouldn' t get points for following the law. And so 14 I think we need to change the  yardsticks.15 But to get to the heart of  your 16 question, I think it is where this dialogue  should 17 be.18 MS. ADAMS:	Can I press it a19 little further?20 COUNCILMAN ERIC GIOIA:	Sure.21 MS. ADAMS:	And that is, we' ve had 22 some landlords, particularly those who are  dealing 23 with units that don' t cost an awful lot and  have 24 been dealing with them for a long time,  whose 25 increases have been in the neighborhood of $ 50 and 2 
2 $ 60 a year.	And they' re saying, hey, with the 3 increases that we' re seeing now in fuel and water 4 and everything else, there' s no way.5 COUNCILMAN ERIC GIOIA:	And in 6 fairness, I will say, and some of you may know,  I' m7 a persistent critic of Con Edison.	Utility rates 8 -- as I get laughs from  the crowd.	Stock up on 9 water and nonperishable goods, by the way, as  the 10 weather gets hot.11 But the -- I have no doubt  that 12 there are people out there who are struggling  to 13 make their buildings work. And I think that  a14 system where you are looking out for  those 15 expectations without having a blanket  increase,16 would be appropriate.17 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you very much.18 COUNCILMAN ERIC GIOIA:	Any other 19 questions?20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any questions?21 ( No response.)22 COUNCILMAN ERIC GIOIA:	Thank you 23 very much for your time.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We appreciate 25 it.

ZHU LIN QIAO:	So it' s one 23 point.24 Another point that tenants 25 supposed to face this problem too and maybe  law 5 
2 supposed to be changed with landlords supposed  to 3 heat building at fifty degrees Fahrenheit versus  55 4 so would be a saving.	Some people may put my 5 clothes, buy portable heater, or go to Florida,  --6 ( Laughter & applause.)7 MR. ZHU LIN QIAO:	-- right? So 8 second point.9 I know some details of  landlord 10 open book at Riverdale.	He pay, though thousand 11 dollars per week.	Another one called doctor,12 thousand dollars a week. And so, you know, came  out 13 expenses, you know, somehow --14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	High.15 MR. ZHU LIN QIAO:	-- high.16 That' s the problem.17 The reason why I talk here  because 18 I have two children, 26 and 28  years old.	And they 19 have problem to rent because apartment in  Midtown 20 was $ 3200 a month.	And so those should be  together 21 for living and so they can' t the start living.22 And this one say when we  have 23 landlords and then lawyers, hurts New York City  and 24 hurts your U.

LEDYS VELEZ:	Yes.	Good 22 evening.	Okay.23 First of all, I am very,  very 24 respectful and I want to be listen and because I   am 25 not emotionally. I like to think.	And I am 13 
2 listening to the tenants as well to the  landlord.3 And each one of you deserve respect as well  as.4 Members of the Rent Guidelines 5 Board, my name is Ledys Velez.	And I would like to 6 first say to the tenants, landlords, you, for  the 7 opportunity speak to you today and tell you how  I8 feel and for the Rent Guidelines Board to  must 9 approve a fair guidelines this  year.10 I am part of a dying breed in  New 11 York City too.	I am a small owner with  the 12 eight- family building in Brooklyn.	That doesn' t13 mean that I have big bucks because I   don' t.	And I14 don' t expect to sell the house at this present 15 time.16 This year we are really  worried 17 about the fuel cost and the prospect of the  less 18 than friendly winter.	For us we had to add cost  of 19 Section 8 tenants.	When I say added cost, I  mean 20 it.	We are forced to make a subsidized --  I' m21 sorry for my Puerto Rican accent -- housing for  New 22 York City residents.23 We are losing money on the  rent 24 that we would be collect. I know many people  here 25 are hard working people and really which I  admire 2 
2 and respect you.	And this tenant has been  nothing 3 but trouble.4 Here you can be specific of  what 5 kind of issues that I' m going to present to  you 6 today. Low rent.7 Ten years Section 8 pay us $ 668 8 with no increase at all.	First of all, when I  send 9 the lease, they didn' t honor the lease. They send 10 me another one. I send to them one. I called to   --11 I called them and I went in person. So they told   me 12 that they can do nothing, just sign the  lease.13 And I refused to sign the  lease.14 Why? The building is quiet. It' s clean. It' s in 15 good shape. After I complain about the tenants  each 16 of Section 8 and I bought so many new stoves.  I' m17 talking about four stoves, three  refrigerators.18 Section 8 don' t do nothing. The tenant report for 19 pest infestation and guess what, I saw one day  her 20 putting a mice on the  stairs.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' re going 22 to have to wrap up.23 MS. LEDYS VELEZ:	Uh- huh.24 And first of all, too, she  bring 25 another -- another person to live in the  apartment 2 
2 without telling me or Section 8 . And according  to 3 Section 8 policy and regulation, she can' t do  that 4 because right away the lease was broke.	And I went 5 back to the Section 8  --6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What you are 7 recommending in terms of the level of  rent 8 increase?9 MS. ADAMS:	For rent stabilized.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	For rent 11 stabilized.12 MS. LEDYS VELEZ:	But that' s one.13 Okay?	According --14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 15 give us an recommendation because you' re out of 16 time.17 MS. LEDYS VELEZ:	Okay.	The Rent 18 Guideline Board proposed a range of 3 . 5 to seven 19 percent for a one- year lease.	And 5 . 5 percent 9 . 520 percent for two- year lease.	This will not cover 21 the single operation of the cost of the  fuel.22 Operating costs are out of 23 control.	The heating water rates and  insurance 24 costs are increasing.	The Rent Guidelines Board 25 has historically voted on guidelines that  are 2 
 2 twenty percent below operating cost.	This year 3 it' s critical that owners get a fair rent  guideline 4 so they are not forced to sell their buildings  and 5 our property.	Like happening in California --6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right.7 Thank you.8 MS. LEDYS VELEZ:	No. I didn' t9 finish.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to 11 finish in the three minutes.12 MS. LEDYS VELEZ:	I came here so 13 let me finish. Let me  finish.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, just 15 tell us what you want.16 MS. LEDYS VELEZ:	Okay. I want --17 according to the Price Index of the Cost, my   fuel 18 bill has raised from $ 900 to $ 1800 .19 My insurance cost from $ 5000 --20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Tell us what 21 you want.	We know that. What would you  recommend.22 MS. LEDYS VELEZ:	Well, the thing 23 is that major increase and that Mayor  Bloomberg 24 don' t force us to accept Section 8 and besides that 25	--2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have 3 nothing to do with that.4 Ma' am, what increase do you want?5 MS. LEDYS VELEZ:	Increase of rent 6 and besides that --7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	A lot?

ELANA SHREYER:	Elana.9 Good evening. My name is  Elana 10 Shreyer. And I am a community organizer with  the 11 Pratt Area Community Council.12 I came here to speak on behalf  of 13 a tenant that called me yesterday when he  heard 14 about the hearings that were going  on.15 But first I' d just like to note 16 that it sounds like we agree on a couple of   items 17 here.18 One, that the system is not 19 working the way it' s structured right now and we 20 need to change that.21 ( Applause.)22 MS. ELANA SHREYER:	But No. 2 , No.23 2 , the Rent Guidelines Board, as it' s currently 24 structured has the power to freeze a rent -- to   not 25 do a rent increase this year and that' s what we' re 2 

2	asking for.3
I think you' ve heard from some 
4 pretty compelling stories about how the  rent 5 burdens are increasing for tenants every year  yet 6 their incomes are not increasing.7 You' ve heard stories about 8 landlords' costs are going up but every year  they 9 get a rent increase despite not making repairs  in 10 buildings, despite not providing an increase  in 11 services to the tenants they' re serving.12 ( Applause.)13 MS. ELANA SHREYER:	Despite 14 continued harassment in buildings.15 ( Applause.)16 MS. ELANA SHREYER:	And you' ve 17 also heard about a new type of landlord that' s18 buying up rent stabilized housing at  exorbitant 19 rates and systematically harassing our tenants.20 One of our tenant leaders  spoke 21 tonight about the incredible turnover in  his 22 building. Thirty- six units have become 23 unstabilized.	Those landlords are not suffering.24 They' re making way more money on those unregulated 25 apartments. They don' t need a rent increase.4 
2 ( Audience participation.)3 MS. ELANA SHREYER:	So I' m asking 4 you not to increase tonight. Surprise us  this 5 evening. Surprise us this time before we make  those 6 changes to the Rent Guidelines Board.	Pass no 7 increase.8 But I' d also like to share what 9 Mr. Douglas Pool of 1022 Bedford Avenue, in the  Bed 10 Stuy section of Brooklyn told me  yesterday.11 Since 1960 he' s lived in this 12 building, about 48 years.	He' s 88 years old and 13 couldn' t make it tonight because he has 14 osteoarthritis in both his knees, high  cholesterol 15 and high blood pressure and it' s difficult for him 16 to get around.17 But he wanted to say that a  rent 18 increase is not fair. He lives on a fixed  income 19 and he pays 32 percent of his income in rent.   Last 20 year alone he got a seventy- three percent rise in 21 his rent because of fuel  costs.22 It' s unclear to me why the Rent 23 Guidelines Board would increase the cost --  would 24 increase the rents and pass that burden along  to 25 tenants who are also facing increased costs in  all 2 
2 areas of their lives.3 Mr. Pool is protected as a  rent 4 controlled tenant, but his neighbors aren' t. He 5 sees that his neighborhood is changing and  he 6 doesn' t want you to pass an increase this year.	He 7 thinks if there ought to be an increase and if   he 8 had to face it, he' d be stalemated. So he wants  you 9 to take this load off his back and his  neighbors 10 back by voting for a zero percent increase  this 11 year.12 ( Audience Participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 Joy Taylor.

JOYCE BRAYBOY:	Good evening,16 everyone.17 My name is Joyce Brayboy. I' m a18 tenant in -- I live in East New York,  Brooklyn.19 And my development is owned by one of these  major 20 developers.21 Now to you, Mr. Markus, I spoke  to 22 you last year at the same -- the same  time.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.24 MS. JOYCE BRAYBOY:	And the 25 landlord' s name is the Arcer Companies.2 
2 This developer has done a  unique 3 thing. Some of the smaller landlords have done  it 4 because their costs are very high to maintain  for 5 the fuel and utility and heat and how water.  Well,6 now they -- this landlord has put this on  the 7 tenants who are supposed to be living in a   rent 8 stabilized building that is supposed to be  low 9 income, affordable housing.	And me, I' m on a fixed 10 income myself. There are senior citizens in  there.11 I have two children that I' m12 raising, one eleven, one twenty.	And you could 13 imagine the costs that I' m incurring right now 14 dealing with paying for heat, hot  water,15 electricity, and cooking gas. That' s everything 16 that a landlord used top take  care of.	Now the 17 tenant has it.18 Last year when you passed those,19 that increase, we didn' t get a -- they didn' t20 subsidize the fact -- subsidize for the fact  that 21 the tenants who pay for their own heat and  hot 22 water, we got nothing. So we got the same  increase 23 across the board as any other tenants that wasn' t24 paying for heat or hot  water.25 And it' s unfair to us. It' s unfair 2 
2 to me because now like some people can go  to 3 Florida. I can' t go to Florida. I can' t even -- I4 can barely afford $ 2 for the train. So I don' t5 understand how this is possible. Landlords  getting 6 an increase?	They have loopholes, they have tax 7 abatements, they have all of this stuff where  we 8 are at.	And we don' t have anything. We can' t hold 9 on anything. We can' t claim the fact that a  boiler 10 broke down on our bills. We can' t do that when  we 11 file for taxes.12 I just got $ 600 this year. That' s13 it. This is the first time I ever got money   back 14 because of what the Mayor did. So now next  year 15 coming up, where am I going to live at? Because   if 16 the increases go up and I' m not considered for  the 17 fact that I also pay for heat just like  any 18 landlord does, what happens to us? Where I am   going 19 to live at? Where are my children going to live   at?20 No one cares. Landlords have loopholes and  tenants 21 have hellholes because we' re faced with these rent 22 increases that are putting people on the  street 23 every single day.24 ( Audience Participation.)25 MS. JOYCE BRAYBOY:	We' ve lost 2 
 2 over thirty- something people in my development 3 alone last year because people cannot afford  to 4 maintain these rent increases and also pay  bills 5 for heat and hot water  and electricity.	And 6 because of the way building is built, we' ve got  to 7 have cable because the -- the wires are crossed.  We 8 can' t even watch TV. We can' t even watch Channel 5 ,9 Channel 7 , Channel 11 News. So we have to get  cable 10 because of the way the landlord made this  building 11 and it' s unfair to us.12 Thank you.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We appreciate 14 it.	And we have in the past, you   know,15 differentiated for the tenant. We didn' t last year 16 because the numbers didn' t show it.	But this year 17	--18 MS. JOYCE BRAYBOY:	It didn' t.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	-- we' re going 20 to look at it and if it' s justified, I' m sure we' ll 21	--22 MS. JOYCE BRAYBOY:	We shouldn' t23 get any because we suffered last year.

But as a broker 19 and a property manager, I represent mainly mom  and 20 pop owners, one or two buildings, mainly  Caribbean,21 Hispanics, minorities and elderlies.22 And I go to court on their  behalf 23 most everyday.

JACQUES MICHAANE:	And of 16 course, bad judges.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 Susan Vargas.19 MS. SUSAN VARGAS:	Hi. My name is 20 -- hi, my name --21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Shhh.22 MS. SUSAN VARGAS:	Hi.	My name is 23 Susan Vargas.24 I live in the neighborhood  of 25 Bushwick.	And I appreciate you all listening  to 2 
2 what I have to say this  evening.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You didn' t4 come from Bushwick originally saying you  all.5 MS. SUSAN VARGAS:	No, sir. I6 come from Texas.	I came to this great State of  New 7 York to live in New York City thinking that it   was 8 just the greatest place to live. I like living  here 9 but the rent issue is a  nightmare.10 I moved into rent stabilization.  I11 have lived here for 24 years. I have not lived   in 12 rent stabilization for 24 years.	But when I did 13 move in, you know, my apartment wasn' t represented 14 correctly to me by my landlord.	I didn' t know 15 about DHCR. I didn' t know about rent stabilization 16 really. But I found out. I  learned.17 And then, you know, we  face 18 increases but the landlord, in my case, has  a19 mortgage -- it' s a corporation. He has 20 subcorporations.	Has a mortgage where he doesn' t21 represent even the tenants that live there  before.22 He does not represent them. It' s all Spanish. I' m23 the lone white person in there. But he has  all 24 white women listed as living in the  building.25 That' s dishonest.2 
2 I came into this supposedly  newly 3 created apartment, it was, because it was  a4 division.	And they doubled the rent from what  DHCR 5 had it from just as a regular two- bedroom 6 apartment. I' ve got about forty percent of that.7 So he' s not only making my rent at 8 double but he increased the other side of it  ' cause 9 they get about sixty percent. He' s making those 10 rents. He' s not counting both of those rents 11 because he' s not reporting it. He' s reporting it as 12 a vacant apartment to DHCR. You can' t do  that.13 And I just -- my big question  to 14 y' all, I realize the fuel costs, taxes increase,15 I' m not stupid. But I think that landlords  should 16 be held accountable. And I feel that the  Rent 17 Guidelines Board, that you all could hold  them 18 accountable.	If they are going to get an   increase,19 then why don' t they have to apply for it like  we 20 have to apply to get into an apartment? Why don' t21 they have to prove their expenses.22 ( Applause.)23 MS. SUSAN VARGAS:	Why don' t they 24 have to prove that they' re not getting a  big 25 revenue?	Why don' t they have to prove -- in  my 2 
2 case, there are sixty violations in my  building.3 It' s supposed to be six units. They' ve made it 4 eight units. Why don' t they have to prove that 5 they' re taking care of those violations? Why don' t6 they have to get a certificate of occupancy.  Why 7 don' t they have to do all this and provide  us 8 services and we don' t have to call HPD and  then 9 they try to get us out of there as   retaliation.10 Why?11 ( Applause.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	On the apartment 13 split, do you have a complaint with  DHCR?14 MS. SUSAN VARGAS:	Yes, Yes, sir.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And what' s16 happened?17 MS. SUSAN VARGAS:	HPD has come a18 couple of times. The Fire Department had to  come 19 once and so they violated him.	Electric came. I20 was paying what I thought was my own  electricity 21 and then the other half of that apartment,  they 22 flipped the fuse, whatever you call it. And  they 23 came over and I found out then I was hooked up.   And 24 then I begged for Con Ed to come. It took   several 25 months to get Con Ed to come because Con Ed   could 2 
 2 not go into the basement to read the meters.  Nobody 3 would.4 Consequently when I took off  for 5 vacation and whenever they came, I was there.  I6 notified the landlord in writing and via  telephone.7 He did have someone there. Con Edison went  down 8 with me. Everybody' s paying electricity in the 9 building but the meters have all been cut. And  the 10 last time they had been read was October 30 , 2006 11	to May 27 , 2008 .12 And you can see all these  loose 13 wires hanging. We were told not to touch them.  It 14 was loose. It was live wires. And he had a bunch   of 15 duct tape around stuff where he was just  stealing 16 from Con Ed period.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	But at DHCR,18 what happened to your case?19 MS. SUSAN VARGAS:	Well, though 20 DHCR it' s still going -- through DHCR, that' s still 21 going on. I just have a docket number with  them.22 But I am in court with the landlord and the   --23 right now the judge has ordered that HPD do  another 24 official head- to- toe inspection.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank 12

MS. HOLDER:	How long have you 
4 been in place in your  apartment?5 MS. SUSAN VARGAS:	I' ve only lived 6 there for seven months now.7 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Seven months.9 MS. SUSAN VARGAS:	I haven' t lived 10 there for forever like a lot of these people  have.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' ve got to 12 hold on for seven months, you  know.13 MS. SUSAN VARGAS:	It does. If you 14 walked in, it' s a cute apartment. It looks like 15 it' s brand new, a studio. But my bathroom ceiling 16 has come down. The sinks ARE coming off of  the 17 wall. I found out there were no permits to ever   put 18 the gas lines that they did ' cause they put new  gas 19 and electric lines in there. I don' t even know  if 20 the original ones were kept up. They have stop  work 21 orders on --22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, call our 23 office in the morning. We' ll try to figure out 24 what' s going on in your building.25 MS. HOLDER:	Was the building in 4 
2 that condition when you moved into it seven  months?3 MS. SUSAN VARGAS:	What do you 4 mean, that the stuff was coming  down?5 MS. HOLDER: With the falling 6 ceilings and --7 MS. SUSAN VARGAS:	No, no. And it 8 was -- it really is primarily two repairs they  were 9 supposed to do above me that they  never did.	And 10 the people had to go  to court.	And when the Fire 11 Department came in, that next week they did.  But 12 they just repaired above me, not me. And I   stayed 13 home from work for two weeks for  this.14 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Do you have 15 counsel to represent you?16 MS. SUSAN VARGAS:	Yes, sir, I do.17 I have counsel in court.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 MS.

ALBERT LONG:	Long. Oh, I' m12 sorry.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Long, Mr.14 Long.	Sorry.15 MR. ALBERT LONG:	Yes. My name is 16 Albert Long.	And I represent Greenpoint in 17 Brooklyn.18 I own a six- family building that' s19 rent stabilized.	And I' d like the tenants to 20 realize that the expenses that have been  incurred,21 especially this year with the increased fuel  costs,22 the increased insurance costs, and water rates  have 23 gone up fourteen percent.24 And what must be realized, with  a25 zero percent rent increase, the incurred costs  by 6 
2 the landlords could be well over seventy  percent 3 for this year because there' s no relief for the 4 heat expense.5 In the wintertime the guidelines 6 state that, I believe it' s from the end  of 7 September until the end of May you must  maintain 8 the temperature -- when it' s outside at 55 degrees,9 you must maintain an inside temperature of  68 10 degrees.11 And just the fact, if you have  a12 zero percent increase, factor in some type  of 13 relief for the heat expense and the water  expenses.14 The water expense is a tenant- controlled item.15 ( Audience participation.)16 MR. ALBERT LONG:	The landlord has 17 no control over that.	The tenants walk in the 18 bathroom, turns on the shower, keeps the  shower 19 running until they walk out of  there.20 The landlord has no control.  But 21 the landlord is paying fourteen percent for  the 22 water plus 159 percent for the sewer  charge.23 ( Audience participation.)24 MR. ALBERT LONG:	The heat.	The 25 fuel expense.	The landlord has -- you have  the 2 
2 boiler running. You maintain a 68  degree 3 temperature inside but tenants get hot.	They open 4 the window.5 ( Applause.)6 MR. ALBERT LONG:	You pay for 7 that fuel. The boiler works harder. You' re paying 8 for that.9 ( Audience participation.)10 MR. ALBERT LONG:	Well, I' m11 sorry.	Tenants are very quick to dial 311 for  no 12 heat but nothing is every stated for running  water,13 consistent shower on, windows open,  boilers 14 straining to keep heat.15 The thing that must be realized  is 16 that this is a give- and- take situation, especially 17 at times like this.	To expect a zero percent 18 increase in rent, well, what are the  tenants19 willing to give back?	Are they willing to give 20 back the mandated 68 degrees inside when it' s 55 21 outside?	Can that temperature be lowered to  65 22 degrees?23 The thing that' s looked at is that 24 everything has been weighted to state what can  the 25 landlord do for the tenant.	Everything has 2 
2 addressed the predatory buyers that seek to  have 3 the 300 , 400 - complex units.	But for the small 4 neighborhood landlord who wishes to maintain  the 5 current demographics of their building to keep  the 6 maintenance and the upkeep and still provide  the 7 mandated services, something must be realized  by 8 the Board as well as the tenants that there must   be 9 some compromise as to what an increase or even  a10 freeze, a freeze would have to give some type of   a11 compromise for the tenant.	That is my --12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank 13 you.14 ( Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,16 sir.17 Marcela Mitaynes;18 Followed by Dorothy 19 Sarantopoulous;20 Followed by Lillian Perkins;21 Followed by Constance 22 Nugent- Miller.23 MS. MARCELA MITAYNES:	Hi. My name 24 is Marcela Mitaynes.	And I resided most of my  life 25 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.2 
2 In 2006 , the building that I3 resided in was purchased by a landlord named  Jack 4 Awella ( phonetic) who also purchased nine other 5 buildings in the neighborhood.6 Within a year he has managed  to 7 empty out fifteen of the thirty apartments in  my 8 building. He has upgraded them for the MCI and  he 9 has also made it a point to rent out   to 10 out- of- towners.	He is very clear in not wanting  to 11 make any repairs to any of the  apartments,12 including mine, who was rent stabilized,  because 13 according to him he did not get enough money  to 14 make changes.15 He was also very clear in  stating 16 that he would make the changes when I left when   he 17 was able to get me  out.18 He has made some changes in  the 19 building to benefit anybody who was coming in  and 20 willing to pay the high rent. He had upgraded  the 21 electrical system. And he had to make a hole in   my 22 ceiling and my floor to run new electrical wire  for 23 the new tenant that came in from California  that 24 moved in above me.25 The last summer I spent not  being 2 
2 able to run the electricity, not being able to  use 3 my microwave and unable to use a toaster and   a4 blender in my apartment.5 He -- he -- he' s making it a  point 6 of trying to take us to court under false  pretenses 7 and accusations. He is in court at least  three 8 times a week with different tenants. And it' s  not 9 just happening in my building. He owns nine in  my 10 neighborhood.11 Mr. Awella drives a LandRover  and 12 has an apartment on Pitt Street in SoHo. I   am 13 asking and pleading that you do not make  an 14 increase for the rent. We cannot afford it. I   am 15 working -- I was looking at being  evicted.16 ( Applause.)17 MS. MARCELA MITAYNES:	I' m18 employed and my husband had become unemployed.  And 19 we went down to the Welfare office and we were   told 20 the $ 405 my husband received for unemployment was 21 too much for a family of  three.22 I was turned away. But not  before 23 running into my next door neighbor who was  also 24 evicted. They are using unethical practices to  get 25 rid of what is left of  affordable housing.	We need 2 
2 you to vote zero increase.3 ( Audience participation.)4 MS. MARCELA MITAYNES:	We are the 5 original New Yorkers.	Where are being pushed out 6 by out- of- towners willing to pay the top rent who 7 don' t know that when they turn around and leave,8 the landlord has a right to increase  twenty 9 percent.	They are willing to leave with them   being 10 three months.	There was a couple -- there was  a11 family that moved into my building that was  only 12 there for three months and left because of  the 13 conditions in the building.14 That couple that moved above me 15 from California waited until the lease was up  and 16 then left. And this is exactly what they want.  They 17 know what they' re doing when they are buying these 18 low income, rent stabilized rent  controlled 19 apartments. In a couple of years they can manage  to 20 makeup what they invested and much  more.21 Mr. Awella purchased my building 22with over 300 violations.23( Audience Participation.)24CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 25wrap up.

Thank you.( Audience participation.) CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Dorothy, is MS. DOROTHY SARANTOPOULOS:	Yes. CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.MS. DOROTHY SARANTOPOULOS: Members
9	of the Rent Guidelines Board  --10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Introduce 11 yourself. Go ahead.12 MS. DOROTHY SARANTOPOULOS: Yes.13 -- my name is Dorothy 14 Sarantopoulous.15 I would like to first thank  you 16 for the opportunity to speak to you today and   tell 17 you why I feel the RGB must approve a   fair 18 guideline this year.19 My family owns a legal single  room 20 occupancy property in Brooklyn, class A, in  Bay 21 Ridge, Brooklyn.	It has 36 residential units.	It 22 is an electric inclusion building which means  that 23 none of the tenants pay for their own  utilities 24 such as gas, electricity or  water.25 We are asking for your help  in 10 
2 granting SRO' s a fair guideline to meet the 3 overwhelming increase in operating costs this  year.4 What is unique to SROs like  ours 5 is that the owner pays all the utilities. In   the 6 last twelve months this has been a  tremendous 7 burden on us.8 From May ' 07 to May ' 08 we have 9 paid over $ 25 , 000 for gas, for heating and for hot 10 water. For electricity we have paid over $ 25 , 000 as 11 well. And water, sewer another $ 7 , 000 . Not one 12 penny can be passed onto the  tenants.13 We are asking for a  modest 14 increase so that we can at least meet our  increased 15 expenses and make deferred repairs to the  building.16 Our tax assessment on the  building 17 has gone up and also our liability and  fire 18 insurance despite having no claims. In other  words,19 none of our expenses have gone down but  have 20 increased by more than 25 percent in the last  year 21 yet rents have remained the same. And yet  again,22 the proposal for Hotel Order # 38 is to  grant 23 another zero percent increase.24 We would also like to point  out 25 that New York State DHCR has allowed an 18 . 28 2 
2 percent increase in the air conditioning  surcharge 3 for electric inclusion buildings payable by  tenants 4 who provide their own air conditioners  recognizing 5 an 18 . 28 percent increase in the price of 6 electricity.	Yet SRO tenants rents have  remained 7 frozen from the previous hotel order.8 I also point out that last year  at 9 our building most of the tenant air  conditioning 10 surcharges were either not collected or  not 11 collectable from our tenants who installed  their 12 own air conditioners.13 Here are examples of how are  costs 14 have increased.15 According to the Price Index  of 16 Operation Costs, fuel costs have increased 37 . 417 percent.18 Our heating and gas bill has  risen 19 from $ 1500 a month to over $ 2200 a month.20 Suffice it to say that most of  the 21 tenants are long- term tenants and residents in the 22 Bay Ridge community for an average of five  years.23 Hard to believe, but we have one rent  controlled 24 tenant who pays just $ 30 a week which includes  all 25 utilities.2 
2 We cannot complete building 3 improvements or major capital projects such as  a4 new roof. Unexpected costs have come up.  For 5 example --6 A VOICE:	Time.7 MS.

DOROTHY SARANTOPOULOS:	Yes.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have gotten 20 no increases from us in  --21 MS.

Okay?	$ 10 food 14 stamps.15 Affordable housing.	That' s just a16 word. That' s just a word.	Okay?	It' s not 17 affordable. You know why?	If you make $ 1 over,18 you' re not eligible for the luxury apartment.	It 19 is too much for supposedly  affordable.20 I applied for Section 8 in  1991 21 when I got hurt on  my job.	Okay? In 2005 I  think 22 they called me and they asked me for everything  but 23 to see what I made every week. And after  that,24 that' s what they told me, no, you were a little  bit 25 too much over.2 
2 You have younger kids, younger 3 people who are running around who are  getting 4 Section 8 which take them in New York to   anyplace 5 you want to go. Okay?6 Now, speaking about going up in 7 rents. We' re speaking about all the charges going 8 up. If you notice, it hasn' t snowed since I  have 9 moved in. So far the weather has been so good.   You 10 know, so all those fuel charges you' re talking 11 about you spending so much money on, it' s  false.12 The landlords, I' m going to speak about them.13 I have been in my apartment  since 14 1976 , ' 76 .	I have four and a half rooms.  Okay.15 When I moved there, my rent was $ 238 in  1976 .	We 16 were signing three- year leases at that time. They 17 changed --18 ( Audience Participation.)19 MS. LILLIAN PERKINS:	Please 20 don' t.	Let me finish.21 They changed it.

And I must  tell 22 you every morning I get up I am met with   stress,23 distress, everything. I don' t even sleep well at 24 night.25 The fuel costs are frightening. I2 
 2 used to pay $ 2 . 30 a gallon.	I have 550 gallons for 3 that six- family that I have to fill. It has gone  up 4 to so tremendously that when I get the bill,  I' m5 afraid to open it.6 I used to pay on an average  of 7 about $ 1 , 055 , which would last me on average an 8 average winter, not a rough winter, ten days  in 9 like the month of January.	That means I require 10 two fill- ups for the month.	The last fill- up I11 got, which was in early April, I got the bill for  12	$ 2 , 039 .	Okay?13 Where are we going with this?	I14 have long- standing tenants.	I have somebody living 15 in my building for thirty years. I have  large,16 three- bedroom units.	Old construction, 1931 .	You 17 don' t see them this size anymore.18 One side of the building is  a19 three. The next side you can even do a four if   you 20 don' t want the formal dining room with the french 21 doors and everything.22 I have a tenant that' s paying $ 755 23 for a large three- bedroom.	The other one across 24 from here is paying $ 840 . We have done MCIs over 25 the year. It' s an immaculate building.	A little 13 
2 repair brickwork that does need to be done  but 3 there' s no way.

2 MS. MOLLY BRHANI:	Hi. My name is 3 Molly Brhani. I' m part owner of a building in 4 Staten Island, 42 - unit.5 There is no housing shortage  in 6 Staten Island. If you open the Staten  Island 7 Advance, there' s 200 apartments available. And my 8 problem is not with rent stabilization, it' s with a9 few people that pay so little it cost me more   to 10 maintain their apartment.11 For example, a few of  our 12 apartments are paying $ 500 , $ 570 for a two- bedroom 13 rental. It cost more than that to maintain  that 14 apartment.15 ( Applause.)16 MS. MOLLY BRHANI:	Fifty percent 17 of my tenants do not even pay the legal rent.   They 18 pay a preferential rent because I can' t rent  them.19 I have good tenants. I want to keep them. There   are 20 some tenants I haven' t raised in three years.21 They' re good tenants. They' re 22 paying and I feel it' s a fair market rent $ 875 ,23 $ 900 , $ 950 . I don' t raise their rents. It' s the ten 24 tenants, fifteen that are paying way too  low.25 ( Applause.)2 
2 MS. MOLLY BRHANI:	No single woman 3 with a two- bathroom apartment is paying $ 550 . It' s4 costing me more to maintain that. My father owns  a5 studio, one room and he' s paying $ 450 maintenance.6 So figure how much it' s costing without taxes. How 7 much it' s costing me to maintain. So I' m paying for 8 them to live.9 I offered to move her into  a10 one- bedroom. No. They don' t have to.11 I' m just proposing that tenants 12 that are paying below $ 900 , below $ 700 have a13 surcharge of some sort --14 ( Audience Participation.)15 MS. MOLLY BRHANI:	-- besides the 16 increase.	It' s not -- it' s not that I' m saying --17 you know, I' m not. If you look at my rent roll,  I18 am not charging the legal rents because I  can' t19 rent them for the legal rents. For the ones  that 20 have moved out, I' m charging fair market.21 But they' re subsidizing the $ 500 22 tenant. I have a $ 550 tenant that' s a pharmacist.23 He makes three times what I do. I work twelve   hour 24 days. I manage my own building because I   cannot 25 afford a manager. We do our own maintenance  because 2 
2 we can' t afford maintenance.3 We change the roof.	Most of them 4 if I wanted to surcharge the majority, I  can' t5 because if I apply for a Major Capital  Improvement,6 my taxes are going to increase. My taxes went  from 7 $ 38 , 000 to 56 in six years --8 ( Applause.)9 MS. MOLLY BRHANI:	-- because they 10 feel that' s how much the market went. My water 11 bill, forget about it. They don' t -- the tenants 12 don' t watch the water. They keep running it. They 13 should be penalized for that.14 Some of the tenants will call  311 15 on heat and they have their windows open. And  some 16 of them they pay their own heat and they  don' t17 complain but there' s other expenses. There' s water 18 expenses. There' s taxes. My insurance went 19 sky- high. And the only ones that complain are the 20 ones that are paying $ 500 , $ 600 .21 ( Applause.)22 MS. MOLLY BRHANI:	The ones that 23 are paying $ 875 , they can move to another apartment 24 if they' re not happy, but I try to keep them. I' m25 not increasing unreasonably so the tenants --  the 2 
2 landlords are not abusing because there' s plenty of 3 apartment and I' m trying to keep good tenants 4 paying good rent. The ones that are abusing  the 5 rules are the ones that are paying $ 500 and  there 6 should be a surcharge.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 ( Applause.)9 MS.

ERIC COCA:	Hi. My name is 8 

2	Eric Coca.3
Hopefully you remember me from 
4 last year. I am currently a volunteer -- since   last 5 year' s RGB -- at Bushwick Housing Independence 6 Project. I work along with my mother who' s  a7 housing advocate.8 Where do I start?9 I' m a college student and when I' m10 not in school, I am devoting my time to   helping 11 tenants in the Bushwick area. I was born and   raised 12 there.13 Now, to start off, you need  to 14 balance this Board.15 ( Audience Participation.)16 MS. ERIC COCA:	You need to 17 balance it off with at least three public,  three 18 tenant, and three landlord members. How are  we 19 supposed to have a fair vote if there are   five 20 public members. Okay?21 ( Audience participation.)22 MS. ERIC COCA:	Don' t assume that 23 the landlord needs the increase without  examining 24 their profits. Because looking at these pictures,  I25 don' t really see any money going into them.4 
2 Frankly, a lot of landlords that  I3 have come across that say they need money, it' s4 really a load of bull.5 At 64 Troutman there are  91 6 violations. Mind you, this landlord is  doing 7 construction in this building.8 If you see these pictures,  the 9 walls are knocked down. The staircase  is 10 nonexistent. There is dust everywhere. There  are 11 piles of wood and scrap in three of the  empty 12 apartments there. The landlord has brought in  dead 13 cats to cause a stench for the remaining tenants  to 14 leave. There' s trash. It' s just filthy.	Tenants 15 need to stuff the bottom of their doors with  wet 16 towels to prevent the dust. Mind you, people  that 17 live there are senior citizens.18 Like many people I' ve met, another 19 one at 194 Elder in  Brooklyn.20 On a monthly basis she has  to 21 worry where her rent money is coming from.  She 22 cannot work.	She is homebound. She has bedbugs  and 23 on top of that craters in her walls. Recently  she 24 had her leg amputated. This is not -- rent is   not 25 something she should be worrying about. She  should 2 
2 be worrying about her health.3 Why should tenants have to pay  the 4 increase with these violations? It makes no  sense.5 At least ban landlords with violations  from 6 increasing their rent, from collecting it.7 ( Applause.)8 MS. ERIC COCA:	Landlords have hit 9 a low when it comes to harassing. There' s a  single 10 mother -- and I have proof of all of this.  There' s11 a single mother at 302 Stockholm who has had  to 12 file a report against her landlord for  sexual 13 harassment. She' s a single mother of four children.14 She does not need to worry about this especially  in 15 a community with gangs and  drugs.16 At 237 Troutman there' s a landlord 17 who illegally locked out his tenant. If you  see 18 here, he knocked down the two front doors of  the 19 building to make conditions unsafe. He was the  only 20 tenant left in that building because everyone  else 21 ran off scared. He knocked down the two  front 22 doors. The tenant no longer felt  safe.23 At one point one day the  tenant 24 left the building. The landlord boarded up the  door 25 with three different locks. The tenant cannot  get 2 
2 in.	The tenant is afraid of his life and   therefore 3 he -- he totally just gave up on his   case.4 Frankly, it hurts to see  families 5 and parents come in and have to say hey, where   is 6 the -- like the nearest shelter. It is not a   place 7 to raise their children.8 I said it before --9 ( Audience Participation.)10 MS. ERIC COCA:	Thank you. I' ve 11 noticed.12 I' ve said it before and I' ll say 13 it again, if tenants have to live in  these 14 conditions, landlords should pay for them to  live 15 like this.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 ( Applause.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Frank 19 Tenteromano.20 MR. FRANK TENTEROMANO:	Members,21 of the Board. I' ve been born and raised in 22 Brooklyn, New York.	And I' ve been a landlord for 23 32 years.24 And if the City is concerned  about 25 its citizens -- and my heart goes out to the   low 2 
2 income and moderate income people of the City.  But 3 if the City is concerned about them, they  should 4 build public housing. It shouldn' t be on the backs 5 of the landlords to be the  --6 ( Audience participation.)7 MR. FRANK TENTEROMANO:	--8 managers of the housing for the downtrodden.  It 9 shouldn' t be on our shoulders, just like you don' t10 control every other business. We shouldn' t be 11 controlled like we' re in a Communist state.12 ( Audience Participation.)13 MR. FRANK TENTEROMANO:	I heard 14 tenants who like it more socialist than we are.  But 15 I believe that this is a free country. We' re 16 fighting in Iraq for democracy and free  enterprise.17 So my -- my heart goes out to these tenants and   all 18 of their complaints.19 But we have expenses that we  have 20 that have gone through the roof and that they  are 21 limited by the rules of engagement that are  set 22 upon us by the City and all the regulations  and 23 what have you.	So that the City can help  this 24 problem by, first of all, taking away the tax  on 25 the gas and all the other materials that the  City 2 
2 government, state and Federal Government makes  for 3 all the things that they' re so concerned about.4 So thank you very much.5 My expenses have gone through  the 6 roof. I have tenants in my building, I have   a7 16 - unit building, in a three- bedroom apartment,8 that are paying $ 600 . They were in the building 9 when I bought it 32 years ago with my  dad.10 A lot of them will not move. And  I11 say if they' re not happy, they' re complaining about 12 where they live. It' s a free country. They can 13 move. They don' t have to stay. Nobody is holding 14 them back as a prisoner. They' re not prisoners.15 They can move wherever they want. They don' t have 16 to live in this City. No one is forcing them   to 17 stay anywhere. It' s a big country out there.18 And all the sad stories  that 19 you' re hearing have nothing to do with free 20 enterprise and the government should back off  with 21 controlling --22 ( Audience participation.)23 MR. FRANK TENTEROMANO:	So --24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Look, we' ve 25 been in pretty decent shape so far. We  let 2 
2 everybody talk. If we can just keep it down  from 3 the crowd. You' ll get your chances at the mike.4 Let' s go. Go ahead.5 MR. FRANK TENTEROMANO:	Thank you 6 very much.7 So again, the increases -- as  a8 gentleman said earlier, I have no control  over 9 water usage.	The tenants have it.	We have a water 10 meter. If anything, get rid of the water meters  and 11 just charge us one flat rate instead of having  it 12 go up because the tenants don' t care because 13 they' re not paying for it as far as the heat  and 14 everything else.15 That' s it.	Thank you very much 16 for your time.17 ( Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 Guillermo Enriquez. You' re here,20 right? Yes. And a translator, right? You' re going 21 to translate or we have one? She' s going to 22 translate. Eric is going to do it.  Okay.23 MR. GUILLERMO ENRIQUEZ:	( In 24 English.) Name is Guillermo Enriquez.	I live at 98 25 Troutman Street, apartment 2 R, Brooklyn 11206 .2 

23	--4
I' ve been living in this apartment MR. GUILLERMO ENRIQUEZ:	( Through 
5 interpreter.) He' s been living in his apartment for 6 28 years.7 Thirty percent of his incomes  goes 8 towards his rent.	Because of a new landlord  buying 9 the building, he has been denied a new  lease.10 He' s been harassed through phone 11 calls and the landlord has been offering money  for 12 him to move out.13 His apartment has a pest  problem 14 including rats and cockroaches.15 I ask that the RGB not give  them 16 the rent increase because of all the  violations.17 I propose that you develop  a18 program like SCRIE and DRIE to help the workers  --19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We can' t do 20 that.21 MR. GUILLERMO ENRIQUEZ:	-- whose 22 income doesn' t -- whose income doesn' t provide for 23 them to be able to pay their  rent.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That' s what we 25 suggested last year. We' re with him. Absolutely.5 
2MR. GUILLERMO ENRIQUEZ:	Thank 3you.4( Applause.)5CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Martha Duff.6I think you should go to  Christine 7 Quinn and tell her that. Have him go to  Christine 8 Quinn and tell her that.9 MS. MARTHA DUFF:	Hello.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hi.11 MS. MARTHA DUFF:	My name is 12 Martha Duff.	And this is first time I' ve ever been 13 speaking.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Martha, you 15 need to talk into the  mike.16 MS. MARTHA DUFF:	Okay? I am a17 small building owner.	I own a nine- apartment 18 townhouse in a building in the East  Village,19 Manhattan on seventh Street, East Seventh  street,20 with my mother, comprising five rent stabilized  and 21 two- rent controlled apartments.22 Of these five tenants, are  paying 23 less than $ 500 a month. There is no mortgage on  the 24 building and I am a good landlord. I   maintain 25 regular repairs and I have no violations  and 7 
 2 haven' t had any for many years, and provide all 3 essential services.4 But my bank account has  between 5 1000 to $ 3000 on a monthly basis which is  --6 doesn' t over anything.7 The RGB Guideline increases are 8 too low and have been too low for many years.   Oil 9 is my No. 1 factor in increasing costs from 2007   to 10 2008 . My actual oil price index has risen 61 11 percent to over a $ 4000 increase last heating 12 season.13 I don' t believe that the three 14 percent increase of low rents cover  this.15 Water and sewer bills have 16 increased by more than twenty percent in the last 17	year up from $ 5 , 000 to $ 6 , 000 .18 My operating profit does not 19 presently provide for any major expenses I  may 20 incur. For example, a new roof, a boiler,  or 21 repairs. If no substantial year- to- year RGB 22 increases are given, I will be operating at a   loss 23 by 2009 especially if oil prices are continuing  to 24 rise.25 Without substantial RGB increases 18 
2 I will be forced to either provide less heat  or 3 repairs and other essential services going  forward 4 or perhaps be forced to sell to a developer  which 5 we all know will result in harassment and  evictions 6 of the low rent tenants.7 The worst part of this 8 historically inadequate RGB increases is that  if 9 they continue, myself and my mother will be  forced 10 out of our apartment, which our family has lived  in 11 for over thirty years. And why? To subsidize  other 12 tenants? I don' t believe that it' s fair.13 As a side note, I was born  and 14 lived under the Communist Soviet Union and never  in 15 my time living under that regime did I  encounter 16 any laws or policies which come close to that  of 17 the socialist- based New York property system which 18 I am addressing today.19 ( Audience Participation.)20 MS. MARTHA DUFF:	If tenants -- if 21 tenants require subsidized housing in New York  --22 which I am sure many do, and I feel for   them 23 because listening today I realize that many  tenants 24 have many problems and I feel for them -- but   then 25 this should be an expense and responsibility of  the 2 
2 state government, not that of my  family.3 ( Audience participation.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What is your 5 recommendation?6 MS. MARTHA DUFF:	As a landlord,7 as a landlord, I require an oil surcharge,  oil 8 surcharge pass- through for all tenants not just 9 rent controlled apartments, just like every  other 10 business in the world. Landlord long- term occupancy 11 increases of $ 100 minimum.12 ( Applause.)13 MS. MARTHA DUFF:	In my opinion it 14 would be fair for all tenants currently  paying 15 below $ 800 . Year after year, double- digit RGB 16 increases as a minimum to help meet the  ever 17 increases -- increasing operating costs I  incur.18 I thank you for your time.	And I19 hope that you see that am I not a slumlord nor   a20 millionaire. I am just trying to manage my  family 21 home.22 Thank you.23 ( Audience participation.)24 MS. ADAMS:	I have a question.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Martha. We 2 
2have aquestion.3MS. ADAMS:	Did I understand you 4to say that there' s no mortgage on this building?5MS. MARTHA DUFF:	That' s correct.6MS. ADAMS:	And at the time that 7 the building was purchased, did you have  rent 8 stabilized apartments in it?9 MS. MARTHA DUFF:	The building was 10 purchased by my family over thirty years ago.  There 11 were both rent stabilized and rent  controlled 12 apartments.13 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.14 MS. MARTHA DUFF:	You' re welcome.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Luz Virella.16 ( Applause.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Followed by 18 Pearl Jones, you' re here, right?19 Andres Mares is here? Okay.20 And then Demetrios Yatrakis.21 Go ahead.22 MS. LUZ VIRELLA:	Good afternoon.23 Good evening.24 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Good evening.25 MS. LUZ VIRELLA:	Thank you for 7 
2 being here and listening to our  problems.3 Okay.	I am Luz Virella. I  reside 4 at Bushwick in the community. I do volunteer  work 5 for BJEV ( phonetic). I am a tenant in a  rent 6 stabilized building which we have many  violations.7 I have a landlord that just  bought 8 the building. It' s a fourteen- family unit. He' s9 been buying everybody out with $ 5 , 000 .10 Out of fourteen families we  have 11 five families left. We are rent stabilized  people.12 We can' t afford the high increase of rent.13 We are living under conditions of 14 bedbugs, rats the size of cats eating  through 15 walls. I mean roaches, infestations of roaches.  How 16 would you guys like to go to sleep and wake up   with 17 bugs crawling all over you. Not a good  thing.18 I had to pay $ 350 extermination 19 because my landlord refused to exterminate. He  says 20 if I	-- that if I have bedbugs, I bought it in   or 21 technically somebody brought it into my  house.22 Technically it' s his job to 23 exterminate the building, not me pay $ 350 out of  my 24 pocket for him to not exterminate. That is  not 25 fair. I don' t think that is fair. And he refuses  to 2 
2 pay me the $ 350 . He says he does not exterminate 3 for bedbugs. What should someone like me do with  a4 landlord like that?5 Now, my question is, I think  you 6 should stop. Keep the freeze.	I mean we understand 7 the small landlord, we understand them.  I8 understand them.	But yet again, they' ve got to 9 live and so do we.	We entitled to live.10 The cost of living is going up  not 11 just oil. If you look at it, milk is going up.   If 12 you look at it, rice is going up. I mean I' m a   poor 13 person. I can' t afford high- class meals so I got to 14 go and look for the low  income budget.	But it' s15 not fair that these landlords want a high  increase 16 and they' re not doing the repairs that they' re 17 supposed to do. I mean we shouldn' t live  like 18 animals. We are human beings.	Treat us like one.19 You want respect, give us respect in  return.20 ( Applause.)21 MS. LUZ VIRELLA:	That' s all I got 22 to say.23 Thank you.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 Pearl Jones.2 

23	Good evening.4
MS. PEARL JONES:	Good afternoon.It' s my first time with the Rent 
5 stabilization meeting.6 I' ve been a landlord for the past 7 44 years.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 9 talk into the mike.10 MS. PEARL JONES:	Yeah. I' ve been 11 a landlord for the past 44  years.12 I have an eight- family building 13 that I brought from rent control to  rent 14 stabilization.	They' re all five- room units. I15 moved from one apartment to the other to  decontrol 16 it in order to be able to improve the  building.17 In 1955 I installed all brand  new 18 bathrooms, modern bathrooms. A few of my  tenants 19 have moved out and bought their own buildings.  I20 have three tenants who are giving me problems  or 21 have given me problems.22 One tenant paying $ 280 - something a23 month rent for three years did not pay any rent.  I24 decided if she couldn' t pay $ 287 a month, she could 25 not pay 10 , $ 11 , 000 . I got a rent stabilization 5 
2 lawyer to take her to court. She begged him to   ask 3 me to take off a couple of thousands dollars. I   did 4 because I' m a mother. I have kids. And she came  in 5 with two kids. She created a problem where she  had 6 a washing machine. They kid forget to put the  thing 7 in the sink and over a period of time it rotted   out 8 the floor in the kitchen including my basement,  the 9 beams in the basement.10 Over the past few years she  hardly 11 allows me to get into the building. Turn  around,12 she was doing hairdressing into the buildings. I' ve 13 got pictures of that.14 I have another tenant who  every 15 time her lease is to be renewed, she  creates 16 violations. She has over 150 violations in  one 17 apartment.	Between 2000 and 2006 I have had to  fix 18 her kitchen floor.	She hangs wet clothes into the 19 kitchen on her line over a period of  years.20 In 2006 I had to get a  contractor 21 in.	I paid $ 6 , 500 to replace the floor and the 22 beams in the kitchen.	Turn around, between, 2001 23 and 2007 , her bathroom constantly needs repairs. I24 have put in a new vanity. I got new tiles.   The 25 plumber goes in and finds that there are  unloaded 2 
2 pennies out of the drain in order to clear  her 3 sink. She got a new vanity and  everything.4 This woman has constantly given me 5 problems.6 Now, everybody' s talking --7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap 8 up.9 MS. PEARL JONES:	Yes.10 Everybody is talking about 11 landlords. The corporate landlords are the ones  who 12 need to be taken care of not the little,  bitty 13 landlords who have five rooms renting for less  than 14 $ 400 a month.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where' s your 17 building?18 MS.

ANDRES MARES:	As a tenant,21 at this point in the game I really have nothing   to 22 say to this Commission or  this Board.	And I think 23 the only reason that I would want to come up   here 24 is to maybe say some things that might have  some 25 bearing on reality.21 
2 First of all, I want to  commend 3 the Landlord Rent Stabilization Association, a4 misnomer if there ever was one, for the work  in 5 bringing out their troops.	Jose Straussburg 6 ( phonetic) and company have done it again. They' ve 7 wheeled out the mom and pops, the small  landlords8 as their shield, a screen to cover the  real 9 interests of the big companies.10 According to Tim Collins, some  of 11 you know him, he was the counsel for the RGB   from 12 1987 to ' 84 , a consultant to the RGB from 2000 to 13 2001 .	Of the 30 , 000 members of the RSA, about 14 3 , 000 of those of the big companies that own most 15 of the housing stock here in New York, they' re  not 16 going to come up there. It would be -- it would   bad 17 PR for top companies, for the oil companies to  do 18 that especially speculators that work on a  mass 19 scale.20 Your role is to put in an  official 21 stamp.	This is a massive rip off.	It' s been 22 carried out against New York and you' re the 23 Bloomberg- appointed hatchet people to do this.24 As far as I' m concerned, you' re an 25 illegitimate body.	As we know, Bloomberg is 2 
2 probably as hell- bent as Robert Moses on reworking 3 our City so that it' s not really livable.4 I think maybe two of you  probably 5 stand up for us as tenants, but the rest of you   are 6 apologists and tools for a gentrification  machine.7 I live in West Harlem and  the 8 impact of the decisions that you' re making, you' re 9 a party to gentrification in my  neighborhood.10 ( Applause.)11 MR. ANDRES MARES:	By allowing 12 unscrupulous owners and companies coming into  our 13 neighborhoods that are ripe for speculation,  by 14 allowing them those increases, you' re actually 15 opening it up further so that Blacks and  Latinos 16 and other working class people have to scurry  like 17 rats to find something that' s affordable.	My 18 favorite story is the gun that puts you out. It' s19 already a done deal.20 The best thing that we can do  as 21 tenants is mobilize behind the bill of Senator  Tom 22 Duane and Assemblyman George Latimer. It' s the only 23 solution to this charade.24 There should be no increase for 25 slumlords, especially slumlords.	The City Council 2 
2 should approve appointments of this Board and  we 3 should be able to look at the books because  what 4 you claim is not what' s real.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 ( Audience Participation.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. --8 MR. DEMETRIOS YATRAKIS:	Yatrakis 9 is the pronunciation.10 My name is Demetrios Yatraksi. I11 work with my family in a small management  company.12 One of the buildings that we --  a13 lot of the issues that have been discussed here  are 14 socioeconomic issues and not really what this  Board 15 is here to discuss.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Speak into the 17 mike.18 MR. DEMETRIOS YATRAKIS:	And that 19 issue is money. And one of the buildings we  manage 20 is 182 Avenue A in the East  Village.21 Over the past four years it' s used 22 17 , 000 gallons of oil. And over the past year that 23 I have been working with my family, the price  of 24 oil has gone from $ 2 . 12 to $ 3 . 55 in April to $ 4 . 13 25 today.2 
2 In real terms, that equals  a3 $ 24 , 000 increase for this building.4 And the rent roll of that  building 5 is $ 405 , 000 . That has thirty stabilized units, 32 6 units, thirty which are stabilized.7 A seven percent increase would 8 give us another $ 32 , 000 to cover our costs. That 9 $ 24 , 000 , which, if oil goes to $ 5 , which it easily 10 could, would be lost.11 So I' m here asking you for the 12 full increase. And I' ll keep this short. I just 13 wanted to give you some numbers from the  landlord.14 So thank you.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 ( Applause.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Shawn Armour.18 Even though I didn' t pronounce your name right,19 you' re my most valuable player on time.20 Go ahead, Mr. Armour.21 Mr. SHAWN ARMOUR:	I don' t have 22 any prepared statement --23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me just 24 make -- I want to say one thing. We got an   extra 25 half hour here. We have to vacate the building  at 2 
2 10 : 30 . So I would appreciate it, everybody, if you 3 move as quickly as you can so we can get   everybody 4 who still wants to speak to  speak.5 Go ahead, Mr. Armour.6 MR. SHAWN ARMOUR:	First, I think 7 that the City has put the tenants against  the 8 landlords. My landlord happens to be a giant bag  of 9 crap.	All right? He' s suing me for nonpayment of 10 rent even though he cashed my rent check this  --11 the first of this month. So I have to go to   court 12 Monday when I should be in Australia  Monday.13 I' m pissed off. I have no 14 tolerance for this.	All I see is people  half 15 asleep. No one' s -- this woman, what she said  about 16 her landlord and what he' s doing and no one  lifted,17 except for this gentleman, lifted a pen. You  people 18 are on auto- pilot.19 The idea that someone is  paying 20 $ 300 for a five- bedroom apartment is ridiculous. We 21 should solve that problem. The landlord shouldn' t22 have to deal with somebody paying $ 200 for a23 spacial apartment.	It' s retarded.24 But, again, you cannot keep 25 raising rents on people who are living on a   fixed 2 
2 income. I' m a retired cop. I grew -- I grew up  in 3 this City.	All right. I went through the  fabulous 4 foster care system here and I' m surprised I' m not a5 criminal and I' m not dead.	I pulled myself up 6 despite what these people will tell you --  despite 7 what these people will tell about, you know,  you 8 can do it in America and all this  stuff.9 And we are not a Communist  State.10 That' s ridiculous. For none of you guys to say 11 anything about that it' s absolutely retarded. What 12 is wrong with you all? She' s saying that this  is 13 like Russia? What? You' re here and not there and 14 you own a building so shut up. It' s ridiculous  that 15 guys would entertain this, these word  games.16 ( Applause.)17 MR. SHAWN ARMOUR:	No. This is the 18 problem.	People come up there with word   games.19 You know, you can actually do some good if  you 20 wanted to.	You know, it' s like the Democrats are 21 partially responsible for this. You have a  war 22 going on and they could have stopped it and  they 23 took no -- no -- no  action.24 They' re going to price these 25 people out. People are leaving in droves. And  then 2 
2 when all these tourists realize they made  enough 3 money and they go back to wherever the hell  they 4 came from, and this City is back like it was in   the 5 70 ' s where nothing about abandoned buildings that 6 you' re giving away for a dollar with a  guarantee 7 loan to fix them up.	And a good percentage of  you,8 trust me, will not be living here then  either.9 It' s absolutely outrageous.10 I have one more question for  you:11 How long do you think you guys are going to   take 12 this like in good spirits? People can barely  afford 13 to feed their kids much less put money away for   a14 college education. This is absolutely  outrageous.15 Outrageous.16 You know, I wanted Christine  Quinn 17 to see this but she ducked in and she ducked   out.18 She is not legitimate.19 This is -- in yesterday' s New York 20 Times there' s this schoolyard that hasn' t had a21 public community center, that hasn' t been opened 22 since 2000 . She' s hiding money, meanwhile these 23 kids are growing up without a playground. You  know 24 I' ve been -- you know, normally -- okay, just  ten 25 more seconds.

I' ve  lived 15 there for ten years. And the conditions in  my 16 apartment are not some of the conditions that  some 17 of the landlords complain that the tenants  cause.18 I had leaking in the roof, mold  on 19 the walls, a leaky faucet. I didn' t cause  that.20 I complained to 311 .	I get no 21 heat, no hot water. Sometimes no water at all.  And 22 they want an increase. I don' t get services. Dead 23 mice in the hallway, graffiti scratch in  the 24 elevator, strangers that come into the  building.25 It' s a private building.	They make their way up  to 2 
2 to the roof having sex.	People putting circulars 3 on the doors.	Jehovah Witnesses come in there.4 Chinese menus, all these strangers in the  building.5 I would like for the landlord  to 6 cure this by putting a sensor that leads to   the 7 roof preventing people from going up there  and 8 hanging out, smoking and drinking.9 I don' t -- I don' t believe that 10 the -- my landlord deserves an increase. They  got 11 numerous violations.	Call HPD. The first complaint 12 over two years. I spent a year -- ten months   in 13 court. I thought the problem was solved. The  City 14 came in and fixed the walls, the mold  and 15 everything. The mold is back  again.16 I' ve been calling for seven months 17 now. No one has come back to fix that. The   tenants 18 contractor' s are telling me since the City fixed 19 that, that they did an improper job and they' re 20 supposed to come back and redo the work again.  So 21 I' m back and forth with them.22 That' s not fair me. I didn' t cause 23 these problems in my apartment. I work two jobs.  I24 work really, really hard. I come home tired. I   live 25 tired.	I' m an EMT.	I work in a catering hall.  And 2 
2 I don' t make enough to barely eat and cover  the 3 bills on time. Sometimes some bills have to go  in 4 late. The gas bill goes in late. The -- I' m  just 5 frustrated.

HOLDER:	When you say 9 conditions in your apartment and in the  building,10 can you just describe those for  us.11 MS. ESTHER ORTIZ:	The mold on the 12 walls, the leaky roof.	Even in the front of  the 13 building the building is not maintained. There' s --14 the construction debris is kept in  the front.	That 15 creates a problems with flies  and rats.	That' s a16 health hazard. And we call Sanitation.	I' m sure 17 that they -- you know, he' s got a fine that  he 18 hasn' t paid.	And to get these contractors that  do 19 poor work and then they work has to be  redone.20 I had the outlet was sparking  and 21 smoke was coming out and I called 311 . They  called 22 the Fire Department. They disconnected that.  The 23 contractor comes in, says, oh, there' s nothing 24 wrong with that.	All you need to do is screw  it 25 back in. I should screw that in. I mean my   landlord 4 
2 does not deserve an increase. Please, I am  asking 3 you to freeze the rent.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 ( Applause.)6 MS.

I go to work tired. I come back tired. And   I13 still don' t make enough to cover all the bills.14 Some bills get paid late.15 And before then I had another  job 16 I was getting $ 9 an hour with benefits, the 401 K,17 health insurance.	I don' t have health insurance 18 now. But the other job I had health insurance  and 19 all these benefits.20 And then when you do the  tax 21 deduction.	I don' t even have a checking -- bank 22 account to cash my check. I had to go to   check 23 chasing. That' s another deduction. When I got the 24 check, I just felt like crying.	It was like 200 25 and something dollars. I don' t think it' s fair for 2 
2 my landlord to get an  increase.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.5 ( Applause.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Andrew Latsko.7 MR. ANDREW LATSKO:	Hello.8 Good evening, Board members and 9 all in attendance.10 My name is Andrew Latsko and I' m a11 property owner -- excuse me, property manager  in 12 Bay Ridge and Park Slope, Brooklyn. I' m a  third 13 generation in my family who has diligently  cared 14 for these rental properties.15 I have always maintained the 16 rental apartments that I manage in the way I   was 17 taught. That is to do whatever is necessary to  keep 18 all aspects of the building in above  average 19 condition and give excellent service to all of  my 20 tenants.21 However, lately, we are reaching a22 point where expenses, detailed in depth by many  of 23 the speakers here before me tonight, have  really 24 come to a point where they are equal to the   rent 25 roll produce by the buildings.2 
2 This puts an extreme burden  on 3 landlords and property managers like myself  in 4 order to do more for the building for the  tenants 5 than just the bare minimum required to not be  in 6 violation.7 We' re in a city that' s not really 8 hospitable to new rental housing.	There' s9 basically no new rental housing that' s not low 10 income or has a hand with the government  involved.11 And you know, we only have what we have right   now.12 And I ask the Board to  consider 13 what happens in this City, long term, where a   large 14 amount of middle income housing is owned,  operated 15 and maintained by smaller owners? And  these 16 landlords are consistently given less and  less 17 money and repetitively given less and less money  to 18 work with on a year in and year out business.   What 19 happens to the state of rental housing when  the 20 amount of money is equal? What happens  eventually 21 when the expenses are going to exceed  revenue?22 Going by the way this Board  has 23 approached rent guidelines in the past, this  is 24 coming up pretty soon.25 You know, I hope the  Board 2 
2 realizes the cause- and- effect relationship. There' s3 a lot of people who got up here tonight and   spoke 4 about their neighborhoods changing, about 5 predatory, big companies coming in, about  landlords6 coming in and buying nine, ten buildings  and 7 changing the demographics of their building  and 8 their area.9 Well, this is happening because 10 somebody is selling these buildings for a  reason.11 If people were making a decent amount of  money,12 putting a little bit in their pocket at the end   of 13 the year, there wouldn' t be all these buildings 14 available to sell.15 All around us the cost of  living 16 is rising tremendously. All of the suppliers  we 17 deal with, utility companies, tradesmen, all of  the 18 retail stores that we have to frequent to  buy 19 supplies, have all raised prices in accordance  with 20 that fact.21 So we' re asking to fairly, please 22 compensate landlords and allow us an  adequate 23 adjustment as well, three, four, five percent.  In 24 many cases, it' s not getting the job done.25 It' s not really fair to continue 2 
2 to let tenants in buildings and pay increases  of 3 $ 20 a month while the increases for that  apartment 4 per month are a lot of times at least triple   that.5 And a lot of times these tenants are  being 6 protected when they can certainly afford  it.7 We are asking for at least  a8 minimum of $ 60 per month increase to cover our 9 expenses.10 ( Applause.)11 MR.

2 of the City were owned and operated by the  small 3 landlords, would that surprise you?4 MR. ANDREW LATSKO:	I don' t5 believe so.6 MS. SCHLEIDER:	Good. Because 7 that' s the way it is.8 MR. ANDREW LATSKO:	I' m going by 9 the demographics in the area that I frequent that  I10 work in, you know, largely.11 MR.

And I' m23 here today to tell you a little about my   situation.24 I live in an apartment  for 25 thirteen years now and I  moved there.	When I moved 2 
2 there I was paying $ 475 a month. And my rent  have 3 been increasing very high every year.	And now I' m4 paying -- well, now my rent is $ 740 . 53 . Well, thank 5 God I' m Section 8 .	The Section 8 started last 6 year, about a year now and after waiting for  over 7 fifteen years because I applied early 1993  for 8 Section 8 .9 What I' m here to say to you is 10 Section 8 allows me a rent of $ 900 a month. And  at 11 the rate that you' re going with this increase every 12 year, pretty soon we' ll get to that $ 900 and 13 Section 8 will not -- will not allow me --   they 14 will not help me with the part that they pay so   I15 will have all -- I' ll have to pay it all  myself.16 And I' ve been on disability since 17 2004 because in 2004 a suffered a stroke and   God 18 help me, I came out of  that stroke.	Then I came --19 suffered ovarian cancer in 2006 .	Had chemotherapy.20 Went to chemo from January to May  2007 .	And right 21 after that, this year, February, I was  hospitalized 22 again for meningitis and so  on.23 A part of that, I' m a diabetic,24 high blood pressure. There' s no way I can go  to 25 work again. I would love to see the bus   passing 2 
2 everyday. I keep wishing that I can get on the   bus 3 and go to work because my income is low and so   much 4 things to do if I do one thing, I can' t do  another.5 So I' m here today to ask you to 6 please consider my situation.	And there are many 7 more people out there just like me who in the   same 8 -- in the same position as  me.9 And to please vote zero  increase.10 Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where do you 12 live?13 MS.

ADAMS:	I wanted you to know 22 that we do appreciate your  situation.23 MS. SUSSANN CLARKE:	Yes.24 MS. ADAMS:	And I thank you for 25 coming and sharing it with us. But you should  know 2 
2 that we do not control Section 8 housing or   the 3 regulations that have to do with  it.4 MS. SUSSANN CLARKE:	Yes. No, I5 know that.6 What I' m saying, the way it' s7 going every year, the increase, we will get to  --8 pretty soon my rent is going to get to the   point 9 where Section 8 is not going to pay their  part 10 anymore.	Because the highest my budget is $ 900 .11 When it gets to there, Section 8 is not going   to 12 pay it anymore. So I' ll have to pay all of it,  all 13 of my --14 MS. ADAMS: Okay.

I  am 14 here for the first time.15 I have to state I am a  landlord.16 I am basically an immigrant from Italy. I came   here 17 33 years ago. I' ve been a tenant for many  years.18 And then I decided I wanted to become a   landlord 19 and I put my investment into my savings in   real 20 estate.21 I am, what I' d say, a very good 22 above any honest act as probably one of the  best 23 landlords you could find. And I' m listening here 24 for the first time.	And I know you have a job  to 25 do, which is not easy. You can' t make miracles  for 2 
2 the tenants. You cannot make miracles for  the 3 landlords.4 Obviously the tenants,5 specifically most of them, some of them  have 6 personal issues about how to pay the rent and  I7 pretty well understand that. I want you to know  the 8 landlord does not get increases unless  the 9 violations are cured. We have to meet  requirements.10 We have to file RPIs, you know, income  and 11 expenses. Our books are there for the City to  know 12 and tax us.13 By the way, I own a  small 14 building, a six- family and I manage a seven- family 15 unit on 6 th Avenue and 16 th Street and also a16 building in Bay Ridge, 28 units. So I' m on  both 17 sides personally involved and a  manager.18 I want to try to make this as  fast 19 as I can and be done with it so everybody else   has 20 a chance to speak.21 We obviously have proven, like  the 22 gentleman said before, the majority of  landlords23 are small landlords. I was here in the late 70 ' s24 when, in the Bronx, buildings were  abandoned 25 because of rent control.	We have proven to the 2

Without us, there will not  be 5 buildings available for the people who live  here.6 ( Applause.)7 MR. TONY URSINO:	I' m sorry. I8 don' t want, you know, any boos, claps or anything.9 I want you to know I have my cellphone by my   beside 10 to be there if I have a problem with a building   or 11 a tenant. We have to deal with every tenant  issue 12 in the world. They' re all specifically individually 13 different from one another.14 There have been individual 15 problems, whether the job reason, whether the  price 16 of eggs or milk or fixed income, or whatever it   may 17 be, because the other tenant is not -- is   too 18 noisy.	They call the landlord and they think  they 19 snap their fingers and things get  done.20 These people that are talking 21 about opening the books, and I am  constantly 22 telling you, I would like to open the books at   the 23 page where there are expenses. You should see  what 24 we look at bills, bills coming to  see.25 Somebody said they' re afraid to 2 
 2 open their bills. It is true. The bills we' re 3 getting for, you know -- as you know for   heating 4 and insurance and another way to say  it.5 Let me tell you specifically  one 6 building where we need help.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Tell us what 8 you want.9 MR. TONY URSINO:	Yeah. I' ll tell 10 you.11 There' s a building, quickly, seven 12 units.	The rents in the building they cannot  go 13 on.	In the late 90 ' s you passed a supplemental 14 allowance.	There are, specifically in this 15 building on Sixth Avenue, these are the  rents:16 $ 345 . 07 , $ 492 and $ 281 , three of those apartments 17 because the landlord was late in applying the  lease 18 increases.19 There has to be a minimum base, 20	$ 60 , $ 100 .21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 MR.

CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We understand.( Applause.)CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Susanne MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	Good My name is Suzi Schropp.	I live 
10 in one of 120 buildings owned by the  notorious 11 Shalom Family.	This year marks the tenth 12 consecutive year that I have not been able  to 13 afford health insurance.14 You may have heard in the  news 15 yesterday, according to the Commonwealth Fund,  the 16 number of American adults who are uninsured  rose 17 from 16 million in 2003 to 25 million last year,   a18 16 percent increase. Taken together with the  number 19 of uninsured, at least 75 million Americans now  go 20 without health insurance for a least part of  the 21 year.22 The drastic increases in rent  have 23 contributed to the fact that I can' t afford health 24 insurance. Last November I contracted a  severe 25 infection from a spider bite in my apartment,  an 10 
 2 expense I had not calculated into my budget.  Does 3 anyone know what it feels like not to have  health 4 insurance.5 My income decreased by $ 7 , 337 last 6 year. I' m still choking on a seven- and- a- half 7 percent increase you administered three years  ago.8 Since 2002 my rent increased by  69 9 percent in addition to rising utilities and cost  of 10 living, while my income has remained the same as in 11	1999 .12 Food has become noticeably more 13 expensive and I' ve begun paying for some of it  with 14 my credit card. I earn too much to qualify for   food 15 stamps or affordable state health insurance  for 16 that matter, even though I am moving closer in   the 17 direction of qualifying.18 Despite ongoing violations in my 19 apartment, the Shaloms have been rewarded  with 20 annual increases.21 This year I would like the  Board 22 to take into consideration landlords' profits.  The 23 RGB' s own reports reveal continued financial health 24 and actually growing profits for  owners.25 Since 2002 the Shaloms have 12 
2 accrued a 350 percent profit in rent revenue in   our 3 building alone.4 I urge the Board to  implement 5 annual rent freezes in buildings with fifty  percent 6 or more market rent tenants.7 These owners make a killing  year 8 after year.	Of course, it would be wonderful  if 9 someone on the Board would exercise vision  and 10 recognize the housing crisis and the heavy  burden 11 low and moderate income renters endure every  year.12 I appeal to your sense of  reason 13 and fairness that you, for once, let the  owners 14 take slightly lower profits as opposed  to 15 continuously tighten the rope around the necks  of 16 human beings who are struggling to make ends  meet.17 I urge you to vote for a  zero 18 percent increase.19 Lastly, I also want to say,  the 20 cost of fuel is not going to  go down.	This is not 21 a problem that tenants have to shoulder  by 22 themselves. There are other options for  owners.23 There' s solar.	And the amount of money that  some 24 tenants -- I mean some that landlords  have 25 mentioned, $ 40 , 000 ?	You can install solar panels 2 
2 that can at least take care of the hot water   year 3 around.	There are many options you can  do.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 ( Audience Participation.)6 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.7 You said that the Shalom  Family 8 witnessed a 350 percent increase in rent  revenue.9 What constitutes that kind of  increase?10 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	Yes.	It' s11 actually a conservative number.	It' s more than 12 that.	Three hundred and fifty percent came  because 13 they deregulated virtually every unit in  the 14 building.	Apartments that used to rent on  an 15 average of a thousand dollars now rent for  like,16 the latest was $ 3 , 300 . They' re 400 - square foot 17 apartments that used to be studios and one- bedrooms 18 that are now converted into  two- bedrooms.	And the 19 prices keep going up. And you know, no  regulation 20 as far as increases go. No tenants, market  rate 21 tenants have increases of $ 500 if the landlord 22 decides to do that.23 MS. HOLDER:	Are there 24 violations in this building?25 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	Well,2 
2 there' s one in that apartment right now.	There has 3 been a violation for the floor which was  repaired 4 after a year- and- a- half and under pressure from 5 DHCR. I have a harassment filing that' s been  going 6 on since 2006 .7 The other thing is an  electrical 8 violation. It' s a whole list of faulty wiring that 9 was due to, you remember the  gas problem.	The 10 landlord turned off the gas stove and I was  without 11 a working stove for a  year.12 And so now we have an  electric 13 stove.	And the wiring, of course, is not up  to 14 code. And that has been going on, the violation  was 15 issued in October 2005 .16 DHCR is monitoring it but we  all 17 know how effective DOB is. We' ve seen that lately 18 in the news. And so things are moving very  slowly 19 yet my landlord has received his increases  every 20 year.21 MS. HOLDER:	And you haven' t22 received an increase in your income since 1990 ?23 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	No. It' s24 actually gone down.	And actually one of my 25 projects, Goldman Sachs is involved. And for  four 2 
2 years I have not been able to raise the  rates 3 because every year they' re coming to me like 4 saying, oh, my God, the budget. We don' t have  the 5 budget. And I' m basically subsidizing companies 6 like Goldman Sachs.7 MS. ADAMS:	What is the source of 8 the increases that --9 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	Pardon? I' m10 a free- lance graphic designer.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So you must be 12 a consultant to use on some  project.13 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	No, not to 14 you directly, but a  nonprofit.15 MS. ADAMS:	I have a question.16 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	Yes.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.18 MS. ADAMS:	What is the source of 19 the data that you gave on the increases that  Shalom 20 has received?21 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	It' s -- I22 know what tenants used to pay in the building and   I23 know what they -- what they go  for now.	You can 24 also --25 MS. ADAMS:	You' re the source of 2 

2	the data?34	point is -- 5
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Basically her MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	No. The 
6 source of the data, you can go to the DHCR and   get 7 rent histories and I have some of them if you   would 8 like to see them.9 And the other thing, you know,  if 10 you want to see how much they rent for,  Sky 11 Management has a website where they advertise  the 12 fees.	And I also confirmed that with my  new 13 neighbors. But otherwise, the turnover is  between 14 three -- three months to  one year.	They rarely 15 stay for two years because, you know, the -- I   mean 16 they increase the rents by a lot and eventually  the 17 tenants just leave. Turnover is very  high.18 I have a picture of the  garbage 19 pit in front of the house if you' d like to  see 20 that.21 MS. HOLDER:	What' s that?22 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	The garbage 23 pit is where the garbage gets dumped into an  area 24 that used to be the basement or the cellar  where 25 the landlord tried to illegally put a  restaurant.6 
2 And then on the first floor they illegally tried  to 3 put a store where an apartment used to  be.4 ( Audience Participation.)5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 Thank you.7 MS. CRUZ:	Just a quick 8 question.	Excuse me.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Reshit --10 MS. CRUZ:	A quick question.11 Have you applied for a  Rent 12 Reduction Order for the situation in  your 13 particular apartment?14 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	I have.	And 15 we were -- well, DHCR awarded us a decrease due   to 16 the lease was filled out wrong, which the owner  did 17 not honor. I was actually in court for two and   a18 half years.	And with that, you know, the  owner 19 kept issuing a faulty lease. It was  totally 20 baseless litigation, total harassment. That' s also 21 how most of my neighbors left the building. I   mean 22 you know the Shaloms.	I' m sure you' ve dealt with 23 them.24 MS. CRUZ:	I don' t know the 25 Shaloms.2 
2 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	Oh!3 MS. CRUZ:	And so you haven' t had 4 a rent increase yourself in terms of you paying  it 5 for a while?6 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	Oh, I have 7 had a great rent increase. Actually, I had  a8 preferential rent that should have been a  legal 9 rent because we used to  pay cash.	The owner -- the 10 previous owners did not register the  building 11 properly.12 When they finally did, they  issued 13 preferential rents to everyone that should  have 14 been the legal rent. As you know, the cash rent  is 15 basis for the legal rent.16 But because it went undetected  for 17 a very long time, we weren' t educated at the  time 18 about it and the landlord lobbyists heavy work  in 19 Albany. And they managed to get the four- year rule 20 which is devastating to tenants like me which  also 21 eliminated at least three tenants because  their 22 rent basically doubled overnight.23 Anything else?24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 Thank you.2

( Applause.)CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Reshit MR. RESHIT GJINOVIC:	Ladies and 
6 gentlemen, good evening.7 My name is Reshit Gjinovic and  I8 own a six- family building in Brooklyn.9 I am here today to ask you to  vote 10 for increase that can keep up with  these 11 out- of- control costs like the fuel, plumbing and 12 electrical.13 This year it cost me more  than 14 double to heat my building, even if it was a   mild 15 winter. Everyone now charges for a fuel  surcharge 16 to make a delivery or a service call to   make 17 repairs. Unfortunately, I am at the mercy of  the 18 RGB for any increase.19 These last three years were 20 especially tough because I had a nuisance  tenant 21 who was harassing all of the other five families  in 22 my building. This man walked around totally nude  in 23 the public hall and outside the steps of  the 24 building. His apartment was in terrible  condition 25 with human waste all over. The smell of  the 6 
2 building was unbearable for the other  tenants.3 I lose some tenants because  of 4 this guy. I spent over $ 20 , 000 in legal fees to 5 evict this tenant or just to get him to clean   up 6 his apartment to stop bothering the other  tenants.7 The court appointed a guardian  for 8 him and someone to come and clean his  apartment 9 once a while. But he still kept his bad  habits.10 He refused to move or to  be 11 relocated.	Finally after three years, they had  him 12 to go to some home for the mentally disturbed.  Now 13 that he is gone, he left me with a   damaged 14 apartment and a mess to clean  up.15 I spent over $ 25 , 000 to renovate 16 the apartment because the urine and the waste  smell 17 was in the wood floors.	The tub, toilet, sinks 18 were stained and it couldn' t be cleaned. The 19 kitchen cabinets were smashed and the  appliances 20 were totally destroyed. And the stove was  missing 21 completely.22 How can I accept -- I expect  to 23 afford $ 45 , 000 in legal and renovation costs? It is 24 totally unfair for this to  happen.25 I take pride in my building and  I2 
 2 provide a nice place for families to live. Where  in 3 your studies do you include this costs  for 4 situation like mine?5 I work two jobs to afford to  pay 6 for these costs. I work as a superintendent  during 7 the day and I work at night as  a concierge.	My 8 wife works in the day cleaning homes and in  the 9 evening cleaning offices. Then, of, course, we  do 10 most of our work in the building  ourselves.11 There is another place to  save.12 We desperately need you to pass the increase  to 13 cover this huge cost. I am asking for at least   a14 minimum increase of $ 60 per month as opposed to 15 just a percentage. The percentage increase do  not 16 take into account long- term tenant with low rent of 17	$ 500 or $ 600 a month.18 Please help us maintain our 19 buildings with realistic increases.20 Thank you.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 ( Applause.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Chris 24 Atheneos.25 MR. CHRIS ATHENEOS:	My name is 18 
2 Christopher Atheneos.	And as you know, I' m a small 3 property owner from right here in  Brooklyn.4 And my family and I own  and 5 operate our buildings in Brooklyn doing a lot  of 6 the work ourselves. We take pride in  providing 7 safe, clean, and affordable housing to New York' s8 workforce and retirees.9 Unfortunately though, maintaining 10 the housing is not so affordable. It doesn' t take  a11 genius to see that the costs to operate  our 12 building, especially over the past few years,  has 13 been unbearable.14 The cost of fuel in my  building 15 has gone for -- and I' ve attached to my  testimony,16 the bills because I think just the visual of  seeing 17 the fuel bill, has gone to $ 1 . 73 in January 2007 .18 And that fuel bill is attached to my  testimony,19 from $ 1 . 73 to $ 2 . 99 a year later in January ' 08 to 20 $ 3 . 70 a gallon in April 2008 . And it has gone up 21 even more in May.22 I haven' t got my May' s bill yet.23 What can we do? The plumbers pass along a   fuel 24 surcharge for this increase but we' re prohibited 25 from doing so.	We are at your mercy for a  decent 2 
2 rent increase so that we may continue to  provide 3 quality housing.4 The housing stock is in dire  need 5 of constant maintenance.	Just look at the City  of 6 New York and the fiscal crisis of the 1970 ' s. They 7 just stopped doing work and repairs and  the 8 repercussions are still being felt.9 To avoid a similar situation,  a10 couple of years ago, the City of New York  learned 11 its lesson and raised property taxes as well  as 12 other taxes to keep the City in good repair  and 13 continue capital projects because they know  what 14 would happen if they didn' t.15 Therefore, similarly, you must 16 pass an increase commensurate with these  rising 17 costs so that we can continue to maintain  our 18 buildings so that they don' t fall into disrepair.19 Just this last year I spent thousands of dollars  on 20 plumbing bills and I' ve attached some bills to my 21 testimony for your to see.22 These are just simple repairs. And 23 for the ordinary person you might not think  it 24 costs that much. But I' ve attached a plumbing bill 25 for $ 430 to replace some air vent valves in  the 2 
2 basement.	One apartment just had to replace  its 3 bathroom facet, $ 425 for a bathroom faucet.4 Then there was the leaking toilet 5 in that same apartment that had to have all of   the 6 toilet tank parts replaced, $ 545 . That same 7 building, built in the late 1920 ' s, had to have the 8 skylight in the public hallway replaced because  it 9 was causing a lease -- a leak, $ 2 , 351 .10 These are all real costs which  you 11 can see for yourself.12 I' ve said it year after year and 13 I' ll say it again, the PIOC does not measure  the 14 frequency of a repair. It just measures  the 15 increase of that cost.	And it' s obvious that older 16 buildings require much more maintenance than  a17 newer building.18 The City is full of  brownstones 19 approaching 200 years old. Therefore, this  Board 20 needs to seriously consider passing a minimum  rent 21 increase of $ 60 , aside from the regular percentage 22 increase because five percent on a $ 600 rent  is 23 still $ 30 a month. And this $ 30 a month, or $ 360 a24 year, doesn' t cost -- doesn' t cover the cost of the 25 replacement of just that one bathroom faucet in  the 2 
2 apartment and it doesn' t pay for the increased fuel 3 or the skylight.4 Thank you.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 ( Applause.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.8 MS.

And we do a   lot 6 of the work ourselves. In fact, tonight when I   go 7 back, I have two buildings we have to put   the 8 garbage out in.9 MS. ADAMS:	Okay. Now, do you 10 know, of the total number of rent  stabilized 11 apartments in New York, approximately a  million,12 how many are of the size that you' re dealing  with?13 MR. CHRIS ATHENEOS:	Well, I wish 14 I could tell you the exact figure but I can' t.  But 15 all I can say is I' ve never met Donald Trump  and 16 I' ve never run into any of the big landlords. I17 mean most of the landlords that are -- where all   of 18 my buildings are located, we' re all surrounded by 19 small owners.20 Whether it' s a six- family building 21 or even if it' s a 50 or 60 - unit building,22 especially like in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn  Heights,23 Park Slope, these are all smalltime owners.  They 24 live in the buildings themselves.25 MS. ADAMS:	But you really can' t2 
2 tell me definitively how many of the million  are 3 say, units of a 100 units or less or anything   like 4 that?5 MR. CHRIS ATHENEOS:	I can' t. I6 can' t.	I couldn' t tell you.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Nobody could 8 tell you.9 MR. CHRIS ATHENEOS:	Sorry.10 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you anyway. I11 mean it' s just something, as you know, we' ve been 12 looking for.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	There' s no 14 answer.15 MS. HOLDER:	I have a quick 16 question.17 MR. CHRIS ATHENEOS:	Sure.18 MS. HOLDER:	You' re about the 19 tenth landlord that' s testified tonight that' s20 asked for a minimum rent increase of $ 60 .21 How do you calculate that? What' s22 that based off of?23 MR. CHRIS ATHENEOS:	Well, we' ve 24 -- in our owners, in SPONY, the Small  Property 25 Owners of New York and the Rent  Stabilization 2 
2 Association and other owners group, I mean we' ve 3 had meetings and we came up with this number.  You 4 know, I mean would I like to say $ 150 ? Sure. But I5 don' t think -- I' m trying to be reasonable.6 MS. HOLDER:	What is it based off 7 of? I mean --8 MR. CHRIS ATHENEOS:	What is it 9 based off of?10 MS. HOLDER:	I mean obviously --11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It' s based of 12 what they think you would vote  on.13 ( Audience Participation.)14 MR. CHRIS ATHENEOS:	Yeah, what we 15 think -- yeah. I mean I could come in here and   --16 probably what I think is reasonable and  palatable.17 I mean --18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is that 19 what --20 MR. CHRIS ATHENEOS:	I mean to 21 come in here and say, you know, we should bring   all 22 of the $ 300 rents right up to $ 900 , I would love to 23 say it, but I don' t think any of you would take  me 24 seriously. So we came up with a $ 60 rent  increase 25 just by our conversations.2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So it' s fair 3 to say, from your perspective, it' s a compromised 4 figure.5 MR. CHRIS ATHENEOS:	Yes. A6 compromise.7 I mean I think it' s totally 8 unreasonable. And that being said, I think it' s9 totally unreasonable given the costs, for  someone 10 to come in here, especially the politicians.  I11 understand you' re advocates and you have to 12 advocate on behalf of your constituents. But  I13 think it' s totally irresponsible for anyone to come 14 in here and say zero  percent.15 I mean I went to Costco today  to 16 buy six half- gallons of milk because it' s cheaper 17 because I can save some money. And so I pay   the 18 increase.19 You know, people come up here  and 20 say increase of health insurance, eggs, bread.  We 21 pay for those things too. But we' re all in  this 22 together.23 ( Applause.)24 MR. CHRIS ATHENEOS:	You know.25 But unless the City starts cutting our real  estates 2 
2 taxes.	If we have to pay for the increase in   fuel,3 then the City should look to alternative methods  to 4 relieve owners, whether it' s cutting the real 5 estate taxes in half, providing income for  tenants 6 and providing increased income for tenants,7 increasing the SCRIE, the DRIE. I mean there  are 8 other alternatives but.9 ( Audience Participation.)10 MR. CHRIS ATHENEOS:	You know.

LAWRENCE GREGORY:	I' m19 Lawrence.20 I' m President of the Flatbush 21 Patio Gardens Tenant Association.	And also I want 22 it to be known that I' m also a  landlord.23 I' m going to really talk about the 24 area and my tenants in regards to the  rent 25 increase. I' m not here to advocate a zero  rent 2 
2 tolerance.	But I am asking all of you on the   Board 3 to at least do a reversal and give the  lowest 4 percentage rate for a one- year lease and two- year 5 lease this year. And one of the reasons that  this 6 should be done is because the tricks, let' s say  the 7 tricks, that are being used against tenants, it' s8 very nasty.9 I was here two years ago and  I10 talked about it to, I think, I don' t know your  last 11 name, I' m sorry, the lady here and a gentleman.  And 12 we were talking concessions then.13 The thing is what the young  lady 14 had mentioned over here, preferential rent. There' s15 a trick, a loophole that is being used to get   rid 16 of not only seniors, not only working tenants,  but 17 the new generation of tenants that are coming  into 18 the buildings. They do not know that the  building 19 is rent stabilized, apartments are rent  stabilized.20 Once they -- and as a matter  of 21 fact, we have evidence of this.	I have evidence of 22 it. Once the tenant goes to sign the lease,  the 23 owner will tell him or her or them you must   also 24 sign this preferential rent rider. The  preferential 25 rent rider may be, say $ 300 . The rent for the lease 2 
2 says $ 1100 . So they say you come up with the $ 1100 3 and we' re going hold back on the lease under the 4 preferential rent rider.5 Well, once they' re in, which is 6 illegal, but once they' re in and after the first 7 year goes by and it' s time for the renewal of  their 8 lease, they are no longer given the  preferential 9 rider treatment.	Their lease is gone and the  rent 10 is going to go up to say, I said $ 1200 , $ 1300 ,11 $ 1400 , $ 1500 , a 300 preferential rent rider, but 12 also with what you decide that year in addition  to 13 that.14 And that' s totally unfair and 15 especially for young couples coming in,  senior 16 citizens, this is effecting everyone. And it' s not 17 only just a borough or two. It' s in the whole  area.18 And I believe that you, as  the 19 members of this Board, should really take a lot  of 20 that into consideration. This is not about  the 21 price of milk and all of that. This is about   where 22 people can live and have a home and stay  there.23 And for young people to come  into 24 this situation not knowing but being tricked  into 25 it and they' re paying $ 1600 and $ 1700 just so the 2 
2 landlord can hit that $ 2000 ceiling and then really 3 go forever, wherever he or she wants to. That' s  not 4 fair.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 MR.

They' re going to pay this year as  well.22 So whatever increase is going to be done this  year 23 is really not going to have any effect or  bearing 24 on these tenants.25 And the real issue is that  there 2 
2 are expenses that have increased. Oil, as you  know,3 has gone up. It will hit $ 150 because Goldman  Sachs 4 has said it will and it has to because people   are 5 treating oil like a commodity and a stock  these 6 days. But that' s another issue. And things will 7 happen.	Oil will go up. It' s unfortunate, but it 8 will.9 The expenses have gone up.  Is 10 there something we can do about tenants who  have 11 signed last year? Is there a retroactive  or 12 something they can put on this year to sort of   get 13 something just to take care of the expenses? I   mean 14 we' re talking about a zero percent. But tenants 15 that signed last year have paid a five percent  and 16 that' s nothing. It doesn' t even cover the expenses.17 The second issue is, the Board 18 should actually put in a penalty for those  tenants 19 who sublease. There are tenants that are paying  in 20 the building $ 400 and $ 500 rents for 21 1500 - square- foot apartments.	I don' t have a living 22 space of 1500 square feet.23 These tenants are paying $ 400 and 24 they have subleases inside there that you can' t get 25 rid of because the laws of New York City are   made 2 
2 in such a way that you can' t.3 ( Applause.)4 MR. PETER KOKOLIS:	They have 5 padlocks inside the apartments that HPD  gives 6 violations that we can' t correct because they 7 continue to have these padlocks.	I mean it' s a8 shame that people have these rents and they  are 9 subleasing them making three and a half  thousand 10 dollars from these apartments.11 I think the Board should  make 12 steep penalties for these types of tenants.  They 13 should say, listen, we' re not going to increase 14 your rent, fine. We' re going to give you a  minimal 15 increase.16 But listen, if you are found  to 17 have violated or if you have tenants that you  are 18 subleasing to, you are going to pay a  twenty 19 percent penalty. I mean that' s only fair. It' s only 20 fair.21 ( Applause.)22 MR. PETER KOKOLIS:	And that for 23 tenants that are really living in a 1500  square 24 foot --25 ( Audience Participation.)2 
2 MR. PETER KOKOLIS:	Excuse me. I3 think I deserve my time.4 ( Audience Participation.)5 MR. PETER KOKOLIS:	I believe -- I6 believe tenants that -- we have senior citizens  and 7 there' s people that live in the City of New  York 8 who really can' t afford it. And it' s a shame, you 9 know, and we do help these tenants. There  are 10 tenants that truly deserve not to have  increases.11 But the majority of them are not in that  category.12 The majority of the tenants are  not.13 These senior citizen tenants are 14 tenants who live in 1500 - square- foot apartments. I15 think if they would be willing -- I  wouldn' t16 increase their rents if they were willing to  maybe 17 live in an apartment that was half that size,  for 18 instance. If we can change it and convert it,  and 19 they would continue to pay the same amount of  rent,20 I would have no objection. I would have no   problem.21 But the issue is that  these 22 tenants are not even paying the bare minimum of  the 23 expenses that the building is incurring when you' re 24 paying a rent of $ 400 . I would just like you to 25 take that into consideration.2

Thank you. ( Applause.)MS. CRUZ:	Excuse me. Excuse me,CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Kokolis,
7 just so you understand, I mean every one of   your 8 suggestions, whether they' re the right thing to do 9 or not, are not within our purview to do. We   are 10 especially not allowed to reopen leases. In  fact,11 the guideline board wants us to do that and that' s12 against the law.13 And, you know, there' s lot of 14 things that I' m not going to argue whether they' re 15 right or wrong, but it' s not things we can  do.16 MR. PETER KOKOLIS:	Just one 17 closing statement, please, just one, five  seconds.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.19 MR. PETER KOKOLIS:	I would just 20 like the Board to take into consideration the  model 21 of Massachusetts where they got rid of these  rent 22 controlled and rent stabilized things and they' re 23 doing just fine.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Talk to the 25 Legislature.7 
2 MR. PETER KOKOLIS:	We should take 3 that into consideration.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Talk to the 5 Legislature, then we' d be out of a job, but that' s6 okay.7 John Boyle.

JOSEPH MAHALAK:	So we' re 24 almost done, great.25 I just wanted to -- my name  is 2 
2 Joseph Mahalak. I' m a tenant in Clinton Hill in  a3 ten- unit, rent stabilized building. It was formerly 4 a house. It was converted into ten  studio 5 apartments.6 Just as an example of ways  in 7 which my landlord, for instance, is claiming  that 8 he' s going to lose the building. He' s going through 9 a hardship process now.10 In the example year that he' s used 11 for his hardship proceeding, his biggest expense  is 12 legal expenses. So over $ 20 , 000 in legal expenses 13 for cases in which every case has been  dismissed,14 frivolous lawsuits, which we incur tremendous 15 expenses as tenants as well but we can' t look  at 16 that as an operating expense for the building  in 17 the way in which he  can.18 The other thing or one other  small 19 example in his claim of poverty is water  expenses.20 And this came up last week. And I understand  that 21 water is an expensive bill for  a landlord.	We are 22 responsible tenants and we are careful tenants  and 23 good tenants in that building.24 But he just did landscaping in  the 25 backyard and installed sixteen new shrubs and  he 2 
2 spent six hours a day watering those shrubs.  Again,3 that goes towards his operating expenses for  the 4 building. It' s not a bearing on we, the  tenants,5 but he can justify that in his hardship  proceeding.6 So that in mind, but then so  many 7 unbearable means in place sort of striving  towards 8 to the $ 2000 cap. So I' m asking you to consider,9 for instance, a zero percent increase until  those 10 reforms are made which eliminate the $ 2000 cap.11 Because there' s a lot of things being done.12 The legal proceedings again me  and 13 against other tenants in the building are one  of 14 those means to just increase our rents  moving 15 towards -- towards that day when there will be  no 16 rent stabilized apartments.17 So I guess, you know, just  the 18 short of it or a proposal I have is, freeze the   --19 freeze the rent increase until the reforms are  made 20until at least the $ 2000 cap is eliminated.21CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22MR. JOSEPH MAHALAK:	Thank you.23( Applause.)24CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Attarian.25MR. MARTIN ATTARIAN:	I live on 
2	the middle East Side. And I' ve been there since the 3	end of 1979 .4 It' s a studio apartment. It' s a5 ground floor back. I have a little garden. It' s6 wonderful. When I took that apartment in about  28 7 years ago, it was considered horrendously 8 expensive. It was $ 525 a month rent and that  was 9 considered ridiculous.10 Anyway, after my second lease they 11 wanted to throw me out claiming that the  ground 12 floor was all commercial and that they didn' t have 13 to give me a  lease.14 Anyway, I spent four and a  half 15 years in court and a hefty bill for an attorney   and 16 finally won rent stabilized status.17 The building happens to be a co- op 18 and I' m a renter there.	The building is run very 19 well. The maintenance people are incredibly good.  I20 have no complaints about anything that has to  be 21 done there.	But I hear these nightmare  stories 22 about other people that have violations and  with 23 these increases.24 So my bit is to see what can  be 25 done about these violations and how to handle  this 4 

2	sort of thing.3
And the handout I just handed  to 
4 the group up there states, jail time not fines  for 5 convictions of landlords who are complicit  for 6 tenant housing violations not prepared within  the 7 three- week period from compliance.	No increase of 8 landlords and their rents. They don' t open their 9 books and are mandated by law to show income  and 10 expenditures.11 Not opening their books also 12 punishable with jail time only. Again, no crime  for 13 landlords, their reps, including all complicit 14 parties such as the Mayor, the Chair, a number  of 15 the Rent Guidelines Board members.16 Increase in rent only if  mandated 17 profit, not greed shown by the  open books.	It' s18 the law. Why the hell do you people get away   with 19 all this noncompliance? I don' t get it. I mean if  I20 cross in the middle of Jay Street, I' ll probably  be 21 ticketed and you guys get away with  murder.22 And I hear people complaining 23 about the cost of oil. I don' t hear anybody  saying 24 that we should go after the oil companies who  are 25 reaping incredible profits at our expenses.  Why 4 
2 should it be put on the backs of the  tenants?3 ( Applause.)4 MR. MARTIN ATTARIAN:	And I hear a5 landlord complaining that he just paid $ 450 for a6 lousy faucet.	I do interior designing as one of  my 7 businesses.	And I did four bathrooms in the  last 8 year. I paid $ 475 for one faucet and $ 350 for 9 another and then there was one was $ 275 and  then 10 another in Brooklyn, $ 89 . And damn it, it' s the 11 best one of the lot. So you have a choice.   You 12 don' t have to go out and carry on about what  things 13 are costing you.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you wrap 15 up?16 MR. MARTIN ATTARIAN:	Yes. Okay.17 Where are we?18 Double jail time for books cooked 19 by landlords and their reps,  et cetera.	Recap:20 Noncompliance to the rent laws.21 Steps:	Complaint, arrest,22 prosecution, sentencing and jail time.

I' m a22 landlord. I' m a landlord in Brooklyn.

2 brought actual bills in not from five years  ago,3 but from last month and this  month.4 In one of my buildings the  water 5 bill was $ 7900 last year. This year it' s over 6 $ 9000 . And I' m sure you heard on the news that next 7 July or this July it' s going to go up  another 8 fourteen percent.9 I got a notice from KeySpan,  now 10 called National Grid, that my gas is going to  be 11 shut off because I fell back so far on the   heating 12 bill. And I don' t know if you know this, but when  a13 landlord falls behind on the heating bill,  they 14 actually mail a notice to every single tenant  in 15 the building.	And, you know, it' s an embarrassment 16 to say the least.17 And in one of my other buildings  I18 was issued a warrant from the State Tax  Department 19 for falling behind on taxes because my money  for 20 taxes was going to heat. And I also have that   to 21 show you.22 So a lot of these things  that 23 landlords are saying they' re not fairytale stories.24 This isn' t Habitat for Humanity.

I own buildings almost about  28 19 years since I was 19 years  old.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Closer to the 21 mike. We can' t really hear you.22 Go ahead.23 MR. RAYMOND CETO:	I thought of 24 being a landlord since I was twenty years old.  And 25 all these years been building up years after  year.14 
 2 I have terrible tenants which everybody -- we' ve 3 been through, you know, all the stories you  be 4 hearing back and forth. Landlord right,  tenant 5 right.6 All I' m asking, why I coming here 7 is because things are really going expensive  not 8 besides gas. It' s the whole where things going up.9 Let' s talk about rice. The price 10 go up rice 65 percent  lately. Okay?	What we going 11 to do about it?	Now, I understand some tenants pay 12	a lot of money on rent, $ 1200 , $ 1500 , $ 2000 .	I13 can' t imagine people paying $ 3000 ' cause I don' t14 have a tenant like that. My highest rent is almost 15	about $ 1100 .16 Now, I have a lot of tenants  which 17 is below $ 500 , $ 550 . Now, I happen to find out 18 their family members bring all their laundry to  his 19 home to wash the laundry. Now, who expense is  going 20 to come out from? We keep on paying on   rent.21 All I am asking is you really  have 22 to give in a subsidized increase to help those   low 23 rents, I mean to make those low rent pay a   little 24 bit higher.	You know, I don' t know how we going to 25 come up with a number of $ 60 , $ 100 but we 16 
2 definitely need something to be subsidized to  help 3 the landlord getting low rent.4 I ask myself, I do all -- I  don' t5 have a bill to my testimony but I tell you   one 6 thing, I' m a cook. I ended up becoming  a7 maintenance guy now. I do my own plumbing. I do   my 8 own electric.	I do my own roofing. I stuck my  hand 9 inside the toilet bowl to get all the plastic  and 10 pennies on to clean up by myself. Can I afford   to 11 get a plumber? I can' t afford to get a  plumber.12 I just finished my painting 13 because of led paint. People play games.  I14 understand there' s a lot of good tenant and a  lot 15 of good landlord.	I understand there' s a lot of 16 bad landlord. It' s very simple. Go to HPD. I' ve 17 been dealing with that. HPD will make you  do 18 exactly what you have to do in  court.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How many 20 buildings do you own?21 MR. RAYMOND CETO:	I own two of 22 them.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How many units 24 in total?25 MR. RAYMOND CETO:	Sorry?2 

23	in total?45	units.6
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How many units MR. RAYMOND CETO:	They' re all six One mistake that I learn is we  buy 
7 six units. That' s only one mistake I make.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.9 MS. HOLDER:	And they' re all rent 10 stabilized you say?11 MR. RAYMOND CETO:	They' re all 12 rent stabilized.13 As long as they pay more than  814 $ 900 , you know, I could deal with it. I don' t have 15 to make a living on them. But to maintain  them,16 okay, with all my labor is still cost me on   average 17 about $ 600 per apartment.18 Now, once I walk away,  neighbor 19 come around throwing papers, dirty stuff on  the 20 floor. The next thing I got is Sanitation. I   see 21 judge used to deduct them. Now you telling  that 22 officer is writing the wrong information. I  would 23 like to bring my Sanitation guy to  testimony.24 That' s a $ 100 fine right down there.25 I finish my work at 10 : 00 . I drove 7 
2 my car to my building in front. I clean up. Do   I3 have a super? I do. But my super ask me, how   much 4 you pay me? $ 100 a month you expect me to  clean 5 your front floor day and night? But does  the 6 Sanitation care about it?	Nobody cares about it.7 All we asking the people who pay low rent,  we 8 definitely have to adjust that.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 MR.

ROBERT ROHRBACHER:	Thank 17 you.18 My name is Robert Rohrbacher,19 R- o- h- r- b- a- c- h- e- r.20 Good evening, members of the  Rent 21 Guidelines Board.22 Thank you for this opportunity.23 I' m the owner of a six- family 24 house, just one. And I' ve owned it for forty  years.25 A few of my tenants have been there for 38   years.2 
2 One twenty years. So you can imagine what types  of 3 rents I was getting because they were all  under 4 rent control.5 I just barely made it all  those 6 years. And when I finally started making money,  I7 put it all back in the building. Put 220 in   every 8 apartment. Air conditioning. I replumbed the  house,9 new roof.10 Last year, a year and a half now  I11 put in $ 24 , 000 in a new front and back and new 12 windows. Now that' s because I was making a  little 13 more money.14 Now, two of those -- two of  those 15 tenants are paying -- one is paying $ 721 and  the 16 other one is paying less than $ 600 . I hear 17 everybody saying $ 60 . And actually, I think $ 60 may 18 be fair in some cases, but some not. When  you' re 19 paying that little for what these tenants  are 20 getting, I think $ 100 and $ 200 would be appropriate 21 for me to bring it up to where it' s at least  fair.22 I think it should be a  sliding 23 scale depending on how little that rent is only  to 24 be fair to landlord.25 Now, these people who live there,2 
2 I don' t get a lot of in and outs. My tenants  stay 3 there for years. You can tell by the  rents.4 Now, that builds community. And 5 that' s what New York needs, building the community.6 They build a relationship with themselves  inside 7 the house.8 Now, if I can' t afford to have a9 nice house, these people will have no -- no  --10 they' ll feel no affection to stay around. They will 11 want to go somewhere else. What' s to keep them 12 there. But I make it very nice and very  livable.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where' s your 14 house?15 MR. ROBERT ROHRBACHER:	It' s in 16 1530 Gates Avenue in Brooklyn.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	1530 what?18 MR. ROBERT ROHRBACHER:	Gates 19 Avenue in Brooklyn.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Gates?21 MR. ROBERT ROHRBACHER:	Yeah,22 right off of Myrtle Avenue.23 It helps -- it helps really that  I24 have no mortgage otherwise I wouldn' t be able to  do 25 these things.2 
2 Now, my rent, my oil bills.  Last 3 year, I just went over it, with the oil   company 4 before I came here today, I paid five  thousand 5 about two hundred dollars last year for  oil.6 This year, as of today, my  last 7 delivery was about a month and a  half ago.	A month 8 ago I paid $ 5 , 700 so far. Now, this is -- this is 9 really going to eat into anything I can do for   my 10 tenants. And this is -- this is really  where 11 communities break down when there' s not enough 12 money to put back in your buildings to keep a   good 13 community. That' s what I' m concerned about.14 This is my retirement. I take  good 15 care of the tenants and they take good care of   me.16 I' m just asking that you just take care of all  of 17 us properly.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 MR. ROBERT ROHRBACHER:	Thank you.20 ( Applause.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sir, introduce 22 yourself.23 MR. SAM ZABALE:	My name is Sam 24 Zabale.	I have an eight- family in Crown Heights.25 Z- a- b- a- l- e.2 
2 Eight- family in Crown Heights,3 Brooklyn.	The average rent is $ 821 . I have two 4 tenants paying less than $ 400 .5 Only -- the point that was  made 6 earlier.	Only four out of eight tenants   will 7 actually have a lease renewal in the coming  year 8 and be affected by anything the Rent  Guidelines 9 Board does. I understand that' s the system here but 10 just as matter of cause.11 We' ve talked a lot about all the 12 increases. I' m not going to, you know, talk about 13 water, and taxes and all of that. I' d just like  to 14 isolate and specifically talk about oil.15 Two years ago the oil was $ 2 . 20 a16 gallon.	That was up twenty percent from the  year 17 before.18 Last winter it was $ 3 . 10 a gallon.19 That was up forty percent from the year before  and 20 that was because in June of last year, so   exactly 21 twelve months ago, I bought a cap, a cap to cap   the 22 oil costs for the winter which was -- I   was 23 fortunate to do that.24 If you look at The Wall  Street 25 Journal article that I just handed out, from  June 2 
2 ' 07 to June ' 08 the cost of oil in the open market,3 which obviously none of us have any power over,  is 4 up 114 percent. That' s from $ 65 to $ 135 per barrel 5 of oil.6 What that means right now is  that 7 this winter we can all expect to pay $ 6 a gallon  in 8 oil. I don' t think people realize that just yet.9 They' re talking backwards and saying forty percent 10 from last year. We legitimately could have a $ 6  oil 11 burden on the landlords this winter. And  people 12 should really be recognizing that.13 Now, if you talk percentage, we' ve 14 been talking percentage, percentage, percentage.15 Let' s put real dollars on this. This is an 16 eight- family, mind you.17 I paid $ 14 , 590 last year in oil 18 for last winter. That doesn' t include maintenance 19 or service. Between eight units that' s $ 1 , 825 per 20 unit or $ 152 a month per unit.21 The increase that I spoke  about 22 from the winter before last to this  winter 23 represented a $ 42 a month per unit increase.  People 24 have asked in the past, how do you get to the  $ 60 25 number?	This is $ 42 associated with just oil,2 
2 nothing else. Not -- and this is across  eight 3 tenants, not four tenants who are going to  renew.4 Eight tenants is $ 42 per month per tenant.5 So this winter with the $ 6 a6 gallon I can expect $ 150 per tenant increase. That 7 being said, I would ask the Board to install a  $ 100 8 minimum increase that would cover the cost of  just 9 oil in the coming year.10 Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 ( Applause.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any more 14 testimony, anybody else?15 This young lady?16 MS.

2 of the increased oil, I' ve been working six days,3 sometimes seven days a week from 9 : 00 to 8 : 00 at 4 night. I' m just coming from work now.5 If there' s another increase, there 6 is no way I can pay it. I' ve been working for  19 7 years. I have a couple of my union members here.   We 8 do not get good increases with our union. So I   just 9 want to sympathize.10 I work for HRA. I have people  --11 I' m now working in the Village.	I have people 12 lined up. I just finished working in Borough  Park 13 which is a " rich neighborhood." The cases are  piled 14 to the ceiling.15 I also would like to  sympathize 16 with the tenants, the working and the  nonworking.17 It' s just getting to be a burden between  working 18 all these hours and the amount of our caseloads  are 19 just so high.	So I also would like you to  take 20 that into consideration ' cause it' s getting to be a21 real strain on the working  people.22 Thank you.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thanks,2

( Applause.)MS. HOLDER:	I' m sorry. I have aCHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I' m sorry.Dawn, we have a  question.MS.	HOLDER:	I have question,
9	just quickly.	I' m sorry.10 How long have you lived in  New 11 York?12 MS. DAWN JONES:	I' ve lived in New 13 York for 19 years. But admittedly this is my  third 14 apartment. Okay? --15 MS. HOLDER:	And how long have you 16 been in this --17 MS. DAWN JONES:	-- because I went 18 and bought a house in Queens and that  was 19 astronomical. I didn' t realize what I was getting 20 into so I moved back to  Harlem.21 And now my rent is going to be  --22 it' s $ 1085 now. Sixty dollars more is -- and then I23 got to pay Con Ed, Time Warner, Verizon. I' m24 working a lot of hours. I' m about to go find a   bar 25 to work at because I can' t do it with this  one 10 

2	check.3
And I' m just saying I also want 
4 you all to know about the people that are  coming 5 it' s not just people on welfare. There' s working 6 people that are coming in for one- shot deals. And 7 I' m at work late processing these cases.8 So I also want you to take  that 9 into consideration. You' re not going to hear that 10 from the Commissioners. But the frontline  people 11 that work, we' re working on these cases for hours.12 And I just finished working  in 13 Borough Park for two years and now I' m in  the 14 Village. And it' s the same thing.15 MS. HOLDER:	And when you say a16 one- shot deal, you' re talking about --17 MS. DAWN JONES:	One- shot deal is 18 where professional people are coming in.	I have 19 attorneys coming in, teachers coming in  because 20 they' re behind in their rent and they need help. I21 have a couple of people who have been evicted  from 22 their buildings cause they don' t qualify ' cause 23 they make too much for a one- shot deal.	But they 24 do at least, you know, come in. But we' ve got  to 25 process all those papers.4 
2 What we do is we process  the 3 papers and it goes to the Rental Assistance  Unit.4 MS. HOLDER:	Right. And you have 5 to prove that you have a future ability to pay   the 6 rent also.7 MS. DAWN JONES:	Right, or they 8 need a third party.9 Most of the people don' t qualify 10 but that' s how bad it' s getting that people are 11 coming in. I mean, you can come Uptown. I' ve  got 12 teachers who are working in bars. I mean it' s  just 13 getting to be too much. I do sympathize that  their 14 oil bills are high, but I mean in my complex a   lot 15 of people have been put out and it' s just  starting 16 to get too, too expensive.17 MS. HOLDER:	And how many rooms 18 do you have?19 MS. DAWN JONES:	Excuse me?20 MS. HOLDER:	How many rooms do 21 you live in?22 MS. DAWN JONES:	I have one 23 bedroom, yes. I mean I might have to go back to   a24 studio but the studios are up in the thousands  now.25 Okay?2 
 2 And what she and I were  speaking 3 about, if there was some way we could get a   housing 4 subsidy or something because it' s just getting --5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' re aware 6 of that.7 MS. DAWN JONES:	Yes. It' s getting 8 to be too -- it' s just getting to be -- it' s  a9 burden on the working people.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 We have another public hearing 14 Monday, at 10 : 00 at the Great Hall at Cooper Union.15 See you there.16 Thank you.17 ( At 10 : 38 p. m., the proceedings 18 were concluded.) 19202122232425
