2 purview, but it all adds into the same  thing,3 which is the housing affordability issue,  which4 is a problem for New York.5 If you have any other thoughts6 in terms of how we can come up with that  balance7 I would appreciate it.8	COUNCILMEMBER GAIL BREWER:	I9 appreciate it. I mean I just think that  the10 proviso idea is an interesting  one.11 I can't tell you how many12 buildings  - - a survey might  be possible	- - that13 are both rent regulated and vacancy  decontrol.14 And I would say in those situations,  in15 part icular, I do think that it is quite unfair  to16 sort of enhance the owners' revenue with  those17 rent regulated because there is a very  good18 stream coming from those that are market .19 The other situation, of  course,20 is there are co-ops and then there are  rent21 regulat ed. And  in those particular buildings22 where there is an addit ional revenue to cover  the23 increased property tax and insurance and so on,   I24 do think you should think about a  different25 scenario.9 
2 Now, of course, I would like  to3 see no rent increase at all , and I understand4 there' s both sides to the issue.5	But we have never had this new6 dynamic of so many rent - - off - the- rent7 regulat ion in a similar building.	I can tell you8 now because buildings are going co-op and all  of9 a sudden somebody who has been living there   for10 thirty years, for two years they were  making11	$175,000	that 's not so much money when you are12 a couple of working household members, and  the13 rent was over $2000 and they can't purchase  the14 co-op at the insider price. In fact , the owners15 wants them out.16 So there are so many  buildings17 like that. I think that that should be looked   at18 very carefully and think outside the  box.19 Thank you very much.20 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.21 (Audience participat ion.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Another23 quest ion.24 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you so much25 for your testimony and also thank you for your12 
1	3022	advocacy on these issues.3	I was wondering what else  you've4 seen. I know your office is very involved  in5 these issues. But have you also seen in  your6 dist rict or throughout the City landlords7 actually going to meters in their buildings  where8 the tenants actually are now being required  to9 pay for their own  utilities?10 COUNCILMEMBER  GAIL BREWER:11 Yes, we have seen that , not in a huge number, but12 certainly it 's something that comes up.13 It isn't a constant , but , yes,14 we have heard  it. But  I can't tell you that it ' s15 a large - scale effort , to be honest  with you.16 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 (Audience part icipat ion. )19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Walter Gambin20 - -  hold on one second. Mr. Gambin, hold on one21 second.22 After Mr. Gambin is Janet  Bulan,23 then Bob Grossman, then Melvin Trepper .24 Go ahead , Mr. Gambin.25 MR. WALTER GAMBIN:	Okay.4 
1	3032	My name is Walter Gambin. I'm  a3 tenant at the Dexter House, 345 West 86th Street ,4 Manhattan.5	I am on public assistance. I6 cannot work enough because of my heart  condition.7 The Dexter House is a Class  A8 Section 248 SRO building . The new management	in9 place for around one and one- third years now  has10 been illegally renting bot h as a hotel and as a11 host el. They have reduced services and have been12 showing an unfriendly,  unwelcoming att itude13 towards many of the permanent  residents.14 These condit ions along with the15 collecting of hostel and hotel rates for at  least16 thirty- five rooms tell me that my landlord17 deserves no rent increase.18 (Audience participation.)19 MR. WALTER GAMBIN:	I am happy20 to see that the New York City Corporation  Counsel21 has filed a case in New York State Supreme  Court22 against Dexter House management	for its illegal23 hotel and hostel renting.24 Now, I have a question which  is25 perhaps to be contemplated , maybe to be  answered6 
2 now. Are there any among the landlords  who3 believe that there is morality to consider,  to4 feel about adding a financial burden to  the5 people of the lower and middle income  economic6 classes if they raise rents again while they,  the7 landlords, already have multiples more  than8 enough for their own financial needs?9 And to the Rent Guidelines  Board10 I would like to say basically you can do  the11 right thing, what I think is the right  thing,12 what a lot of people here seem to think is  the13 right thing, which is to give basically no  more14 rent increases, except perhaps in some  cases15 where there are hardships, where if landlords   are16 will ing, they can open their books to the State17 Housing Authority,	if they are willing, if  they18 don' t have anything to hide , or if they are19 will ing to be open and honest , which I don't20 trust overall that they are.21 And in the words of the22 Constitution liberty and justice for all .23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 (Audience participat ion .)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Janet Bulan.2 
2	MS . JANET BULAN:	Hello!3 My name is Janet Bulan.  About4 ten years ago I heard a politician give a  speech5 to a different Rent Guidelines Board asking for  a6 thorough review of this system, stating that  this7 ritual is unproductive  for owners and renters8 al ike.9 I strongly agree that we need  to10 seriously look at means other than the  annual11 rent increases for making housing viable  for12 private owners.13 Simply increasing the rent  by14 such a minuscul e percent is not the answer. There15 are so many small property owners whose  rent16 rolls do not cover maintenance and  operating17 costs, let alone make a profit.18 Our small building is over  a19 hundred and twenty years old and our  expenses20 have skyrocketed over the years. Our  average21 regulated rent for a one-bedroom on the  Upper22 East Side is $367. 08 per month. Our building has23been owneroccupied since 1920 and always  well24maint ainedand violat ion free.25Our long- term occupants love
1	3062 their gold mine so much that they very often  have3 roommates while they spend their summers at  their4 homes away from home for months on  end.5	Is it fair that someone who 6 moved into the City, into a renovated  apartment7 in 1975 was paying only $278.00 in 1984  and8 thirty years later is only paying $574. 00 when 9 his salary was $33 , 000 in 1984 and is now 10	$150,000 as of the year 2000711 Is it fair that our property12 taxes went up from $8,500 in 1984 to $44,000  last13 year, and is due to increase  again?14 Do the math. People like  this15 should at least be required to pay rent  keeping16 in step with their increases in salary and  our17 escalating costs.18 The protection of this  lifelong19 privilege for entrenched New Yorkers regardless20 of their income at the expense of owners is   the21 root of all evil in this housing system. It  must22 end.23 How is the interest of the  City24 better served when the property owner is   forced25 to personally provide a subsidy to that  tenant?11 
2 We don' t require to get proof of financial need3 of tenants to obtain such a subsidy.  Landlords4 open their books; tenants do  not.5 Most of our low- rent tenants6 have much more equity than some of our  higher7 renters. Tenants who are in dire  financial8 straits have a variety of public agencies  they9 can turn to for help .10 Such help is not available  to11 the property owner. He either pays his bills  or12 loses his building and that is not in the  best13 interest of the City.14 In closing, I ask you to take  a15 long view of the effects of your  guidelines'16 percentages on the economy of small , aging17 properties and their owners. New York needs  us.18 Tenants need us. All we ask for are fair  rents19 and a chance to realize an income from  our20investment sandour hard work.21Thank you .22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Any23quest ions?24(No response.)25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Thank you.

Those of  you5 who spoke the other night , you know, we have a6 lot of people we need to get through and  we've7	had	Mr . Grossman is the third or fourth person  8 from the last night. And I would appreciate  if9 that those who spoke the other night would  wait10 until the end. We' ll take everybody. But it11 really is not fair to all the  people.12 But , go ahead , Mr . Grossman.13 MR. BOB GROSSMAN:	Thank you.14 Every year we hear from  so-15 called small landlords claiming that  their16 prof its are inadequate.17 Let them open their books and  if18 they can prove their prof its are inadequate, the19 law says they can get hardship  increases.20 They have no business coming  in21 front of the Rent Guidelines Board and asking  for22 rent increases.23 I 've been living in an SRO hotel24 in Manhattan for the past nineteen years. As you  25	know, SRO hotels must rent out  seventy percent of8 
2 their rooms on a rent stabilized basis in  order3 to qualify for any rent increases vot ed by the4 Rent Guidelines Board .5 That is not done by any  SRO6 hotels in New York City that I know of . Very few7 of them meet this seventy percent  requirement8 because they will only rent to tourists  and9 students who are willing to pay $120 a day  rent10 and up .11 These SRO hotels don' t need and12 don' t deserve a rent increase from the Rent13 Guidelines Board because they are making very  big14 prof its from the tourists and students.15 This is why there' s so few16 landlords that attend these  hearings.17 The number of rent  stabilized18 tenants in New York City has been  drastically19 reduced over the years by landlords who refuse   to20 rent rooms on a rent stabilized basis. And  by21 doing so, which is illegal, they have  defeated22 the purpose of the rent stabilization law  which23 was and is to allow low- income people to live  in24 New York City.25 Landlords' greed has for  many2 
2 years been turning the City into a place  where3 only the rich can afford to  live.4 Emma Lazarus had these  words5 written on the Statue of Liberty in New  York6 Harbor and they state what the United States  has7 always meant to the people of the  world:8 Give me your tired , your poor,9 Your huddl ed masses yearning to10 be free.11 Well , Emma  Lazarus got  it right.12 A hundred years later after she wrote those  words13 still many of us are poor and all of us  are14 t ired. And I 'm telling you why we' re tired. We15 are tired of being exploited by peopl e whose16 greed knows no limits and who want to live  off17 the misery of most of their fellow  citizens.18 We are tired of a real  estate19 industry that refuses to build low and  moderate20 income housing.21 We are t ired of polit icians who22 are bribed by the real estate lobby and won' t23 vote to build low and moderate income housing   in24 the City.25 We are tired of the richest  city2 
2 in the history of the world having  homeless3 people sleeping in its parks and on  sidewalks.4 And we are tired of the  Rent5 Guidelines Board giving rent increases  to6 landlords who don' t deserve them.7 I ask the Rent Guidelines  Board8 members to seek the welfare and happiness of   the9 many and not indulge the selfishness and greed   of10 the few. I ask you to have a conscience.  You11 should not vot e for a rent increase but for a12 reduction in rents.13 Thank you.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Perfect.15 (Audience participat ion. )16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Melvin17 Trepper; are you here?18 (No response.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Trepper?20 (No response.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Harry22 Atkinson.23 The next three are Harry24 Atkinson,  Jeremy Eagle and Eduardo Barahona.25 Mr. Atkinson.2 
1	3122 MR . HARRY ATKINSON :	Thank you .3 Good afternoon, Panel.4	My name is Harry Atkinson . I5 have been an SRO tenant at 80 Riverside Drive   for6 the past twenty- five years, and now I 'm retired7 and I'm living on limited income .8 The Riverside Towers Hotel  has9 120 rooms of which only now sixteen are rented  by10 tenants such as myself . The other one hundred or11 so rooms are rented to tourists at $90 to $100  a12 night at least .13 Surely no landlord is in  any14 hardship. My room is 9 x 9, no kitchen, no  air15 conditioning , no room service and a shared shower16 and toilet.17 Repair work is always ongoing  in18 a building such as ours,  and upgrading	- and I19 use the word carefully - principally for  tourist20 benef it allowed the landlord to apply for MCI21 increases. We pay the  increases.2 2	Affordable  housing is rapidly23 diminishing in our City and in our  building24 part icularly. No more long - term tenants are25 allowed to come in, and these rooms  become23 
2 tourist rooms.3 As you know from other rental4 apartments, once they are vacated , the landlord5 puts up the other rents and the rents  become6 prohibit ively expensive .7	As a mass of voters live in  and8 on rather an income of about $20,000 a  year,9 which is $1600 a mont h. If you pay a rent of  $70010 to $1000 , that is more than half of what you take11 home. The rest you have to subsidize somehow or12 other to find ut ilities, food , clothing and13 health insurance, if you  can.14 This mass of voters are  getting15 itchy and polit icians rely on those mass votes.16 Surely the Rent Guidelines Board is aware  of17 these conditions. Reduce the hardship of  paying18 high rents by acting compassionately	towards19 renters less fortunate than  myself.20 May you set a good example  for21 the rest of the country.22 Thank you.23 (Audience participation. )24 MS. LUSSKIN:	Last year the25 Board voted zero percent  increases for SRO8 
2	tenants.3	MR. HARRY ATKINSON:	I can4	hardly hear you. I'm sorry.5	MS. LUSSKIN:	I'm sorry.6	Last year the Board vot ed zero7 percent  increases for SRO tenants, but two  years8 previously there was an increase but with  a9 proviso attached that should have kept  the10 tenants in your building, because there' s less11 than seventy- five percent are being rented to12 permanent	SRO tenants.13 Did your landlord take the14 increase or try to take the increase in the year15 two years previously when an increased was  vot ed16 in?17 MR. HARRY ATKINSON:	No. The18 landlord has kept to the Rent Guidelines  Board ,19 but he puts in MCis for work which is  maint enance20 repair and we are continuing how to contest  it .21 But DHCR , whatever, constantly award him this22 upgrading which is  really maintenance	repair.23 MS. LUSSKIN:	Right.24 MR. HARRY ATKINSON:	And we25 have extra  income  - -  increases rather because of7 
2	that .3	MS. LUSSKIN:	Right.4 But my question is the  proviso5 did actually do its job two years ago; is  that6 correct? In the sense the RGB increase did not  go7 - -  I understand  there were many,  many other8 increases, but the RGB - voted increase on SRO9 rents two years ago, he did not  - - your   landlord10 did not take because he did not qualify under  the11 proviso; is that correct?12MR. HARRY ATKINSON:	That 's13true.14MS. LUSSKIN:	Okay. Thank you.15MR. ZELNIK:	Yes. I have another16quest ion too.17MR. HARRY ATKINSON:	Yes.18MR. ZELNIK:	Just to clarify.19You said yourroom is about 9 foot by 9  foot.20MR. HARRY ATKINSON:	9 x 9.21MR. ZELNIK:	And you share a22bathroom?23MR. HARRY ATKINSON:	A toilet24and a shower.25MR. ZELNIK:	And you have no
2	kitchen?3	MR. HARRY ATKINSON:	No4	kitchen.5	MR . ZELNIK:	And could you tell6	me what you pay per mont h, please?7 MR. HARRY ATKINSON:	I'm sorry?8 MR. ZELNIK:	What you pay for9	monthly rent?10		MR. HARRY ATKINSON:	It 's only 11	like $400, between $400 to  $500.12	MR. ZELNIK:	$400 to $500?13 MR. HARRY ATKINSON:	A mont h.14 MR. ZELNIK:	A mont h.15 So let ' s just say $450 .16 MR. HARRY ATKINSON:	But if I17 get  - - if I try to get a studio, it would   be18 above.19 MR. ZELNIK:	Okay. But right now20 you are currently paying roughly $450 a  month?21 MR . HARRY ATKINSON:	I'm sorry?22 MR . ZELNIK:	Right now you're23 paying roughly $450 a  month?24 MR. HARRY ATKINSON:	$450.25 MR . ZELNIK:	Okay.  Thank you.13 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3	(Audience part icipat ion.)4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jeremy Eagle,5	Eduardo Barahona,  followed by Chris Carroll.6	MR. JEREMY EAGLE:	My name is7	Jeremy Eagle. I live in Inwood, Upper  Manhattan.8 As a fifteen-year resident  - -9 A VOICE:	Speak into the mike.10 MR . JEREMY EAGLE:	I'm Jeremy11 Eagle  from  Inwood , Upper Manhat tan.12 As a fifteen-year resident in  a13 rent stabil ized apartment , I've become a keen14 observer of trends in my neighborhood  and15 building.16 Is this working? Can you hear17 me?18 However, it is clear that  the19 tenants  - -  I'm sorry. My landlord goes by  the20 books. However, it is clear that the tenants  that21 he has selected , that he has certain   standards .22 In order to meet his goals, the tenant s he23 chooses are clearly selective because it 's clear24 that they will not stay in the building  very25 long.10 
2 This is just one of the means3 that he uses to turn over the leases  and4 eventually get the apartments in the building  off5 of the stabilized lease rolls.6 And though he goes by the  books,7 he only does the minimally required things  to8 maintain the building. So we have been left  with9 sixty- year old windows and a building that10 freezes in the wintertime.11 I believe he does the minimal12 amount to maintain the building, again  to13 encourage people to leave rather than  stay.14 Now, he does all of this  even15 though he owns the buildings outright.  He16 inherited five apartment buildings,  82 apartments17 in each building, inherited these buildings  from18 his father who built them sixty years  ago.19 So while the apartments are20 going off of the stabilized rent rolls, rents  are21 going up. He has probably no mortgages on  the22 building. Of course, it 's hard to prove all of23 this. It's hard to see his  books.24 But , again, I 've been a long -25 time resident and I think it 's pretty clear what2 
2 he' s doing in the building and how much prof it he3 is making.4 In the time that I have lived  in5 that building I'm sure the value of this  building6 and the others that he owns has gone up  perhaps7 three t imes. I'm sure it 's tripled while my wages8 have remained basically flat in the last  ten9 years.10 I think this is a more  typical11 situation. I urge you to rollback the rents  to12 give the people a chance to stay in the  homes13 that they've tried to live in for years and  years14 while the landlords are moving us through  and15 pushing us out.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 (Audience part icipat ion.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Eduardo19 Barahona.20 MR. EDUARDO BARAHONA:	I'm from21 Jamaica, Queens. And  I belong to - - I'm a   tenant22 and also belong to the Central  Hispanic23 (unintelligible.) And we have the United  Tenant24 Coal ition. We are fighting for justice.25 And we have been working  where2 
2 the City recognize that there is a crisis here  in3 New York City. One of them is the Battery  Park4 City that is giving some form now to  build5 affordable  housing . The other  one is6 (unintelligible)	That is the SPD program. We  won7 it .8 The City recognize that we  have9 a crisis in affordability of housing . When we10 talk affordability, we are talking also  to11 preserve the apartments that we have  already12 affordability, and that means the  rent13 stabilized. You know, that the City  now14 pract ically putting nothing on the rent15 stabil ized. It 's also every year increase plus16 increase.17 And landlords get rent  increases18 for MCis or vacancy allowances. They get also   for19 the RGB every year it 's increasing.20 And the other thing is that  we21 know that by statistics that the cost of  living22 here in New York City is so high. Even if  the23 minimum wage went to $6 an hour, the  statist ics24 show that a person should make $11 to live  here25 in New York City.9 
2 But despite all of these  facts,3 the RGB continues every year increasing  the4 rents. And most of the peopl e who live in those5 buildings are people with low income or  people6 who make the minimum wage. That is why  - -  the7 reason I am here in the name of the tenants  to8 stop the increase and to freeze the increases  for9 this year and for the next year to take  into10 consideration all of those facts, that  people11 we don't need more increases on the rent .12 Thank you.13 (Audience participation. )14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 Question.16 MR. EDUARDO BARAHONA:17 Question?18 MR. PAGAN:	Yes. I have a19 quest ion.20 I know the work that you are21 doing in Queens. But in reference to the peopl e -22 - I know you represent a lot of newcomers  from23 Latin America. And could you give us an idea  of24 what kind of wages they are  getting?25 MR. EDUARDO BARAHONA:	Yeah.2 
2 Most  of them, you know, working  even - - we  are3 working in labor	(unintelligible) with the4 workers, has been abuse.  Even  - -  some of them5 don' t make even the minimum wage . We are fighting6 for them working twelve/thirteen hours with  not7 gett ing enough, you know. And people sometimes8 living five or seven people to pay the  rent9 because the money they are making they  are10 spending on the rent , more than seventy percent11 of what they make.12 MR.

CHRIS CARROLL:	Good19 afternoon.20 My name is Christopher Carroll .21 I am opposed to any SRO rent increase this  year22 for the following reasons.23 I am a writer with a low  income.24 I pay more than thirty percent of my  annual25 income for rent of a single small room in an  SRO .2 
2 I live in Dexter House which  has3 had a new owner and management	for about a year.4 This new owner, Jay Wartski, spent one month   in5 jail for hiring drug dealers to harass tenants   in6 another SRO owned by him.7 He' s currently renting illegal8 hotel rooms and hostel beds in Dexter House on   a9 nightly basis, a direct violation of SRO  law.10 The renting of up to  twelve11 hostel beds in a single room has created  an12 overcrowded and noisy environment and put  a13 severe strain on community bathrooms.14 However, seventy- five percent of15 the rooms in the building are still occupied  by16 permanent  residents. So any SRO rent increase17 would apply to me and all the other  permanent18 residents.19 Despite making large sums  of20 money from illegal tourist rentals, Dexter   House21 management  has decreased its services for22 permanent residents by eliminat ing in-house phone23 service and reducing maid service for  common24 areas of the building.25 They've also harassed  tenants2 
2 including my next door neighbor for  complaining3 about illegal condit ions in the building.4 They've also brought  frivolous5 and false evict ion suits against many tenants.6 They are also warehousing  rooms7 and refusing to rent any rooms to perspect ive8 long- term residents. They are attempting to  turn9 our home into a tourist  hotel.10 Any SRO rent increase granted  by11 this Board would be a travesty of justice.  Please12 do not reward criminal ity.13 (Audience participat ion. )14 MR. ZELNIK:	One question.15 How large is the room that  you16 occupy?17 MR. CHRIS CARROLL:	Excuse me?18 MR.

Her application  for17 this exemption is based on a claim that at  least18 eighty percent of the building was rehabed  thus19 entitling her to the exempt ion.20 However, in examining  the21 building DHCR file it was evident that some  of22 the work was done under the wrong permit and  it23 may be quest ionable as to whether she could still24 file for this exempt ion X amount of years after25 the fact .7 
2	Given the landlord' s recent3 actions, her profit motive is more than  clear.4 She has illegally raised the rent on one of  the5 exist ing tenants at least fifteen percent.6 She has conveyed to me in  no7 uncertain terms a desire to rid herself  of8 certain tenants in order to convert two  studios9 into a one floor through so that she can  more10 than triple the rent that she is  currently11 receiving.12 While it is understandable  that13 one should protect one' s investment , she is14 insensit ively if not avariciously willing to15 carry out this plan at the expense of the  tenants16 who are disabled and  indigent.17 While the housing law that  she18 is seeking to have an exempt ion is based on19 creating new housing, it is also one that  could20 easily displace those most vulnerable to  the21 greed of landlords trying to maximize  their22 investments.23 Those most vulnerable  to these24 machinations,	having little economic power  and25 the wherewit hal to advocate on their own behalf ,3 
1	3292	must be heard.3	As this is the appropriate  forum4 for those that are disenfranchised to voice  their5 concerns, the powerbrokers of this City need  to6 be made aware of the paradoxical harm that  is7 being done in the service of supposedly  creating8 more housing.9 Thank you.10 (Audience participation. )11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	David12 Robinson.13 Arthur LaMirande next  following14 Mr. Robinson, followed by Parvati Devi .15 Okay.16 MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	Good17 afternoon.18 My name is David Robinson.  I19 work with Legal Services for New York  City.20 A VOICE:	Speak into the21 microphone.22 THE REPORTER :	You have  to get23 closer.24 MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	I 'm sorry.25 My name is David Robinson. I 'm a4 
1	3302 staff attorney with Legal Services for New  York3 City. I 've submitted some extensive written4 test imony which is submit ted on behalf of both5 Legal Services for New York City and the  Legal6 Aid Society.7 Legal Services and Legal Aid8 attorneys see on a daily basis the  devastating9 impact of the rent increases that have  been10 imposed over the years on rent  stabilized11 tenants. We see that because for our clients  the12 ability to stay in a rent stabilized apartment   is13 the only thing that separates our clients  from14 homelessness  and occupancy in homeless shelters15 and the precariousness of housing that can  result16 in a devastating impact on those  families.17 Particularly in light of all  of18 the other cutbacks that are occurring in  City,19 State and Federal housing programs, the impact  of20 rent stabilized rent increases, which you  have21 the power to control , is really, really, really22 important.23 And  I think - - I always like to24 remind you, as I've commented in the past  couple25 of years, of the incredibl e ways in which the2 
1	331  2 recent changes in the law and in the  rent3 stabilization code have made it so much  easier4 for landlords to make much more money  and5 increase the rents.6 So that the impact of these  rent7 guideline increases, it is that much  less8 important for those landlords. They have  the9 twenty percent vacancy allowances. It used to   be10 that we would come up and advocat e before the11 Rent Guidelines Board to limit the  vacancy12 allowance, which often it would be five  percent13 when it was ten percent . That was considered a14 huge amount. It's now twenty percent or slightly15 less for one -year leases.16 There is the possibility  of17 deregulation for apartments that reach the level  18	of $2000.19 There are the l/40th  rent20 increases for individual apartment improvements21 which have been a scam the landlords have used   to22 get  buildings	- - get easy rent increases  because23 it 's so diff icult to check on the accuracy of the24 repairs that have been made.25 This is combined with the  fact19 
2 that the DHCR does such a poor job in  enforcing3 the rent regulations system, that landlords  that4 overcharge tenants know that they are pretty  much5 guaranteed to get away with those  overcharges.6 With all of this that has  gone7 on and the addit ion of the ability to get out8 from under pref erent ial rents that used to be9 guaranteed to a tenant for the life of  the10 tenancy as opposed to just for the lifetime of  a11 lease, it is really important that the  rent12 increases, which have been much too high in  the13past , be frozenat their current levels  this14year .15CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16MR.

2 MR. ARTHUR LaMIRANDE:	Good3 afternoon.4	My name is LaMirande. I rise  to5 express my opposit ion to any increase in rents  in6 rent stabilized apartments with the possibl e7 exception of certain small landlords who  can8 prove hardship.9 I ' ll give you just one example10 of why the major landlords are not entitled  to11 any increase in rents.12 The building in which I  have13 resided for the past twenty years, up  in14 Washington Heights, has a list of eighty- seven15 violations on record. I 've just sent a copy  of16 that up to you.17 Most of these violations  have18 been outstanding  for many years, but have never19 been corrected.20 Instead of spending a few21 thousand dollars to correct these violations,  the22 landlord is now spending hundreds of thousands  of23 dollars to break up vacant apartments  into24 smaller units, thus removing the new units  from25 the rent stabilization rolls and allowing him  to5 
2 charge market rents for the smaller  units.3 Furthermore ,  water temperature4 in the showers throughout the building  is5 unstabl e and has been so for all of the twenty6 years that I have lived there. This creates  not7 only an inconvenience but a physical hazard.  The8 landlord simply refuses to correct the  problem.9 And I finally filed a formal10 complaint with the DHCR last year. They  ordered11 the landlord to correct the problem within  thirty12 days. The landlord ignored the order of the  DHCR13 and I then filed a new complaint with the  DHCR.14 This time they ordered my rent reduced to  the15 previous level.16 The reaction of the landlord?  He17 is thumbing his nose at the DHCR and thumbing  his18 nose at me and continuing to demand the  higher19 rent , which the DHCR had ordered reduced.20 Meanwhile ,  the  fundamental  problem remains21 uncorrected.22 In addition, there are major23problems withthe antiquated electrical wiring.24My electricalsupply has frequently failed  in25recent years.The landlord categorically  refuses
  2 to update the ant iquated wiring.3 In addition, both the boiler  and4 the elevator repeatedly break down . The landlord5 refuses  to update  the antiquated  equipment .6 Clearly, a landlord with such  a7 contemptuous attitude towards his tenants is  not8 ent itled to any increase in rents. I am sure9 there are hundreds, if not thousands,  of10 comparable incidents throughout the City. I  ask11 that any increase in rents be denied with  the12 possible except ion previously noted.13 Thank you.14 (Audience participation. )15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,16 sir .17 MR. ZELNIK :	I'm looking - - sir?18 I'm looking over the list of violations that  I19 think are from your building that you  circulated.20 And it appears that some of these violat ions, 21	number one, go back to 1987 or  1988.22 MR. ARTHUR LaMIRANDE:	That 's23 correct .24 MR . ZELNIK:	And those25 violat ions at this point , in seventeen years,22 
2 have not been cured at  all?3 MR. ARTHUR LaMIRANDE:	As far4 as I know, no more than three or four have  been5 corrected. The rest6	MR. ZELNIK:	The other comment I7 would make, I'm looking at several of  these8 violations, and these are violations,  from what  I9 can see, they are not minor. These  really10 threaten the life, health and safety of  people11 living in the building.12 And what has the position  been13 of the DOB or any of the other agencies that   you14 contacted other than rolling back the rent to  a15 prior level? What have they been telling you   at16 this point? These are  serious.17 MR. ARTHUR LaMIRANDE:	As far18 as I know, the Department of Buildings has   taken19 no action. And as I just reported to you,  the20 DHCR ordered my rent reduced. The landlord   is21 ignoring the order.22 My own lease is up for  renewal23 at the end of October. I am fearful that he  may24 try to force me out of my apartment because  I25 won' t agree to pay the higher rent , which would7 
2	be illegal , but I don't know what he is going to3	try to do.4	MR. ZELNIK:	Are you self -5	represented in terms of doing this or do you  have6	any legal assistance?7	MR . ARTHUR LaMIRANDE:	No. I do8 not have any legal assistance. I did go to  the9 State Senator' s office, Schneiderman. And they10 contacted the landlord. They have received  no11	reply from him.12 MR. ZELNIK:	And who is your13 City Councilperson?  Have you gone to them?14 MR. ARTHUR LaMIRANDE:	I'm15 not - - it ' s either Robert Jackson or Miguel16 Martinez.	I'm not sure which.17 MR. ZELNIK:	Have you gone to18 them at all?19 MR. ARTHUR LaMIRANDE:	I wrote20 to Robert Jackson and I've received no  reply.21 MR.  ZELNIK:	Well , there are2 2	some really serious violations here that I  think23 really need attention.24 So - -25 MR. ARTHUR LaMIRANDE:	That 's23 
2	correct. Thank you.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 (Audience participation.)5 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Parvati  Devi .6 Janet Ziff is after Ms.  Devi,7 then Mina Hirschberg.8 MS. PARVATI DEVI:	I thank you9 for your understanding at this time. It 's very10 hard for me to keep my  composure.11 In honor of Frieda Zanes,  who12 passed away last night , I give my testimony.  She13 was everything to me, everything that helped   me14 even be here and speak.15 This is a personal	issue. The16 Senior Citizen Rent  Increase Exemption needs  to17 be extended to people with  disabilities.18 I live on $666 a month. I  was19 lucky for a couple of years. My rent was   frozen.20 I lived , of course , in shambles. That 's why  the21 rent was frozen.22 Now I have a brand new  landlord23 three months. I now got a new increase for   $3024 coming next month.25 The MCis are going to follow.  I6 
2 don' t know what I'm going to do. If this body3 doesn' t do something to press the Mayor, whatever4 is necessary, I'm going to be homeless very,  very5 soon.6	I haven' t anyone to help me. I7 am mot ivated to come here and encouraged by this8 woman. It 's very hard for me to read more of9 this. I'm really hoping that you are going  to10 make some kind of resolut ion I heard made up.  I11 really hope that you are going to do  that.12 Thank you.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 If you could leave the rest of15 your test imony.16 Thank you.17 (The following written18 testimony was submitted by Parvat i Devi:19 "Good afternoon:20 "My name is Parvati Devi. I am a21 member of Disabled in Action. I receive  SSI22 benefits. Year after year I come before  this23 board with the same problem. The t ime is soon24 when I can no longer afford to pay increases.   I25 managed whil e my rent was frozen due to lack of7 
2 services with a previous landlord. Now times  are3 really hard .4 "Although this board cannot  vote5 on rent increase exemptions, you may  influence6 the Mayor to do the right thing - extend  the7 Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exempt ion SCRIE to8 younger people with  disabilities.9 " I am very close to10 homelessness. My rent goes up thirty dollars   next11 month . On top of this, my new landlord is fixing12 the building. Soon the MCI charges will  bring13 another 6% increase. Imagine living on  66614 dollars per month when your rent is 496  dollars.15 That is 75% of my income. Could you live on   17016 dollars for all other  expenses?17 "By extending SCRIE to younger18 people with disabilit ies, landlords are19 guaranteed  their increases.20 " I am tired of hearing bits  and21 pieces that the disabled community should  be22 t reated differently from seniors, have a lower23 income cap or try to exclude  certain24 disabilities. Most people with disabilit ies live25 everywhere. Not only are nursing homes  and2 
1	3412 supportive housing expensive, most people  with3 physical or mental disabilities don' t require4 these services.5 " The Olmstead  decision says we6 are to live in the community whenever  possible.7 But we are being ghettoize? everyday into  their8 institutions only because we cannot afford  the9 rent with our fixed incomes. We, the  disabled10 community from many groups	(see attached paper11 with further informat ion) call upon this board  to12 do the right thing and press the Mayor to let  the13 State pass legislation extending SCRIE to  younger14 people with  disabilities. " )15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Janet Ziff ,16 followed by Mina Hirschberg , followed by Ilsa17 Whitney.18 Go ahead.19 MS. JANET ZIFF:	Good afternoon.20 My name is Janet Ziff. I 'm  a21 rent stabilized tenant living in a former  interim22 multiple dwelling loft. Today I will be  speaking23 on behalf of tenants who pay for their own  heat24 and hot water.25 I understand that when2 
2 considering expenses owners must pay, the  price3 of fuel oil is a major one. There are  many4 tenants like myself who are already paying  this5 expense. In my case it is even higher than  what6 most landlords pay since my water is heated  by7 electricity.8 To include my group of  tenants9 in the normal rent increases would be to  unfairly10 charge us for an expense we already  pay.11 Last year you gave us only  one-12 half of one percentage point differential.   This13 year it should be more.14 At the same time the  increases15 do not take into consideration that  most16 homeowners and landlords pay a mortgage,  the17 interest of which is deducted from income  taxes.18 Tenants, however, pay that as part of their  rent19 in after- tax dollars and do not get any tax20 relief for that expense.21 It seems that these days  almost22 everyone wants to live in New York  City,23 especially Manhattan.  Even my brother' s mother-24 in- law on her deathbed recently told me that if25 she could live anywhere, it would be  in2 
2	Manhattan.3	As the arts, financial ,4 publishing and fashion capital of the world , it5 seems that there is no limit to the number  of6 people willing to live here at whatever cost ,  to7 the chagrin of those of us who saw it through  the8 white  flight of the	' 60s, the bankruptcy  of the9	'70s, the crime of the	'80s, through the10 prosperity of the	' 90s, the attack on the World11 Trade Towers and the incredible coming  together12 of all New Yorkers.13 Wit h sound rent regulation14 policy we New Yorkers can cont inue to stay15 together by allowing New York to remain  the16 diverse community that it  is.17 The real estate industry18 recognizes that New York is the playground of  the19 rick and famous, the city of opportunity.  Living20 here is the mark of success. The industry  would21 like to cash in and have all of New York  City,22 especially Manhattan, at market rate, a  rate23 which is prohibitive  to the middle class.24 I ask that reason will prevail25 in the increases you determine and allow  the10 
2 economic diversity that makes New York City  what3 it is. If the proposed increases go through,  New4 York will lose its integral middl e class and the5 balance it brings to the  City.6 (Audience participat ion.)7	MS. LUSSKIN:	How much do you8	pay in ut ilities a month?9	MS. JANET ZIFF:	It averages10 about $175.11 MS. LUSSKIN:	And how much is12 your rent?13 MS. JANET ZIFF:	$1300.14 MS. LUSSKIN:	$1300. So that15 it 's more  than ten percent	- -16 MS. JANET ZIFF:	Yes.17 MS. LUSSKIN:	of your rent.18 Thank you.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mina20 Hirschberg , are you - - hold on a  second.21 MS. ILSA WHITNEY:	Ilsa Whitney.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Whitney,23 Mina  Hirschberg  is next .24 Is Mina here?25 (No response. )10 
2CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Isshe here?3(No response. )4CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Goahead.5	MS. ILSA WHITNEY:	Good6	afternoon.7	My name is Ilsa Whitney. I'm8 here to oppose the increase of rent increase   due9 to where  I live , at the Dexter House , located  at10 345 West 86th Street.11 The reason why I oppose the rent12 increase is because there has been a reduction   in13 the services, of the building services, and   also14 as far as the cleaning services, they have  been15 completely cut for the residents, the tenants  of16 the building.17 And also - - well,  I use a18 communal bathroom and there are  constant19 leakages.20 And the Dexter House  is21 currently conducting an illegal operation,  hotel22 and hostel operation. And they are  advert ising23 themselves illegally on the Internet even though24 the building is filed, listed as an  SRO.25 And what happens is that  the8 
2 hot el rooms are serviced immediately but the3 communal bathrooms, there' s constant leakage and4 deteriorat ion of the walls, and a lot of fungus5 on the walls and a lot of  problems.6	And also in my room, I have  a7 very tiny room. I believe  it 's 4 x 10, where  if  I8 extend my arms I can touch with my elbows,  my9 right elbow and my left elbow, I can touch  the10 dresser and the twin size bed. And my twin  size11 bed is even smaller than a regular standard   twin12 size bed.13 And then just to cover  the14 walking space of the room, I can take  three15 elongated steps and that will cover the  walking16 space of the room. That 's all there is. That 's17 all the space I have.18 And I pay $343 .64 a month, which19 is a very, very t iny room.20 And my sink is a very  antiquated21 sink which has cold water on one side, hot  water22 on the other side. I have an arthritic  condition23 where my fingers have become deformed  throughout24 the years. And it affects my  condition.25 It ' s a shock to my body to be7 
2 constantly, you know, exposed to this hot  and3 cold water. It 's just not good.4	And throughout the years I  have5 had a lot of leakage in my building, in my  room.6 It 's just been very uncomfortable	living there.7 I just want to refer to my  notes8 so that I can remember.9 Also due to the fact that  the10 Dexter House is conducting an illegal  operation,11 that has created a problem as far as  the12 elevators. The elevators are always jam  packed13 with people. Just yesterday there was  a14 limousine, a real long limousine that came  in.15 And all of these tourists came out and they  were16 carrying like four and five luggages. And  they17 got in the elevator.18 And it 's terrible. Not all of19 them could fit in the elevator. And when I go  and20 visit my friend on the twelfth floor, I have  to21 wait somet imes like fifteen minutes. I have  to22 wait until the fourth t ime the elevator comes23because theother three times it 's usually jam24packed withtourists and hostel  students.25And they are all carrying  all
2 these luggages. It ' s like pandemonium.	It 's just3 not fair to us. You know, we've lived for years  -4 - I have lived there for over ten years . And it5 was never like this. Now it 's gotten worse and6 worse and worse.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 (Audience part icipat ion.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any10 questions?11 (No response.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 (Audience part icipation. )14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is Mina15 Hirschberg here?16 (No response. )17 MS.

1	3492	FATHER ROBERT ARCE:	Good3	afternoon,  ladies and gentlemen.4	You may remember me because  I5 test ified before you on Monday, May 2nd . I would6 just refresh your memory.7 I am Pastor of St. Margaret  Mary8 Catholic Church located in the Bronx at  the9 corner of East Tremont Avenue and Morris  Avenue10 between Jerome Avenue and the Grand  Concourse.11 We have about a thousand  people12 attending Mass on Sunday .13 I've served in the South  Bronx14 from June of 1967 until the present time with  a15 three- year service in the East Bronx.16 I invited the Board to come  and17 walk through the Bronx, to walk through  our18 streets so that they could learn what we face   in19 our neighborhood.20 And as you' ll remember, I asked21 our parishioners	to let me know of conditions  in22 their building that need attention . As a result23 of this request , I was given a number of24 addresses that need  attention.25 There are few - - these are a  few5 
1	3502 among many with probl ems.3 We were accompanied on our  walk4 by Mr. Martin Zelnik from the Rent  Guidelines5 Board . Between myself and Ms. Hilda Chavis, who6 uses a wheelchair and was unabl e to join in the7 walkabout because the elevator in her  building8 was not functioning that day, a few  community9 members and organizers from the Northwest  Bronx10 Community and Clergy Coalit ion, especially my11 Hope organization, we mapped out a walking  tour12 of the area .13 We walked up and down the  hills14 of our neighborhood.	I thought that the walk was15 important because we needed to show what  the16 geography is that our residents meet upon  gett ing17 off the trains and buses that bring them  home18 from work .19 What every working person20 expects when they get home is that the  pressures21 of the workday are over. It is time to rest  and22 have dinner.23 In the case of working mothers24 and housewives it means get ting into the kitchen25 and preparing  dinner  for the  family .2 
1	3512 Imagine walking  home  to find :3 One , that  the elevator which has4 been out of service for over a month is still  out5 of service;6 Two, the hot water is still not7 availabl e;8 Three, you dare not open  the9 window	(a) for fear it will fall out and hurt10 someone on the street , or if it falls out ,   having11 to figure out what you will use to keep  the12 elements out ;13 Four, the ceiling still leaks;14 Five , your  teenage  daughter is15 still afraid to go into the tub to bathe  because16 she can hear the rats crawling through the  walls.17 These  are two pictures	- - there18 are two pictures which have just been given  to19 you on page eight of the June 20th issue of  the20 Hispanic newspaper Hoy, of the ratholes in  the21 backyard and the deteriorated condit ions of the22 casement windows in that same building on  East23 176th Street .24 The woodframe windows are25 rotting  in place.  I don 1    t know of anyone who2 
2wouldtry to open the window for fear that  they3couldnot be closed again, but that it would  fall4apartfrom the effort either opening or  closing5it.6Imagine not being able to open  a7	window during the heat wave of the last few  days.8	I was not present later in  the9 day when the reporter and photographer  visited10 the site, but I was told that a giant rat ran  out11 in front of them while they were in the  backyard.12 There is a problem then of13 overcrowding because of the lack of  affordable14 apartments in which to move. We have  three15 generations in one apartment : mother, daught er16 and granddaughters. Two of the children  are17 infants.18 Thank you very much.19 (Audience participation .)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Alfred Scott.21 MR . ALFRED SCOTT:	Good22 afternoon.23 There are a few  characteristics24 of other species which humans could adopt   for25 their advantage.9 
2 And I came across a little  piece3 of writ ing recently which I thought I might  read4 to you for the benef it of all of us here. And it5 has to do with the geese that fly all over  the6 sky .7	Fact one, as each goose flaps8 its wings, it created an uplift for the  birds9 that follow. By flying in a V formation,  the10 whole flock has seventy- one percent greater11 flying range than if each bird flew alone .12 Lesson, people who share  a13 common direction and sense of community can  get14 where they are going quicker and easier  because15 they are travelling on the thrust of one  another.16 Fact two: when a goose falls  out17 of formation, it suddenly feels the drag  and18 resistance of flying alone. It quickly moves   back19 into formation to take advantage of the  lifting20 power of the bird immediately in front of   it.21 Lesson : if we have as much sense22 as a goose, we stay in formation with  those23 headed where we want to go. We are willing  to24 accept their help and give our help to  others.25 Fact three: when the lead  goose8 
2 t ires, it rotates back into the formation and3 another goose flies to the point posit ion.4	Lesson: it pays to take  turns5	doing the hard tasks and sharing  leadership.6	As  with geese , people are7 interdependent on each other' s skills,8 capabilities and unique arrangements of  gifts,9 talents and resources.10 Fact four: the geese flying  in11 format ion honk to encourage those upfront to keep12 up their speed.13 We need to make sure our  honking14 is encouraging.  In groups where there' s15 encouragement  the production  is much greater.16 The power of encouragement  to17 stand by one's heart or core values and  encourage18 the heart and core of others is the quality  of19 honking that we seek.20 And , finally, fact five: when a21 goose gets sick or wounded or shot down,  two22 geese drop out of formation and follow it down   to23 help and protect it. They stay unt il it dies  or24 is able to fly again. Then they launch  with25 another formation or catch up with the  flock.7 
1	3552	And  the lesson from that one ,3 the final one , if we have as much sense as geese,4 we will stand by each other in diff icult times  as5 well as when we are  strong.6 Thank you.7 (Audience participation. )8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Reverend John9	Duffeil.10 FATHER JOHN DUFFEIL:	Yes. My11 name is Father John Duffiel. I'm the Pastor  of12 the Church of the Ascension.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One second. I14 just want to call out the names.15 Vicki Labosky will be after  the16 Reverend ,  and Angela Haynes after that .17 FATHER JOHN DUFFEIL:	Thanks18 for that extra t ime .19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' ll get2 0	it .21 FATHER JOHN DUFFEIL:	My name22 is Father John Duffeil. I'm the Pastor of  the23 Church of Ascension, the Catholic Church of  the24 Ascension on West 107th Street in  Manhattan,25 between Broadway and Amsterdam. That 's where the21 
2	church is.3	The parish runs from  Central4 Park to the Hudson River,  from ll O th Street  to5 lO lst Street.6 There 's about 1800 people that7 worship there, many of them people of  limited8 means.9 And I really come to urge you  to10 have a rent freeze because your actions in  the11 past have produced prices in our neighborhood   and12 a lessening of that number of people , that would13 be people of limited means that can be part  of14 our congregation because they have to  go15 elsewhere. They just can't continue to live  in16 the area where the rent increases are so  sharp.17 Many of them can't get  two-year18 leases anymore because you've done some  strange19 things. I'm not a mat hematician or anything, but20 you've stretched something a little bit  larger21 than it should be.22 Yes, I'm here to say that  you23 thought a lot about the landlords. Now I  think24 it 's t ime to really think a bit more about the25 tenants.4 
2 I would urge very much for  a3 rent freeze at this particular t ime. I think4 that 's essential if we are really going to5 maintain this City as a City of a great  mix,6 unless you insist on, in my opinion, forcing  all7 of the people out of Manhattan into the  outer8 boroughs. Not that there' s anything wrong with9 the outer boroughs, but some people would like   to10 live where they've lived for many, many  years.11 You are really uproot ing people12 and it ' s unjust  in my opinion.13 It 's become a struggle for many14 in my neighborhood between whether there' s a roof15 over your head or food in your  belly.16 If you ask some of the food17 pantries  in the neighborhood, the numbers  are18 growing larger and larger. And in part it 's19 caused by some of the decisions that are made  by20 this part icular board.21 So I would just urge you to  kind22 of look again. And, as I say, you've given in  my23 opinion an awful lot of attent ion to the needs of24 the landlord. It 's now t ime to look at the25 quest ion of affordability and the needs of  the2 
1	3582 tenants.3 Neighborhoods  have to be mixed4 neighborhoods. That 's one of the great values of5 the area that I'm in, which is the Upper  West6 Side Manhattan Valley.  It ' s a very mixed , mixed7 area and hopefully will be able to stay that  way.8 And poorer people and people  who9 have more means will be able to live together  in10 peace and harmony.11	Again, it ' s very much in your12 hands. Salaries don' t increase when you lift the13 rents up a little bit more  - that 's  the14 unfortunate thing  - even though  - - some of  those15 landlords don' t pay people who work for them a16 little bit more because you've lifted the  rents17 that they' re collecting.18 There has got to be some way  of19 balancing it all out. And I just hope that  you' ll20 find a way. It 's, to my way of thinking, a21 quest ion of human rights because we have a  right22 to housing.23 And  it ' s also a question of24 human dignity. And that 's what the faith25 community stands for. It 's to protect human12 
1	3592	rights and promote human dignity .3	So, again, we would very much4 urge you to be a little bit more concerned  about5 the tenants and that whol e quest ion of their6 ability to kind of respond to what you dictate ,7 and perhaps a little bit more democracy  should8 come into this question.9 Thank you.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 (Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Vicki13 Labosky, Angela Haynes is next , and after that is14 Jesse Graham.15 MS . VICKI LABOSKY:	H ,  I16My name is Vicki Labosky. I  have17lived atthe Dexter House since 1991,  fourteen18years .19The Dexter House is a 261-unit20SRO. Thebuilding is owned by Herbert Wolff  of21 Hawaii and Sam Goldosky	(phonetic) of New Jersey .22 As of May, 200 Jay Wartski is a leaseholder  and23 the president of the Dexter House 345 , Inc. So24 Jay Wartski is the one in charge of the day- to-25 day rent ing of the Dexter House .21 
1	3602 The Dexter House is a Type A  2483 SRO which does not allow for any hot el rooms.4	Before May, 2004, there were  325 illegal hotel rooms in the Dexter House.  Mr.6 Wartski came in in May 2004. Now there are ,  one7 year later, almost sixty rooms under the   control8 of the management.  That ' s about  thirty- five hotel9 rooms rent ing for $75 to $100 a night. There are10 five youth hostels, multiple - bed youth hostels,11 renting for $30 a bed in a room with four  bunk12 beds . That equals $120 a night. This is a blatant13 violat ion of the City/State Multiple Dwelling  Law14 which states that no more than two people  may15 occupy a single  room .16 And everything is advertised  on17 the Internet. There are about fifteen empty   rooms18 which management  refuses to rent to regular19 tenants and about five rooms occupied by  Mr.20 Wartski 's friends who act as informants against21 the regular tenant.22 This seventy- five percent23 proviso does not help us at all because  the24 management  does not yet have control of more  than25 twenty- five percent of our apartments . So we are5 
2 not yet near the less than seventy- five percent3 tenant mark.4	So any rent increase would5 really hurt us whil e encouraging them to go right6 ahead whil e they are making money hand over fist7 at $100 plus per night of renting illegal  hotel8 rooms and also bringing  frivolous eviction cases9 against us Dexter House tenants,  seriously10 disrupting our lives until we cannot stand  it11 anymore and we just give up and leave. And that 's12 what they want .13 They have found - - I found  out14 that almost all of the youth hostels in New  York15 City today are really SRO buildings being  rented16 as youth hostels illegally.17 And so with this going on,  this18 is going on in all of the SROs in New York  City19 today. So they don' t need a rent increase. Zero.20 We need help.21 I myself was here last year . I22 test ified. And by coincidence that morning of23 that day at 10:30 in the morning	I was showing an24 HPD inspector around the Dexter House, as I  had25 been asked to do by our advisors. And then  at5 
2 3 :00 p.m. that afternoon, right outside my room,3 I was harassed verbally by the leaseholder of  our4 building, Mr. Wartski , and by Mike, the5 maint enance man.6 Mr. Wartski yelled loudly  into7 my face: "Who - the " f " word - do you think   you8 are? We are here to inspect your room now. "9 And he proceeded to try to  force10 his way into my room. I stood out in the  hall ,11 very  shocked ,  frightened , and refused  to let them12 into my room.13 Then they wouldn' t leave. So14 finally  I started yelling  loudly " they're15 harassing me, they' re harassing me. " And when16 other tenants came to see what was going on,  they17 finally left.18 Then that day, the same day,  I19 rushed down here and still very shocked and   shook20 up , I told what happened in my testimony along21 with what ever else is going on in our building.22 About a month later I received  a23 letter from the Dexter  House management	saying24 that they were terminating my status as a tenant ,25 and that if I did not move out , they would evict2 
2 me .3 And from then on I 've been4 defending myself in court with the help of  the5 SRO Law Project . Thank you . In fact , my next6 court date is June 21st , this Tuesday. So my7 harassment by the Dexter House management  has8 been going for a year and I don't see an end  in9 sight. So I'm still fight ing eviction. Okay?10 So, basically,	I think that 's11 all I have to say and I hope that you will  help12 us and that these rents for the SRO  buildings13 should be frozen until the illegal youth  hostel14 rooms and the illegal hotel rooms are stopped  and15 done away with.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 MS. VICKI LABOSKY :	Thank you18 very much .19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 (Audience participat ion. )21 MS. ANGELA HAYNES :	H , I22 My name is Angela Haynes and  I23 live in an SRO in Harlem where now landlords  and24 real estate developers have set their sight to  be25 the new luxury neighborhood.2 
2 Real estate developers have3 decided that our neighborhood is going to be  the4 new luxury neighborhood.5	We now have buildings,  of6 course, selling in the mill ions. And , of course,7 the SRO landlords see that as something to do,  to8 convert their buildings, not even just keep  it9 SRO. No, they're looking actually to  warehouse10 SRO and remove themselves from regulat ion.11 My landlord has actually  bought12 our building three years ago. I've been  harassed13 in court , various things trying to evict me and14 an eighty- three year old woman with cancer,15 diabetes, living on Social Security. He  actually16 took away her shower or use of a shower,  decided17 not to repair her electric facilities. If it 's18 ninety degrees, she cannot have an  air19 condit ioner because with the old electric system,20 there is no way she can run - - if it 's  nine21 degrees, she has to figure out a way to  have22 heat.23 We cannot get things  delivered24 because he decided the tenants, he' s not going  to25 fix the intercom services. It ' s a walk- up6 
1	3652 building. She has to make arrangements to  get3 valuable,  life- saving diabetes medicine delivered4 to another area to keep herself alive. And  she5 lives on the third floor .6 This is what we have to  deal7 wi th . He actually came into my apartment ,8 verbally harassed me, threatened to evict me   from9 my apartment and actually  - - this is - - asked  for10 a fifty percent rent  increase.11	If it were not for the SRO Law12 Project , I would be sleeping on the street today.13 And this is not the end of the  story.14 As of today, I have  complaints15 in Housing Court that are years, not days,  not16 mont hs, that he refused. The City Housing17 Department actually showed up and because  the18 landlord refused them entry, they said we  cannot19 do anything.20 So now we have two/three  years21 running complaint s that have gone unheeded.22 And up to a few mont hs ago he23 decided to give us an illegal utility  surcharge .24 Now I'm paying an extra $70 a month that 's25 illegal , but has our lights shut off if we12 
1	3662	decided not to pay it.3	So I paid it. I had to send - -   I4 sent over $1000. He decided actually it was  going5 to be a retroactive  surcharge.6 So this is the continuous7 situation. They are not just getting  rent8 increases. They are inputt ing surcharges. They're9 trying to move people with cancer who are  eighty-10 three living in the neighborhood thirty years  out11 of their apartment.12 My  landlord , Peter Kaplan, right13 now would not give me a new lease because  he14 decided I am a troublemaker and he wants us  out15 and he is going to try to warehouse our  building16 and turn it into unregulated apartments .17 He applied with the City for  a18 Cert ificate of Non- Harassment and he is planning19 to make these changes to our  building.20 I hope you can help us. First ,21 roll back the rent and , of course, tell us how  to22 get the City to bett er respond to some of these23 illegal act ivities by our landlord.24 Thank you .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4

PRISCILLA DURANT:	Good21 evening, Rent Guidelines  Board.22 My name is Priscilla Durant.  I23 live at 537 West 156th Street. I'm chairman of   my24 building.25 We would like you to vote no on10 
2 the rent increase. This will affect all  the3 people in my building and two mill ion more  people4 who are disabled and living on low income  and5 homeless in this City.6 It 's critical that you take a7 stand for the needy. This increase will  force8 people out of their homes. This would  increase9 homeless which we have enough  already.10 Disabled and senior  citizens11 will be put in nursing homes which would  be12 overcrowded where they would not get the  proper13 services, not in this City.14 Please vote no. Each time  you15 vote you always increase the rent. We,  the16 working people, that pay the taxes, we  cannot17 stand anymore. We are struggling with  the18 increase of last time.19 Please make a decision  that20 would help the landlords and the tenants to  meet21 the rent increase if you are going to give one   or22 say no to the rent increase or freeze  it.23 The stadium that Mr.  Bloomberg24 was going to build , why don' t you put that money25 to use and help the tenants and the  landlords2 
2 with this money.3 Thank you.4 (Audience participation .)5	MS. PRISCILLA DURANT :	And we6	do remember when you run for public office.

DAHLIA DUPERRIOR:	Good21 afternoon.22 My name is Dahlia Duperrior.  I'm23 a rancher and I live in Midtown Manhattan,  Hell 's24 Kitchen to be exact. This area of the City  was25 once affordable. What was considered to be   really10 
2 affordable, this is no longer the  case.3 Apart ments that are in tenements that still are4 in existence are grossly  overpriced.5 If a tenant moves out that 's6 paying  $800 a month  i n  rent , the landlord will7 hike the rent as much as $1700 a mont h and more.8 The majority of the tenant9 holding landlords are well known in  the10 Department  of Buildings for numerous violations11 of building codes . Registration should be12 mandatory with DHCR. These are the very   landlords13 that should be excluded from receiving  yearly14 rent increases.15 As a matter  of  fact , rents16 should be frozen or rolled back for three  years,17 period , across the  board.18 This City is going through  a19 housing crisis. Warehousing  apartments also20 should be looked into . This is in my opinion21 another contributing factor to the shortage  of22 housing and the affordability of rates.  People23 are being priced out of their homes. The   shelters24 are overflowing with homeless  families.25 This situation isn't getting2 
2	better, and those that aren' t in shelters are3 living commune style or sleeping in  subways.4 This is unacceptable. We,  the5 renters, are paying for operat ing expenses,6 taxes, plus whatever else is tacked on to  or7 included in rents. Renters should be  given8 consideration.9 I hope the Rent Guidelines  Board10 takes the plight of renters of this  City11 seriously.12 Thank you .13 (Audience participat ion.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Eric15 Spruiell . Is he here?16 (No response.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Harvey18 Epstein.19 Mr. Epstein?20 (No response.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No.22 Joyce Goodman representing23 Assemblymember  Daniel O'Donnell . Are you here?24 MS. JOYCE GOODMAN:	Good25 afternoon.5 
2	My name is Joyce Goodman  for3 Assemblymember  Daniel  O'Donnell. Daniel O'Donnell4 represents the 69th District in the New  York5 State Assembly,  represent ing residents of6 Manhattan Valley, Morningside Heights, the   Upper7 West Side of Manhattan and southern  Harlem.8 Thank you for the opportunity  to9 discuss rent adjustments  for renewal leases  for10 rent stabilized apartments .11 The proposed rent increases,  if12 passed , will have a dramatically negative effect13 on the lives of tenants who live in my  Assembly14 District and for all tenants across the City  of15 New York.16 These increases will  adversely17 affect the very people our system was  originally18 designed to protect. We cannot continue  to19 overlook the housing needs of our  working20 famil ies or our most vulnerable residents: our21 seniors, immigrants, the disabled and  homeless22 populat ions.23 First  and foremost ,  I ask the24 Board to consider vital statistics that  are25 probably not unique to my community office,  but3 
2 which are extremely telling in terms of why  there3 are so many of us here today who refer to  the4 affordable housing situation in New York City  as5 a crisis.6 Over the course of the last7 seven months my community office has  assisted8 approximately twenty- six households who fell into9 rent arrears and sought legal assistance  to10 prevent them from losing their rent  regulated11 apartments.12 This is an average of almost  one13 non- payment case every week. Each one of these14 const ituents required on average four follow- up15 meetings and/or comprehensive legal services  or16 an advocate in Housing Court to prevent  their17 eviction.18 It is important to note that  the19 majority of these cases involve tenants who  pay20 between $650 and $950 per month for rent.  The21 diff iculties my constituents face paying these22 rents goes a long way in dispelling the idea  that23 they should simply relocate to  other24 neighborhoods to find housing  elsewhere.25 Affordabil ity is an issue across2 
2	the City.3	Furthermore, a majority of  these4 tenants have lived in their apartments for  more5 than a decade and they occupy apartments that  are6 at capacity. For exampl e , most of these single7 renters currently  l ive in one - bedroom apartments8 and the majority of those who occupy an  apartment9 larger than a one-bedroom more often than  not10 have boarders or third parties who are paying  a11 percentage of the rental  expenses.12 Additionally,	a majority of13 those who have sought assistance from my  office14 are those who are approaching sixty- five but do15 not qualify for SCRIE, are permanently  disabled16 or low- income working families.17 It is easy for me to draw  the18 conclusion that each of these constituents  who19 live on a fixed income would find themselves  in20 an impossible living situat ion if faced with a21 rent increase over the next one or two  years.22 It is an acknowledged fact  that23 my community off ice could justif iably operate24 solely as a housing assistance unit with no  extra25 t ime or resources to devote to the myriad of4 
2 other issues that affect my community, given  that3 so many of my const ituents have housing- related4 problems.5	Based on these facts alone, I  am6 adamantly opposed to yet another rent  increase7 which will cause a major hardship for  thousands8 of New Yorkers who are already struggling to  make9 ends meet.10 When there is a failure to  index11 the benefits that our most vulnerable rely  upon12 to meet their living expenses, it is  outrageous13 to assume that those who on average  receive14 monthly SSI benef its of less than $600 per mont h,15 or a shelter allowance of $215 per mont h would be16 able to afford a rent increase of any  amount.17 If we cont inue to increase rents18 based  solely - -19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to20 wrap up.21 MS. JOYCE GOODMAN:	Excuse me?22 Yes.23 If we continue to increase  rents24 based solely on the burdens claimed by  landlords25 without considering the increasing burdens  of6 
2tenants,then we will inevitably be forcing  more3and morepeople out of their homes.4I do not need to point out  that5over thepast few years we have lost tens  of6 thousands of units of previously affordabl e7 housing and that increases by the RGB will  result8 in the eventual loss of all rent  stabilized9 housing in the City.10 In New York City a great  number11 of our residents have endured trying  fiscal12 circumstances.  To continuously  impose increases13 on rent stabilized tenants will force them  from14 the communities they helped to  build.15 It is t ime for the RGB to take16 the dramatic step of enacting a rent freeze,  or17 at the very least reduce the increases for  this18 year.19 (Audience part icipation. )20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 Let me read the next names.22 Eliya Feldman representing  New23 York State Senator Tom Duane.

But we are going to  let8 him talk because we didn' t have a rule against9 two talks.10 Hold on a second.11 Richard Barr will be after  Mr.12 Anthony.13 Followed by Marguerite  Yaghjian.14 Go ahead , Mr. Anthony.15 MR. TYRONE ANTHONY:	My name16 is Tyrone Anthony and I live in Hell 's Kitchen,17 300 West 46th Street.18 And I'm here on behalf as  the19 Acting Chairman for 346 West 46th Street  Tenants20 Association .21 We send this communication  to22 express our concerns regarding the  proposed23 increases for renewal leases specif ically as they24 apply to SRO Class A, Class B rent  stabilized25 unit s such as us.6 
2 We say no to the proposed3 increases because our owner is already  charging4 rents that are very high.5	The Chairman, on behalf of  the6 tenants of the building, sent complaint  letters7 to the following, including but not l imited to8 Division  of Housing  and  Community Renewal ,9 Department of Homeless Services, Department  of10 Health, Congressman Jerrold Nadl er office , for11 harassment ,  discrimination,  mail tampering,12 violat ion of building maint enance, rodent and13 vermin infestation, and retaliation  against14 tenants for doing so in good faith .15 Why should owners such as  ours,16 who violate the law and exploit tenants, be   given17 an increase so that they can continue to  abuse,18 harass and retaliate using that very increase   for19 their benef it and yet continue to reduce services20 and fail to make required repairs and get  tax21 increases in the future and still bring  tenants22 to court for frivolous  reasons?23 Therefore, we say no rent24 increase.25 And I would like to say that  we6 
2 have complaints in the Human Rights, which I   have3 complained to Human Rights, and I have won  a4 settlement , a small settlement of Human Rights5 against  this owner, Clinton Housing.6 And we also had to do a  building7 wide to date because the owner has failed  still8 to fix washers and driers that were supposed  to9 be a part of his contract in the  building.10 So we say no rent increase.  And11 you all who will go back to Mayor Bloomberg,   I12 wish you would tell Mayor Bloomberg that  we13 cannot take a rent increase in New York  City.14 Thank you.15 (Audience participat ion.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Richard Barr.17 Mr. Barr, are you here?18 Followed by Marguerite  Yaghjian,19 and then Keanya Gubitose.20 Go ahead.21 MR.

1	3802	Vacancy decontrol  is providing3 massive profits to some landlords and  decimating4 the stock of regulated  - -5 A VOICE :	We can't hear you.6 MR. RICHARD BARR :7 decimating the stock of regulated apartments   in8 this City.9 You can't do anything about  it .10 It 's not your purview. But what you can do is get11 away from this idea of a one- size- fits- all rent12 increase .13 If somebody' s got seven14 apartments in South Jamaica and long - time15 regulated tenants and is losing money,  people16 deserve to make a reasonable return and not   lose.17 Okay, give him his  increase.18 But in many neighborhoods,19 including mine , and I'm on the West Side of20 Manhattan  above  72nd Street , below  96th Street -21 I don't want to pinpoint and put the spotlight  on22 my own landlord23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' re not a24 hotel though? You' re not in a hotel?25 MR . RICHARD BARR :	No . I'm in7 
2	an apartment.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.4 MR. RICHARD BARR:	the5 motivation to get vacancy decontrol is such  that6 he' s willing to give people six figure amounts  to7 leave or if he acquires one as a result  of8 somebody dying or moving 1  put in the amount of9 renovat ions necessary to take it over that  $200010 c ap 1	and once it 's deregulated 1	in my building11 it 's twenty times the regulated rent.12 Now maybe that 's an extreme.13 Mine is perhaps a unique building. But in   other14 neighborhoods around the City, if somebody   gets15 somebody out who is paying $1000 and gets  it16 deregulated by getting it over the $ 2 000 1	is now17 gett ing $3000 or $3500 or $4000. And let 's say18 twenty- five percent of the units in that building19 have become deregulated 1   he' s gett ing that kind20 of an increase, why do the regulated tenants  have21 to give him the three or four percent? He' s22 getting plenty from the market rate  tenants.23 And if he' s got stores in his24 building with commercial rents being what  they25 are,  think of that.  Consider  that .ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES 1  INC .
2 You really have to get away  from3 one- size- fits- all rent increases. Some people are4 making out like bandits off part of  their5 building. Why should the stabilized tenants  have6 to subsidize it further?7 I understand that some  proviso8 has been drafted that would mean a zero  increase9 for regulated tenants in a building where  twenty-10 five percent or more of the apartments  have11 become deregulated.  I urge you to take that12 seriously and try to work that into your  formulas13 this year because it 's the only fair way.14 To compare that guy with the15 seven apartments  in South Jamaica, to somebody16 who' s got a bunch of buildings in Manhattan  that17 are getting  deregulated  that  quickly,  is really -18 - it ' s apples and oranges .19 Thank you .20 (Audience part icipation.)21 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Marguerite ,22 is she here?23 (No response.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Marguerite25 Yaghjan.

2 every time I pronounced	it by now.3 (No response.)4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Keanya5 Gubitose.6 (No response.)7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Keanya8 Gubitose?9 (No response. )10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Not surprised11 they're gone.12 Alex Movahed.13 (No response.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Representing15 State Senator David Patterson.16 (No response. )17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yael Perry.18 Hold on one second. Let me  read19 some other names.20 Matthew Rader.21 (No response. )22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Who is gone.23 He spoke last  - - the other night  anyway. But  I24 saw him earl ier. Is he here?25 (No response. )8 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No.3 Then George  Quinto .4 (No response. )5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I 'll call6 these names again. But now Yoel  Perry.7 After Mr. Quinto is Dan  Matsis.8 You here? Yes?9	MR. DAN MATSIS:	Yes.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.11	Everybody should take the mike12 in their hands. It 's the easiest way to do it ,  if13 you can.14 MR . YOEL PERRY:	Thank you.15 I only have a little spoken16 time.17 I appreciate your presence  and18 assistance and very well.19 My sense of coming up here  is20 because  I only represent  a tenant . And  the way -21 - I live in 12 West 85th Street with my  family,22 two 25-year olds and a 20.23 And my sense of timing now  is24 just to say to you guys that you put in all  -25 what everybody has said by now and you  understand12 
2 what is inside of yourself to know what is  the3 right thing to do.4	And I have no solutions,  but5 except to ask, and I beg of you guys, to  think6 about this, freeze it.7	Second choice , if that  is not8 possible,  remind the people who are investing9 what they are doing. Sure , it 's easy to get a10 bank loan nowadays and make a purchase  of11 something that 's not quite proper.12 I am in the building trades  for13 the past twenty years. I've worked as a  plumber14 most of the time. Sometimes I  do painting.	I do15 whatever  is necessary to be just - - to become   a16 builder.17 My  sense , again,  is choices18 rather than just go one way for any of us here  or19 for yourselves.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You live in21 an apartment , not  a hotel?22 MR. YOEL PERRY:	I live23 okay. My presence	- - I reside at 12 West  85th24 Street .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	West 85th8 
2Street.3MR. YOELPERRY:Eighty- five,4building 12.5CHAIRMANMARKUS:Okay.6MR. YOELPERRY:And the person7 who  owns my building	- - yes, I am also - what  is8 it? -  stabilized controlled apartment.  I   pay,9 thanks to you guys, $600 for everything.  That10 even includes electricity  and gas.11	So I am able to live. I love the12 United States. That 's what I can tell you.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 MR. YOEL PERRY:	And my16 So, again, the choices, is all  I17 beg of you guys.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 (Audience participat ion. )20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Perry,21 how big an apartment do you have? How many  rooms?22 That was a question here.23 How big is your apartment?24 MR. YOEL PERRY:	It has two25 rooms and the bat hroom.12 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Two rooms and3	a bath.4	MR. YOEL PERRY:	That 's it. A5	little studio. That ' s about  it. A little  niche.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 Mr. Rader, who I don' t think is8 here.9 (No response.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Quinto,11 George Quinto.12 (No response.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Dan Matsis.14 You' re Mr. Matsis?15 MR. DAN MATSIS:	Yes.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Great.17 After Mr. Matsis is  Susan18 Slocum.19 MS. SUSAN SLOCUM:	Here.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.21 After that is Maxine  Zeifman.2 2	Are you here?23 MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	Yes.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Great.25 Dan Matsis, go ahead.23 
2 MR . DAN MATSIS :	Yes. Good3 afternoon, Board Members.4 My name is Dan Matsis.5 A VOICE:	We can't hear you.6 MR. DAN MATSIS:	I live in a 9-7 unit brownstone on the Upper West Side. And  I've8 been the target of harassment by virtue of  a9 landlord. And three of the last five leases  that10 he signed have been with musicians. The one  that11 lives across the hall from me is an  electronic12 ampl ified musician .13 A VOICE:	Louder.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We need to15 get the musicians here. They' ll make it louder,16 right?17 (Laughter.)18 MR . DAN MATSIS:	They do.19 I guess I can't get used to20 that.21 And I attempted for four  years22 trying to get some relief from the nuisance  and23 he hasn' t helped.24 And  that ' s his way of attempting25 to get me out of my $743 apartment .7 
2 As to the operating expenses  of3 the building owners, they should be  disregarded4 since they' re self - serving surveys. The Board5 should be taking  - - making  audits of a sample  of6 the various types of buildings that will  be7 regulated and making its ruling based on that .8 And they will probably find  that9 there would be few, if no rent  adjustments.10 The funct ion of this Board is11 not to make deregulat ion adjustments. The12 function is to make cost adjustments. And  they13 need good figures to do  that.14 As to the operating  expenses,15 the CPI was announced yesterday and I think  it16 was 1.5 percent excluding the fuel  rate.17 The fuel cost will probably  be18 normalizing	in the next few years.19 As to property taxes,  Mayor20 Bloomberg  should give up on his grand designs,  go21 for treatment  for his Oedipus Complex  and let ' s22 get those property taxes  down.23 As to labor costs, they  are24 using immigrant labor. My landlord renovated   five25 apartment s and in every case he used immigrant2 
2 labor. None of that was passed on to any of  the3 tenants and he' s probably misrepresent ing it as a4 valid labor cost.5 The mat erials costs are coming6 from products that are supplied by China and  the7 Asian countries and I can't imagine that  those8 costs are escalating for the property  owners.9 As to interest costs  on10 mortgages, the mortgage interest cost is down  to11 5 .5 percent . Any landlord who has not taken12 advantage of that to refinance is incompetent  and13 doesn' t belong in the business.14 And what this Board should do  is15 issue zero rent increases and we' ll shake out16 these incompetent landlords .17 And the tenants could  start18 their own co- ops and condos and they could manage19 the buildings on their own, even bett er than the20 landlords are doing .21 (Audience participation. )22 MR. DAN MATSIS:	And we' ll be23 property owners, a little capitalism for  the24 tenants.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 
2 Thank you.3 (Audience participat ion.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Susan Slocum.5 Susan, I know you were here.6	Great.7	Maxine Zeifman, she's here too ;8	right? Yes?9	And then Evans Thompson. Is she10 here or he here?11 Go ahead , Ms. Slocum.12 MS. SUSAN SLOCUM:	H ,  I13 My name is Susan Slocum.  I've14 been in housing for a long t ime. I live in a  rent15 stabilized apartment. My building  is all studios.16 I never see my landlord , Stanley Wasserman17 (phonetic) here saying he' s not making money18 because he' s making a ton.19 Landlords are not required  to20 open up their books. If tenants want to  freeze21 their rent with SCRIE, they got to submit  all22 kinds of documentation. You got to make it   fair.23 People' s wages are not going up.24 Tenants become homeless and the landlords  just25 want more  and more  and more.  Somehow it ' s got to10 
2	stop.3	Thank you.4	(Audience participat ion. )5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is Evans6 Thompson here?7 (No response.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No.9 Maria Bottino, are you here?10	MS. MARIA BOTTINO:	Yes.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Okay.12 You' ll be after Ms. Zeifman.13 Followed by Lawrence Lee.  Are14 you here?15 MR. LAWRENCE LEE:	Here.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay .17 MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	Hi!18 My name is Maxine Zeifman.  I19 want to speak for and I want to state for   the20 rent stabilized tenants, I want the same   zero21 increase that the SRO tenants got last  year.22 And for exactly the same  reason,23 that the landlords are making tremendous  prof its.24 I want to say some negat ive25 things I suppose about the composition of  the12 
2 Board. You know3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We can take4 it . Go ahead.5	MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	Well , I 6 feel very much like some of the  State7 representat ives and City Councilmen about the8 composition of the Board.9 We  - - the tenants who test ified10 Tuesday  - - I was at Tuesday  - - there was a11 feeling amongst them that this is just a  sad12 charade, that you listen to the tenants, you  hear13 their issues and you vote for the landlords   in14 every kind of issue. And that  is heartbreaking	- 1516 (Audience part icipat ion. )17 MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	- - and18 despairing  for us.19 (Audience participation.)20 MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	And it 's21 despairing for us because  I represent the middle22 class and the lower middle class. These  are23 gifted people and hard- working who are drawn  to24 this City from everywhere.25 And they really are the  reason16 
2that this Cityis great  and renowned , not the3landlords.4(Audience part icipat ion. )5MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN :	We are the6ones that makeit great.7(Audience part icipat ion. )8MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	And  9 Governor Rockefeller took the rent  regulations10 from New York City. He took it from New York  City11 to help his own, to help  the billionaires.	This12 City - - that 's why we need the home rule and   the13 Erstadt Law. We can' t get that law passed in14 Albany .15 (Audience participation. )16 MS . MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	They don' t17 want to give us home rule because we would  have18 something fair for the tenants.19 In this City real estate is  like20 Texas is oil. It is a special interest . It is a - 2122	(Audience part icipat ion .)2 3	MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN :	And24 tenants are not fighting on a level playing   field25 with a special interest . They are fight ing for24 
2 their human needs, housing. That 's not a special3 interest . That ' s to help people survive.4 People need that .5 (Audience part icipat ion.)6	MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	Now, it 's7 ridiculous.  I 'm a rent stabil ized tenant . I've8 been in the building thirty- two years. I came  in9 at $750. I 'm at $1946. September 1st I go up to10 $2073 . I have a rent controlled neighbor next11 door who came in in the	'60s.12 How can those landlords say  that13 rent controlled people who have been in  the14 building	forty years are paying $400? The  only15 way they are paying $400 a month is if  those16 landlords are not meeting requirements  because17 otherwise they would be up where my  neighbor18 right next door to me on the right is,  paying19 $2300 after forty years.20 So, you know, we need a  zero21 percent increase. We didn' t have to have an22 increase last year. Last week The New  York23 Times - -24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to25 wrap up.7 
1	396  2 MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	- - book3 review said that prices of real estate in  New4 York between 2003 and 2004 - this is not in  New5 York, this is the United States, prices of  real6 estat e - between 2003 and 2004 went up thirteen7 percent.8 Now, our building has only,  out9 of fifty- seven apartments, eight rent controll ed10 tenants left . He is renting two bedrooms for11 $5000 decontrolled.  Five years ago he was selling12 two bedrooms for $875, 000. He 1 s selling them for 13	$1,800,000 or $2,200, 000 the last figure.14 He is making out like a bandit15 just like the SRO landlords are making  out.16 And all of them on the  Upper17 East Side and Upper West Side are like that .18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 You have to wrap up.20 MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	That21 greed , this kind of landlord greed ,  if we  have22 home rule, I think we would have a panel  here23 that would be pro- tenant.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.25 Question.14 
1	3972 Are you in a co- op? Are you in a3 non- eviction co-op? Is that why you're saying4 he' s selling the building, some units? Are you  in5 a non- evict ion co- op?6	MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	Am I what?7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you in a8 non- eviction co-op? Is that why you are saying  he9 is selling units?10 MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	A non-11 eviction. It was only twenty percent and  they12 managed  to get out practically everybody.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'm just14 asking.15 Thank you.16 Maria Bottino.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Lawrence Lee,19 followed by Gregory Hylton.  Is Gregory Hylton20 here?21 MR. GREGORY HYLTON:	Yes, I am.22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Good to23seebackagain.24Thank you.25Maria Bottino. Go  ahead.
1	3982 MS.  MARIA BOTTINO :	H ,  I3 Good afternoon.4 My name is Maria Bottino and  I'm5 here represent ing Asian Americans	for Equality.6	I am going to have Mr. Lee  make7 his statement in Chinese and then I'll read it   in8 Engl ish.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.10	No problem.11	MR. SZE KUEN LEE:	(Speaking in12 Chinese.) Thank you.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 We are going to give you  three15 minutes. Okay? You can hold the  mike.16 MS. MARIA BOTTINO:	Okay. Thank17 you.18 Good afternoon.19 My name is Sze Kuen Lee. I  have20 been living at 123 Rivington Street for the  past21 fourteen years.22 My wife and I are in  our23 seventies and we are retired. We have a family  of24 six. We live with our son, his wife, and  two25 grandchildren. The grandchildren are only 8   and12 
1	3992	11.3	My son is currently working. Our4 income  is slightly over the SCRIE   requirement .5 Therefore, we are stuck with a very high  rent.6	Our annual gross income  is7 $27, 000. We pay $870 per month on rent. It is8 expect ed to increase again by the end of this9 year to $920.10 The condition of the  apartment11 is very poor. There are roaches and rats.  There12 has been a leak in the bathroom for more than   ten13 years, but the landlord does not  care.14 We really want to move to  a15 nicer place, but we cannot afford the  rent .16 Actually, there are many  tenants17 in Chinatown facing a similar situation. I  hope18 the RGB will not approve a rent hike the  next19 year.20 Thank you very much.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 (Audience part icipation. )23 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Lawrence  Lee ,24 followed by Mr. Gregory  Hylton.25 MR. LAWRENCE L E E :	I have a7 
1	4002 question. I stay in a shelter right down  the3 block at 8 East 3rd Street. It 's part of the4 housing package for me which allows me for  my5 rent to be just $765 per mont h. But yet I can't6 get a studio apartment or a one- bedroom for that7 price because a studio starts out at $850  and8 better.9	So, therefore, I'm forced to  be10 stuck in the system, forced to be  homeless,11 forced to stay in my shelter, to get  bounced12 around from facility to facility. So you have   to13 make money off my HA number. Instead of me  being14 a productive member of society where I can  work,15 pay my own way  - - the job that I have right   now16 still is not allowing me enough to move out  of17 the shelter.18 But yet you're going up on  rent.19 Now, what am I supposed to  do?20 You' re making working class people who can't cut21 the cost of living to become homeless.  The22 shelter system is overcrowded.23 Where do we go from there?  What24 type of help do we have? We' re so far low on  the25 map when it comes to poverty, you don' t even  see10 
1	4012 us. We' re just a shadow standing among people.3 So tell me what are we  supposed4 to do?5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I hate to say6 it , but  this Board doesn' t have the answer.  I7 know you're in the system and I 'm sure there are8 counsellors in the system who try to help  people .9 We have a l imited role and , you10 know, we would admit that when we raise  the11 allowabl e lease increase, it raises rents in the12 City . And that has an impact . There' s no doubt13 about it. And that 's our job to have that impact.14 But we cannot and do not  deal15 with individual cases, although I would be  happy16 to have you call our staff tomorrow, if you  think17 you are getting  some sort of runaround  - -18 MR. LAWRENCE LEE:	I 'm not19 gett ing a runaround.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What?21 MR. LAWRENCE LEE:	I ain' t22 gett ing no runaround.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And we' ll try24 to elevate your particular situation. That 's all25 we can do.6 
1	4022	MR. LAWRENCE LEE:	Furthermore ,3 Mr. Lubell , from the statement that you made last4 t ime I was here in this hall , peopl e come here5	like this is a welfare handout that we need.  You6	understand that?7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No, no.8 MR. LAWRENCE LEE:	You owe9	peopl e an apology for what you said.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No, no.11	We had this earlier today. Mr.12 Lubell was quoting  an advocate  - - not  advocat e, a13 representative of the tenants who testified  at14 one of our non- public hearings, which are15 meetings  where he indicated  - -16 MR. LAWRENCE LEE:	Wait. When17 he made that statement , he did not state out of18 his mouth that he' s reading that somebody   - -19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	He did. He20 did. Timothy Collins  is the  - - he did.21 MR. LAWRENCE LEE:	No, he22 didn' t.23 I sat right over here when  he24 said that. He offended everybody in this  room.25 One person got arrested because he wanted  to12 
2 speak about what he said.3 (Audience participat ion.)4	MR. LAWRENCE LEE:	Don't tell5	me what he said. He owes everybody an  apology.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have a7 transcript of the record and I guess we  are8 hearing a little differently.9	Thank you, Mr. Lee. I  appreciate10 your coming back.11 (Audience participation.)12 A VOICE:	Can you tell us what13 number you're up to?14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Hylton,15 please.16 A VOICE:	Excuse me. What17 number?18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	132.19 A VOICE:	Thank you.20 Mr. Hylton, who will be  followed21 by Margarita Lopez and then Daniel Pecam.  Mr.22 Pecam, are you here?23 (No response.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.25 Mr . Hylton, good to see you.10 
2 MR. GREGORY HYLTON:	Thank you.3 Good to see you too.4	How are you doing, to the Board5	and members of the Board , ladies and gentlemen.6	My issue is the fact , if you7 raise rent - okay? - it doesn' t make it    any8 easier for anybody else.9	And what we' re trying to do is10 make people in the society part of the   society.11 If they cannot become part of society because   the12 rent is raised , how do we become a part of?13 You see, one of our issues is  -14 - I'm actually in shelter right now. Okay?  And15 not everybody in the shelter deserves to  be16 there. Situations happen in life. Okay? And  it17 happened to me and I just happened to be   there.18 But I have to deal with it.19 And when you talk about  raising20 rents, I look at the fact that if I do  get21 housing, I got to pay seventy- five percent of  the22 money that I make out of my job for my rent   right23 now. Then how do I pay for my telephone? How   I24 pay for my TV? What about my food? Things   become25 rough .10 
2 I think my issue is when we  have3 business, not every year a business is  always4 going to make you money. There' s some years a5 business, it 's just , you know, it ' s bad this6 year . How did you do last year? Oh, not so  good.7	And it 's the fact that when  8 people in not just the shelter, but the  elderly,9 the middle class, really want to become part  of10 the society, how do you do that when things  are11 not good this year because we just didn' t have12 five people to vote not to raise the  rent?13 (Audience participation. )14 MR. GREGORY HYLTON:	That 's all15 we need. That 's all we need.16 (Audience part icipation .)17 MR. GREGORY HYLTON:	You know,18 I'm not going to take up too much time because   I19 really have a lot of  facts.20 But  I really  - -  I didn' t come 21	prepared  this morning.  I just came to you out   of22 my  heart ,  ladies and gentlemen.23 Okay?24 And part of my heart  says,25 listen, every t ime I go to bed I have to pray22 
2 that I make enough money to make the  rent.3 Not all the landlords do  what4 they' re supposed to do. Everybody needs to make5 money to l ive. Am I right?6 (Audience participat ion .)7	MR. GREGORY HYLTON:	So that if  8 we can't live and we can't make money, how do  we9 pay the rent? Only five peopl e are needed.10 I 'm asking you out of my heart ,11 I 'm asking you - okay? - out - - how many  people12 from the shelter are here right now? Stand up .13 Stand up and show - okay?14 All we do is ask you. We  ask15 you, senior citizens, we just ask you, sir . We16 ask the Board, we ask, ladies and gentlemen  of17 the Board  - okay?  - we even plead  with you.  Okay?18 Please , just do not raise the rent this year.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 MR. GREGORY HYLTON:	Talk about21 it next year because this year we may need to  22	just get more in the society  because they need 23	more jobs.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,25 Mr . Hylton.24 
2MR. GREGORY HYLTON:	You know3what I mean?Thank you for your time. It 's4appreciat ed.5(Audience participation .)6MR. GREGORY HYLTON:	Okay.7CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Margarita8	Lopez, Councilmember.9	(Audience participat ion.)10 COUNCILM EMBER MARGARITA LOPEZ:11 Good evening, everyone, and good evening to   the12 public. Forgive me that I am looking to  the13 front. Okay? I apologize to  you.14 Thank me for allowing me  to15 speak here today.16 Michael Bloomberg, the Mayor  of17 the City of New York, and Comptroll er William18 Thompson a month- and - a - half or a month and three19 weeks ago, both of them had a press  conference20 together with ACORN, an organization that  works21 to create affordable housing for New Yorkers.22 And they had that press23 conference in which I was invited to be  to24 announce that they were able to locate  $15025 mill ion that came out of the prof it from the10 
2 authority that constructed Battery  Park.3 They indicated that  - -  the press4 conference was about announcing construction  of5 af fordable housing in New York because we have  a6 crisis, a crisis of affordable housing for  New7 Yorkers .8 Then for this Board to entertain9 the idea that  an increase on the rent   controlled ,10 stabilized apartment is something that we  should11 even talk about it is preposterous .12 But equally, when we have  the13 two highest elected off icials from New York City14 telling the City that if we do not reverse  the15 trend  that we put in the	'70s and the	' 80s giving16 incent ives to developers to build housing at that17 t ime because no one wanted to build and we gave18 thousands of tax abatements to them to build  that19 housing that today is unaffordable to  anybody,20 and both of them said publ icly in that press21 conference that we now have to put the money  into22 product ion of affordable housing, let 's begin by23 preserving the ones we have under the  rent24 stabilized laws and the apartments that  exist25 right now.2 
2 (Audience participation.)3 COUNCILMEMBER  MARGARITA LOPEZ:4 Right now.5 Thank you.6 (Audience participat ion. )7 COUNCILMEMBER  MARGARITA LOPEZ:8 If the Mayor and the Comptroller agree on  this,9 if the public agrees, if everyone in New  York10 City understands that we do not have  affordable11 housing in this City today as we need it , why is12 this Board even thinking about increasing  the13 rents for people  in these apartments?14 (Audience participation.)15 COUNCILMEMBER  MARGARITA LOPEZ:16 Why?17 (Audience participation. )18 COUNCILMEMBER  MARGARITA LOPEZ:19 From where are you coming?20 (Audience participation. )21 COUNCILMEMBER  MARGARITA LOPEZ:22 I came today to express my understanding of  what23 everybody is talking about in the City, that  we24 have a crisis, that we are not going to be   able25 to house the working people of this City  because2 
2 the working people of this City are going to  be3 simply the homeless working people of the  City.4 (Audience participat ion.)5 COUNCILMEMBER  MARGARITA LOPEZ:6 That ' s what we are going to have.7 (Audience participat ion.)8 COUNCILMEMBER  MARGARITA LOPEZ:9 And I hope that you, as a Board that  is10 responsible  of what ' s going to happen  in this11 City, part icularly the representat ives of Mayor12 Bloomberg on this Board , say very clearly, hell,13 no more rent increase for rent controlled , rent14 stabilized apartments.15 (Audience part icipation. )16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Daniel17 Peckham.

I 've been  there21 twenty years. Rent $437.35.22 I'm not  a well -known person yet ,23 but  I try. You know, I call it fool 's errand ,  but24 I 'm out there. I 'm trying. I want - - that 's what25 I want to do.12 
1	4122 And I drive a cab during  the3 week to make my rent.4 I wouldn' t be able to do what I5 want ed to do to become an actor without the rent6 being controlled.  I have a one room, little  dinky7 thing with, you know, shower and bathroom  in  the8 hallway. Ninet een units. And I live with  that.9 You know, Master' s degree, law school , the whol e10 thing, well heeled , decent upbringing, breeding,11 you know, Western New York.12 And I just think that all  the13 facts that the landlords and you - - and I   don' t14 think I even have to tell you, I think you   know15 that it 's a lot of obfuscation, you know, just16 like the air transfer rights in Midtown so they17 can get the high- rises up.18 It - - the facts, they don' t have19 these expenses.  They don' t need  - - my landlord' s20 a billionaire many times  over.21 And I'll tell you  something.22 Even if I could afford a high rent , there' s23 something about the people out here, and   these24 people - -25 (Audience participation.)2

He said what is what ,10 something.  I don' t know.  I 'm ready to answer you.11 I 'm tuned. I 've got the actor' s ears.12 These are my friends. They  want13 to talk to me. They want to know what 's going on.14 "Hey, hi Joe. " Don't push them out of   my15 neighborhood.16 The landlord lives in  Riverdale17 and he' s a nice guy and all . He doesn' t want  to18 really know what 's going on with me.19 I get along with these people.20 I 'm a young, scrapping sixty- year old kind of guy21 and I could work for a living. I can get  along.22 But a lot of these guys  can't.23 And they should be allowed  - - I24 know they are not down here for their  health.25 It ' s a nice day out there. They are down  here10 
1	4142 because they need to be down  here.3 And so they must be  telling4 something called the truth about what they  need5 and what they can't afford. And I want  them6 around in my neighborhood.7 That 's all I got to say, except ,8 oh, with the West Side SRO Law Project , they9 helped me with an overcharge a couple of  years10 ago along with Rudy. I got on the phone with  him,11 with CBS AM radio, talked to the Mayor because   I12 was being overcharged. For five years  the13 Division of Housing and Community Renewal  didn' t14 do anything. But Rudy got on it , the West Side -15 -  I got to give him  credit.16 So don' t make a monkey out of17 me, please. Please, just don't raise the  rent.18 You already did it , you know,19 You know the deal. You know that they don't  have20 those expenses.21 Thank you.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 3	(Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ivan Simpson?25 (No response. )24

VIRGINIA CASWELL:	Yes.10 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Okay . Great.11 Go ahead , Mr. Lone.12 MR. WASIM LONE:	Thank you.13 I'm Wasim Lone. I'm the head  of14 an organization, GOLES, Good Old Lower  East.15 A VOICE:	Louder.16 MR. WASIM LONE:	I'm Wasim17 Lone. I'm a tenant organizer of GOLES, which   is18 located right in the neighborhood, a  tenants'19 rights organizat ion. And I want to read a20 statement.21 High rents have systemat ically22 displaced the low and moderate- income tenants out23 of the Lower East Side. According to the  Housing24 and Vacancy Survey there has been a  seventy25 percent  decline in the Puerto Rican population10 
2 since 1980, and a twenty percent decline in  the3 African American population  and significant4 declines in the ethnic Polish, Ukrainian  and5 Russian communities.6 The ethnic diversity that  has7 historically def ined the neighborhood	is on its8 way out completely to be replaced by white   young9 urban professionals.	It is not the same10 neighborhood anymore and the remaining low  and11 moderate- income tenants are barely hanging on  to12 their homes.13 These tenants are often  victims14 of landlord harassment aimed at driving  tenants15 out of their apartments. The tactics employed   by16 the landlords include deprivation of  services,17 physical  and  verbal  harassment , frivolous18 litigation  harassment ,  aggressive  buyout tactics,19 rent gouging, et cetera.20 GOLES has seen a marked  increase21 in the harassment activit ies since the	'90s when22 vacancy decontrol went into effect that   rewards23landlords withderegulated units upon vacancies24when the rentscan be restruct ured to $2000.25Major Capital  Improvements and
2 RGB increases all add up to increase  rents3 displacing  low- income tenants to homelessness.4 Property values have risen  so5 high that now even landlords of project - based6 Section 8 buildings are beginning to opt out  of7 the program further eroding the stock  of8 affordable housing  in the neighborhood.9 GOLES is currently involved  with10 many of these buildings to make sure that  they11 stay in the program.12 The housing crisis citywide  has13 gone on for so long that it should be called  a14 permanent  housing nightmare. The homeless15 population  is at record numbers. New York City16 Housing Authority has a ten-year waiting  list.17 There are tens of thousands doubled and  even18 tripled up, the hidden homeless, because they   are19 not counted. And one out of four renters, as  we20 all know, pays more than fifty percent of  their21 income on rent .22 The RGB cannot solve all  the23 housing problems of the City, but you can do  your24 part , and it 's a very  important part , to freeze25 the rent this year.2 
2	Thank you.3 (Audience part icipation. )4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Those of you5 who are in the room who would like to speak  who6 have not signed up , you can sign up upstairs7 because at six o'clock we' re cutt ing off the8 sign- in sheet. So if anybody wants  - - that 's not9 when we' re cutt ing off the hearing. It ' s when we10 are cutting off the sign- in sheet.11 So if there' s anybody down here12 who wishes to speak and did not sign in  upstairs,13 pl ease sign in.14 I will also make the same15 announcement at , you know, about ten to six.16 MR. ROBERT KATZ:	What number17 are you up to?18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	153 .19 What 's your name?20 MR. ROBERT KATZ:	Robert Katz.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	154.22 You' re two away.23 Sona Fink.24 Then Virginia  Caswell ,  and then25 Robert Katz.5 
1	4192	Go ahead.3	MS. SONA FINK:	My name is Sona4	Fink.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold the6 mike. Hold on. Hold on. You need to hold  the7 mike.8	MS. SONA FINK:	I've lived for9	forty- three years in Peter Cooper Village.10 Can you hear me now?11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Speak loud12 and stand close to the  mike.13 MS. SONA FINK:	My landlord is14 Metropolitan  Life whose lawyers and real  estate15 experts know how to put City and State rent   laws16 and regulations to the most advantageous   use.17 As we all know, State  law18 permits a landlord to increase rents to cover   the19 cost of Major Capital Improvements and then  to20 continue charging that increase in  perpetuity21 after costs have been  recouped.22 In May 1996 , Met Life began23 charging Peter Cooper tenants for astoundingly24 expensive replacement windows. That added   about25 five percent to our rents.10 
1	4202 In late 2003 , DHCR ruled  that3 Met Life' s electrical rewiring of Peter Cooper4 Village merit ed an increase of $114 a month for  a5 three- room apartment , $153 for four rooms.6	Each time this Board vot es an7 increase for rent stabilized apartments,  it8 compounds those MCis, which have been folded   into9 our base rent . For Peter Cooper tenants who opt10 for a lease renewal every two years, the  monthly11 cost of those windows that we started paying   for12 in 1996 has risen by twenty- eight percent as  a13 result of biannual increases granted by the  Rent14 Guidelines Board over the years.15 In the ten years between August16 1995 and this coming August , when my current17 lease will expire, my rent has been raised by   5218 percent through MCis and the crucial decisions   of19 this Board.20 Throughout  those same years,  I ,21 like many other retirees in Peter Cooper  Village,22 have lived on income from Social Security   and23 investment of savings that once promised a   safe24 future. Today, those savings have been dwarfed   by25 inflat ion and historically  low interest rates.7 
1	4212 Two-year Treasury notes I held in 1995  yielded3 between 6.5 and 7.5 percent . Yest erday, the4 highest yield for a two-year T-note was  3 .695 percent.6	The incomes of Peter Cooper7 Village and Stuyvesant Town' s large population  of8 World War II vet erans and their wives or  widows9 can't keep pace with even the lower end of  the10 rent increases you are considering now.11	Meanwhile, our affluent landlord12 continues to invest millions in MCI projects   that13 pay back in increased rents pretty much like   the14 juiciest bond issue you can dream  of.15 As you weigh the necessity for  a16 rent increase, please keep in mind the needs   of17 the people whose lives your decision will  affect .18 Thank you.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Virginia22 Caswell , Robert Katz, and Jeanie Dubnau.23 Jeanie Dubnau is 155.24 Go ahead.25 MS. VIRGINIA CASWELL:	Okay.12 
2 My name is Virginia Caswell  and3 I work as a legal secretary and live in a  rent4 stabilized apartment  in Stuyvesant Town.5 During the eleven years I  have6 lived in my apartment my rent has increased  627 percent. This is an incredible rate of  increase8 due not just to the yearly increases  established9 by the Rent Guidelines Board , but also to the10 many increases for Major Capital  Improvements11 which Met Life, my landlord , takes advantage  of.12 I can honestly say that  despite13 the Major Capital Improvements, the  maintenance14 of our buildings is worse than when I moved  in.15 I can afford the increases  now16 since I am working full - time, but I will not be17 able to afford these rents when I retire and  my18 income drops drastically.19 Since I like to plan ahead,  I20 started making applications to Mitchell - Lama and21 other co- ops so that I will have a secure housing22 situation when I retire. In the process I   learned23 something very interesting. I found that  the24 carrying charges for these co- op apartments have25 ranged from around $300 to around $585 per  month2 
2	for one - bedroom apartments.3	I think it is fair to conclude4 that this is the range which would apply to  the5 carrying charges for landlords of rent - stabilized6 apartments. These carrying charges are far   below7 the rents of anyone I know in Stuyvesant  Town.8 On the face of it it does  not9 appear that Met Life at least is suffering due   to10 the rent stabilization  laws.11 Landlords, such as Met  Life,12 also increase their income by vacancy and   luxury13 decontrol. A New York Times article from   April14 2005 said that over 13 , 000 apartments were15 removed from the rent rolls of rent  stabilized16 apartments last year alone. This means  that17 landlords' profits at a minimum are at  least18 three - and - a-half times greater than the amount19 they are paying out in expenses for these 13 , 00020 apartments.21 The big  landlords, at least ,  are22 not hurting.23 You can look at this  gathering24 and you will see that the majority of people  are25 tenants. On purely human terms, why would  you4 
2 benef it the few at the expense of the many?3 And history shows that if  the4 middle class leaves the City, fiscal  crisis5 follows quickly behind as it did in the  1970s6 since the middl e class shoulders the majority of7 the tax burden of New York  City.8 (Audience participat ion. )9	MS. VIRGINIA CASWELL:	I urge10 you to take the larger picture into11 consideration.12 I would also like to urge you  in13 the future to have evening hours for  public14 test imony since the - -15 (Audience participation.)16 MS. VIRGINIA CASWELL:17 majority of tenants have to take off time   from18 work when you have testimony during the  day.19 Thank you.20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Just to be22 clear, we had an evening hearing and this   hearing23 goes until whenever. But anybody can sign  up24 between five and six.25 Mr. Katz.10 
2 Ms. Dubnau, Jeanie Dubnau, are3 you here?4 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	Yes.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Then Mr.6	Thompson. Okay?7 Go ahead , Mr. Katz.8 MR. ROBERT KATZ:	Before I9 start my presentation,	I would like to remind10 this Board that it is a governmental agency.  I11 believe you heard criminality here, at   least12 prima facie, with reference to the Dexter  House.13 And I believe that you have an obligation   to14 inform the District  Attorney.15 (Audience participation.)16 MR. ROBERT KATZ:	I appear here17 as counsel to the Queens League of United  Tenants18 to void an argument for caps. I am asking for   a19 special guideline for  caps.20 You, who have shown a power  and21 proclivity to in the past impose the poor   tax,22 must now today utilize that same  flexible23 authority to construct a percentage maximum   cap24 for any year going forward as to the  tenants25 regulated.9 
2 The cap is needed now to3 ameliorate the hardship caused by  the4 Legislature' s destruct ion of preferential	rent.5 There are tenants this year  who6 when their lease expires are going to  confront7 increases between one hundred to three  hundred8 percent . To now place on this tenant those9 increases of your guideline  is an abomination.10 The cap is needed where  tenants,11 because of mult iple MCis, are now confronted with12 an increase of six percent each year,  perhaps13 adding that six percent each year for eight   or14 ten years.15 The MCI charge is  incorporated16 in the base rent before your guideline  is17 imposed. Your guideline is going to cause  grave18 hardship over and above the six percent  annum.19 I have a client now, who  because20 of a retroactive policy of DHCR , this year will21 go from $900 to $1400 before your guideline   is22 imposed.23 I have  another client  that ,24 because DHCR made a retroact ive adjustment in25 rent , which took them a good part of a day to2 
2 make, is not only now facing a substant ial  rent3 hike , but  faces arrearage  now calculated  over 4	$30 , 000.5 And on top of this, you  will6 impose a rent guideline which will ensure  a7 bankruptcy filing.8 You should not be the straw  that9 breaks the camel's back. You must at the  very10 least find a way to cap in any regulat ed lease11 period. And it is t ime that you take a fair  look12 at this problem.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Katz,16 you're an attorney, right?17 MR. ROBERT KATZ:	Yes.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What gives us19 the right to overrule the public policy that  the20 State Legislature adopted?21 MR. ROBERT KATZ:	I am not22 asking you to overrule it. I am  just23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You're asking24 us to take an act ion - you're an attorney  -   you25 are asking us to take an act ion which the  State5 
2 Legislature specif ically took an action to do3 something different. What gives us, this Board ,4 which is not a legal body, a legislat ive body,5 the right to do that?6 MR. ROBERT KATZ:	All - -7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you8	make that argument to me?9	MR. ROBERT KATZ:	I will answer10 your quest ion.11 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Go ahead .12 MR. ROBERT KATZ:	I'm not13 asking you to overrule any legal body. The  State14 Legislature passed a preferential	rent . I am not15 arguing here about the preferential  rent.16 All I am saying is if  somebody17 has to pay a three hundred percent increase   this18 year, it should not then after that three  hundred19 percent	increase have your guideline on top  of20 that three hundred percent  increase.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jeanie22 Dubnau.23 MS.

Our people are the  taxi9 drivers without whom our City could not   function.10 Our people are the school aides. Our peopl e  work11 the restaurants serving those who can afford   to12 eat there.

JEANIE DUBNAU:	In the last19 few years we in Washington Heights have seen the20 virtual disappearance of apartments that   are21 affordable to the low- income population of our22 area. Higher income peopl e are displacing  our23 folks because they can pay higher rents. What   are24 you going to do about this?25 Do you think the fact that  we6 
2 have 38, 000 homeless City residents has nothing3 to do with the annual rent increases passed  by4 your RGB?5 (Audience part icipat ion.)6	MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	Do you7 think the fact that over one- quarter of all8 families pay more than fifty percent of  their9 income for rent has nothing to do with  your10 annual rent increases?11 (Audience participat ion. )12 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	We have no13 more Section 8. Many landlords are refusing  to14 accept those tenants who still do have Section  8.15 Rents are going up not just because of  lease16 increases, but because of legal  increases,17 including MCis, washing machines and also  because18 of illegal overcharges of all  kinds.19 Landlords  are harassing  long -20 term tenants to leave in order to bring  in21 tenants with higher incomes. What are you  going22 to do about this?23 The landlords on your panel24 always argue that the RGB is not a social  welfare25 agency. That ' s what Mr. Lubell has said  many7 
2 times. In fact , the RGB functions as a  guarantor3 of profits  for landlords.4 (Audience participat ion.)5	MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	Public6 members, I ask you to put yourselves into the7 position of our low- income renters, our  elderly,8 whose rents continue to go up, unless they  are9 very low income and only if they pay a third   of10 their income for rent . How would you feel, how11 would you live if you had to pay fifty percent   of12 your income for rent. I bet you nobody on   this13 panel is doing that.14 Consider the fact that we15 already have a law on the books which allows   rent16 increases if a landlord really can prove he' s  not17 making a profit.18 These are hard times.19 Unemployment ,  underemployment ,  incomes decreased20 by 6.5 percent  in the last few years.21 You have an awesome22 responsibility.  I ask you do the right thing.23 Look in your hearts and vot e for zero percent24 rent increases.25 (Audience participat ion.)6

EVANS THOMPSON:	My name is12 Evans Thompson. I've lived in the Village   for13 thirty- five years.14 I want to address the15 unscrupulous  and unlawful practices of  landlords16 and landlords' agents to trick people out  of17 their leases which happened to me two years  ago.18 I'm a rent stabilized tenant and I was offered   a19 $100 increase per month when I had a  rent20 stabilized lease from the inception of  the21 building, which was a new building from 1990,   so22 they had the tax abatement.23 So what the landlady' s agent was24 trying to do to me was give me three  bogus25 leases. The first one was for $100 a  month12 
2 increase because I believe they were just   shaking3 the tree to see who would be thrown out into   the4 street not knowing the  law.5 But I knew the law and I  called6 Mr. Cabrella. I wrote him a letter. And they  put7 a letter of determination on the landlord' s desk8 which stopped their action.9 Now, the thing that really10 bothers me is nothing happened to the   landlord.11 They disrupt ed my life. I was fearful of  losing12 my home and living in the street and  nothing13 happened to them.14 I have proof of all of  the15 events that I'm talking about. I saved that   in16 case I ever go to court , I'm going to get17 somebody in trouble for trying to screw up  my18 life.19 And this is all I wanted to  say.20 I'm going to say something  else21 too.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.2 3	MR. EVANS THOMPSON:	I think24 New York today, I don' t know why these people  who25 have all of this money are trying to gut  the24 
2 people who are working and making this City   the3 place that it is.4 (Audience participation. )5	MR. EVANS THOMPSON:	If you6	want to	if you want to - - and I'm going to say7	this	if you want to "whititize" this City,  you8 ought to think about that because we are  all9 making contributions here to this life. And   if10 people who have and the people who don' t have,  if11 you can't get together on the same page, I  mean12 what are we doing?13 Do you want to kill us? Because14 that 's what we feel like. We feel like you want15 to kill us.16 So all I'm saying is that  we17 don' t need any more increases. We need housing.18 Thank you.19 (Audience part icipat ion.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 Mr. Richlin,  representing22 Councilman Gioia.23 Let me also indicate  that24 several other Councilmembers have joined us   here.25 So the next three speakers after Mr. Richlin   will8

At a time when  our9 economy is generally strong, there is no  excuse10 for the fact that New Yorkers who are  working11 harder than ever have, holding down one,  two,12 even three jobs, too many of them are  still13 nevert heless unable to afford a decent apartment14 for themselves and their  families.15 In 1970, the average tenant16 household paid twenty percent of its income   in17 rent in New York City . Today, that figure is 2818 percent. More than a quarter of all  tenant19 households dedicate over half of their  income20 just to pay the rents. Meanwhile, the cost  of21 living cont inues to rise.22 This situation is  unacceptable23 and seriously threatens the future of our  City.24 There is simply not enough affordable housing   in25 our City. And every time that we hike up  the7 
2 rents, we are lef t with even less.3 We cannot stand idly by as  the4 gap between rent and income continues to  grow,5 because if middl e and lower- income New Yorkers6 cannot afford to live here, we will start to  lose7 our workforce and our middl e- class tax base . And8 we furthermore will jeopardize our character  and9 tradition as a city with room for all peopl e  from10 all backgrounds seeking a better life  for11 themselves as well as their  kids.12 A VOICE :	That 's right .13 (Audience part icipation.)14 MR. ELI RICHLIN:	This15 affordabl e housing  crisis - - thank you - - is16 everybody' s issue because all New Yorkers have a17 stake in how we solve this probl em, whether they18 own or they rent , whether they pay market rates19 or have rent controlled apartments.  Indeed, those20 who live in New York' s one million rent regulated21 apartments are a ref lection of the City as a22 whol e.23 It is essential that the Rent24 Guidel ines Board acknowledge the affordable25 housing crisis when deciding whether the rents   of2 
2 over a million households in our City will go   up3 again, and if so, by how  much.4	Just to close , I don' t think5 that anyone here is saying that New York' s6 landlords don't have the right to make a prof it7 on their property. They are important members   of8 our community and we must work with them  to9 guarantee that New Yorkers have places to  live.10 But the decisions this  body11 makes on rent hikes in part determine  whether12 mill ions of New Yorkers will be able to keep  a13 roof over their heads.14 This Board has a  responsibility15 to take the needs of those millions of  hard-16 working tenants into  account.17 Keeping rents in check is  just18 one component of a solution to the crisis  of19 affordable housing. It 's a critical component20 that we must address. And we also must   continue21 to address the insufficient supply of  affordable22 housing throughout our ent ire City.23 We must work together to  reclaim24 the waterfront , to build over unused rail yards,25 and think creatively about other  potential5 
2	housing sites.3	In conclusion, working together4 we can make this happen citywise to solve our5 affordable housing crisis. The long- term healt h6 of our economy, as well as the very charact er  of7 our City, depend on it.8 Thank you very much.9 (Audience participat ion.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Excuse me.11 Mr. Richlin, there are  some12 questions.13 MR. ZELNIK:	I have a question14 and maybe you can give me some perspective   and15 maybe some of the other City Council people   can16 do it as well.17 Let me first acknowledge that  I18 seriously believe that there is an  affordable19 housing crisis in this City. There has been for   a20 while , probably will be for a while also.21 And let me also indicate to  you22 that my feeling is that clearly we have  to23 preserve affordable housing as one part of   the24 problem.25 But what I have not iced over the10 
2 years or in recent years is that when affordabl e3 housing projects or low- income housing projects4 are proposed	for certain districts, all of  a5 sudden the same people that appear here and  tell6 us that we need to have this affordable  housing7 preserved are voting against affordabl e housing8 in their own districts, that old Ed Koch  NIMBY9 policy.10 And I'm just curious, how do  you1112 (Audience participation .)13 MR. ZELNIK:	- - how do you14 justify want ing to preserve affordable housing15 yet not fighting for affordable housing in  other16 districts?17 (Audience part icipation .)18 A VOICE:	What facts do you19 have?20 (Audience part icipat ion. )21 MR. ELI RICHLIN:	I would	I22 guess, to answer that quest ion, I would enter  as23 an exampl e a case of - -24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Quiet .12 
2 He' s just asking a question.3 What 's your problem?4 (Audience participation.)5	MR. ELI RICHLIN:	Well , I am6 going to pass it along to the members of  Council.7 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:8 Mr. McLaughl in,9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Zelnik.10 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:11 Excuse me, Mr. Zelnik.12 Mr.  Zelnik, that ' s a very good13 quest ion and I speak - -  I am the co- chair of the14 Black/Latino and Asian Caucus of the  City15 Council. There are approximately  twenty- five16 members.17 But  I - - let me introduce myself18 and I can go on my time and I'll respond to  your19 question. Okay?20 My name is Robert Jackson  and21 I'm a member of the City Council of New  York.22 (Audience part icipat ion.)23 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:24 And I represent northern Manhattan on the   City25 Council ,  some geographic  areas  of Washington10 
2 Heights, Inwood , West Harlem, Hamilton Heights3 and Morningside Heights.4 And my district  - - and I'm5 giving it to the members who are not aware so   you6 know where I'm coming from - - is 163 , 000  people7 from 123rd Street to the end of Manhattan,  where8 the average family income, based on the  20009 Census, is $34,000 a year for a family of  four.10 That ' s the average  family income.11 And my district , based  on the12 Census, is fifty percent Hispanic , thirty- three13 percent Black, fourteen percent white and two   to14 three percent Asian. That 's the makeup of my15 district .16 Now, let me answer  - - first of17 all , let me just compliment all of you for18 serving as members of this Board. I think  that19 all of you need to	deserve credit for  serving20 and to hopefully come to a decision that  would21 best meet the needs of the residents of New   York22 City and the City as a whole.23 But as a member of this24 legislat ive body, the City of New York, as far as25 affordable housing, the City Council  supports2 
2 affordable housing. And  if , in fact , the City  of3 New York right now - - and I say to you, Mr.4 Zelnik,5	Zelnik, is that how you6	pronounce  your name?7 MR. ZELNIK:	Right.8 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT9 JACKSON:	wants to build affordable  housing10 in my district , I welcome that not tomorrow, but11 today.12 (Audience participation.)13 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:14 So I think that if you ask the average member  of15 the City Council , most members would answer yes16 to that.17 I know that my colleague,  Miguel18 Martinez, would respond yes and he   represents19 Nort hern Manhattan.  I know my colleague Malinda20 Katz, who is over here, she would respond   yes.21 And that would go on and  on.22 There would be hardly any,  maybe23 one or two, that may respond in the nay, in   a24 negative.25 But let me just make a couple  of10 
2 points if you don' t mind. Is that okay,3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.4 COUNCILMEMBER  ROBERT JACKSON:5 - Mr. Chair?6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.7 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:8 I appreciate it very much.9 First of all , I think that , and10 I'm sure that you've heard the testimony as   far11 as the affordable housing crisis here in New  York12 City. It ' s at an all - time high . In fact , any time13 you talk about building in New York City,  there' s14 always many, many advocates and  individuals15 talking about the need for affordable  housing.16 And Malinda Katz will talk  about17 - - she's the chair of our land use committee  - -18 we've had those built into projects because  the19 demand is so great.20 And considering that the cuts  in21 Section 8 and then these Mitchell - Lama housing22 developments where  landlords are buying  out ,  it23is increasingthe demand for affordable  housing.24And Jeanie Dubnau talked  about253 8,000 peopleare homeless. I say to you, as  a
2 Member of the City Council , we are constantly3 approached by delegat ions, individual Council4 Members, and the Council as a whole,  about5 affordable housing  for people, working people  in6 the City of New York, that are of working  means,7 that are not middle income , and also those of  the8 middle income, but also those individuals  that9 are homeless.10 And so I say to you, based  on11 what I've said to you describing my district   and12 some of the major issues that are facing the   City13 of New York, this budget  of ours  - - we have a  $5014 billion budget and we are expect ing in New  York15 City a budget deficit of $3 .5 billion at the  end16 of	' 06 which  ends June 30th. We' re expect ing a17 $4.5 billion def icit in  ' 07 and in ' 08.18 And I say to you that there  are19 cuts being made right now in the City budget   by20 the Mayor in which people	more than likely21 those that are last hired will be the  first22 fired, laid off - - that already will  face   the23 gamut , where are they going to live and how  are24 they going to be able to afford the  rent.25 So we have a big problem.2 
2 So I ask you to consider all  of3 these factors in making a determinat ion about4 what you have to do in carrying out  your5 responsibility.6 But I ask you to take a  couple7 of things into consideration.8	I ask you that where there is9 twenty- five percent of apartments in a building10 that  are unregulated , meaning  that they've11 reached the cap , that there be no increase12 whatsoever for that particular building, and  that13 if the landlord doesn' t register their apartments14 with DHCR , that they should not receive an15 increase.  That ' s their obligat ion to register16 their apartments with  DHCR.17 (Audience participation.)18 COUNCILMEMBER  ROBERT JACKSON:19 And also I ask you to consider that if a  building20 - -  if a building  has over one hundred code21 violations, that there be a stipulat ion that  that22 landlord should not be ent itled to an increase23 unless those code violations are cleaned  up.24 I think that25 (Audience participation. )9 
2 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT3 JACKSON:	everyone in New York City wants  to4 have a City that we can be proud of , that we  all5 can say that we are proud to live and work in   New6 York City, and that the apartments are  livable7 and meet the code regulations as set forth by   the8 City and the State.9	And so I ask all of you to  help10 to maintain affordable housing in New York   and11 especially the public members because, you  know,12 I've heard before, and I don' t serve on  your13 body, but you have the tenant members and  then14 you have the owner members, and really we   are15 really talking to the public  members.16 So I'm really talking to all  of17 you but I'm really, really speaking to the   public18 members. You make the difference and you have   the19 decision in your hands.20 And I ask you to consider that21 in your deliberations.2 2	Thank you very much.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Lusskin,23 
2	go ahead.3	MS. LUSSKIN:	It 's almost more4 of a statement , but on this issue of increases  in5 the buildings where there are mult iple6 violations, this is something that we , as a  few7 years ago relatively new members to the Board ,  I8 know I asked a question is that something that   we9 can effect.10 And it 's something that , as I11 understand it , the Legislature in Albany has12 specifically spoken on and we are not in  a13 posit ion where we can countermand something  that14 they've specifically spoken  on.15 But it is certainly an  issue16 that  - -  the rent control system is handled17 differently.18 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:19 Okay. So that 's not within your jurisdiction; is20 that what you are saying?21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	There' s a22 Corporat ion Counsel ruling	" ruling" may be the23 wrong word  - - a memo going back to the   early24 '80s, if anything the law has gotten more  pro-25 owner, if you will , that  indicates  - -4 
2 MS . HOLDER:	Although  I 1   m not3 sure that still applies now that owners  can4 actually self - cert ify that they 1  ve actually dealt5 with the violat ions of their building.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We did ask7 Corporat ion Counsel and they pull ed out the old8 memorandum or whatever exactly it  is.9	We have that. In fact , it was10 this year I think that , this year, asked late11 last year in response, and we pulled it out.  And12 we 1   re happy to give you a copy of that  particular1314 MS . LUSSKIN:	Which is not to15 say that  it shouldn 1   t be addressed.  But  it 1    s yet16 another issue that unfortunately	it seems that17 it 1   s in the hands of Albany, although there are18some people whosay fortunately.19But you, as a legislative20representat ive,that is something that can be21brought up withyour colleagues  - -22COUNCILMEMBER  ROBERT JACKSON:23Okay.24MS .
