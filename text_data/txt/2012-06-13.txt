SCHLEIDER:Present.9CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:Mr. Schleider10is present.11Mr. Wenk.12MR. WENK:	Here.13CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:Mr. Wenk is14present.15Chair is present.16We have a quorum.17 I' d like to welcome you to this18 public hearing of the New York City Rent  Guidelines19 Board.	This is the first of two public  hearings20 for comments regarding the proposed guidelines21 adopted by this board on May 1 st.22 The second and final public23 hearing to comment on the proposed  rental24 adjustments will be held on Monday, June 18 th,25 starting at 10 : 00 a. m. at The Great Hall at Cooper17 
2 Union, 7 East Seventh Street in  Manhattan.3 You can pre- register to speak by4 calling the Rent Guidelines Board offices  at5 212 - 385 - 2934 and pre- registration ends on June 15 th 6	at 1 : 00 p. m. 7 The final vote on adjustments to8 rent stabilized renewal leases will be held  at 9 Cooper Union on Thursday, June 21 st, starting at 10	5 : 30 p. m.11 Board members, in your folders you12 will find two memos from the  RGB staff.	Drafts of13 both the hotel and apartment explanatory  statements14 and findings will be distributed to board  members15 this Friday.16 Before we begin our hearing, I' d17 like to read some of the rules and parameters  for18 those who are testifying before the board today  -19 as soon as I get  them.20 Thank you.21 We are going to limit, as we  have22 in the past, each speaker to three minutes in  their23 testimony.	If we do have large numbers, which  is24 not apparent at this moment, I do reserve the  right25 to reduce some of the speaking  time.11 
2 Those who have pre- registered and3 have checked in at the front desk or have  not4 pre- registered and have still checked in at the5 front desk, please do so.	You will be called on  in6 that order.7 When you are speaking, there is  a8 clock.	We' d like you to pay attention to it.	We9 will start it at three minutes.	The clock will10 beep when there is about 30  seconds left.	I' m11 going to ask that you start to draw your  comments12 to a close at that  point.13 If the board members have any14 questions for you, that will not count towards  your15 three minutes.	You will still have the three16 minutes to talk.	I will try and mention a  few17 names at a time in the order of which they will   be18 speaking so you can start to move down to the   front19 because it' s not that easy, trust me, to get  down20 to the front in this room.21 With that in mind, I' d like to22 call our first speaker, which will be  William23 Stanford;24 Who will be followed by  Patrick25 Siconolfi.2 
2 I' m going to try and alternate3 owner representatives and tenant representatives if4 we have enough of each.5 Following Mr. Siconolfi, will be6 James Jones.7 Mr. Stanford.8 Oh, there is	-- there is a  mike9 here.10 A VOICE:	There' s two of each.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Oh, okay.12 MR. STANFORD:	There' s too much13 aggravation for me to climb up and down  these14 stairs.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I don' t blame16 you.17 MR. STANFORD:	Okay.	I slept on18 a bunk bed for over  20 years.	I slept on the19 bottom bunk and it killed my back.	Okay?	I don' t20 want to turn myself into Ironside, Raymond  Burr.21 I asked this question in the  past22 and I' m asking it and reasking it: Is there  any23 particular reason why you didn' t hold public24 hearings in Staten Island?	In the last six years25 you held them in every borough except  Staten2 
2 Island.	Can someone tell me why you avoided  Staten3 Island?	Any particular reason why?4 MR. MC LAUGHLIN:	The reason why5 we haven' t done it in Staten Island is only  one6 percent of all the stabilized apartments  actually7 are in Staten Island.	So by holding the hearing8 there, we really wouldn' t make it available to9 everybody else in the City.10 So that -- that' s the reason.11 It' s just the number of units are so low holding  it12 in Staten Island we would -- we -- the fear is   that13 we just would not get a good  turnout.14 MR. STANFORD:	But you can try.15 Because, after all, Staten Island is,  officially,16 in your borough but, technically, it' s a New Jersey17 borough.	You' re treating Staten Island like a18 forgotten borough just like the MTA.19 And I said this before,  dealing20 with the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, it' s21 like dealing with the MTA  board members.	I mean,22 both teams are absentminded and inconsiderate  and23 not showing any concern for us.	MTA board members24 are constantly electing fare and toll  increases,25 you' re constantly electing rent increases.2 
2 You want us to keep paying  more3 money for rent and meanwhile some of us are  living4 in buildings that are -- buildings and  apartment5 that are unsafe.	Did you ever consider that over6 the years?	Why should we pay more when we' re7 living in buildings and apartments and also  rooms8 that are both illegal and unsafe?	They' re hazards9 to my health, your health,  their health.	No.	You10 never considered that in the last six  years.11 Basically, your attitude is just12 like -- because you have the same attitude as  the13 MTA - take and no give.	That' s all it is.	It' s14 take and no give.	You don' t want to be bothered.15 You don' t want to share our concerns.16 I' m surprised you held public17 hearings -- two public hearings, you know,  the18 second at 7 East Seventh Street, which reminds  me19 of Rikers Island.	The first, elsewhere -- because20 it' s like -- years ago, back in 2006 , this room21 would have been full.	It' s empty.22 I know it just started but it' s23 empty.	It' s embarrassing.	New York City Rent24 Guidelines Board was born in 1969 , the same year25 the Mets won the World  Series.2 
2 It was my understanding it  was3 created to help those in need.4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Please draw5 your comments to a close, Mr.  Stanford.6 MR. STANFORD:	Okay.	But it was7 my understanding it was the New York City  Rent8 Guidelines Board was created to help those in  need,9 those who have problems paying rent.	And that' s10 not what I' m seeing here.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.12 MR. STANFORD:	Thank you.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Patrick14 Siconoffi.15 MR. SICONOLFI:	Good afternoon.16 I' m Pat Siconolfi.	I' m the17 Executive Director of the Community Housing18 Improvement Program or CHIP.	CHIP is an19 association of 2 , 500 owners of multi- family20 property and together, the members of CHIP  provide21 more affordable housing in the City of New  York22 than the Mayor' s new housing plan, than Mitchell23 Lama or than NYCHA.24 CHIP is here to recommend to  you25 today that you enact a low  rent supplement.	Low2 
2 rent supplements are important because many3 apartment rents do not cover the actual cost  of4 providing that apartment.	The average income for5 apartment, according to the RGB studies is $ 1 , 1716 and that has to be measured against the cost  of7 actually providing that apartment, not simply  just8 the operating expenses which RGB reflects in  the9 PIOC.10 As an example, the RGB  calculates11 that net operating income is about 32 percent  of12 gross income but from that 32 percent the  owner13 must pay about another 20 percent for debt  service,14 another 5 percent for capital improvements  and15 another 10 percent for the operating costs that  the16 RGB doesn' t recognize.17 It' s an unsustainable financial18 model because when you add in all those  other19 expenses, many buildings actually end up in  deficit20 and there' s not an operating surplus.21 And note, also, that this problem22 is unrelated to debt service costs. Rent  stabilized23 buildings are characterized by very stable  patterns24 of ownership.	Approximately two- and- a- half percent25 of them change hands every year.2 
2 And what that means is, you  have3 an average holding time of 40 years for a   rent4 stabilized apartment and -- and that pattern  is5 very inconsistent with high debt service.	So,6 accordingly, we recommend the low rent  supplement.7 In addition to that we  recommend8 that the primary guidelines be five percent for  one9 year and nine percent for a two  year.10 But just to go back to the  low11 rent supplement, I mean, this is very  important12 because many buildings are one financial  or13 regulatory shock away from being in deficit.	You14 get one tenant who can' t pay for whatever reason  or15 doesn' t pay for whatever reason or you get one16 situation at DHCR where you make a  meritorious17 defense, even if you are found to be right, that' s18 a financial shock to the building that that --  that19 can' t be sustained sometimes by -- by -- by  these20 lower rent apartments.21 And the other thing, I' ll make one22 last point is, in the Rent Guidelines  Board23 analyses, when you show the income and out go of   a24 building, you count revenues from capital  projects25 but you don' t count the expenses associated with2 
2 those capital projects so you' re overstating the3 revenue, you' re overstating how well buildings are4 performing and you' re making it look as if the5 buildings are doing rather well when many of  them6 are, in fact, either just breaking even or  in7 deficit.8 I think I just  ended.9 Thank you.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.11 MS. CRUZ:	I have --12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz.13 MS. CRUZ:	-- I have two14 questions.15 MR. SICONOLFI:	Sure.16 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you very much.17 Can you hear me?18 MR. SICONOLFI:	Yes, I can.19 MS. CRUZ:	I just want to follow20 up on your point about the capital  improvement21 revenue that -- are you saying that our  reports22 don' t reflect the expenses that an owner has to23 outlay in order to make those capital  improvements?24 MR. SICONOLFI:	That' s correct.25 MS. CRUZ:	Okay.2 
2 MR. SICONOLFI:	Because when the3 board does its analyses, it looks at only  operating4 costs, the Price Index of Operating Cost so  capital5 costs and a whole bunch of other costs are  not6 included.7 But, certainly, the revenues from8 those are included.	So in accounting terms this  is9 -- it' s incredibly unrealistic.	It doesn' t --10 MS. CRUZ:	Right.11 MR. SICONOLFI:	-- make accounting12 sense.13 MS. CRUZ:	So there' s -- there' s14 definitely an overstatement, is that what you' re15 suggesting --16 MR. SICONOLFI:	Yes.17 MS. CRUZ:	-- in the net18 operating income?19 MR. SICONOLFI:	Net operating20 income is incorrect in the board' s research and21 it' s overstated.	Revenues are overstated and so22 building financial positions are way over  stated.23 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.24 MR. SICONOLFI:	Okay.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.2 

23	Patrick.4
MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you,A quick question; of the 2 , 500 ,
5 that' s owners or that' s properties that your6 organization --7 MR. SICONOLFI:	Owners.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Owners.	Of the9 2 , 500 owners, what would the average sized building10 be that those owners operate and  manage?11 MR. SICONOLFI:	Well, you mean in12 CHIP' s membership or you mean, generally, among13 stabilized --14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	In CHIP' s15 membership.16 MR. SICONOLFI:	Well, CHIP' s17 membership we tend to have smaller owners,  you18 know, with smaller and medium- size holdings so19 holdings of, you know, a 50 - unit building is very20 common.	A lot of our membership has 25 - unit21 buildings, 40 - unit buildings, 50 - unit buildings.22 Occasionally, you get the 200 - unit building.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	And24 how many of your owners live in the properties  that25 they --5 
2 MR. SICONOLFI:	Well -- well, we3 have -- we have a statistic which is very close   to4 that because we surveyed the stabilized  owner5 universe generally, in other words, our  members6 plus people who are not  our members.	And in that7 we found that 30 percent of the owners live in   the8 building and I would think that in -- among  CHIP' s9 membership because of the type of our  membership,10 it would be even higher on CHIP' s members --11 membership.	But they live in the building.12 But then we also found that  5013 percent lived within the same zip code and  7014 percent live in the City.	So what that means is,15 that those owners are very heavily invested in  the16 stability of their buildings and the stability  of17 their neighborhoods and they' re very much committed18 to the City.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Terrific.20 Now your supplement, could you21 explain that again how you see that  working?22 MR. SICONOLFI:	Well, the board23 enacted two supplements recently and we would  see24 it working in the same fashion for rents  under25 $ 1 , 000 that there would be, in addition to whatever2 
2 the guidelines was, there would be an  absolute3 number that would be used instead of the  guideline.4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	And5 going back to the capital expense, I mean, I   agree6 with your point that the revenue seems to be  just7 free without any cost associated.	I don' t know if8 it' s necessary to reflect it in the net operating9 income.10 If we couldn' t reflect it in the11 net operating income, how else would you see  us12 reflecting that expense?13 MR. SICONOLFI:	Well, that' s a14 good question.15 Thank you for asking.16 I mean, I think, you either  have17 to do what an accountant does which is  reflect18 capital income and capital expenses in a  separate19 report or a subsidiary document or you don' t20 include either.	You know, typically, what --21 what' s done when you look at the finances of  the22 building is, you -- you assess all sources  of23 income and you assess all -- all purposes  of24 expense and you keep the operating ones,  both25 income and out go on one side and the capital  ones2 
2 on the other.	And that' s how you do it.3 So either you include both or  you4 exclude both.	But to include the revenue on  one5 side and not the expense is very  unrealistic.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right, especially7 given the multiple year payback on any of  these8 capital expenses, if there are any multiple  year9 paybacks --10 MR. SICONOLFI:	Right.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- if there are12 any paybacks.13 MR. SICONOLFI:	Right.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.15 MR. CHEIGH:	Mr. Chairman, I have16 a question.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes, Mr.18 Cheigh.19 MR. CHEIGH:	I' m sorry, I forgot20 your name, sir.21 MR. SICONOLFI:	It' s Patrick.22 MR. CHEIGH:	Hi.	Thank you,23 Patrick.24 I -- I should remember your  name.25 Sorry.2 

2345	time with yours.6
MR. SICONOLFI:	That' s okay. MR. CHEIGH:	I wanted to -- MR. SICONOLFI:	I have a hardMR. CHEIGH:	So I wanted to --  I
7 think it' s great that you have a large group of8 owners who have, you know, they have long  retention9 rates, they are invested in the properties and  they10 are local owners and they care about  the11 properties. And they want to maintain  their12 properties -- and they want to see, excuse me,  they13 want to see increases just to make sure that  they14 keep their properties afloat and that they get  a15 decent return on their investment.16 But, you know, there have been17 increases in years past that have been fairly  low18 but even despite that, the hardship  applications19 filled by building owners are almost none  --20 MR. SICONOLFI:	Can I --21 MR. CHEIGH:	-- in the history22 of the Rent Guidelines Board.23 MR. SICONOLFI:	Did you have a24 question about hardships?25 MR. CHEIGH:	That' s right.	And7 
2 also based on the long retention rate that  you3 talked about that owners have, it doesn' t seem like4 the Rent Guidelines Board and the  Rent5 Stabilization policies are leading to, you  know,6 mass exodus of building owners because, you know  --7 MR. SICONOLFI:	Oh, you know,8 that' s actually -- I think you' re misunderstanding9 something.	Let me take your first question  first.10 The -- and I' m glad you asked it11 because the hardship application procedure at  DHCR12 is written such, you know, I would,  actually,13 invite you to read the section 25 - 22 . 4 . 2 of the14 Rent Stabilization Code which speaks about what  you15 have to do to qualify for a  hardship.16 And I think what you will find  --17 and I believe that there are others here who  can18 corroborate this -- is that, essentially, the  way19 it' s written, if you do as an as- of- right test, no20 one is eligible to apply.	The rules are written in21 such a way that you  cannot apply.	So to say -- to22 then say that, oh, you know, no one' s eligible  to23 apply but then I wonder why no  one applies.	It' s24 because the rule is written in such a way that   no25 one is eligible, almost no  one.2 
2 The very few who do make  it3 through this rather massive net of requirements  --4 I think, you are probably also aware that DHCR  does5 not act -- does not -- it' s not that they grant  or6 deny, for the most part they don' t act on  them.7 They just sit there and they sit there for  years.8 And so there is none. There is no real -- there   is9 no real workable hardship process, none.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I find it a  bit,13 you know, I' m not going to say disingenuous, but14 what I find a bit troubling that my  colleague,15 Brian, brought this up because we had testimony  for16 DHCR in our -- in our last meeting that  spoke17 precisely to this point and they admitted that  this18 hardship case load is broken.	It' s not workable.19 And to -- to present the  question20 to a representative of 2 , 500 owners as if, shame on21 you,	you should be using this type of   available22 subsidy or available problem solving mechanism,  I23 think is a bit, I don' t know, inflammatory.24 MR. CHEIGH:	You know, one final25 comment I have is it seems that building owners  are2 
2 not shying away from entering into  rent3 stabilization by applying for tax abatements,  HPD4 subsidized loans.	As a result they have to,  you5 know, comply with rent stabilization  regulations6 that they may never have had before -- or  extending7 rent stabilization.	So on the other side,  building8 owners are taking advantage of  stabilization.9 They' re not selling off in exodus and it seems like10 there' s a stabilized approach that' s happening11 right now.12 And I feel like on the -- on  the13 demand side, it almost seems -- it seems like  the14 building owners want rent stabilization and  they15 match it with tax abatements that they  get.16 MR. SICONOLFI:	If -- if I may,  I17 think you' ve drawn an incorrect conclusion.	I18 mean, there -- there -- you' re fantasizing about19 what might be in the minds of rent  stabilized20 owners and they clearly do not want  the system.	I21 mean, this system does not work.22 And if you -- I believe that  you23 care about affordable housing and the future  of24 housing in this City.	I believe that you all  do,25 as we all do.	And -- and, I think, the problem  is2 
2 is that you have 70 years of data in front of   you3 that demonstrates that rent stabilization  is4 causing the problem, not solving the problem.	It' s5 causing the problem.6 And I know that' s beyond what7 you' re authorized to do.	But you can' t state --8 you can' t say to me that owners want rent9 stabilization.	That' s not -- that' s not in any10 one' s view of this world.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.12 James Jones.13 Let me point out to  everybody,14 there is a microphone down here that' s closer and15 there' s a microphone in the back, whichever is  best16 for you.17 Mr. Jones.18 MR. JONES:	The chief of New York19 City Foreclosure indicated that he spoke with  my20 attorney recently but my attorney indicates he  does21 not remember speaking with the chief of New  York22 City Foreclosure.23 My attorney indicates that he left24 a message on the voice mail of the chief of   New25 York City Foreclosure.2 
2 I thank God.	I thank the unknown3 judge.	I thank the three unknown  contributors.4 New York State Assemblyman Keith5 Wright, representing Central Harlem, spoke to6 Manhattan Community Board 10 in the year 2011  to7 this issue.8 The Riverton Housing complex,9 stretching from 135 th Street and Fifth Avenue to10 the Harlem River Drive, Riverton Houses had  been11 included or added to the  foreclosure list.	And I12 quote New York State Assemblyman, Keith  Wright,13 " negro former owner pocketed, pocketed $ 10014 million.	$ 100 million, United States currency."15 Why did you lie negro?	Yes, the16 negro alleged owner lied.	Negro alleged owner had17 been foreclosed, $ 200 , 000 missing, disappeared.18 1880 Seventh Avenue, also known as  Powell19 Boulevard.20 Thirty- one full apartments,21 independent apartment units in buildings --  negro22 alleged owner relations with building have  been23 severed.	Negro alleged owner backed a  Chinese24 worker into a dark closet area, confessing this  is25 his home, 31 full and independent apartment  units.2 
2 Chinese worker is not required to substantiate  the3 truth of any claim.	Negro alleged owner lied.4 Chinese owner disregard the missing $ 200 , 000 .5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.6 Nick Petras.7 Who will be followed by  Barry8 Soltz.9 Who will be followed by  James10 Anderson.11 MR. PETRAS:	Hi.	My name is12 Nick Petras, Jr. and I' m president of the Community13 Housing Improvement Program, an association of14 small and medium- sized apartment owners.15 Among other things, my family owns16 several hundred rent stabilized apartments, about17 90 percent of which are in Queens.	Like a large18 number of rent regulated owners, we' ve owned most19 of our apartments for more than 25  years.20 I' ve been in charge of the21 day- to- day operations of our real estate business22 for the past 18 years.	My testimony is made on  my23 account and does not necessarily represent  CHIPS'24 position but I' m sure that they' re actually very25 similar.2 
2 I' ve come to testify about the3 long term tenant discount and I' m asking that you4 include a minimum increase or a low rent  supplement5 in this year' s Guidelines order.	I think everyone6 in New York knows that the longer a tenant has   been7 in a rent regulated apartment, the better the  deal8 the tenant most likely has.9 And savvier owners of New York10 apartments know that the lowest rents in  the11 building belong to long- time rent stabilized, not12 rent controlled tenants.	This is caused by the13 cumulative effect of insufficient Guidelines14 increases ov 0 er the years.15 In 1981 my family purchased a16 48 - unit apartment building on 29 th Street in17 Astoria consisting mostly of one- bedroom18 apartments.	Currently 45 of those apartments  are19 rent stabilized, two are rent controlled and one  is20 occupied by the super.	The average rent in the21 building is $ 1 , 099 . 16 .22 When my dad bought the  building,23 the tenants were attempting to get a  78024 administrator appointed and were conducting a  rent25 strike.	Well, I guess the strike and tenants  get2 
2 the well- run building they wanted.	Today more than3 40 percent of the tenants in the building  have4 lived there 15 years or more.	This number includes5 only two rent controlled apartments.	The average6 rent for these long- term stabilized tenants is7 $ 808 . 75 or 26 percent less than the average rent.8 These tenants don' t cover the9 proportionate cost of running a building.	Rather,10 they are being subsidized by the newcomers to  the11 building who are paying market rents,  mostly12 preferential rents.	And without passing a minimum13 increase this year of at least $ 65 for a one- year14 lease and $ 95 for a two- year lease, these tenants15 will fall further behind.16 This calendar year the real estate17 taxes in the building are approximately $ 123 , 400 or18 $ 2 , 572 per apartment.	In the previous year, the19 real estate taxes in this building were  about20 $ 115 , 100 or $ 2 , 398 per apartment.	The difference21 one year over the other, reflected a 7 . 22 percent22 increase, which is about $ 8 , 300 or $ 173 per23 apartment.	This is $ 14 . 44 a month per apartment.24 Water in this -- water for  this25 particular building is billed by the  City2 
2 quarterly. The previous four quarters water3 expenses were about $ 15 , 600 .	The previous year was4 about $ 14 , 300 .	The monthly increase per apartment5 was about $ 2 . 26 .6 This building also is heated  with7 a dual fuel boiler.	I' m sure that today you' re8 going to receive quite a lot of testimony in   the9 benefits of burning natural gas where an owner  can10 get it.	I generally agree.	But it isn' t a11 panacea.	Even switching over from oil to gas,  the12 cost of the heating and hot water in this  building13 increased approximately 5 . 57 percent or about $ 5 . 8414 per apartment per month.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Nick, please16 draw to a close.17 MR. PETRAS:	Okay.	I' m just18 going to simply say, if you add up these totals   --19 I' m not going to go through my profit and  loss20 statement but these total costs -- the  proposed21 guideline that you offered will not -- will  not22 cover these costs for the long- term tenants.23 Thank you.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25 Questions?2 
2 MS. CRUZ:	I have a question.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz.4 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.5 When the low rent supplement was6 enacted by this board, for about two years  the7 courts were -- indicated -- issued orders that  the8 owners could not use those low rent  supplements.9 Was that the case in -- in your  buildings?10 MR. PETRAS:	Well, we -- we --  if11 you recall, the courts actually rescinded the  low12 rent supplement and then it was reinstated by  the13 Court of Appeals.14 MS. CRUZ:	That' s right.15 MR. PETRAS:	We used it in --  in16 many of these cases. We  took it.	We refunded it17 and then we recharged it once the Court of  Appeals18 reversed.	That was an accounting nightmare and  I19 know that' s got nothing to do with you people  but20 it was just -- I' m still -- I' m still unhappy about21 that.	But, yes, I would like that -- I would  like22 that back.23 MS. CRUZ:	That just added more24 cost to your collection.25 MR. PETRAS:	I' m sorry?2 
2 MS. CRUZ:	That just added3 additional cost to your collection processes;4 right?5 MR. PETRAS:	It -- it cost me6 personal time because it was -- wasn' t something I7 could delegate.	I sat in front of an  Excel8 spreadsheet, you know, with all the  buildings9 rolled in and it was a pain in the -- it was a    real10 pain in the neck.11 MS. CRUZ:	And -- and you did12 that because it was worthwhile, obviously, for  you13 to collect that additional --14 MR. PETRAS:	Oh, absolutely.15 MS. CRUZ:	-- income.16 MR. PETRAS:	It was worthwhile17 to collect the low rent supplement.	Absolutely.18 MS. CRUZ:	And -- and did that19 turn away any of your tenants?	Did anybody have20 to leave because of that --21 MR. PETRAS:	No.22 MS. CRUZ:	-- additional23 supplement?24 MR. PETRAS:	No.25 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.3 MR. CHEIGH:	Oh, I' m sorry.4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Oh, I' m sorry.5 Mr. Cheigh.6 MR. CHEIGH:	Sorry.	Is your name7 Patrick?	I' m going to ask you questions.8 Thanks for your testimony.9 I just want to ask, what' s the10 market rate rent in the  community?11 MR. PETRAS:	For a one bedroom,12 over there I' m getting about $ 1 , 350 .	This is a13 very nice building built in 1940 .14 MR. CHEIGH:	And so you -- I' m15 sorry, how long have you -- have you owned  this16 building?17 MR. PETRAS:	We' ve owned this18 since 1981 .19 MR. CHEIGH:	And did you -- did20 you purchase the property with debt?21 MR. PETRAS:	We purchased the22 property with debt; yes.23 MR. CHEIGH:	And is there still24 the same -- has the mortgage been paid  off?25 MR. PETRAS:	No, there' s still2 
2debtonthebuilding.3MR.CHEIGH:Was it refinanced?4MR.PETRAS:It was absolutely
5	refinanced.	Sure.6
MR. CHEIGH:	And when was it
7 refinanced, recently?8 MR. PETRAS:	This one was9 probably refinanced in the last two or three  years,10 yeah.11 MR. CHEIGH:	And did you do any12 capital upgrades with the refinancing or was  it13 just to restructure the debt?14 MR. PETRAS:	We' ve -- we put in a15 lot of money in this building.	We did about16 $ 250 , 000 worth of facade and pointing work about17 two or three years ago.18 MR. CHEIGH:	Okay.19 MR. PETRAS:	We take money out of20 buildings, we buy other buildings.	We invest it21 other words -- otherwise.	If you know anything22 about capital finance, the debt' s actually cheaper23 than equity.24 MR. CHEIGH:	Right.	Right.25 And one of the things we  always7 
2 ask is will -- are building owners willing to,  you3 know, be more up front about their  incoming4 expenses if we should have -- and then, of  course,5 the building owners always -- always say,  well,6 tenants should be able to be up front about  their7 income and expenses as well.8 MR. PETRAS:	We -- we file an9 RPIE every year on this building.	I don' t think10 that there' s any secret.	There' s no secret to the11 finances of any of these buildings.	I mean, you12 can go and -- I' m sure that you go and like look  at13 any of the Massey- Nathal Reports ( phonetic),14 they' ll tell you pretty much what they -- how they15 estimate and what -- what any of these  buildings16 are costing to run.17 MR. CHEIGH:	And how much is the18 property worth? If you did a recent  refinancing,19howmuch wasit worthon the --20MR.PETRAS:What you can sell it21forand whatit' s intrinsicallyworth is probably22twodifferentthings.23MR.CHEIGH:Um- hum.24MR.PETRAS:Do I -- you know  --25MR.CHEIGH:But -- but why is  it
2 two different things?3 MR. PETRAS:	Because I don' t --4 because I' m very concerned about interest rates.5 Interest rates are very low right  now.6 MR. CHEIGH:	Okay.7 MR. PETRAS:	And like I said, I8 think, you can sell it for more than it' s  worth.9 Now the question is, is what do you do with   the10 money?11 MR. CHEIGH:	And when you mean12 it' s -- you can sell it for more than what it' s13 worth is it because the comparables are higher  than14 what the income can support?15 MR. PETRAS:	I' m sorry?16 MR. CHEIGH:	What -- are you17 saying that the comparables are higher than  what18 the income stream --19 MR. PETRAS:	I' m saying that --20 that there are -- there are, as you all know,  there21 have, particularly, with some of the private  equity22 money that was running around a few years  ago,23 there are people who are willing to spend a   lot24 more on these buildings than I think that they' re25 worth.2 
2 There have been some very foolish3 purchases as you, you know, you' ve watched various4 of these, you know, private equity portfolios  fall5 apart. Some of that stupid money' s still out there.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	All right.7 Thank you.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes, Mr.10 Schleider.11 Thanks for coming by and12 testifying.13 Over your properties' holding14 periods, how many tenants have had  difficulty15 meeting the Rent Guideline increases?16 MR. PETRAS:	We have a -- a,  you17 know, we own, for the most part, Astoria,  Jackson18 Heights that -- those neighborhoods.	We have very19 few nonpayments so I would suspect very, very  few.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And you run very21 well maintained buildings?22 MR. PETRAS:	Yes, we do.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And you' re24 proactive in the management?25 MR. PETRAS:	Um- hum.	I do this2 
2 full time.	Most of the CHIP -- I mean, most of   the3 -- my associates from CHIP or many of my  associates4 are full- time owner/ operators.5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Would you say, in6 your opinion, that the tenant incomes have  risen7 faster than the rate of rent  increases?8 MR. PETRAS:	I would say looking9 -- I can' t tell about tenants in place but I  will10 tell you the quality of our applications is  getting11 better.	I mean, the multiple of income over  what12 we' re asking rent is -- seems to be increasing13 anecdotally.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	So if15 you had a -- a certain percentage of your   units16 free and available to be leased at market  rent,17 your rent rolls would increase substantially?18 Significantly?	Moderately?19 MR. PETRAS:	I don' t think very20 much at all.	I' m -- for the most part -- this21 building, for example, I think, I said --  counted22 20 preferential rents.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	All24 right, so you' re saying that the market is putting25 a ceiling on the rents  --2 
2 MR. PETRAS:	Oh, absolutely.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- but you' re4 seeing applicants that could afford much  higher5 rents if the rents were moved up higher  than6 market; is that correct?7 MR. PETRAS:	Yes.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is that it?10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yeah.	It seems11 like the tenants can afford it.12 Yeah, thank you.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.14 MR. PETRAS:	Thank you.15 Mr. Soltz.	Barry Soltz.16 He' ll be followed by James17 Anderson.18 He' ll be followed by Sam Stein.19 MR. SOLTZ:	My name is Barry20 Soltz.	I am a tenant and also the  legal21 coordinator and organizer for my building' s tenants22 association, Janel Towers in the  Bronx.23 There are 229 families living  in24 our building.	Our building is a former  Mitchell25 Lama that is now rent stabilized and is owned  by2 
2 Larry Gluck and Stellar Management.3 Gluck is not one of those  small,4 poor, impoverished landlords that we hear about  by5 the opposition at these hearings.	Larry is a6 successful landlord whose predatory practices have7 led to a huge loss of affordable units to   our8 City' s affordable housing stock.	I wonder why we9 never seem to hear from the big landlords  like10 Gluck here.11 Our association has spent12 thousands of dollars on attorney fees and we  still13 owe our attorneys well over $ 20 , 000 .	We had to14 fight to get into rent stabilization.	We had to15 fight to avoid the unique or peculiar  rent16 increase.	We are currently fighting an MCI and  to17 add insult to injury, we have just got hit with  an18 additional MCI increase.19 It seems that all we do is  fight20 and struggle to try to keep our homes  affordable.21 I know other tenant associations in the Bronx  and22 elsewhere that are going through similar23 circumstances.	To the best of my knowledge,  over24 35 units in our building have been deregulated  --25 deregulated since buying out by using  questionable2 
2 arithmetic and means.3 For example, deregulated4 one- bedroom units are going for $ 1 , 500 in our5 building.	By looking at the rent of a  previous6 tenant and by calculating in the vacancy,  and7 renovation increase, the numbers do not add  up.8 Stellar Management is not putting in 18 carat  gold9 faucets to warrant the renovation bills.10 In a discussion I had with  a11 gentleman, who' s both a realtor and a landlord,  a12 month ago, he was shocked to hear some of the   high13 prices being charged in our building.	It' s about14 time that windfall profits from deregulated  units15 are factored into the formula by this  board.16 Last year, New York City  tenants17 got hammered with a rent increase of 3 . 75 percent18 for one year and 7 . 25 percent for two years.19 However, at the same time, the Nassau Rent  Board20 approved an increase of two percent for one  year21 and three percent for two years and in  Westchester22 the increases were two and- a- half for one year and23 four percent for two years.24 Every year the suburban counties25 enjoy significantly lower increases than City2 
2 residents, even though on the average New York  City3 rents are higher, the differences and increases  are4 striking and alarming.	Perhaps someone here on the5 board today can explain these discrepancies to  me6 today.7 In addition, in the Bronx,8 landlords brought in an average net  operating9 income of $ 239 every month from each rent10 stabilized apartment they own.	This year marks the11 sixth straight year that landlords have seen  their12 profits grow.	I am all for landlords doing  well13 but it' s about time that owners bear their fair14 share of the economic burden since their  profits15 are increasing.16 I will wrap it up.17 It all comes down to  fairness.18 When this board passed the huge increase that  it19 did last year, it was a punch in the face to the   9920 percent.	It is unfair to consistently approve  huge21 increases that benefit the one percent at  the22 expense of everyone else.	Your vote has such a23 dramatic effect on our lives.	A large increase can24 mean the difference on whether a family can  put25 proper food on the table and extreme  instances2 
2 whether a family goes homeless or  not.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Please wrap it4 up, Mr. Soltz.5 MR. SOLTZ:	All I' m asking is for6 you to please give us for once a fair  shake.7 Fairness and a fair shake for  once.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.9 ( Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Soltz, let11 me ask you a question, you said that you  were12 fighting an MCI.13 MR. SOLTZ:	Yes.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Are you15 fighting it that the work was not done? What  was16 the --17 MR. SOLTZ:	We are fighting --18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	-- what was it19 put in for?20 MR. SOLTZ:	We -- the MCI was  for21 point work and balcony facade work and we  are22 fighting that the work was not properly  done.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And you said24 there' s another one that' s coming in?25 MR. SOLTZ:	There' s another one2 
2 for roof work which, unfortunately, we do not  have3 the money available to -- to fight that  one.4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	But the work5 was done?6 MR. SOLTZ:	Supposedly the work7 was done.	We have not -- it would cost us  about8 $ 10 , 000 to challenge that and since we already owe9 our attorneys about $ 20 , 000 in bills, we -- we10 can' t do it.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for13 showing up and for your  testimony.14 You' ve lived in Janel Towers how15 long now?16 MR. SOLTZ:	About -- let me just17 off the top of my head, seven or eight  years.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	And19 what size apartment do you have  there?20 MR. SOLTZ:	I' ve got a one21 bedroom.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And you live with23 yourself, a family?24 MR. SOLTZ:	I live with my25 significant other, my -- my wife to  be.2 
2MR.SCHLEIDER:Excellent.3Congratulations.4Andyou' re a renter?5MR.SOLTZ:	Yes.Yes, we rent.6MR.SCHLEIDER:What is your7rent?8MR.SOLTZ:	Ourrent is -- is9approximately --it' sabout $ 720 .10MR.SCHLEIDER:$ 720 .	And your11 income is comfortable enough to support that  rent?12 MR. SOLTZ:	It -- it gets tough13 some times.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	It gets tough15 sometimes?16 MR. SOLTZ:	Yes, it does.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And that seven18 hundred- some- odd, that' s with the MCI hold on?19 MR. SOLTZ:	Yes.	Well, the new20 MCI hasn' t been applied to our bill yet.	We were21 expecting it on this month' s bill but, I  guess,22 it' ll probably be on next month' s.	It has been23 approved by DHCR.	We did not, as I said,  legally24 challenge it.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And, I' m sorry,11 
2 you head the legal committee  there?3 MR. SOLTZ:	Yeah.	I' m on the4 tenant' s association executive board.	I' m the kind5 of like the legal coordinator with our  attorneys.6 I' m the tenant organizer for our building.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Are you an8 attorney?9 MR. SOLTZ:	No, I' m not.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.11 MR. SOLTZ:	You' re welcome.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Cheigh.13 MR. CHEIGH:	Quick question.14 What is the amount of the MCI increase that you' re15 seeing?16 MR. SOLTZ:	The first one, I17 forget the exact figures, the first one, I  believe,18 was almost $ 4 per room.	The new one is about  --19 almost $ 3 per room.20 MR. CHEIGH:	And how much would21 that be for your unit directly?22 MR. SOLTZ:	For my unit it would23 be -- let' s just round them up to like 4 and  3 .	So24 our -- my one bedroom counts as -- as three   rooms.25 So that' s 12 plus the other one would be --  so2 
2 about $ 21 extra a month.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Just wait, just5 one follow up.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I' m sorry.7 Mr. Schleider.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You said that the9 -- the one- bedroom apartments similar to yours, the10 market rent would be what, about?11 MR. SOLTZ:	My next door neighbor12 is paying $ 1 , 500 a month.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Twice what you' re14 paying?15 MR. SOLTZ:	She' s paying over --16 over twice of what I' m paying and she' s actually17 has hired an attorney to try to see if she can   get18 her rent increase, because the  previous19 tenant --20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Just wait. Before21 you go into that, --22 MR. SOLTZ:	Okay.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- how many other24 apartments, how many other one- bedroom apartments25 in the complex are renting for about $ 1 , 500 a2 

2	month?3
MR. SOLTZ: I don' t have those
4 exact numbers.	I mean, the --5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But you' re on this6 committee that -- that' s trying to do -- all  right.7 I' m sorry.	Go ahead.8 MR. SOLTZ:	Yeah, I -- I don' t9 have those figures with me.	I could get them for10 another time but I don' t want to guess.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.12 Thanks.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.14 James Anderson.15 MR. ANDERSON:	Yes.16 I' m here to bring facts, evidence17 and proof and to talk in only truth, whole  truth18 and nothing but truth because I' m not lawyer,19 politician or legislator to understand -- to  lie.20 All the expenses of the  buildings21 now become -- become more and  more high.	I' m22 surprised that two people who live in -- who sit  in23 their site, incompetent and they claim  that24 expenses is zero and cannot rise the  rent.25 So they do not see  that4 
2 politicians do not help nothing and they  cannot3 never vote for interest and for the landlords  or4 for the tenant.	We already have evidence that the5 majority of them crooks to take money,  illegally6 like George Bruno, another one.	Some man of the7 office of the mayor - mayor  very rich.	He' s got a8 lot of money and somebody stole it of  campaign.9 Controller also; Albany small city10 with the biggest crook, too many and nobody  cannot11 punish. This miserable business will continue.	We12 don' t know how much.	So to expect to --  expect13 that they will do something for the real  estate14 problem, never. City Councils never make the  law.15 They looking like comedian and clowns of  different16 religions, nationalities, they have countries17 overseas.	They stay here only for big  salary.18 So in this situation, the best  way19 landlords and tenants to respect each other  and20 everybody to take care his duty, serious  landlord21 who repair and tenants who is real good  citizen22 never to make damage in the apartment or stop  to23 pay rent.24 This -- we must take between  us25 landlords and tenant. Landlords -- this2 
2 politicians, legislators, them cannot --  nothing3 good because they rise them salary 10 percent,  124 percent, maybe 16 percent only to City Councils  are5 not -- are not parasites in big  duty.6 For small employees in the  City7 they sometime years and years don' t rise nothing.8 Too many years and they rise only  two percent.	And9 the big difference of small salary City  employees10 probably receive 23 , 24 , 000 . The biggest salary for11 Commissioner, $ 189 , 000 , seven time and half for12 people who don' t work.13 So in this situation you see  today14 that not too many -- very few landlords, very  few15 tenants, they don' t expect nothing good.16 Politicians and legislators, they' re lawyers, they17 coming of law school which is lawyer liar,  they18 just --19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Anderson,20 wrap it up, please.21 MR. ANDERSON:	What?22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Wrap it up.23 Your time is up.24 MR. ANDERSON:	All right.	Any25 question or you want to give -- or you don' t  want2 
2 to give me hard time?3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	No questions.4 MR. ANDERSON:	No questions.5 Take it easy.	Have a nice night.	Tomorrow you6 have a nice day.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You too.8 Sam Stein.9 Who will be followed by  Jack10 Freund.11 Who will be followed by  Saundra12 Blakeney.13 MR. STEIN:	Hi.	How are you?14 Thank you for hearing my15 testimony.16 My name is Sam Stein, I' m a rent17 stabilized tenant in Elmhurst, Queens.	I' m also a18 community organizer and I work for Tenants  and19 Neighbors, it' s a membership organization of over20 3 , 000 tenants, many of whom are rent stabilized.21 I' ll keep it brief.22 The first thing I wanted to do  is23 just point the contrast between where the  debate24 generally is and what I see in my daily  life,25 either as a tenant in Queens or as an   organizer.2 
 2 We generally talk about rent3 stabilized rents that are far below market rate  and4 while that seems to be true, in parts of  core5 Manhattan, it is not true in the rest of the   City.6 In my neighborhood, in Elmhurst,7 if you' re not a homeowner, you' re almost,8 certainly, a rent stabilized tenant.	In my9 building the rents are on paper $ 2 , 300 for a10 one- bedroom apartment.	We get preferential rents 11	for $ 1 , 300 .12 Giving a high RGB increase  really13 does nothing in this situation.	It' s only going to14 bring the -- the on- paper rent closer to the15 decontrolled threshold.	These landlords are16 getting the money that they need to keep  the17 buildings up to -- up to shape. And to say   that18 tenants are -- don' t really need a lower increase,19 that we' re doing okay with the high increases year20 after year, is simply not the  case.21 There is so much turnover that' s22 not voluntary in these neighborhoods and people  are23 calling me every day asking what the  Rent24 Guidelines Board increase is going to be  because25 they' re -- they' re not getting an increase in their12 
2 salary.	They' re not getting lower health care3 bills but their rents are continuing to  rise.4 And the other thing I just  wanted5 to say is I' ve been coming to all the  public6 meetings.	There' s a lot of compelling data that' s7 produced. Really, it' s a fantastic amount of8 information and I just wanted to encourage you  to9 listen to the staff of the Rent Guidelines  Board.10 As I understand it, they  are11 saying that the PIOC has been over  estimating12 actual landlord cost growth for years.	The 200913 PIOC was a 3 . 6 percent increase.	The RPIE, the14 actually reported increase was just . 1 percent.15 The following year the PIOC was 5 . 5 percent and the16 actual increase was . 9 percent.17 I believe the staff is saying  that18 the PIOC has been over estimated and leading  to19 overly high rent increases that are  not20 substantiated by increase in costs.21 Clearly, property ownership is22 still a profitable enterprise.23 I will wrap up.24 We see six consecutive years of25 NOI increases, double digit NOIs in some  places2 
2 this year.	Landlord profits today are higher than3 they were in 1969 despite an aging housing  stock4 and on top of that we have record high  rent5 burdens. This year it was 35 . 2 percent was the6 average, which according to HUD makes the  average7 rent stabilized apartment unaffordable.8 We' ve got one- third paying more9 than 50 percent which is  simply untenable.	So I' m10 encouraging you, as Mr. Soltz did, to think  of11 fairness.	Think of the tenants who really are in  a12 very tough position this year as the economy is  not13 keeping up to pace.14 Thank you very much.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.16 Let me ask you a  question.17 MR. STEIN:	Sure.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You mentioned19 that you have a preferential  rent.20 MR. STEIN:	Yes.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	What size22 apartment do you have?23 MR. STEIN:	A one bedroom.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Are you -- and25 the legal rent is what?2 

234	preferential is?56
MR. STEIN:	$ 2 , 300 . CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And yourMR. STEIN:	$ 1 , 360 .CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And does your
7 landlord give you the RGB increases each year  on8 your preferential?9 MR. STEIN:	Yes.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	So it' s a11 direct pass through to you and do you normally  sign12 a two- year lease?13 MR. STEIN:	I will, yes.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You will.15 Okay.16 MS. CRUZ:	How are the --17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz.18 MS. CRUZ:	How are the conditions19 in you building, generally?20 MR. STEIN:	Pretty great.	We have21 a super who' s on top of everything.	The landlord22 lives down the hall from me.	Things are well23 maintained and they could be charging me more  rent24 than they are and they don' t need to -- they don' t25 need another increase.7 
2 My lease is structured as are  the3 others, to increase based on the RGB rate  even4 though they don' t have to.5 MS. CRUZ:	How many units in the6 building that you live in?7 MR. STEIN:	I believe it' s 77 .8 MS. CRUZ:	Seventy- seven?9 MR. STEIN:	Yes.10 MS. CRUZ:	And what types of11 issues do the tenants bring to the owner that  he12 does or he does not respond  to?13 MR. STEIN: Typical tenant14 complaints from vermin to the occasional leak  to15 heating problems, in particular, radiators.16 MS. CRUZ:	Um- hum.	But does he17 address them?18 MR. STEIN:	Yeah.	I -- what my19 -- my feeling is that the rents do, actually,  pay20 the landlord enough to do the work in the  building21 and he does not need a substantial increase to  make22 that possible.23 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Excuse me.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Steven.2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you, Sam.3 MR. STEIN:	Sure.4 MR. SCHLEIDER: So what would you5 say is your landlord' s average rent in the6 building?7 MR. STEIN:	I think it' s8 standardized for my -- for one bedrooms is $ 1 , 360 .9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So you' re saying10 that we -- if we were to multiply that by   7711 apartments, that would be his -- his rent  roll?12 MR. STEIN:	There are larger13 apartments.	There are two and three --14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So what would you15 say is his --16 MR. STEIN:	I don' t -- I don' t,17 actually, know what --18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But you' re coming19 here asking us to, you know, take into account  the20 kind of landlord profits. And as such, there is  no21 real way to distinguish or determine what  the22 profits are. In fact, our statute precludes us  from23 considering profit because it' s too complex and24 complicated and too individual calculation per25 building.	So maybe you' d want -- you' d want to2 
2 take that out of your  discourse.3 The next thing and just on  a4 personal level, what is it that you  organize?5 MR. STEIN:	What is it that I6 organize?7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.8 MR. STEIN:	I' m mostly in a9 legislative organizer area and I turn  tenant10 complaints into demands for legislative change.11 There are other organizers in my organization  that12 organize tenant associations to deal  with13 conditions issues.14 I also help to --15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	It' s good work.16 I just was curious as to what you  did.17 MR. STEIN:	Yeah.	So I turn the18 individual complaints into legislative demands.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thanks.20 MR. STEIN:	Sure.21 MS. ADAMS:	Question.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes, Ms. Adams.23 MS. ADAMS:	Did I understand you24 correctly earlier to say that the conditions in  the25 building by and large are okay, that there are  no2 
2 major complaints about upkeep in the building  or3 leaks or things like that?4 MR. STEIN:	In the building that I5 live in, that is correct.	There are, certainly,6 plenty of other buildings where people are  calling7 me up, the tenants and neighbors, saying that  their8 rents are rising and yet they' re not.	The only way9 that these problems are addressed is when there' s a10 vacant apartment and then suddenly they do all  the11 work.12 MS. ADAMS:	Okay.	And do you13 know how many units in your building  have14 preferential rates?15 MR. STEIN:	My understanding is16 that all the, at least, the one- bedroom apartments17 are going for the same starting preferential  rate.18 MS. ADAMS:	Okay.	And roughly of19 the 77 , how many are one- bedroom apartments?20 MR. STEIN:	I think, roughly,21 two- thirds.22 MS. ADAMS:	Okay.	Thank you.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider,24 did you want to follow  up?25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I guess, that this2 
2 just begs the question --3 MR. STEIN:	Um- hum.4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- and, actually,5 it' s not really a question. I mean, if we were  to6 take your testimony --7 MR. STEIN:	Yeah.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- and just9 project that over the course of all the  rent10 stabilized properties, I can see why your  landlord11 does not have to have a rent increase because  your12 average rents are well high enough to support  their13 operations and maintenance of your building.14 Unfortunately, not all landlords15 are in that type of -- of particular situation  and16 when you have rents and properties that are half  of17 your rent, obviously, I' m sure you can see the18 struggles that landlords have to meet  operating19 costs.	If they can meet it at your level and  not20 have to go to -- to the legal rent to -- to   charge21 your -- your occupancy costs, then if we had  all22 the rents in rent stabilized properties well  above23 what the average rents are, according to our  staff,24 the clause that you, you know, requested us to  pay25 attention to, then, yes, I agree, we wouldn' t have2 
2 as much of a  problem.3 Thank you.4 MR. STEIN:	Okay.	I' m not sure I5 agree with that assessment though.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, you could7 not agree with it but you asked us to -- to take   --8 take what our staff tells us to heart. And we' re9 seeing a much lower average rent than the  average10 rent in your building.	And, obviously, it goes to11 prove that if we had much higher average rents,  the12 landlord wouldn' t be in such a problem.13 So I appreciate your testimony.14 Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Cheigh.16 MR. CHEIGH:	Just, you know, we17 got reports from the staff, we' re going to median18 and mean legal rents and the preferential rents  and19 how differently it varies borough by  borough.20 But it sounds like from  your21 testimony, you' re talking more about the rent22 burdens that a lot of renters that you deal  with23 face, which are the rents are not that low. They' re24 like $ 1 , 000 or higher.25 MR. STEIN:	Yes.2 
2 MR. CHEIGH:	And the median legal3 rent is about $ 1 , 094 .	The mean legal rent is4 $ 1 , 895 .	So, essentially, you' re just saying that5 there are a lot of tenants out there despite  some6 urban myths about the handful of people who  are7 very low rents.	They may have higher incomes but8 there' s a lot of people that are struggling to  make9 it. And so for their rents -- these are the  people10 that you primarily organize and who call  you.11 MR. STEIN:	The vast majority.12 Yeah.	I mean, I have a cold right now because  I13 was outside the building in Brooklyn where  people14 are struggling to pay the rents that are rising  all15 the time with the conditions issues  on top.	So the16 -- the cases that you hear of, of the very   lucky17 rent stabilized tenant in Manhattan who pays  next18 to nothing is a case that I' ve never seen and I' ve19 see hundreds of cases every day.20 MR. CHEIGH:	Except for the one21 that went to the Supreme Court.22 MR. STEIN:	Except for the one23 that went to the Supreme Court.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	One thing I25 would like to say is the last -- the last   thing2 
2 this board needs you to tell us is to pay   attention3 to the data and the studies that our staff  does.4 We do pay attention to that - from the  tenants'5 side to the owners' side to the public  members.6 The amount of effort and work that goes into  what7 we do is amazing and I' m not going to downplay  that8 for anybody.9 So I want to get that on  the10 record.11 MR. STEIN:	Absolutely.	And I12 didn' t mean to condescend or imply that that was13 not the case.	I was just emphasizing my reading  of14 the data and saying that it reinforced the  case15 that I was trying to  make.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	Thank17 you.18 Jack Freund.19 I can' t stand that beeping.20 MR. FREUND:	Thank you, Mr.21 Chairman, members of the board.22 I want to first reiterate  our23 request that this board re- enact the minimum rent24 increases that were in effect in the same manner  as25 they were in effect on the Orders 40 and  41 .2 
2 But I want to address  another3 matter here, specifically, when I appeared  before4 this board previously, we asked for an  additional5 rent increase for buildings that heat  exclusively6 with oil.	That was based on the RGB' s own data,7 specifically, the Price Index which showed that  for8 buildings that heat with oil the Price Index  was9 3 . 9 percent, not 2 . 8 percent.10 However, since that point, since11 that time, I' ve had several owners who' ve come in12 with their fuel numbers. I' ll give you one -- an13 individual with whose consumption went down by  1314 percent but prices increased by 45 percent so  his15 total fuel cost for the same April to March  period16 rose by 32 percent whereas the Price Index  measured17 1 . 6 percent.18 We had several of those  owners19 come in so I thought, well, you know, maybe  they' re20 just individual small owners, individual owners,21 maybe these are unique.	So I went to a  larger22 owner, Langston Property Services, they have23 appeared before the board.	They' ve invited24 testimony.25 I asked them, give me your  fuel2 
2 data.	They run about 200 buildings, about 10 , 0003 units mostly in the Bronx and upper  Manhattan,4 average rents in those buildings are about $ 1 , 000 .5 We very carefully match buildings6 for -- we had complete data for two years  on7 consumption and cost, not consumption, just  cost.8 And what we found, we were able to match  839 buildings, large, small, exclusively oil heated.10 And their average increase over the period  where11 the board measured -- the Price Index measured  a12 1 . 6 percent increase, their average increase was13 over 20 percent.14 And I have -- coincidentally,15 today one of my colleagues in the office came  in16 with his co- op statement. Their oil price17 year- over- year increased by 44 percent.	I just18 heard Nick Petras - and I thought this was only   an19 oil issue - but I just heard Nick Petras say   that20 in a gas interruptible building, his  costs21 increased, whereas according to the Price  Index,22 they should have decreased.23 So I must say that, you know,  the24 Price Index, I think, is  generally accurate.	This25 year, when it comes to measuring fuel, I  think,2 
2 it' s seriously deficient.	I want to reformulate my3 suggestion to the board rather than an  additional4 increase for oil heated buildings, I think you  need5 to substantially increase your preliminary range6 and provide substantially higher rent guidelines7 for all buildings because, I think, and I   will8 continue to look at this and, hopefully,  before9 Thursday get you more data.10 But I think the data is  seriously11 deficient in terms of what is an estimate by  the12 Price Index and when you compare it with  actual13 consumption, we see that across the board, cost  of14 heating buildings has increased by a  substantial15 amount, apparently something in the order of  2016 percent and what that does if it was -- if you   plug17 20 percent into the Price Index, you get not a 2 . 818 percent Price Index, you get a 5 . 23 Price Index.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Wrap it up,20 Jack.21 MR. FREUND:	And, I think, it' s22 even higher than that.23 Thank you very much.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25 MS. ADAMS:	Question.2 
 2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Adams.3 MS. ADAMS:	What year were those4 figures based on, the increased figures?5 MR. FREUND:	We specifically asked6 these owners for data that covers the same  period7 that is covered by the  Price Index.	So it' s April8 ' 11 to March ' 12 compared with the prior April to9 March period.10 MS. ADAMS:	So the -- the numbers11 that you quoted are for the last year, ' 11 to ' 12 12	or ' 10 to ' 11 ?13 MR. FREUND: They are14 year- over- year figures.	It' s exactly what the15 Price Index measures.	The Price Index measures an16 April to March year which cuts across the  years,17 okay?	April --18 MS. ADAMS:	No, I' m just trying19 to understand exactly what year you' re talking20 about.21 MR. FREUND:	We' re -- let me22 repeat.	We' re talking about the same year --23 MS. ADAMS:	Which is?24 MR. FREUND:	It' s really -- we' ll25 call it ' 11 -- the beginning of the year, ' 10 over13 

2	' 11 .3
MS. ADAMS:	' 11 .	So that would be
 4 the year that we had the especially cold winter;  is5 that the year that you' re speaking of?6 MR. FREUND:	It -- it covers --7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You' re comparing8 two periods to get your rate of  increase.9 MR. FREUND:	We' re comparing two10 periods.	One of those --11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And so it' s12 ' 10 -' 11 which was, as Betty said, the cold year --13 MS. ADAMS:	One of which was14 exceptionally --15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- to -- to the 16	' 11 -' 12 .17 MR. FREUND:	Cold.18 MS. ADAMS:	One where we had an19 exceptionally cold winter and the other where  we20 had an exceptionally warm winter.21 MR. FREUND:	Precisely.22 MS. ADAMS:	Many have reported23 that looking at those two years that, although  the24 past winter was exceptionally warm, because of  the25 increases in oil cost, they didn' t see the savings17 
2 that they expected.	That' s why I want it to be3 clear --4 MR. FREUND:	Exactly.	Yeah.5 MS. ADAMS: -- on what year  you6 were talking about.7 MR. FREUND:	Well, I think, you' re8 making the point that I' m trying to make that, I9 think, what happened is that the Price  Index10 somehow gave too much weight, because they  used11 heating degree days as a proxy for  actual12 consumption, the Price Index gave too much  weight13 to the decrease -- to the warm winter, in  effect.14 And as you just accurately pointed15 out, many people not only didn' t see savings but,16 actually, saw substantial increases in oil  costs17 over that period.18 MR. CHEIGH:	Is the --19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Cheigh.20 MR. CHEIGH:	I' m sorry.21 Does the staff have the actual  --22 what was the oil price increase  per gallon?	I know23 it was -- it' s available but --24 MR. MC LAUGHLIN: The price depends25 on the fuel number, but it was average between  202 
2 percent and 23 percent increase in  price.3 MR. CHEIGH:	Right.4 And then you reduced it based  on5 the fact that it was a much milder winter than   in6 the prior year?7 MR. MC LAUGHLIN:	Yeah.8 MR. FREUND:	So there --9 MR. MC LAUGHLIN:	There' s a10 methodology.11 MR. FREUND:	There are two things12 that happened here.	I think, one, the staff,  you13 know, got oil prices of -- that increased by  2014 percent, as I said, in at least one case we have   an15 oil Price Index increase of 45 percent. And I   think16 what happens, there is -- is that because the  Price17 Index takes the price at the beginning of  the18 month, on one day at the beginning of the month   and19 then you have a constantly rising Price Index  --20 Are you okay there, Mr.  Chairman?21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yeah, we' re22 having technical -- some technical difficulties.23 MR. FREUND:	Technical problems.24 MR. CHEIGH:	You get no beepers.25 Remember the stop watch.2 
2 MR. FREUND:	I' m running out of3 time, just our luck.4 Okay.	I can do that all  night.5 What happens -- I think this is  an6 important point so I -- I' d like the board  members7 to pay attention to it, if  possible.8 MR. CHEIGH:	Oh.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Time' s up.10 ( Laughter.)11 MS. ADAMS:	I' ll be your beeper.12 MR. FREUND:	Do I get credit for13 not making you crane your necks  up there.	I' ll get14 down on my knees and if you' ll compensate for  that.15 So, anyhow, May -- you know,  if16 you take a price on the first of the month and   then17 the price of oil continues to increase during  that18 month, obviously, owners are purchasing through  the19 month, they' re not purchasing on May 1 .20 And, in fact, what we' ve seen in21 steadily rising oil prices through the course  of22 the period -- of the  past year.	So, I think,23 that' s part of it.24 And the other part of it I  think25 is the heating degree days in this case were not  a2 
2 good proxy for actual consumption and  owners3 didn' t, you know, had a -- they, basically, bought4 more oil than would be indicated by heating  degree5 days -- so.6 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Freud.7 MR. FREUND:	Yes.8 MS. CRUZ:	I' d like to now direct9 your attention to another item that, I think,  the10 board needs to seriously consider this year  which11 is the minimum rent adjustment.12 I just note that the  minimum13 dollar increase for low rent apartments occupied  by14 long- term tenants was approved by the State' s15 highest court.16 However, for virtually the entire17 two years after that increase was passed by  this18 board, owners were not able to use it because  the19 challenge to that lawful increase brought by  the20 Legal Aid Society was winding itself through  the21 courts.22 How did the inability to take  that23 lawful increase for many owners because of the  --24 of the court processes, hurt owners of  rent25 stabilized buildings; if you know?2 
2 MS. FREUND:	Well, it' s an3 interesting question, Ms. Cruz.	I' m glad you asked4 it.5 I -- I think what happened --  I6 mean, there was, obviously, a lot of  confusion7 around Orders 40 and 41 which -- where a stay   was8 issued on the Order and owners could not  collect9 it.	So, you know, some owners collected some   of10 it.	Some owners didn' t collect, depending on  when11 your lease came up during that  period.12 If they did collect it,  owners13 ended up refunding it, as Nick Petras  just14 indicated, which was a complicated and a  costly15 affair. And, you know, if you didn' t do it,  you16 were potentially subject to over -- rent  overcharge17 complaints.18 But, I think, what' s most19 interesting about this is that even if  you20 collected the minimum rent increases under  Orders21 40 and 41 , you still have low rents.	I mean, we22 have a situation where you' ve got about -- you23 still have about 17 percent of the housing  stock,24 about 100 and -- more than 166 , 000 units of housing25 that rent for less than $ 800 a month. And so  these2 
2 -- these housing units renting for less than $ 800 a3 month are barely covering the operating costs,  the4 average operating costs, as calculated by the  RGB5 staff, based on RPIE data.6 So these rents, in other  words,7 started off so low that even with the  minimum8 dollar increases under Order 40 and 41 , there are9 still very low rents that still don' t sustain10 themselves, that still don' t carry their fair share11 of the building' s operating costs.12 So there is room there for  a13 minimum rent increase that -- that rent --  that14 rent increase. And I think we should understand  by15 when we say a minimum rent increase, a   minimum16 dollar increase, we' re talking just about a,17 essentially, a few dollars more than what  the18 guideline increase would be.19 So, for instance, if you had a  two20 -- end up with a two percent increase on a  $ 60021 rent, you know, it' s $ 12 so that a $ 20 minimum of22 that would add another $ 8 to the rent.	That' s, you23 know, less than the price of two frappaccinos  a24 month, basically.25 MS. CRUZ:	That' s -- that' s a2 

2	very good point.34
CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	We like soda. MS. CRUZ:	Could you just say
5 again, I didn' t -- I didn' t catch that.	How many6 apartments in the rent stabilized universe  are7 renting below $ 1 , 000 a month?8 MR. FREUND:	What I cited was9 166 , 000 apartments renting for less than $ 800 a10 month.11	MS. CRUZ:	166 , 000 , oh, below $ 80012 a month.	Okay.13 MR. FREUND:	But, you know, the14 fact of the matter is, with the median rent  of15 around $ 1 , 000 a month, many more apartments are16 very close to marginal -- marginally being able  to17 carry the operating costs of the buildings.	So18 let' s face it, you know, you' ve got a moving19 target, operating costs keep increasing.	Real20 estate taxes keep increasing each year, water  and21 sewer charges keep increasing each year.22 So your operating costs keep23 increasing so there' s always going to be a need  to24 bring up those low rent  apartments.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Jack - and that' s12 
2 operating expenses without capital infusions,3 without debt services or any sort of  special4 mandates that need to be implemented for  the5 building stock, that' s not covered by this6 operating income that' s coming from rents,7 especially room for marginally -- meeting  the8 operating expenses of the buildings, as  you9 testified.10 Anything above the stabilized11 operating profile then, of course, is a negative  to12 an owner so there' s no cushion.	So what you' re13 trying to persuade the board to do is  consider14 having a cushion for these apartments for  those15 owners.16 MR. FREUND:	It would be great,17 Mr. Schleider, if they could have  a cushion.	We' re18 just asking for them to  break even.	We' re just19 asking for these apartments to cover their  costs.20 You know, normal buildings outside of the New  York21 context run with reserves.	The City of New York22 when it subsidizes a project, sets up a   reserve23 fund for the building so they can pay  unexpected24 expenses.25 Stabilized property owners don' t2 
2 have that luxury.	They don' t have the cushion.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right.4 MR. FREUND:	So we come before5 you each year just, essentially, asking you to  keep6 owners whole just to allow them to break  even7 without that cushion.8 But, yes, in essence, you' re9 right.	There are all these costs that are  not10 accounted for in the Price Index and they  keep11 growing.	We' ve talked about the unfunded mandates.12 New man each year -- this year, backflow  prevention13 devices and oil conversions and other  matters.14 So, yeah, I mean, you need  a15 guideline that' s substantially above the Price16 Index this year, especially since the Price  Index17 is artificially low as I' ve tried to demonstrate18 based on fuel costs.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.21 MR. FREUND:	Thank you.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: Sondra Blakeney.23 MS. BLAKENEY:	Are you aware of24 the tactics that landlords are using to  increase25 their costs?	I live in a building with  1012 
2 apartments.	My heat is on even on days when  I3 don' t need it.	And on days heat is necessary,  it4 is gauged too high.	The result, higher heating5 costs, as if landlords don' t know that.6 The previous speaker spoke of not7 knowing consumption, just cost.8 Also, what incentive is there  for9 maintenance workers to not waste products, to  save10 money?	None.	My union, Local 100 Transport11 Workers, does not have a contract at this  time.12 The members are looking at a zero, zero, zero  for13 the first year in a three- year contract.	I' m14 wondering if you guys have ever thought of  zero,15 zero, zero for the next two  years.16 Just as someone has stated, there17 is no working avenue for  the owners.	We tenants18 who are not able or eligible for any subsidies,  we19 have no, none, nada, zilch way to afford  our20 increases because we are not eligible  for21 subsidies.22 I believe if rent increases  ever23 became reasonable, like one percent for the  first24 year and three percent for two years,  people25 wouldn' t have to double, triple up in an apartment2 
2 in order to afford the rent.	It means people can3 afford their own apartment which landlords  should4 love because that means more volume of  apartments5 for landlords.6 Did you guys ever take into7 account the cost of living increase for  tenants?8 Our wages do not reflect the same increases as  rent9 increases.	If you want -- if I wanted to  move,10 which I' ve lived in my apartment 24 years, but if  I11 wanted to move, I can' t --12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Blakely,13 please -- please wrap up.14 MS. BLAKENEY:	-- because I can' t15 afford the rent.	So life, liberty and the pursuit16 of happiness is not available for me because  of17 greed of persons who want more and more  from18 persons who really are not able in more ways  than19 one.20 Not for nothing, every person who21 has stood here to advocate for others, some of  you22 have chose to get personal with  that person.	They23 -- they, as I am, are here to advocate for   others.24 My question to the board, do you know the -- do   you25 know the tactics that landlords are using  to2

I23 wouldn' t know what they' re using but turning the24 heat up at inopportune times is certainly one  of25 them.12

10 mispronounce a name.11 Who will be followed by  Robert12 Luo.13 MS. ERICKSON:	Hello.	My name is14 Sandra Erickson.	I' m in the management business15 for about 30 years.16 We have a small family  business17 with my son and daughter here in the South  Bronx.18 We have about 500 units, 465 of them  are19 affordable.	So people pay less than 30 percent  of20 their income towards their rent.	Of those units,21 about 308 are less than $ 999 , between $ 500 and $ 99922 and 42 of them are less than $ 500 .23 And I' m just here to -- I want to24 say, first of all, I live in  the Bronx.	I' m on a25 local Community Board, on the housing  committee.10 
2 I' m very active in community affairs and I want  to3 say that I am here to mention the low  rent4 supplement.	Not to forget about us  affordable5 housing managers, we do -- I have rehabbed  almost6 all of my buildings so they' re beautiful and the7 tenants are very happy but I do on especially  some8 of these low rents, I would like to see some   type9 of low rent supplement.	When it was available a10 few years ago, it was helpful and that' s really11 what I' m here to say.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 MS. ERICKSON:	Thank you.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Penelope15 Josefitiz.16 MS. JOSEPHIDES:	Hi.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Hello.18 MS. JOSEPHIDES:	Good afternoon,19 board.20 Yes, as you mentioned, my name  is21 Penelope Josephides.	I' ve lived in my building for22 40 years.	I' ve never seen anything so -- policies23 so mean, that' s one thing.24 And it' s interesting while I was25 listening that one of the landlords said  his2 
2 hardship was that he couldn' t make out the hardship3 forms that they' re so arduous.	Our hardships are4 numerous.	I' m on a fixed income.	I -- my previous5 owner, the owner of the building, she had  many6 buildings, was Frances Friedman.	I' m on the upper7 east side.	I' m practically an anomaly because of8 my fixed income.	There are many, many more tenants9 moving in that are making more  money.10 However, we' re -- we' re old11 timers.	We try to keep our building.	We do have a12 new owner, the Ventura Brothers and they have  a13 mansion in New Jersey and they  have help.	My help14 that I get in my apartment is, for instance,  one,15 my toilet stopper wasn' t working. I asked --16 there' s an offsite office.	His -- his office is  in17 Queens.	He also only has a drop off box for  my18 rent which I cooperate, I walk two blocks and  I19 drop off the rent.20 However, I' ll go back to the21 repairs.	This particular owner, the Ventura22 Brothers, bought the buildings.	There were five23 buildings on 82 nd Street between York and East End.24 They were -- are now -- more -- much  better25 maintained as far as the improvements.	There' s2 
2 marble.	It looks like the Plaza if you just  walk3 in.4 But then if you walk into an  old5 apartment like mine, which I haven' t had repairs6 for many, many years -- and I was subjugated  to7 comments by my landlady like oh, you have  such8 cheap rent, you can do that yourself,  Ms.9 Josephides, and she' s passed away and may she rest10 in peace.	I didn' t have animosity with her.11 However, I did realize that under that -- with  that12 quote, I would be doing my own  repairs.13 My father had a  dilapidated14 building in the Bronx on 2093 Ryer Avenue, 183 rd15 Street.	I will go back to where now our new  owners16 have done some improvements and then they' re17 lacking also in repairs.	The stopper -- all right.18 Just very quickly, this is  one example.	The19 stopper was broken. They brought in help.	The help20 lives in the basement.	Everything is a mess.	We21 have rats.22 If there' s going to be an23 increase, really we should have some  improvements24 for an increase.	But on fixed incomes, we' re25 really intimidated.	I cannot afford an increase.2 
2 I' m just barely getting by.	And that' s -- I' m one3 but I' m legion.	There are many, many, many more4 stories beyond this.5 Town and Country in the6 neighborhood, 79 th Street, their old tenants are7 being intimidated for any type of infraction  and8 are getting eviction notices.	If you have the9 second cat, for instance, or you hoard and you  have10 to clean, you' re old and you can' t do it.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Please wrap up.12 MS. JOSEPHIDES:	Just about the13 stopper -- this is the talent that  I received.	The14 super came here, came to my apartment, put  the15 stopper out.	The handle was still broken and16 rolled with a pencil the direction that I have  to17 flush the toilet with.	There are many more18 examples but I don' t have time and I hope that  more19 people speak up for the tenants.	We cannot endure20 increases.21 Thank you.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.23 MS. CRUZ:	One question.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz.25 MS. CRUZ:	One question.2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Josefitiz,3 there' s a question for you.4 MS. CRUZ:	You indicated you are5 on a fixed income and cannot afford any  additional6 increase in your rent.7 Are you able to qualify for  SCRIE8 which would --9 MS. JOSEPHIDES:	I actually -- I10 do feel protected in that respect.	I did ask about11 that and that' s -- since that' s federally12 regulated, it is staying.	I' m keeping my fingers13 crossed that will stay.14 However, it still stands to  say15 what -- even if I can squeak by and have my   rent16 protected, I' m really just trying to speak for17 many, many other people as well.	I' m an advocate18 also for other people that are  tyrannized.19 MS. CRUZ:	I see.	So, in fact,20 you don' t -- your rent is not increased because21 you' re a -- you qualify for --22 MS. JOSEPHIDES	I' m hoping that23 stays.	My DRIE is up at the end of this year   and24 my land -- and my lease is up at the end of   the25 year.2

I' m the owner of a building in  Queens.13 I bought the building, a14 four- story walk- up in Forest Hills in 1997 and it15 has 17 stabilized and three controlled.	For 1516 years I tried all efforts to maintain the  building17 and to accommodate what the tenants ask  for.18 Of the 20 units, ten families  were19 there for over 25 years already and they  never20 leave.	They love me and they call me the best  guy21 in the world.22 For many years the cost of23 maintaining the building have been increasing  all24 the time.	In 2011 , my number two heating oil25 expenses increased, increased 29 . 6 percent from8 
2 $ 23 , 884 in 2010 to $ 30 , 954 . The water charges3 increased to 19 . 4 percent.4 If I -- I moved the first  bill5 dated January 24 th back to 2010 already.	If I keep6 the first bill, that bill in 2011 , the increase is7 89 percent.	I don' t know why.	I checked my bill8 on the water board website, I got all the  bills9 there.	I don' t know why it was like 89  percent10 higher.	But -- so I moved the one quarter, the  one11 bill back to 2010 so I come to the figure of 19 . 412 percent increase.13 Oil and utility charges are up  to14 9 . 6 percent.	This is utility plus the heating  oil15 that come to a total of $ 45 , 480 , equal to 3516 percent of total operating cost.	Taking away all17 my mortgage interest, I' m taking all the banking18 charges, the depreciation costs and other  charges19 et cetera, et cetera, so the operating costs  is20 really like net operating cost.21 And at the same time my  rental22 income dropped three percent due to vacancy  or23 whatever reasons.	And other government and many24 items like a backflow prevention devices I have  to25 pay $ 3 , 300 something.	And, also, I have to  pay2 
2 like emergency repairing at additional cost.3 I have three controlled tenants  4	for $ 181 . 68 , $ 181 . 72 , and $ 282 . 13 , all the time up5 till now.	I can hardly cover their heating  charges6 with the rent they' re paying me.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Please wrap up.8 MR. LUO:	I' m sorry.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Please wrap up.10 Your time is up.11 MR. LUO:	All right.	So -- I,12 also, one thing I want to say is I have a   good13 relation with my tenants.	One rent control lady14 who live in 4 B and her daughter approached me  when15 1 E was vacant.	She asked me, can give me  the16 apartment so I can take care of  my mother?	I say,17 okay.	Now the mother moved down from 4 B to live  in18 1 A for five years already.	So she don' t have to go19 up to 4 B again.	So I just want to say I have  a20 very good connection and relation with my  tenants.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Question?22 ( No response.)23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.24 MR. LUO:	Thank you.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is there5 
2 anybody in the room who has not registered to  speak3 who would like to speak, please see the people  at4 the table outside. Only those that have  registered,5 we have, but if you have not signed  up.6 The next speaker, Carmen Vega7 Rivera.8 Who will be followed by  Endrich9 Ernst.10 Who will be followed by  Maggie11 Silva.12 MS. VEGA- RIVERA:	My name is13 Carmen Vega- Rivera and I' ve been a resident of the14 Bronx for the last 31 years.	I moved here from15 lower Manhattan to come and work as the  Associate16 Director of the Bronx Museum of the  Arts.17 I thought I was going to  see18 change in the 31 years that I resided in   my19 apartment which is in this community.	It' s in20 walking distance from this college.	And what I' ve21 seen under the ownership of the landlord that I' m22 presently with, is that the building  has23 deteriorated to the point where, for the last  four24 years, we have not had heat.	There has been many25 HP actions.	I' ve been in court.	I' ve won many of2 
2 the court cases and yet I still remain  without3 repairs.4 There is a building- wide DCHR,5 rent reduction.	Recently we learned from this6 particular landlord that he now has changed the  LLC7 management company.	We know nothing of this8 company.	It just incorporated May 17 th.	It all9 seems smoke and mirrors.10 I' m disabled.	I' m permanently11 disabled.	So I, too, am on a  fixed income.	Have12 not received an increase for  three years.	This13 year was the first year that we received a 3 . 6 yet14 my rent increase was 6 . 75 .	So the math doesn' t15 work.16 My husband is also temporarily17 disabled.	So when you combine our income and  our18 medical needs, they exceed what we' re bringing in19 with regards to how we can afford to  live.20 That said, I am very -- a  strong21 advocate of not having an increase  at all.	And, if22 anything, a small increase if it' s necessary.	And23 I also am pushing for why a landlord, like the   one24 that I have, that is the 12 th worst landlord by  the25 New York Public Advocate, is allowed to continue  to2 
2 get and receive increases yet he fails to do any   of3 the repairs for any of the  apartments.4 There are 81 apartments.	There5 are approximately 19 that are commercial  and6 businesses, both external and internal.	No heat,7 no hot water.	HPD has been paying for the oil  for8 the last few years.	He' s unresponsive.	Doesn' t9 answer to calls, emergencies, the staff does  not10 have the workmanship, doesn' t have the ability.11 There' s no one with a license to do  the boiler.	It12 goes on.	I can actually paint a painting  about13 this.14 And I' m frustrated because my15 income is a certain amount and there' s an  increase16 that I can' t afford and yet I' m not getting17 repairs, I feel like full circle is I' m  getting18 nowhere.	So landlords should not be entitled  to19 rent increases especially if they have  HP20 violations, if they DHCR rent decreases,  their21 backs should go up against the wall and let  them22 feel it that with the rent rules that they  have23 existing right now, they should be able to do  the24 repairs.	Why get an increase and not do  the25 repairs?	The math doesn' t work for me.2 
2 Thank you.3 ( Applause.)4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.5 MS. CRUZ:	I have a question.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz.7 MS. CRUZ:	I' m very sorry to hear8 of the terrible conditions that you are  living9 under. But at the beginning of your testimony  you10 indicated that there were complaints filed at  the11 Division of Housing and Community Renewal and  that,12 in fact, there were orders issued that reduced  the13 rent, rent reduction orders; is that  right?14 MS. VEGA- RIVERA:	Yes.15 MS. CRUZ:	So then this owner that16 is not providing services to its tenants is  not17 entitled to increases under those DHCR  rent18 reduction orders.19 MS. VEGA- RIVERA:	That I' m aware20 of, but for the tenants who failed to sign  because21 they were afraid to sign, especially the  new22 immigrants where some of them are paying $ 2 , 500 to23 $ 3 , 500 for a two- bedroom apartment, they come with24 this preconceived notion that if they get  involved,25 something can happen to them and they would  lose2 
2 their apartment.	So --3 MS. CRUZ:	How --4 MS. VEGA- RIVERA:	-- out of 815 units and you have 19 or so that are commercial  or6 maybe 15 commercial and the balance of that and  you7 have lots of new immigrants.8 MS. CRUZ:	Right.9 MS. VEGA- RIVERA:	This is what10 happens.11 MS. CRUZ:	I -- I completely12 appreciate that but those tenants have legal  rights13 and they have the right to file a complaint at   DHCR14 and have their rent frozen until repairs are  made.15 In addition, you also indicated16 that you brought the landlord to court and  HP17 actions were commenced; is that right?18 MS. VEGA- RIVERA:	Yes.19 MS. CRUZ:	Were abatements granted20 to tenants that established that there  are21 conditions like lack of heat and lack of hot  water,22 those are automatic conditions for abatement.23 MS. VEGA- RIVERA:	Well, it' s24 interesting --25 MS. CRUZ:	So not only would the2 
2 rent be frozen but --3 MS. VEGA- RIVERA:	Right.4 MS. CRUZ:	-- the owner would have5 to refund --6 MS. VEGA- RIVERA:	Right.	And,7 actually, no, we have not  gotten abatements.	I8 personally have been to court many  a times.	I do9 have three DHCR rent reductions; one for no  heat,10 one for lack of repairs and I forget what the   third11 one is at the moment but the HP actions  were12 similar with regards to the repairs.	They haven' t13 been done.14 I haven' t received an abatement.15 I' ve been harassed.	I have harassment charges and16 I' ve gotten into this without asking for it.	It' s17 just been facing me all this time, especially  when18 I became disabled in 2008 and I walked back in   and19 I said, why is it that I' m not getting heat and  why20 is it that this is not getting repaired and why   do21 I have leaks?	Why do I have rats?	We' re not22 talking mice.	We' re talking huge size rodents in23 our courtyard, rodents.24 MS. CRUZ:	It' s terrible.	It' s25 absolutely horrible what you' re describing and this2 
2 particular owner should not have the entitlement  to3 increases by law because there are many,  many4 provisions in the law that would preclude him  from5 getting increases.	We do not have to not  grant6 increases or come up with more provisions to  limit7 increases when the laws already provide  penalties8 against these types of owners.9 MS. VEGA- RIVERA:	The penalties10 are not harsh.	I won a judgment on January 12 th11 for a motion of $ 7 , 400 .	The repairs still haven' t12 been done.	We -- HPD was taking him  to court.	We13 had a trial May 31 st.	He, basically, settled out14 of court for $ 3 , 500 .	If I do the math four  years15 that I' ve been without heat and hot water, all16 apartments, $ 3 , 500 was a slap on his finger, not17 even on his wrist.18 So those penalties are not harsh19 enough for him to feel it.	I feel that the20 harshness will come when he is not allowed to  have21 any increase from any tenant and is able to  prove22 and show and demonstrate that he is doing  quality23 repairs.	When you have his back up against  the24 wall and the money' s not coming in, then he' s going25 to feel that pinch in his  pocket.2 
2 Other than that, I don' t know3 which way to go because if he' s not complying  with4 the courts, he' s not complying with DHCR, he' s not5 complying with the tenant and he' s not listening to6 our request, at what point and where do we get   the7 justice and where does he get what he  deserves?8 And to me it' s hit him where the  dollar is.	As my9 father always said, your best friend is the  dollar10 in your pocket and if you don' t have it, you' re not11 going anywhere.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 Brian, do you have questions?14 MR. CHEIGH:	I mean, I' m just15 curious, I' m not too clear on the --16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Rivera,17 just another question.18 MR. CHEIGH:	Are you paying rent19 directly to the landlord still?20 MS. VEGA- RIVERA:	Excuse me?21 MR. CHEIGH:	You' re paying rent22 directly to the landlord still?23 MS. VEGA- RIVERA:	I' m still paying24 my rent but I' m paying it through my attorney.25 I' ve been evicted six times because he refuses to2 
2 do the rent so that' s why the harassment.	And3 since I' m involved with the tenants association so4 my rent has been going to  my attorney.	He doesn' t5 do the repairs, as my attorney has told him,  and6 they' ve been communicating, he doesn' t get the7 rent.8 MS. ADAMS:	Am I understanding you9 correctly that it' s really not the law against this10 but the enforcement of the law that' s causing the11 problem?12 MS. VEGA- RIVERA:	I think it' s a13 combination.	I think that the law is there  but14 when you read in between the lines of the law,  it' s15 -- people have different interpretation and  then16 it' s implementing that law, the accountability, the17 enforcement.	Those fines have to be much  more18 severe.	That $ 3 , 500 that he paid out of court on19 May 25 th -- not to appear on a trial for no  heat20 and hot water for four years -- 81 units,  whether21 you were commercial or not, demonstrates that  he22 can afford it.	That' s a drop in the bucket.23 And meanwhile I' m freezing.	I24 have tons of chronic illnesses.	I cannot afford to25 be in my apartment freezing  all year.	I' m not2 
2 getting any better.3 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.5 Endrich Ernst.6 MR. ENDRICH:	Good afternoon.7 I' m Mr. Endrich.	The fuel cost8 adjustments -- not the fuel cost, the  water9 adjustments you made, it' s not -- it' s not10 accurate.	The water increase we get, it doesn' t11 compare to the cost we have to pay for the   City.12 The other one is that the  tenants13 who vandalize their own apartment, that  the14 landlord should not be responsible for it and  the15 tenant should pay for the damage they  do.16 Thank you.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.18 Maggie Silva.19 MS. SILVA:	Good evening, ladies20 and gentlemen.	I' m so glad that all of you are21 here tonight.22 Well, my name is Maggie Silva  and23 I live in the Bronx for  44 years.	You don' t know24 the danger that I have in my building where I   live.25 I have harassments in the last  few months.	They2 
2 even send me letter, the landlord, from the  office3 because they not have to receive complaints  in4 there. And when the inspectors come in  the5 building, they don' t like it.6 Our building have about maybe 8007 violations.	And that' s a shame because we pay a8 lot of rent in there.	We have 87 unit apartment in9 there and most of them -- like studios are  paying10 $ 1 , 100 and they' re very small.	And we have -- as11 long as I live in there 44 years, first of all,   we12 have landlord that he was very good and the  office13 was located in 57 th Street.	He was very decent and14 respectful.	He used to listen and  stuff.15 Then after that he pass away  and16 we have another landlord.	Live in Brooklyn.	He17 was very good too.	Very good person.	But in 2007 ,18 the landlord pass and new company took over  the19 building and we have been struggling and  struggling20 with that building since then.	They took up the21 carpet downstairs in the lobby.	We don' t have it22 any more.	People go over there and smoke  marijuana23 and do all kind of garbage,  you imagine.	I don' t24 want to mention it because I' m so embarrassing --25 I' m so disappointed.	I' m telling you.2 
2 I live in there in the  Bronx.3 I' ve been living here for almost 50 years and  it4 has been my worst experience in here because  people5 doesn' t have respect.	They walk in there any  time,6 any hour.	They break the elevator two years  ago.7 I fell in the front elevator and I broke  three8 ligaments of my left leg and  my ankle.	I' ve been9 suffering from that.10 I' ve been mugged in there five11 times with a gun.	That' s a shame.	But it' s true12 in the name of the lord.	We had three people pass13 away.	They got killed with guns because the guy  is14 not in there.	We don' t have no guards and this15 landlord is doing nothing.	They have people in16 there they don' t do nothing for the tenants at  all.17 They say keep up calling the company and we  send18 somebody from the outside.19 The super is not helping at  all20 either and this is something very serious and  I21 appreciate that you listen and I wish you the  best.22 Do something for us because we  are23 the poor community fighting for our  right.24 Thank you so much.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.2

TORRES:	Good evening.	My11 name is Grace Torres.	I am a member of Casa  New12 Settlement Apartments and the president of  my13 tenants association at 111 East 167 th Street here14 in the Bronx.15 I' ve lived here for 33 years.16 There are 68 units in  my building.	Bloomberg17 recently declared war on super- sized soda.	What18 about declaring war on super sized rents?	How many19 of you live in rent paying apartments?	By a show20 of hands, please.	So as I thought.21 Then you can' t even imagine the22 fear that families feel every year not knowing  if23 the increases you impose will force them out  of24 their homes and into shelters.	For those that make25 it into shelters because that is not a  guarantee2 
2 either.	In a borough that had the  highest3 unemployment, an increase of any kind  would4 displace thousands of tenants.5 We are also dealing with MCI6 increases that have increased rents from $ 100 to7 $ 300 a year because there is no oversight by  the8 State regarding these capital improvement9 increases.	My landlord knows -- known as the  MCI10 king, has stated that without these MCIs he  might11 as well close up shop.12 And the names of his companies  are13 as follows:	Started out as Share Associates,14 turned into Finkelstein and Morgan, turned into  HW15 Management, and now is currently Finkelstein  and16 Tim Burger. And our rent receipts indicate that  we17 should pay our rent to  Kelly Associates.	So follow18 the trail if you can.19 This should be taken into account20 by the RGB, when making their final vote  because21 all of these factors affect how much a tenant' s22 rent can increase in a year.	There is a total23 disconnect between the City and State which  is24 escalating the homeless crisis in New York  City.25 Make no mistake, my management2 
2 company makes so much that was able to offer $ 283 million for ten buildings in the Bronx,  the4 Millbank properties, known as the Millbank5 properties, after he promised no MCIs to these  new6 tenants.	After two years he was supposed to  make7 the necessary repairs and was also touted as  a8 saviour by many politicians. He is now  hitting9 these tenants with major capital improvement10 increases that he filed for.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Torres,12 please wrap up.13 MS. TORRES:	Sure.14 Also, there needs to be a  central15 database where owners with multiple violations  and16 State imposed increases that exceed the RGB' s17 increase and the owner has a history of  filing18 multiple MCIs through displaced tenants so they  can19 take these units out of rent stabilization,  should20 be denied.21 These large owners are using the22 system to take out the remaining tenants out  of23 rent stabilization units.	There shouldn' t be any24 increases for these landlords.25 Thank you very much.2 
2Havea good evening and thank  you3for yourtime.4CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.5Chris Athineos.6Whowill be followed by Patrick7Crooks.8Whowill be followed by James9Williams.10MR.ATHINEOS:	I' ll speak down11 here.	My eyesight isn' t as good as the people up12 there.	I don' t know if I can see you  so.13 My name is Chris Athineos.	I' m a14 small property owner from Brooklyn.	Some of you15 know me - my family and I operate  several16 properties in Brooklyn and we do most of the  work17 ourselves.18 Every year I come here and  I19 testify about some great expenditure that I' ve had20 over the past year.	Last year it was the  hurricane21 and the terrible rains and the water damage that  we22 had.	This year I' m going to talk about  something23 different.24 I had a simple, what I thought  was25 a simple two- room studio apartment that became11 
2 vacant in a small seven- unit brownstone I have in3 Brooklyn. And as part of the normal turnover in  an4 apartment, we go in and we repair any wear and   tear5 things.	We repaint the whole apartment, have  it6 all cleaned and rent it.7 So when we started to paint,  I8 thought some paint was peeling so we took a   little9 closer examination and I put my finger on the   paint10 and my finger went through the wood molding  around11 the window.	And after a closer examination  we12 realized what probably is an owner' s worst13 nightmare, termites.14 So went inch by inch in  the15 apartment examining all the walls, the floors,  the16 molding, the ceilings and we started peeling  back17 all of these things in the apartment right to  the18 beams.	All the beams on the floor were eaten  by19 termites.	One beam, main beam -- these  are20 three- inch beams.	The building was built in  188521 so they' re -- you can' t even get three- inch beams22 at like a Home Depot or  a Lowes.	We had to order23 them from a special place at Dykes  Lumber.24 And we had to re- support all these25 beams and change them to replace it from all  the2 
 2 rotted termite damage.	It' s certainly, you know,3 no small job by any means.	And it certainly wasn' t4 a typical apartment turnover.5 So we basically had to  demolish6 the apartment.	They had to have an  exterminator7 come and treat all the  affected areas.	We lost8 about three months time and we had to repair  all9 this and put the apartment all  back together.	When10 all is said and done, it' s probably going to cost 11	us about $ 25 , 000 .12 Now mind you, we didn' t see any13 live termites.	This may have been from last  year14 or years ago.	But none the less, it must be  dealt15 with today.	As I' ve said over the years, older16 buildings require much more maintenance than  the17 newer buildings built with modern steel and  modern18 technology.19 This isn' t reflected in the PIOC.20 The PIOC measures an increase in the cost from  one21 year to the next but not the frequency of  repairs22 in older buildings.	It should.23 As an owner, I take  responsibility24 for the repair and I must attend to it to avoid   any25 further damage.	But the unfair part of this  is12 
2 that the RGB doesn' t compensate me for this cost.3 My income is fixed based on the tenant' s  longevity4 in the apartment.	The more years a tenant is  in5 the apartment, the lower their rent is.	Yet our6 expenses are not fixed, the sky is  the limit.	It' s7 unfair.	It' s unfair to the owner and unfair to new8 tenants moving in and paying closer to  market9 rents.	Why should anyone get a free  ride?10 If an owner -- if I, as an  owner,11 have to make the repairs, which is in my  interest,12 shouldn' t the tenant pay their fair share which13 would be in their interest as well?	We should all14 be on the same side.	We all want quality housing.15 So I' m just going to wrap up and16 recommend a longevity increase, as you have done  in17 the past, which will start to create a  more18 equitable playing field for the tenants and  the19 owners and tenants within the same  building.20 So I would recommend a $ 5021 one- year supplemental increase for apartments that22 rent for below $ 1 , 000 and $ 100 for a two- year lease23 in addition to the regular guideline  percentages.24 While it certainly won' t bring the25 below market rents comparable to those being  paid2 
2 by recent tenants, it will at least be fair  to3 everyone.4 Thank you.5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,6 Chris.7 I' m afraid to ask, what about the8 termite damage in the other  apartments?9 MR. ATHINEOS:	Well, it didn' t get10 that far but we had to go, you know, luckily   this11 was in a first- floor apartment so we went through12 the basement and had to break the whole  basement13 ceiling and change the beams and then we went  one14 -- and we ripped out the ceiling in this  apartment15 and one beam on the  ceiling.16 But, I mean, you know, in one  way17 it was good the tenant moved out because  otherwise18 who knows --19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Otherwise you20 wouldn' t have known.21 MR. ATHINEOS:	-- when we would22 have realized this damage.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Any questions?24 ( No response.)25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,2 
2Chris.3MR. ATHINEOS:	Thank you.4CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Patrick Crucks.5MR. CROOKS:	Good evening.	My6name isPatrick Crooks.7I' m the District Representative8 for Assemblywoman Naomi Rivera.	As you may know,9 she' s in Albany right now and apologizes for not10 being able to be here so I' ll be giving  this11 testimony on her behalf.12 The rising cost of rent in  New13 York City is alarming.	It is disproportionate to14 both tenant incomes and landlord expenses and it' s15 threatening to make our City inhospitable in a  way16 that is unprecedented in New York' s proud history.17 The current situation is not18 sustainable.	Rents are rising while people are19 losing jobs, having their hours cut back or  working20 at jobs that don' t pay a living rage.	The rent21 burden in New York City is  35 percent.	That is the22 highest it has ever been.23 And one- third of New Yorkers who24 live in rent stabilized apartments where we  should25 expect rents to be affordable, are spending  508 
2 percent of their total income on rent.	Shelter is3 a basic human necessity, but the tenants in  my4 district are telling me stories of having to  cut5 back on other real necessities like food  and6 medicine for themselves and their children in  order7 to keep a roof over their  heads.8 This isn' t good enough for the9 United States.	It isn' t good enough for New York10 City and it isn' t good enough for the people of  the11 Bronx.	New York must remain an affordable City  for12 all of its residents.13 I recognize that small landlord14 owners are feeling the pinch of the  economic15 climate too and I' m prepared to help them weather16 the storm as well but not on the backs of   tenants.17 The fact is that landlord profits are higher  today18 than they were in 1969 . And some purchase their19 buildings at speculative prices with the  intention20 of displacing the tenants and converting  the21 buildings to market rates or luxury  housing.22 Now some of these landlords are23 finding that they don' t have the money to pay  the24 debt service and they' re allowing conditions to25 deteriorate.	Tenants cannot be handed the  bills2 
2 for the gambles that landlords choose to  take.3 As you know, there is  another4 underlying problem that results from increasing5 rents.	With each increase rents get closer to  the6 point of no longer being rent stabilized  and7 converting to market rates.	When that happens, we8 take one more step towards making New York  City9 unaffordable since future tenants and renters  will10 not have the protection of rent stabilization  --11 excuse me, or even basic tenants  rights.12 In the last 30 years New York  City13 has lost almost 200 , 000 rent regulated units. That14 is a dangerous trend. Stable and  diverse15 communities are what make New York great.	My16 district in the Bronx is a beautiful example  of17 ethnic diversity.	Many of my neighborhoods have a18 proud tradition of welcoming immigrants from  across19 Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia  and20 Europe, among other places.21 We are enriched by these  new22 arrivals and we must remain a community  where23 residents can get a chance at the American dream  as24 nearly all of our ancestors did.	That can' t happen25 if affordable apartments are becoming an  endangered2 
2 species in the City.3 And what happens when tenants are4 priced out of their apartments?	Well, they' re5 left with very few options.	There is only 3 . 126 percent vacancy rate in New York City.	For rent7 stabilized apartments the vacancy rate is 2 . 638 percent.	As families who are priced out of  their9 apartments scramble to find a new place to  live,10 they' re torn from their schools, houses of worship11 and child care providers and this has a  socially12 destabilizing effect that hurts our communities.13 The RGB must be given the  correct14 information to make informed decisions.	In 200915 the Price of Index of Operating Costs show  that16 landlord costs had increased by 3 . 6 percent and in17 truth, provided by documents provided by  the18 landlords from the Department of Finance,  their19 costs only rose . 1 percent.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Please wrap up.21 MR. CROOKS:	I' m finishing up.22 The same thing happened in  201023 when the cost actual went up . 9 percent when  they24 reported at 5 . 5 .25 I' m calling on the RGB to demand2 
2 access to accurate data to remain mindful of  the3 responsibility all of us in New York City have  to4 make -- to find a place for all New Yorkers to   call5 home.6 Thank you.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 Mr. Schleider.9 Mr. Schleider has a question  and10 Ms. Adams.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	A couple of points12 seemed a bit confusing to me.	You' re representing13 who, precisely?14 MR. CROOKS:	Assemblywoman Naomi15 Rivera.16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Naomi.	And what17 -- what section is she from?	What district?18 MR. CROOKS:	That is in the Bronx.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And the number?20 MR. CROOKS:	Eightieth.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Eighty.22 Thank you.23 You said that the -- you  had24 mentioned that the landlords are struggling  with25 overleveraged properties; did you mention it  like2 
2that?3MR.CROOKS:	There were --4MR.SCHLEIDER:	You can refer to5the --tothetext.6MR.CROOKS:	Yes.	There were7 landlords who were having trouble making  payments8 based on speculative pricing.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	Then10 earlier in the Assemblywoman' s testimony, you said11 that there are profits that were higher than you' ve12 seen in the recorded history of RGB.	How do you13 square that up if you have landlords that  are14 struggling yet profits are high?15 MR. CROOKS:	We were going on the16 numbers provided by us by  --17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But that' s not --18 but that' s not what I meant.	How do you square19 that up?	How do you have these  seemingly20 contradictory concepts?21 MR. CHEIGH:	Steven, I think he' s22 just citing the RGB research.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I would prefer if24 the Assemblywoman' s representative --25 MR. CROOKS:	What I' m saying is,7 
2 is that the landlords are not -- are passing  the3 costs on their mistakes onto the tenants  and4 they' re still seeing their profits go up while5 they' re still claiming that they' re having trouble6 making their payments.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So they' re8 claiming.	Okay, I understand.9 Yet we have RGB reports showing10 that about ten percent or thereabouts of  housing11 stock is distressed where we actually have  expense12 burdens that are higher than  income.13 So how does that square with  the14 testimony you just gave?15 MR. CROOKS:	I don' t have that16 information on me right now so I couldn' t  answer17 off the top of my  head.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	You19 also made mention that the Assemblywoman  embraces20 the immigrant inflow into her District, which  we21 all applaud.	That' s great.	Yet we' ve had22 testimony before that -- that suggests that  the23 immigrants are paying much higher rent and they  can24 afford it.	Any discourse on that?25 MR. CROOKS:	I' m sorry, you' ll2 
2 have to repeat yourself.	I couldn' t hear you.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	I' ll start4 again.5 The Assemblywoman embraces, as we6 do, the influx of immigrants into her district  that7 she' s representing them and that' s terrific.	We' ve8 had, and according to the testimony, it seems  that9 they' re struggling and can' t meet the rent burdens10 as they come in. Yet we' ve had testimony here that11 suggests that immigrants coming in are paying  high12 rents so how does the Assemblywoman connect  those13 dots?14 MR. CROOKS:	We' re doing this15 based on conversations we' ve had with constituents16 who have come to us as a last resort saying,   that17 we cannot afford to make our rent, that we' re being18 treated unfairly by our landlords.	So we' re doing19 this based on conversations we' ve had with20 immigrant constituents who are saying that they' re21 having trouble making the rent.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	So then the23 information that the Rent Guideline Boards,  its24 staff, should bring to us are these  conversations25 or I' m confused because the Assemblywoman is2 
2 admonishing us to have accurate information.	So3 where is this accurate information supposed to  come4 from?5 MR. CROOKS:	This is from the6 Department of Finance.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	But8 these conversations that your Assemblywoman had  are9 not from the Department of Finance;  correct?10 MR. CROOKS:	Not directly, no.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Not directly.	Is12 the Assemblywoman willing to promote legislation  to13 increase funding to the RGB so that we have  the14 resources to do the right -- to do an   expanded15 survey of owners' expenses?16 MR. CROOKS:	I' m sure she would be17 willing to work with you.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	Would19 you bring that question to  her?20 MR. CROOKS:	I will bring it to21 her and I will be happy to get back to you on   that.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Adams.24 MS. ADAMS:	Yeah.	Thank you for25 your testimony.2 
2 And probably you would take these3 questions to her too because they weren' t covered4 in your testimony and two of them,  primarily.5 One of the things that we are  very6 concerned about is the lack of enforcement of  some7 things that are on the books.	And we' d be8 interested in knowing what steps she' s taking to9 bring about that enforcement or how she thinks  it10 might happen.	It' s very clear that that is a11 problem for a number of her  constituents.12 And the other would be, we  are13 very concerned about the disconnect between  the14 City and State with regard to many of  these15 regulations. And I' d be interested in knowing what16 the recommendations are and what steps she' s taking17 to bring that about.	Again, I don' t expect you to18 be able to give the answers but, perhaps, you  could19 respond in writing.20 MR. CROOKS:	Sure.	She is21 beginning a dialogue with a members of the  City22 Council, actually, this week to kind of work  on23 issues dealing with -- dealing with the  unit24 conditions in different apartments within the  City.25 And obviously it' s a major concern of hers to2 
2 ensure that there, you know, that the  housing3 conditions within the district and throughout  the4 City meet the needs of -- of the tenants and   that5 they' re getting their fair shake.6 The legislative session is ending7 at the end of this month.	However, she is going to8 make it a priority to make affordable housing  and9 quality housing a priority.10 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Brian, did you12 have something?13 MR. CHEIGH:	Could you just14 describe quickly which -- what boundaries  Assembly15 District 80 is?16 MR. CROOKS:	It includes Morris17 Park, the Pelham Parkway area and  Norwood.18 MR. CHEIGH:	And is -- is it19 mostly Latino community?20 MR. CROOKS:	It' s -- it does have21 a large Latino community.	However, it is very22 diverse.	There' s a very large Albanian population,23 Italian and really all different ethncities live  in24 that area.25 MR. CHEIGH:	Is it mostly a  rental2 
2 community or is a mix of renters and  owners?3 MR. CROOKS:	It' s a mix.4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.5 Once again, if there' s anyone in6 the room who would like to testify who has  not7 signed in outside, please do.8 Our next speaker, James Williams.9 Who will be followed by  Steve10 Wright.11 MR. WILLIAMS:	Is it all right if12 I speaker from here?13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	We need you at14 a mike.	I' m sorry.15 MR. WILLIAMS:	I' ve got a bad16 knee.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is there anyway18 we can get a mike up to  him?19 MR. WILLIAMS:	Can anybody hear20 me?	No?21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Give it your22 best shot.	How' s that?23 MR. WILLIAMS:	Give it my best24 shot?25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Give it your2 

2	best shot.34
MR. WILLIAMS:	You got it.You know, I' m from the tenement
5 apartment building 1717 Gleason Avenue ( phonetic.6 I' m James Williams.7 My interest is in deregulation and8 how it we will affect our present  rental status.	I9 live in a low income community and I am   retired,10 expecting no raise in my future  funding.11 What is the ceiling price you' re12 faced with to rent increases in a low  income13 community? And what about people of my status  and14 the elders of our community?	How could relocation15 as, you know, being asked, being requested  to,16 going to benefit us in the future, especially  when17 we return to our apartments, we will find  them18 deregulated by the landlords who never made  a19 mention of deregulation.20 And can you explain the  issuance21 of four percent per year along with the  rent22 increases from impoverished communities?23 I have two questions.	Well, two24 more.	I' d like to add that in.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m sorry -- I' m5 
2 sorry, Mr. Williams, could you repeat that  last3 question?4 MR. WILLIAMS:	My last question?5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yeah.	Yeah.6 MR. WILLIAMS:	Okay.	I said --7 and can you explain the issuance of four  percent8 per year along with the rent increases  in9 impoverished communities?10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	Got it.11 Got it.	Okay.	I understand.12 MR. WILLIAMS:	Oh, you' re good.13 Okay. thank, you, I appreciate  it.14 Now, can we be forced to  relocate15 and can we be forced into deregulation. Those  are16 my two questions?17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.18 As far as relocation is  concerned,19 you are guaranteed a lease in a rent  stabilized20 apartment.	As long as you' re paying your rent you21 cannot be moved out.22 MR. WILLIAMS:	Okay.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Well, there are24 provisions if there are -- you know, but they' re25 voluntarily moving you out.	You know, if you want2 
 2 to -- if they want to buy you out, but that is   the3 nature of rent stabilization is to protect you  and4 protect your tenancy.5 MR. WILLIAMS:	Now what about6 deregulation?7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	As far as8 deregulation is concerned, under the law  the9 apartment an deregulated either when the  rent10 reaches the deregulated limit. If you' re in11 occupancy, it' s high income, high rent. Income must12 be, what is it $ 200 , 000 now? $ 200 , 000 for the13 preceding two years and the rent has to be over 14	$ 2 , 500 , both.15 If the apartment is vacant and  the16 new rent is $ 2 , 500 , it can be deregulated.	But if17 you are in tenancy in the apartment, the income  of18 those residing in the apartment would have to  be19 over $ 200 , 000 for the two preceding years and the20 rent has to -- has to get to $ 2 , 500 .21 MR. WILLIAMS:	Do -- do I have  to22 be asked do I want this  deregulation?23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	If those24 requirements are met, no, the landlord applies  to25 the State Department of Housing Community  Renewal15 
2 and he applies to deregulate the unit.	He doesn' t3 have to ask you.	He will ask you to prove --  to4 prove your income. You have to provide  income5 proof. And if you meet that qualification of  that6 -- of that level of income for the preceding  two7 years, he applies to the State to deregulate  the8 unit.	He does not need your permission to do  it.9 MR. WILLIAMS:	Okay.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	That' s -- that' s11 the law.12 MR. WILLIAMS:	Okay.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	That' s beyond14 us.15 Okay?16 MR. WILLIAMS:	Good enough.17 Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.19 Steve Wright.20 MR. WRIGHT:	Good afternoon to21 everyone on the panel.22 I' ve been living in this building23 for the last 28 years, been married 27 years  and24 have been preaching for the last 31  years.25 I' m also involved in a building2 
2 that has been involved in a third- party transfer3 and I' m just asking questions.	They' ve come in and4 they' re saying they want to put up new walls, new5 ceilings and new floors.	But when I ask them,  no6 two persons will give me the  same answer.	I' m not7 a trouble maker but I only want the right  answer.8 They' re asking us all to leave the9 building after the whole building has been  redone10 and they say we can return two  years later.	Today11 they came to my apartment and I spoke with them   and12 I asked them, are you deregulating? And they  say,13 no.	I want to know somewhere down the line   can14 they take and can they raise  the rent?	That' s my15 first question.	All I' m asking is a few questions.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	They can raise17 the rent based on certain work that' s done in  the18 apartment which are either individual apartment19 improvements or in the building, major  capital20 improvements but they have to be approved by  the21 State.	They file with the State. You  receive22 notification that the work was done and the  State23 will grant the increases.24 MR. WRIGHT:	So, for example, if25 I' m paying $ 720 a month now, is it possible that my2 
2 rent can go up to $ 1 , 500 or $ 1 , 600 a month?3 Because they' re not -- they' re not giving me a4 definite answer.	I' m getting different answers all5 depending on who I' m speaking to.6 MR. MC LAUGHLIN:	You' ve been in7 place 20 years in your  apartment?8 MR. WRIGHT:	I' ve been in there9 for 28 years.10 MR. MC LAUGHLIN:	Twenty- eight11 years.	I mean there are programs, tax  abatement12 programs which will deregulate a unit after they' re13 out of that tax abatement program.	Generally, it' s14 on new constructed buildings in the last, you  know,15 30 or 40 years.	If you' re in an older building16 that was built well before that, then it would  not17 -- most likely not fall  under that.	It' s called a18 421 A Tax Abatement Program.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Andrew, I think20 he' s talking about --21 MR. MC LAUGHLIN:	But I' m not,22 maybe I' m --23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Your concern is24 that you' re a rent stabilized tenant.25 MR. WRIGHT:	Yes.2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	And3 you' ve been asked to leave your apartment.	You4 want to know if you can come back to this   apartment5 at the end of two years and at the rent that  you' re6 paying now.	And the reason you' re being asked to7 leave is because your building, under  this8 third- party transfer is going to be renovated, --9 MR. WRIGHT:	Yes.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- rehabilitated.11 It' s probably not safe for you to be in it  during12 this renovation as your other neighbors are  going13 to have to be asked to move so that the   renovations14 can be completed. And after this two- year cycle,15 you' re going to be invited back in.	So your16 question is, is your rent going to be the  same17 rent?18 MR. WRIGHT:	And not reflect19 market value.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I understand.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: Ms. Cruz.22 MS. CRUZ:	I don' t give legal23 advice on the board.24 MR. CHEIGH:	Regarding that, you25 have a TPT administrator assigned to you by HPD;  is2 

2	that correct?34
( No response.)MR. CHEIGH:	There is someone --
5 there' s a third party taking over your property --6 MR. WRIGHT:	Yes.7 MR. CHEIGH:	-- right?	And8 they' re supposed to be the ones contacting you and9 letting you know what your future rent could  be10 based on the repairs.	They could restructure the11 rents based on the repairs and you have to  contact12 HPD regarding what your new rent structure will  be.13 MR. WRIGHT:	I' m not a trouble14 maker but I wanted to know also -- I just want   to15 know my rights.	Do I have to leave?	Do I -- I16 mean, if I don' t --17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You have to18 leave.	It' s unsafe.	You can' t stay in the19 building.20 MR. WRIGHT:	No, I mean, can the21 tenants actually refuse to allow them to come  in22 and to do the work and -- you have  to leave?	So23 they can take legal action to move tenants out  the24 building if tenants decide not to move  out?25 MR. CHEIGH:	They can.5 

23	don' t know.45
MR. SCHLEIDER:	Don' t guess.	YouMR. MC LAUGHLIN:		We don' t know. MR. SCHLEIDER:	We don' t know the
6 particulars.	We don' t know the particulars.7 Sorry.8 We appreciate your frustration in9 not being able to get a straight answer  between10 people that you have been asking the question  of.11 This -- this is, unfortunately, this is not a   body12 that can answer those questions.	We don' t know the13 particulars and we' re not equipped to help -- help14 answer a question like that.15 MR. WRIGHT:	I thank you for your16 time and your honesty.17 Thank you.18 MS. CRUZ:	Hold on.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Question.20 MR. MC LAUGHLIN:	It should be21 Housing Preservation and Development, HPD.	They' re22 the ones that administer the third- party transfer23 program so they would know the particulars  about24 that.	So I suggest that you go to them and  ask25 them because we don' t know on this board because6 
2 it' s out of our purview.	So you need to or  I3 suggest you go to HPD and ask  them.4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Or DHCR.5 MR. SCHEINBERG: You can find it  on6 their website?7 MR. MC LAUGHLIN:	Well, there is8 -- you can go to nyc. gov and there' s a link to9 Housing Preservation and Development and or you  can10 call 311 and ask for Housing Preservation  and11 Development and get somebody on the phone and  ask12 them.	And they' re located on 100 Gold Street which13 is in downtown Manhattan so you may want to  try14 going directly there tomorrow and trying to get  an15 answer to your question.16 MR. WRIGHT:	I thank you for your17 time.18 Thank you.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.20 As of now there are no  other21 speakers who have signed in.	Is there anyone in22 the room who would like to come and  speak?23 ( No response.)24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	Then we25 will take a 10 , 15 minute adjournment and see  if2 
2 anyone else shows up.3 And I thank everyone.4 We stand adjourned.5 ( At 6 : 43 p. m., the hearing was6 temporarily recessed.)7 ( At 7 : 02 p. m. the hearing was8 resumed.)9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	We do10 have another speaker that came so we will  reconvene11 for our one speaker at this  point.12 Marina Miloradovich, did I --13 we need the mike that' s why.	I' m sorry.14 Take your time.	Relax.	We' re15 easy.16 MS. MILORADOVICH:	Yeah.	Hi.	So17 my name is Marina Miloradovich and I' m an  SRO18 tenant since 2008 --19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Could you speak20 a little closer to the  microphone.21 MS. MILORADOVICH:	Oh, sure.22 MR. MC LAUGHLIN:	You can lift23 it.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You can -- you25 can put your bag down.	We won' t take it.2 
2 MS. MILORADOVICH:	Don' t worry.3 That' s fine.	Is it okay like this?4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes.	That' s5 perfect.6 MS. MILORADOVICH:	Very good.7 So my name is Marina  Miloradovich8 and I' m an SRO tenant since 2008 . And since 2009 we9 won, three of us in our building, we won, I   believe10 what are two holdover cases against the owner,  with11 the help of a Law Project, which assisted us   in12 making sure that whatever the existing laws  are13 that they' re respected.14 And anyway, for now we won and,  I15 think, that in that -- in that time of  the16 beginning of a recovery, I really think that  rents17 shouldn' t be increased at all for that time at18 least because I know that, for instance, in  our19 building we' re struggling to pay our rent. And20 there are two units that are not SRO units  that21 are, I believe, not occupied most of the  year.22 That' s an example.23 I also heard and I don' t know if24 that' s correct, but I think I heard that in  most25 SRO larger buildings, the owners make a minimum  of2 
2 $ 300 profit per year and I don' t know if that' s3 true. And I believe that smaller SRO  buildings4 often are, have units that are -- can be rented  out5 on a market -- market -- what do you call   that,6 market --7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Market rate.8 MS. MILORADOVICH:	Yeah, rate.9 And if that' s true, just during a time like this,  I10 think, it' s nicer if the rents are not increased.11 And if there are conflicts, for instance, like  in12 our building, I mean, I' m sure people can reach13 compromises but I don' t think owners should14 purchase SRO buildings if they wanted to make  a15 huge profit.16 So that' s all I wanted to say.17 Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Where is your19 building?20 MS. MILORADOVICH:	In Harlem.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	In Harlem.	And22 how many units -- I' m sorry, how many units are  in23 building, how many SRO units?24 MS. MILORADOVICH:	SRO units, I25 believe, just the minimum that is, the  minimum2 
2 needed to classify the building as  a SRO.	I don' t3 remember what it was originally on the plan  because4 I think it has been changed from the -- meaning   it5 is still originally in reality an SRO but  there6 were changes made.	I don' t know by who within the7 time which are not registered, I  think.8 But that was -- it may have  been9 awhile back.	I don' t want to say now things that I10 don' t --11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Does your12 building have tourists using the  --13 MS. MILORADOVICH:	No.	No, no,14 no, no.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: Have any of those16 units been renovated?17 MS. MILORADOVICH:	None of that.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	None of that.19 MS. MILORADOVICH:	It' s just that20 it is an SRO building.	Some part of it was21 changed.	I don' t know when.	I don' t know if it is22 the current owner.	I don' t really believe so but23 there are market rate apartments in there that  are24 not occupied.	I mean, I can' t give every detail --25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	No, you don' t2 
2have to.3MS. MILORADOVICH: -- but Idon' t4want to say things that  are wrong.	But --5CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	We won' thold6you to them.	It' s okay.7MS. MILORADOVICH:	-- at atime8like this if you purchase, excuse me, if  you9 purchase an SRO building and, I mean, I think  it' s10 better not to increase the rents and especially  for11 buildings like this which you, I think,  that12 they' re cheaper than other buildings because they13 are SROs, as far as I  know.14 Anyway, thanks, I don' t want to15 say anything else.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	Thank you17 for coming.18 Is there anybody else in the  room19 who would like to speak?20 ( No response.)21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	We' ll22 take another ten minute break in case anybody  else23 shows up.	If no one -- if no one comes, we  will24 adjourn for the evening.25 We stand adjourned for the moment.9
