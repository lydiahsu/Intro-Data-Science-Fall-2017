2The other thing that I do want3to ment ionis that I only see these small4landlords.I never see any of the big guys  down5here.6So I mean in some cases there7	may be a probl em. I'm not a landlord. I don' t8know. There maybe a problem.	In some cases there9may not . I haveno documentat ion.10But even, let 's say, the benefit11 of the doubt , the small landlord is having a12 problem. Well , what does the tenant do? I mean we13 really have nowhere to go.14 And as I said the other day,  and15 I won' t go through the story again, and you've16 heard today, where people that have a lot  to17 contribute have had to leave the City.  This18 promotes a breakup of community, a breakup of  a19 relationship to a community, a breakup  of20 families, a breakup of friends. It doesn' t make21 for a healthy society.22 The other thing that I did  also23 want to bring up is one little story I heard  from24 a relative of mine who is in one of  those25 Mitchell - Lama' s that are going out . And one of11 
2 the t enants  - - one of the tenants had said to  the3 new owner, she says, listen, I can't afford  this4 $300 or $400 increase that you are giving me.  And5 do you know what he said to her? Well ,   move .6	And she's a working person.  She7	just works in an office .8	You know what that reminds me9 of? Let them eat cake. It 's the same type of10 mentality .11 And they have to do something12 about this.13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. ADELE BENDER :	I'm just15 going to really quote real fast from a book  that16 I read by John Grisham. He did research on this .17 So it was based on  fact .18 There are two lawyers having  a19 conversation. Becomes a street lawyer, okay?  And20 one of the lawyers says to him: "This  country,21 you got to love it ."22 New York, richest city in  the23 world , can't house its people. So they end up24 living in the streets.25 And so it offends some of  the9 
2 people walking along Fifth Avenue. This  was3 written several years ago.4 And so they elect Rudy what 's5 his face to try to clean all the places  up.6 So they pass laws: you can't  sit7 on the street , you can't l ive under the bridge,8 you can't stay here, you can't stay there.  And9 they pay lawyers to literally make being poor  a10 crime. Okay? That 's what it boils down to.11 We don' t want it to come out to12 that .13 What 's happening	is that the14 middl e class will become poor. Something has got15 to give .16 So I 'm asking you to give  the17 tenants a little breather and for once do  the18 right thing. Please freeze the rents for  now.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 MS. ADELE BENDER:	Because I21 have to tell you22 (Audience part icipat ion. )23 MS. ADELE BENDER:	I have to24 tell you one thing.25 Like they said in the movie,  we2 
2 are mad and we don't want to take it  anymore.3 Thank you.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 (Audience participat ion. )6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	James7 Anderson,  followed by Jason Haber, followed by8 Mr. Hoffman, Andrew Hoffman.9	Talk to us, Mr. Anderson.10 So far you' re behaving  yourself ,11 Mr. Anderson.12 MR . JAMES ANDERSON:	What?13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So far you've14 been behaving yourself.15 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	All the16 t ime.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All the time?18 Not all the time. But  today.19 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	I am not a20 member of the Board. I respect you because  you21 are appointed by the Mayor.22 I respect you. The Mayor23 selected. They don' t respect the Mayor, must24 respect the peopl e who elected you.25 These people who blame you,  you10 
2 must defend yourself , not to pl ead guilty. I3 defend you anyway.4	So I will bring facts, evidence5	and proof that three things rise all the  time:6 tax, fuel oil and insurance.7 I don't like. Two peopl e who8 represent  - -  tenants lie all the t ime. They don' t9 feel shame. Big deal .10 And they mention a little bill .11	They don't mention another. Mention one, then12 mention another also.13 I - - for revenge,  I mention14 Pagan - -15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No, no, no.16 No revenge.17 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	All right.18 Just to be nice. I appreciate19 it .20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good. Good.21 You need to be nice.22 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	So we live23 in the great est city, the richest city. The law24 is very strong and give chance to everybody  to25 have better life.12 
2 For that reason city become3 eight million people each year and about  seventy4 mi llion (unintelligible .) So city not bad. But5 for sick peopl e , l iberals,  also city very bad.6 And they still live here, don' t want to go New7 Jersey, Pennsylvania , which is very good there.8	So, anyway, the landlords  turn  9 over any profit , pretty strong , who is not  - -10 sold out the building or bankruptcy,	city take11 the building, who is strong still pay all  the12 expenses and all the punishment	from the city.13 Because hotel landlord  is14 guilty, is they throw garbage at tenant in  the15 front of a building , landlords  is guilty .16 So I tell them, hang up any17 landlord in the front to the fire escape.  Case18 closed. It will be very easy and nice to  make.19 And once  - - three things go up.20 If we go by the law three times, rent must go up.  2 1		But you will decide that.  I22 don' t want	your decision will be final23 decision .24 And we will continue this25 probl em probably forever.22

JASON HABER :	Thank you,21 Mr. Chairman. It's a hard act to  follow.22 I 'll read the following into the23 record. This is the testimony of  Assemblymember24 Scott Stringer.25 My name is Scott Stringer.  I9 
11602represent the 67th AssemblyDistrict in3Manhattan. Today, I am hereto call on the Rent4Guidelines Board to chart anew direction. For5 the last two years the RGB has raised  rents6 dramatically. And today my message to you  is7 simpl e, enough is enough.8 (Audience participation.)9 MR. JASON HABER:	The job of10 the RGB , as I understand  it , is to evaluate  the11 economic conditions facing both landlords  and12 tenants, and based on this analysis, to  determine13 rent adjustments for over one million  New14 Yorkers. This task, I grant you, is  daunting,15 like this hearing , but the facts do not lie. We16 face an unrelenting housing affordability  crisis17 here in the City.18 The RGB' s own report makes this19 argument better than I or anyone else  could20 possibly enunciate. Quoting from the 2005  Income21 and Affordability	Study: " real wages are falling,22 homel essness levels high, food stamp recipients23 increasing , and public assist ance levels rising24 for the first t ime since fiscal year 1993 . "25 Unlike landlords that can t ake10 
1	1612 advantage of the robust real estate market ,3 tenant incomes have declined. They fell by  1.54 percent from 2002 to 2003 and by 5 percent  from5 2001 to 2002. In 1970 , the average tenant paid6 twenty percent of their income to rent.  Today7 that number has soared to 28 percent .8	Dwindling economic resources9 present tenants with few options. But today  you10 have the power to change that. Today you can  help11 make tenants keep their rents  affordable.12 Make no mistake about it. A  rent13 increase , any rent increase, this year is14 uncall ed for, unjust ified and unwarranted.	I call15 on the RGB to freeze rents at their  current16 levels and to do so immediately.17 These trends we see today  are18 sobering. And make no mistake about it , there is19 an affordabl e housing crisis here in our City.20 The RGB has a unique21 opportunity. Rather than increase rents, as it  is22 assumed you will do, let 's do something else.23 Let 's increase the opportunity for affordability24 in this City. Let ' s make New York a place   where25 all can live , work and play, and let ' s keep  the9 
2	rents affordable.3	Furthermore, there are some4 things we disagree on. But here are two things  we5 should all agree on.6	First , we should allow the City7 to have greater control over its own  housing8 policies. Let 's do that now.9	(Audience participation.)10 MR. JASON HABER:	Let 's return11 home rule to New York City and let 's have members12 of the RGB conf irmed by the City Council. This13 will allow for an open and healthier  policymaking14 process.15 Thank you for listening to what16 I've said here today. Make the right  decision.17 Freeze rents and keep affordabl e housing alive in18 New York City.19 (Audience part icipation. )20 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Thank you.21 There' s a question for you.22 MR. JASON HABER:	Thank you.23 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you for your24 test imony.25 Would you also share with  us10 
1	1632	what  Assemblyman,  that you represent	- -3 MR. JASON HABER:	Stringer.4 MS. ADAMS - - Stringer - - I'm one5	of his constituents.6	CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	That ' s your,7	right , Assemblyman.8	MS. ADAMS:	Would you share with9 us what he' s done to increase the supply of low-10 income housing in the City?11 MR. JASON HABER:	Sure. I'd be12 happy to.13 First of all , as you know, Scott14 is a member of the New York State Assembly  where15 there does seem to be a sense of  perpetual16 gridlock in Albany, although this year we  did17 pass a budget  on time for the first time  - -18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So much so19 that he' s trying to get out ; right?20 MR.  JASON HABER :	What ' s that?21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So much so22 that he' s trying to get out .2 3	MR. JASON HABER:	Well , next24 week is the last week of session. That 's all I'll25 say about that .24 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is he running3 for Borough President?4	MR . JASON HABER:	He is, but we5 can talk about that at a later date , not today6 though.7 But he' s done - - Assemblyman8 Stringer has introduced several  bills.9	First , to expand  SCRIE. We10 talked about the disability issue. It came  up11 earlier today. He' s on that bill which woul d12 expand SCRIE to the disabled and also raise  the13 cap of SCRIE.14 He' s also supported low- income15 housing initiat ives up in Albany.16 We would be happy to provide  the17 Board with copies of those bills, which I don' t18 have on me now.19 But we have introduced bills in 20	the Legislature on this very  issue.21 MS . ADAMS:	How many of those22 have been passed?23 MR. JASON HABER:	If we could24 change  the Governor,  I might  add , that would25 probably be helpful too .21 
1	1652	(Audience participation. )3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any4 addit ional quest ions?5 (No response. )6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,7	Mr. Haber .8	MR. JASON HABER:	Thank you,9	Mr. Markus.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Andrew11 Hoffman, followed by Susanne Schropp, followed  by12 Lydia Horiguchi.13 MR . ANDREW HOFFMAN:	My name is14 Andrew  Hoffman.  I 'm the Chairman of the  Community15 Housing Improvement Program, a property  owners'16 advocacy group. And I 'm the owner/operator of17 rent regulated housing in New York  City.18 And thank you for the19 opportunity to address the Board on behalf of  my20 membership, which consists mainly of mid - sized21 property owners, such as myself , who are hands-22 on owners of real estate.23 Our expenses continue to24 skyrocket . This year' s increases, while not as25 high as last year, continue to  increase.10 
2 Operating rent regulated property in New York  has3 become more problematic this year than any  other4 year.5	Fuel prices remain high, real6 estate taxes are going up, labor increases  are7 substant ial this year primarily due to the8 increased health benefits for our employees.  And9 this year marked a dramatic change in the  way10 lead paint is dealt with in our  apartments.11 As you have heard previous  to12 today, and I'm sure you'll hear many t imes in the13 evening, Local Law #1 has caused a  dramatic14 increase in expenses that are not shown in  the15 PIOC.16 What makes mat ters worse is the17 continual bombardment	in the press about the18 increase in real estate prices and that co- ops19 are selling at astronomical numbers and  apartment20 buildings are flipping.21 This is true if you bought  or22 sold property. It 's not true for owners such as23 myself who are going to come here today  to24 test ify who aren' t selling and aren' t reaping the25 prof its.6 
2 (Audience participat ion.)3 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	They are4 the owners who are sticking with their  rent5 regulated property and they are eking  their6 dwindling prof its.7	A perfect example is a sixty-8 unit building I own on 89th between Madison  and9 Fifth. Seventy percent of the apartments are  rent10 regulated , thirty percent are decontrolled. But11 of that , forty- two percent of the revenue is12 generated by seventy percent of the  apartments.13 The rest is generated by my seventeen deregulat ed14 apartments.15 Last year my rent roll went up16 $55, 000, $30 , 000 from the  stabilized apartments,17 $25, 000 from the deregulated apartments, because18 the deregulat ed apartments aren' t going up as19 fast . They are actually, those prices are going20 down. They are.21 I had  - - last year alone my real22 estate taxes increased by $12 , 000, my labor by23 $11, 000, my fuel by $7, 000, and my water and24 sewer by $3 , 000.25 Additionally,	I had two vacant8 
2 apartments. I had to spend $8 , 000 in lead paint3 law compliance because of these two  vacant4 apartments, mainly due to, just to remediate  the5 lead paint . Additionally, due to the time it cost6 me to remediate the lead paint , I lost $30,000 in7 lost rent . It was a few months to do this work.8 (Audience participat ion.)9 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	It turns10 out I only did these two apartments for  people11 who didn' t have children but according to Local12 Law #1 I had to spend that money  anyway.13 As you can see, my  $55,00014 increase did not go very far this year.  And15 that 's not even considering all the other16 expenses that went up this past  year.17 And I took a look at all  my18 speeches from the previous years. I've testif ied19 now for fifteen years at the Rent  Guidelines2 0	Board. Every year we talk about fuel going up   one21 year, insurance going up another year,  this,22 that. Every year something is going up. The  PIOC23 goes up every year. The PIOC continues to  rise,24 but we don' t get our rent increases commensurate25 with the PIOC.21 
2 This year we all read in the3 papers that it 's an election year. The Rent4 Guidelines Board is apt to approve low  increases.5 The Rent Guidelines Board must6 transcend pol itics when it comes to rental7 housing in this City. The only thing that  will8 happen with low rent increases is owners, such  as9 myself , will sell their properties at extremely10 astronomical levels.11 And if I sell my property,  the12 person buying my property to going to co- op the13 building. And we don' t want that to happen.14 I want to stay as a rental15 owner. Help me to stay as a rental owner  by16 giving us appropriat e rent increases.17 Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 MR. PAGAN:	Question.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Pagan has21 a question.22 MR. PAGAN:	Just for my23 information, you indicated that thirty percent  or24 seventeen apartments have been  decontrolled.25 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	Yes, sir.2 
1	1702	MR. PAGAN:	When were they3	decontrolled?4	MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	Well ,5 since the Rent Reformat ion Act of 1988, they6 became decontrolled because of  vacancy.7	I don't have one apartment  in8 that building that became decontrolled due  to9 luxury deregulation because none of my  rent10 stabilized apartments are anywhere close  to11 $2000. My average rent for a  two-bedroom12 apartment just of f Fifth Avenue is $1400 for a13 two- bedroom on Fifth Avenue.14 MR. PAGAN:	What 's the highest?15 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	Sorry?16 MR. PAGAN:	On the controlled17 apartments, what 's the highest rent?18 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	My highest19 rent is about $1400 for a two- bedroom.20 MR. PAGAN:	On the stabil ized21 apartments?2 2	MR . ANDREW HOFFMAN :	Yes.2 3	MR. PAGAN:	Okay. Thank you.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any other25 quest ions?24 
2 Thank you.3 There' s a question.4 Do you have any vacancies? He' s5 looking for an apartment.6	MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	For you I7	could work something out.8CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thanks.9(Audience participation. )10CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	It ' s a joke.11It 's a joke.12MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.13CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Susanne14Schropp.15MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.16CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oh, sorry.17There' s a question. Sorry, Mr.18Hoffman.19Mr. Anderson, you need to  keep20quiet.21MS. HOLDER:	On your deregulated22units, how muchdoes a two- bedroom go for?23MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	About24$4,000.25MS. HOLDER:	$4,000.
2 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	And the3 probl em being , as I said earlier,  the increase  -4 - when I have  a $4000 apartment  that  becomes5 availabl e for rent , either on renewal or on6 vacancy, that 's all I'm going to get because7 that ' s market . So what am I going to ask for?8 Another hundred dollars? On a percentage  basis9 that 's nothing.10 So I somet imes this year had to11 lower my non- stabilized apartments.12 You know, people  - -  the market13 up in that part of Manhattan is a little  soft14 right now. Everybody sees that. You know,  when15 you're up to market , you are not get t ing16 increases if you don' t want to have that17 apartment vacant.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 Susanne Schropp. Wel come back.20 Followed by Lydia Horiguchi ,21 then Dawn Sullivan.22 Go ahead.2 3	MS. SUZI SCHROPP:	Good24 afternoon.25 My name is Suzi Schropp. I 'm  a24 
2 member of the Shalom Tenants Alliance and am  here3 today to report on record the abuse and  the4 harassment of rent regulat ed tenants and to give5 you a glimpse, a small glimpse, into the  future6 of rent ing in New York City.7 Since the passing of luxury8 decontrol , landlords have been racing to reach9 the magic barrier of $2000. The Rent  Guidelines10 Board has contributed great ly in helping11 landlords reaching their goals.12 For the past  three years - - are13 you l istening, Mr. Markus? Thank you.14 For the past three years the15 tenants of the Shalom Tenants Alliance  have16 documented harassment patterns across close to  a17 hundred buildings owned and operated by  the18 Ohemshalom Family, also known as Shalom.  Their19 tactics range from drastic decreases in  service20 and neglect to the point of deterioration of  the21 buil dings over frequent basel ess litigation to22 endangerment of tenants' health and  safety.23 The Shaloms have a pattern  of24 conduct ing construction without permits and tend25 to take zoning laws into their own  hands.2 
2 One Shalom building at 188  East3 93rd Street has been without secondary means  of4 egress for about a month now.5 8 St. Mark' s Place underwent two6 attempts of illegal conversions from  residential7 spaces to commercial.8 At 2182 Barnes Avenue a  tenant9 battl ing breast cancer comes home to no heat or10 hot water for weeks at a time. The Shaloms  and11 their staff have called her secure job and  almost12 got her fired.13 At 253 East 77th Street  two14 stories have been added to the building  without15 proper permits and  despite violations.	In the16 process ventilation tracts that used to  lead17 through the building to the roof have been  closed18 up. That 's, of course, causing mold problems.19 The Shaloms have tenants  sign20 illegal mold riders as a condition of  their21 renewal leases, making them solely  responsible22 for any mold in their apartments. And  I've23 attached the rider.24 On 222 Sullivan Street , an25 apartment  was  converted  into a restaurant . After2 
 2 having invested most of his life savings into  the3 restaurant , the restaurant owner had to vacate4 the space and lost $150, 000 in the process.5 The Shaloms are very  successful .6 Within the first two years they managed to  rid7 forty to a hundred percent of the buildings  of8 their rent regulated tenants, already  small9 apartments  - -  and they convert  already small10 apartment s into mult iple bedrooms which means11 one-bedrooms become two- bedrooms and rent for 12	$4000.13 So that 's how landlords increase14 their rent rolls.15 And the New York City market  can16 hold a lot. It 's very special that way. There is17 hardly any urban area in the United States with  a18 greater housing shortage. The worst thing is  that19 market rate tenants are given poor conditions as 20	well . They pay top dollars and if they complain,21 they can rest assured that their leases will  not22 be renewed. They have almost no recourse  in23 preserving  their rights.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to25 wrap up .21 
1	1762	MS . SUZI SCHROPP :	Landlords -3	-  I'm almost done.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.5	MS . SUZI SCHROPP:	Landlords  6 are increasing the amount of bedrooms in  the7 apartments. At 231 East 14th Street large  one-8 bedrooms are converted into four-bedrooms.  And9 this goes on and on. I'm just going to cut to  the10 chase.11 There are other landlords  like12 that . Of course, we know that . The Cromans , the13 Economakises and many more.14 Unfortunately,	it casts a shadow15 on decent landlords but , as they say, it only16 takes one bad apple to spoil a bunch. As far  as17 I 'm  concerned , landlords on a large scale do  not18 deserve increases .19 In my testimony in Brooklyn two 20	days ago I asked the Rent Guidelines Board  to21 stop viewing tenants as game pieces. Today I  ask22 you to level the playing  field.23 Every year owners request24 ridiculously high increases and the  tenant25 members request zero . After the traditional21 
2debate - -3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:You need to4wrap up.5MS. SUZI SCHROPP:- - the Board6meets - -7I'm almost done.8- - the Board meets- - I have one9more sentence.10CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:Go ahead.11MS. SUZI SCHROPP:This year I12 would like the tenant members to request a  minus13 4 to minus 6 percent increase on one -year leases14 and a minus 7.5 to a minus 9 percent increase  on15 two-year leases.16 Maybe this year we can meet  in17 the middle at zero percent.18 And I also invite each and19 everyone of you to attend the Shalom   - -20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It 's a run-21 on sentence.22 MS. SUZI SCHROPP:	tenants'23 monthly meeting  and really learn about what  ' s24 really going on.25 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Thank you.12 
2	(Audience participat ion. )3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Lydia4 Horiguchi , followed by Dawn Sullivan, followed by5 Nick Petras.6 MS. LYDIA HORIGUCHI:	H ,  I7 My name is Lydia Horiguchi and  I8 thank you for your time.9 I own a brownstone on the Upper10 East Side of Manhattan.	I manage my own building.11 I do everything for it as my husband passed  away12 several years ago.13 Every year expenses increase.  My14 rents cannot cover the cost of operat ing my15 building.  For exampl e , if we  increase 3 percent ,16 I have rents $450. So $13 .50 more for me.17 My taxes go up , my insurance,18 repairs, and it 's becoming more and more19 di fficult for me to maintain my building.20 I'm asking the Board Members21 here today to try and understand the problems  of22 the small business	the small owners of the23 buildings.24 Thank you very much for  your25 t ime .8

LYDIA HORIGUCHI:	I have10 five units and I have rent controlled in  there.11 Three are stabilized rents and I also have  rent12 control. So like $172 a month I get for one  of13 the apartments.14CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	You have five15units includingyour own or - -16MS.

2 So have all your tenants  - - how3 long have all your tenants been in the  building?4	MS.  LYDIA HORIGUCHI :	Well ,5 since I have the building. So we say ten  years.6 MS. HOLDER:	Okay. So you7 haven' t had any room where people have left the8 building?9	MS. LYDIA HORIGUCHI :	No . No10 one has left .11 MS.

LYDIA HORIGUCHI:	Between20 
2First and York.3CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	A good deal .4Okay. Thank you.5MS. LYDIA HORIGUCHI :	Thank6you.7CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Dawn8Sull ivan.9MS. DAWN SULLIVAN:	I'm Dawn10 Sullivan. I represent tenants on the East Side  of11 Manhattan.12 And I wish I knew about  this13 building earlier because I would have sent peopl e14 to put them on a mailing list .15 I 've been coming here  for many,16 many years. Today I'm here against my doctor' s17 orders and I don' t know if I 'm a  cockeyed18 opt imist or a masochist because every year I come19 and I say the same things: consider  the20 affordability  factor for tenants.21 In my building the average22 tenant has been there since the building opened ,23 is paying well over $1000. They' re paying $1200,24 $1500 a month.25 There was a young lady and  her10 
2 husband expect ing a baby and they wanted to move3 from a studio to a one - bedroom  on their floor.4 They went to management and they said they  would5 like to move up.6	And he said: " Great , you can7	have it . It will be $2200. 118	She said , "Wait a minute. I know9	the man who is in there, he was paying $1050. 1110 And he said,  11  That 1    s all right.11 We I    re making  improvements. 1112 " But  you made improvements13 before he moved  in. 1114 He said , "You don' t get it , do15 you? We are going to do what we have to do to  get16 the rent over $2000. 1117 In my building the deregulated18 apartment never goes for less than $3000.  They19 are going for $5000.20 I've been counselling tenants21 for many, many years on the phone and I  was22 taking care of the disabled, seniors on  fixed23 incomes and widows.24 Well , my husband  died recently. 2 5	So I am now a disabled , senior citizen on   a10 
2 limited income. So all the people I've  been3 speaking for all these years I 've now joined the4 ranks.5 You have to consider what  goes6 on in these buildings. The percentages you  give7 to tenants whose rents are over $1000 is  a8 dramatic amount . It 's like $90 a month or9 something . That 's a lot of food. That 's a lot of10 prescriptions.11 And we have to - - at the  very12 minimum you've got to freeze rents over  $100013 because those stabilized tenants are hanging  on14 by their teeth.15 We don't get any affordabl e16 housing built that 's going to remain affordable17 housing. We give developers subsidies, but  ten18 years after they' re built , they go to market.   I19 mean it 's ridiculous.20 Now the 80/20 buildings are21 telling their tenants they' re going to market.22 I have been saying enough  is23 enough for a long time. And I have to tell  you24 that 's my theme today. Enough is enough. We've25 had enough increases. For those people  whose2 
2 leases are up this year they already paid  seven3 percent two years ago. Give us a break.  Consider4 what it ' s like for us.5 We don' t have hardship. We6 cannot file a hardship appl ication if we can't7 afford our apartment .8	Owners, like this lady with  the9 brownstone,	she could open her books and  file10 hardship and get an increase . She' s guaranteed a11 8.5 percent profit with rent stabilized  tenants.12 I had rent controlled tenants who were  paying13 $2200 a month, rent controlled.14 So, you know, please consider15 what we' re going through.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 Quest ion.18 (Audience participation.)19 MR. PAGAN:	Thank you for your20 test imony.21 You said something that I  don't22 remember hearing before. You said that before  you23 and your husband were paying for the rent and  he24 died and now you have a lower income .25 What was the income before  and9 
2	what is the income now?3	MS. DAWN SULLIVAN:	That' s what4 - -  I'm still trying to get his Social Security.  I5 haven' t got it yet . So I'm still waiting to get6 that .7	It's going to be pathetic. I'm8 going to have  - - until  I get the apartment9 changed around , at some point I'm going to have10 to get a boarder to pay the rent because  his11 Social Security and the little tiny pension  he12 had - and I mean tiny, like a $140  something13 dollars, it 's ridiculous.14 I'm going to be - - life15 insurance is going to be subsidizing my rent.  And16 when that runs out or runs down, then I'm  going17 to have to take in a boarder for the  second18 bedroom. Absolutely.19 MR. PAGAN:	And is that20 something that you're seeing in your building,  of21 people who are dropping in income because one  of22 the spouses passes away?2 3	MS. DAWN SULLIVAN:	You have no24 idea how many calls I get from desperate  seniors.25 There was a meeting  - - I think it was the  Shalom24 
2	tenants' meet ing, I'm not quite sure, or if it3	was the Rent Guidelines Board meeting	there4 was a woman who has been very active in  my5 community . If you went to a precinct council6 meeting, of which I'm on the board, or you  went7 to a community board #8 meeting, she'd be  there.8 Well , guess what?  She was there9 wi th a group of homeless people . She is now10 homeless.11	And this is what ' s happening.12 When every t ime we do a mailing, we get back a13 stack that big of returns. They' re not moving to14 the Bronx and Brooklyn . They' re moving out of15 State . They' re going with their kids in other16 states.17 And we need those people  because18 many of them are activists who have kept  the19 stability in our neighborhoods.20 (Audience participat ion.)21 MR . PAGAN:	And one final not e.22 Since your husband passed  away,23 has your rent increased?24 MS. DAWN SULLIVAN:	I just had25 a rent increase before he went . It ' s $1220  right12 
1	1872 now, and MCis . We 1   re fight ing three MCis.  We won3 on the windows. DHCR came back and said , oh, you4 won on the windows, but now we are  reconsidering5 charging you for the windows because the  owner6 said he made some adjustments. This  is7 ridiculous .8	And when you rent , as I said,9 whatever it is over a $1000 , any percentage is10 monumental .11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 (Audience participation .)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Nick Petras,14 followed by Larry Wood , followed by Mary McCune.15 Nick Petras.16 MR. NICK PETRAS:	My name is17 Nick Petras, Jr. and I 1  m represent ing my family 1   s18 interests.19 Among other things, we  own20 several hundred rent stabilized apartments,  about21 ninety percent of which are in Queens  County.22 My dad bought his first building23 in 1959 and I 1  ve been in charge of the day- to-24 day operat ions of our real estate business for 25	about ten years.12 
2	I know that many landlords have3 been discussing surging costs for insurance,  real4 estate taxes and energy. But I have come  to5 testify about something else, the long - term6 tenant  discount .7 " Time After Time, " that ' s one,89	A VOICE:	Discount?10 MR. NICK PETRAS:	Long - term11 tenant discount.12 Time after time, that 's one, we13 landlords come here to ask about relief from  the14 long- term tenant discount and time after t ime the15 Board does nothing, perhaps due to the howls  of16 poor tax by tenant leaders. I 'm asking for a17 " Change of Heart , " number two, from the Board.18 I think everyone in New York19 knows the longer a tenant has been in a  rent20 regulat ed apartment ,  the better  the deal the21 tenant most likely has.	And the savvyer owners22 of New York apartments know that the lowest  rents23 in a building belong to long - t ime rent24 stabilized , not rent - controlled , tenants.25 In 1981, we purchased a 48-unit10 
1	1892 bui lding on 29th Street in Astoria consisting3 mostly of one- bedroom apartments. The average4 rent in this building as of  this morning	is5 $798. 00. Last year' s operating cost including6 real estate taxes of each apartment was $378. 00.7 That number does not include reserves  and8 replacements.9 When my dad bought  the building ,10 the tenants were attempt ing to get a 7A11 Administrator  appointed and were conduct ing a12 rent strike. Well , I guess the striking tenants13 got the well - run building they wanted. More than14 one - third , 17 of 47 rented apartments, of the15 tenants who live in the building have been  there16 for twenty years or more. This number  includes17 only three rent controlled  tenants.18 Average  rent for these long -19 term rent stabilized tenants is $580. 05. The20 average rent for the three rent controll ed21 tenants is actually higher.22 Considering our cost of debt  and23 our cost of equity, these tenants don' t cover24 their proport ionate cost of running the building.25 And it should be noted that two of these  long-2 
1	1902 term tenants have Florida condos which are  not3 their primary residences, and one is - and I  hope4 he' s not here because of not to tip him off -5 actually lives on Long Island. He' ll get his6 Gollub not ice with the next renewal cycle offer.7 Now some will say that we  make8 up for the long- term tenant discount on vacancy.9 I 'm no longer so sure that this is the   case.10 We caught one SCRIE tenant11 illegally subletting her apartment . That is, her12 "True Colors, " that 's number  three, showed her to13 be a prof iteer, not a little old lady. She lives14 out - of - state and , caught red - handed, surrendered15 the apartment without much of a  fight.16 The problem is that the17 Department for the Aging is reevaluating  her18 benef its and they may rescind some of the SCRIE19 that they compensated us for. I'm going to  have20 fun trying to collect that money in Florida.  I21 don' t count on gett ing it.22 Finally, we have been asking  for23 between $1050 and $1100 for a vacant  one-bedroom24 apartment in Astoria for about five years  now.25 When an apartment that was rented in the  past2 
1	1912 several years is re- rented, we get very little3 increase and sometimes get a decrease. And  note4 that market rate apartments tend to turn  over5 more frequently - tenants not locked into  a6 deal - and are on the market for a longer  period7 of time for renting.8 "Money  Changes Everything. " A9 longevity increase of six percent or more  for10 tenants in possession ten years or more will  help11 these tenants pay more of their fair share of  the12 costs. This would be about $36 a month for any  of13 my 29th Street tenants.14 Also, it will balance out  the15 increases that the market , not the rent16 stabilization	- - also, the market , not the rent17 stabilization regime will prevent me  from18 obtaining two or three apartments in - -  I  won' t19 be compensated for the  vacancies.20 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Thank you.21 (Audience participation. )22 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	We have some23 quest ions.24 MR. ZELNIK:	I just have one25 simple quest ion.2 
1	1922 Obviously, you haven' t been3 happy with the increases over recent years  and4 you are particularly concerned about the long -5 term tenant discount.6	I'm just curious, with 700 units7	that you and your family have operated for  twenty89	MR. NICK PETRAS:	Several10	hundred.11	MR. ZELNIK:	Several hundred.12 - - to what extent have  these13 insuff icient increases affected your quality of14 l ife in living?15 (Audience participation. )16 MR. NICK PETRAS:	I've actually17 never been to Switzerland. They don' t affect my18 quality of life , but they do affect my investment19 decisions.20 We have for the most part  been21 concentrating on buying stores as we expand.  We22 bought some rent stabilized apartments, but  it23 was sort of a strange year, only  fourteen24 apartments, two years ago. But for the most  part25 we are pursuing  other investments. We ' re not12 
1	1932	pursuing rental apartments in New  York.3	And that' s not a good thing. I4 know I 'm the bad guy to all of these people back5 here. But that 's not a good thing.6 (Audience part icipation.)7 MS. HOLDER :	I have  a question.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Go9	ahead.10 MS. HOLDER:	I think because you11 were concerned about your time , you rushed12 through some testimony and I didn' t understand13 what you said.14 You said that , I guess or what  I15 heard , was that with your unregulated apartments16 you had more turnover.17 MR. NICK PETRAS:	The ones at18 market turn over more quickly.  Absolutely.19 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.20 So is that an argument  for - - I21 don' t under  your argument . You' re saying they22 turn over more  quickly but you can't realize   - -2 3	MR. NICK PETRAS:	Meaning your24 vacancy loss on the higher apartments is  higher25 as a cost than your vacancy loss on  lower24 
1	1942	apartments.3	It 's the argument here that , for4 example , you say, oh, that  there' s a huge  housing5 shortage in New York because the vacancy  rate6 found by the Housing Vacancy Survey is  three7 percent.8 Well , if I rented all of  the9 apartments in the City of New York for a  dollar,10 your vacancy rate would be zero of course.  If11 they went to market , market probably clears 5.512 percent vacancy rate, 4.5 percent vacancy  rate.13 MS. HOLDER:	And how much is14 your average apartment going for,  your15 deregulated apartment?16 MR. NICK PETRAS:	There are no17 deregulat ed apartments in this building.	I said18 market rate apartments. The market  is Astoria	is19 about $1100 for a one- bedroom apartment in an20 elevator building.21 MS. HOLDER:	And what percentage22 of your apartments are you able to get the  market23 rate?24 MR. NICK PETRAS:	In that25 building? Maybe four or  five.4 
1	1952 MS . HOLDER :	Okay.3 And how many units do you  own4 with your family?5	MR. NICK PETRAS :	About 500 .6	MS . HOLDER:	500.7 And what percent age of those 5008 units are deregulat ed?9	MR . NICK PETRAS:	One .10	MS. HOLDER:	One percent or - -11	MR . NICK PETRAS:	We own mostly12 Queens .13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider14 has a question.15 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you, Mr .16 Petras, for your testimony.17 Your family has been in rent18 stabilized	- - has owned  rent  stabilized property19 for forty- five years now? Is that what I hear? 20		MR . NICK PETRAS:	Yes.21 A VOICE:	Longevity.22 MR . SCHLEIDER :	And  there are23 other  - - yes, longevity, which  is very  important .24 And there are other families  25	that own rent stabilized buildings for  thirty,21 
2	forty, fifty years also?3	MR. NICK PETRAS:	Among my4 landlord friends I think we' re actually5 newcomers.6	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay .7	So there is a tremendous8 stability here in ownership, tremendous  stability9 here in maintaining	rental stock that you are10 seeing as being challenged right now with  the11 rate of expense increases and the lack of  rent12 regulated increases that you are able to  attract?13 MR. NICK PETRAS:	I would think14 so, yes .15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So how do you16 see the solut ion? How do you see us helping you17 to maintain your tenancy base - you have  a18 stabilized property - so you're not scrambl ing19 for this last dollar, so you're not trying to  re-20 rent your $1100 units at21 MR . NICK PETRAS :	Well , I 've22 contended , and I know that some of the studies23 have shown, that if everything were deregulat ed -24 and I know that you don' t have the power to do25 that - that market asking prices would  actually8 
1	1972 go down maybe ten/twenty percent.3 (Audience part icipation.)4	MR. NICK PETRAS:	I think that5 the more you bring up the very long- term tenants,6 the less pressure there will be on higher  rent7 apartments.8 And you could say that  some9 peopl e will  say, you know what  - - my guy who10 lives on Long Island , for example, he' s holding11 onto an apartment that I think he' s paying $550 a12 month for. And he' s l iving out in Long Island. As13 far as we can tell , he might be spending a couple14 of days a week  there , maybe  actually  four days a15 month.16 That apartment would be  freed17 up. And if his rent kept going up , he' d come to a18 point where he would  say it ' s not worth  it for me19 to try to pull the wool over the landlord' s eyes.20 And that apartment would be21 freed up and it would be rented , you know, close22 to market rent.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank24 you.25 (Audience part icipation.)5 
2 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Larry Wood ,3 followed by Mary McCune, followed by Jean  Grillo.4	MR. LARRY WOOD:	Good5 afternoon.6 I guess I want to start just  by7 thanking the members because I know this  is8 largely a thankless task.9 I know many folks are very10 cynical about this process and they think the  fix11 is in, you know, a decision has been made  before12 you have even heard the testimony.13 But I know that ' s not - -14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You know what15 the decision is?16 MR. LARRY WOOD:	I know that 's17 not true. Let me finish. If you could let me  talk18 without interrupting  I would appreciate  it ,  Mr.19 Chair.20 I know that 's not true because I21 know there is an intense debate that goes on22 where the two reps try to get an agreement  with23 three of those public members, and the same  goes24 wi th the tenant reps. There is a real25 deliberation that goes on.5 
1	1992 I worked at the SRO Law Project3 from '87 through	'95 and I know that you did4 consider the  - -  I know your predecessors  and you5 have listened and responded to the plight of  SRO6 tenants over the years and know that the  rent7 increases that they would have had to pay  would8 have a real hardship for many of those  tenants.9 And  it ' s not just that you were10 l istening to the plight of the tenants. You also11 were looking at the pract ices in the industry.12 And you've listened to the testimony of the  staff13 at the Law Project as well as the  tenants14 themselves.15 And the pract ices of the16 industry, those landlords are making more  than17 adequate returns. You recognized that one  size18 didn' t fit all because in different years you19 said SRO landlords who have seventy- five percent20 or more regulated tenants, they' ll get the rent21 increase. Other years, you know, with  those22 provisos, with those restrictions  in place ,   those23 landlords who had signif icant deregulat ion and24 were making, again, more than an adequate  return,25 they didn' t get the rent increase.2 
1	200  2 And I 've always been puzzl ed why3 you haven' t taken, you know, different iated among4 some of the apartment situat ions as well.5 Clearly they weren' t warranted6 for the SRO owners who were making a big  killing.7 And I urge you to listen to the SRO tenants  and8 kind of pull out their  testimony.9 I 'm  kind of very disappoint ed10 that they are mixed in with everybody else.  But11 you' re going to learn about the transient12 rentals, the rentals to the special  needs13 populations, the colleges who net lease  big14 chunks of the units. So there' s a lot that those15 provisos do to protect those remaining  buildings .16 I guess  I 'm  asking you that you17 do the same for apartment buildings.	It 's no18 secret that in most of Manhattan and in  growing19 areas of the City we have a de facto vacancy  20	decontrol. Rents are going up sky high. It ' s a21 great investment to buy even rent  stabilized22 buildings in this City.23 And more and more landlords  are24 making significant income. As you've heard  from25 some so far, on those non- regulated units they21 
2 are making more than adequate rates of return  in3 those buildings.4 So I would urge you to  consider5 a proviso that if twenty- five percent or more of6 the units in a stabilized apartment building  are7 deregulated , there' s a zero increase for those8 remaining rent stabilized tenants.9 (Audience participation. )10 MR . LARRY WOOD:	I recognize11 the bulk of those buildings are in Manhattan,  but12 that ' s where we have  the highest  average rents.13 That ' s where  the apartments  are approaching that14 $2000 threshold in many  instances.15 And I think it would be16 warranted.17 There are some other provisos18 that I would recommend as well . My t ime is up19 though and I will take quest ions.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Pagan.21 MR. PAGAN:	First , Mr. Wood ,22 could you tell me where your building is and  your23 rent?24 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Sure. I live25 at 211 West  85th Street . And  it's on the Upper2 
1	2022	West Side. I 've been in there since 1978.3	My landlord - - it ' s a 12- unit4 building and since	1    97 eight out of the  twelve5 units are now going for - - are deregulated.   He' s6 gett ing between $3500 and $4000 for these7 apartments. My rent is currently about a  little8 over $900. I'm paying about $11,000 a year  in9 rent for that apartment. And he' s gett ing about10 $45, 000 for those deregulated units.11 MR . PAGAN:	When you' re talking12 about proviso, what authority do we have to  set13 that?14 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Well , I think15 the precedent  certainly was established through16 the SROs. We got those provisos well over  fifteen17 years ago .18 And I think it 's very important19 that the mission of the Rent Guidelines Board  is20 not just to protect the profits. It 's to protect21 the affordability of the units. And it 's to22 protect  against obscene  - -23 (Audience participat ion.)24 MR. LARRY WOOD:25 prof iteering.4 
2	I mean certainly if somebody  is3	not making a rate of return that	you know,4 they're really losing money, there are  provisions5 where they can get hardship  increases.6 And where a landlord has a  fully7 rent regulated building and they need  that8 increase, you know, based on the proper  studies9 and stuff to determine it , they should get one.10 My argument is there are many11 buildings where landlords are making more than   an12 adequate rate of return. And you have  an13 opportunity here to address the  affordability14 issue and to lessen the hardship on those  tenants15 in those buildings, particularly  seniors and16 people who are kind of locked  in.17 You know, I know seniors  who18 live in walk- ins. They would love to move to19 another building because they can' t walk up  four20 flights anymore.21 But they've got no choice.  They22 can't go find another place. They can get on  a23 wait ing list for 202 housing. Where I work at24 Goddard Riverside, we have housing for  senior25 disabled. We have an eight - year wait ing list.4 
2 People come in pleading because they want to  get3 out of their rent regulated building and get   into4 something that they can get in and out of  easy.5	But they' re locked in . There' s6 no other affordable housing out  there.7 So I think you have the right8 and the means to take a look at the  apartment9 increases and not do a one- size- fits- all , but to10 differentiat e based on some of the economics in11 the different buildings out there .12 And I would love to address  the13 enforcement piece of it  too.14 MR. PAGAN:	Yeah. Let me ask15 you.16 And this is the first t ime17 anybody has brought up the idea of the  provisos18 on the apartment side. We always talk about  them19 in reference to the SRO side. I think it has  been20 custom over on the apartment side. But now  as21 deregulat ion goes forward in many of the22 apartments,  it may  make  some sense .23 What about the enforcement?  Do24 you think DHCR will  - - because  this is a25 different , we' re looking at different sensors or6 
1	2052 a different universe . SROs are a smaller universe3 than the apartments.4	MR . LARRY WOOD :	Certainly.5	MR. PAGAN:	Would this be6 something that would cause some probl ems in7 enforcement?8	MR.  LARRY WOOD :	I don' t9 beli eve so. I think it certainly could increase10 the number of cases filed.11	In the way it worked for SRO12 tenants, in the first few years that the  provisos13 were in place there was some back and forth  with14 the landlords over whether or not it applied  to15 their building, you know, depending on - - I think 16	there was one year that rooming houses got  an17 increase but hotels didn' t , and whether  a18 building was thirty units or more or thirty  units19 or less. The wording had to be very careful.  You20 know, I remember running around and looking at  C21 of Os .22 And there was one year that  a23 proviso was around warehousing.  If over ten24 percent  of the building  was not  rented , the25 argument was that if the landlord needed  the17 
  2 rental income, he should rent out the  building3 first and then get an increase.4 But it 's very hard to determine5 what ' s warehoused and what ' s not .6 But for the deregulated units,7 it 's pretty basic . DHCR has apartment details and8 they have building details. I understand that  you9 get l ists from DHCR indicat ing how many regulated10 units exist  in a building . It ' s easy to contrast11 that to the Cert ificate of Occupancy.12 For SRO tenants the way it13 worked , they're statutory  tenants. They don' t14 have a lease . So when their rent increase was15 going to take effect in October and the  landlord16 passed out a not ice saying , you know, a four17 percent increase this year, if the proviso was  in18 effect , we would counsel the tenants and say you19 shouldn't have to pay that increase because half 20	of your building is empty, half  your building is21 deregulated.22 And very often in many cases the 23	landlords wouldn' t refute it and their tenants24 didn' t have to pay the increase.25 Where  it was disputed , where24 
2landlords saidI believe I am ent itled to that3rent increase,either we filed an overcharge4complaint withDHCR as one way to adjudicate it  -5 - they have the building detail and they  can6 tell , you know, there' s a hundred units in this7 building and fifty percent of them are no  longer8 regulated. It's very dry cut and it 's simple to9 figure out .10 The other way was through11 landlord/tenant court in a counterclaim,  you12 know, a non-payment proceeding.  They often	the13 judges would prefer the tenant to take the  issue14 to DHCR so they didn' t have to sort it out. But15 that was the other way it was  addressed.16 The SRO landlords do not  contest17 the provisos anymore. I mean thankfully  you've18 just given a zero increase across the  board19 because it makes it a lot easier around  the20 enforcement .21 But there' s so many cases where22 you only have twenty tenants lef t in a 200- unit23 building. It ' s a no - brainer. They don' t even care24 about the RGB increase because it doesn' t affect25 the economics of their  building.5 
2	For apartment tenants they have3 to sign a lease. So if they are going to  contest4 it , say, well , I don't bel ieve you' re ent itled to5 this increase because I know in my case  two-6 thirds of my building  is deregulated ,  I would7 sign my lease but I would file an  overcharge8 complaint . I mean that ' s the way it can be9 adjudicated. And I think that 's a fair way.10 If DHCR needs to hire additional11 staff , that' s a different measure.	I mean if we12 have crime in the City, you hire more cops . If13 we've got more crime among landlords, you  hire14 appropriate enforcement personnel. That 's the way15 I look at it.16 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	What ' s your17 view on what a proviso would do to the  harassment18 of t enants who are currently in rent stabilized19 apartments? Don't you view that that  would20 increase harassment? Would that be your  view?21 MR. LARRY WOOD:	I have such a22 target on my back. I'll tell you. I'm paying  $90023a month for anapartment and my landlord  could24get $4000. I 'malready a target .25I don't - - if my landlord  is
2 going to get a two percent/three  percent3 increase, I don' t think that changes things.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Wouldn' t you5 imagine that in our industry the RSA and the  rest6 would litigate a proviso if we did it? Do  you7 have any view as to the legal ity of the proviso?8	MR. LARRY WOOD:	I believe	- - I9 guess you would have to check the history.  I10 think there was some litigation when the  provisos11 were first put in place for the SROs. But  we've12 had them for over fifteen years at this  point.13 I believe you have every right14 to put the provisos in place. And I really  urge15 you to consider them.16 I do know there was  - - we've17 been asking or seeking a proviso about  rent18 impairing violat ions. And I understand that Corp19 Counsel said that 's beyond the authority of the20 Rent Guidel ines Board. I don' t know if it ' s21 accurate  or not .22 But certainly around your non-23 registrat ion of units,  that ' s another proviso24 you've had in place for  SROs.25 I know tenant act ivists out in9 
2 Queens and Brooklyn said that 's more of an issue3 for them. There are many buildings that are  not4 properly registered , or when they get renewal5 leases, they don' t get the rent stabilized rider.6 So I say that those would be7 proper provisos to have as well. And you have  the8 authority because you've been doing it , you know,9 fifteen years for the SRO tenants. There' s no10 reason why you couldn' t do it for apartment11 tenants as well12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I disagree on13 that .14 Go ahead.15 MR . ZELNIK:	I had mentioned  to16 the SPONY rep before , they were going to have a17 brainstorming	session. I was hoping they  were18 going to do some brainstorming	on a part icular19 topic.20 I don't want to put you in the21 spot now for provisos, but I'm intrigued by  the22 notion of the provisos. And I just wonder if  you23 and some of the other tenant groups might  not24 want to have a brainstorming session and  look25 into that and maybe submit  something.2 
2 MR. LARRY WOOD:	I'm been3 trying  - -  I'm actually been talking  it up among4 my fellow tenant activists for  years.5 But  I believe  - - I know Michael6 Mc Kee spoke about it earlier.7	MR. ZELNIK:	But perhaps we need8	some paper, a writ ing, just to give us some9	MR. LARRY WOOD:	I believe the10 tenant reps will have something in writ ing for11 you later today.12 MR. ZELNIK:	That would be13 helpful.14 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Okay.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any more16 quest ions?17 (No response. )18 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Thank you,19 sir.20 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Thank you.21 (Audience participation. )22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mary McCune.23 Ms. McCune is followed by  Jean24 Grillo, followed by Eric Margules.  2 5		Go ahead.10 
2 MS. MARY McCUNE:	I ' ll try and3 reach the mike.4	My name is Mary McCune and  I'm5 an attorney at the Columbia University- Legal6 Services for New York City West Harlem  Community7 Advocacy Partnership. The Community  Advocacy8 Partnership provides free legal advice  and/or9 representation in housing matters to low- income10 residents of Community Board #9 in West  Harlem.11 I am here today to ask the Board12 to vot e for a rent freeze for rent stabilized13 tenants.14 Between  1900 and 2000 , the15 number of households in Community Board #9  paying16 more than thirty percent of their income  towards17 rent increased by twelve percent. There' s now18 twenty- seven percent of households that are19 paying more than fifty percent of their income  on20 rent . Every rent increase you grant decreases the21 amount of affordable housing  available.22 One of my clients lives with  her23 three children in one bedroom of a three- bedroom24 apartment. Although  she was working  full- time ,25 she could not afford an apartment on her own  so5 
2	she tripled up with two other  families.3	She was forced to choose  between4 overcrowding and homel essness.5 Every year landlords testify6 that they need higher rent rolls to be able  to7 afford to maintain their buildings. Alt hough8 apartment rents have doubled and tripl ed in the9 past ten years, I see no improvement in  the10 conditions in the buildings where my  tenants11 live.12 For example, one of my  clients13 moved into an apartment in September. Two  days14 afterwards, Con Edison came in and shut off  the15 gas because the landlord had not connected  the16 gas meter properly. My client went without  gas17 for seven months while waiting for the  landlord18 to fix the problem.19 When  the heat  season started , he20 discovered the radiators had not been  properly21 connected and had little or no heat for most  of22 the winter. My  client ' s rent was  roughly double23 that paid by the prior  tenant.24 Large rent increases do not25 guarantee higher returns for landlords.  When4 
2 rents  skyrocket ,  apartments  are vacant longer3 between tenanci es because it is harder to find a4 tenant who can afford to rent them. Tenants  are5 also more likely to default on rent payment s when6 they are paying in excess of thirty percent  of7 their incomes towards the  rent.8	Landlords say rent freezes  or9 low- rent increases are unfair because they force10 landlords to subsidize low- income tenants. I11 think it is unfair for low- income tenants to12 subsidize landlords.13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. MARY McCUNE:	Because when15 landlords cont inue to collect rent increases16 while not providing services, that is  exactly17 what is happening. Tenants are paying  for18 services they are not getting and the landlord  is19 pocket ing the difference.20 Tenants cannot afford a rent21 increase of seven percent , four percent or even22 two percent. So I ask the Rent Guidelines  Board23 to vote for a rent freeze.24 Thank you.25 (Audience participation. )9 
1	2152 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We owe you3 thirty- six seconds next year.4	MS. MARY McCUNE:	Okay. I 1   115	keep it . I'll bank  it . Do I get interest on  that?6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You get two7 seconds next year.8 Jean Grillo.9	Hold on one second. Followed  by10	Eric Margules,	followed by Ann Cunningham.11	MS. JEAN GRILLO:	Thank you12 very much for the opportunity to speak  today.13 I am a District Leader for14 Downtown Independent Democrats for Tribeca. I  am15 not only an elected off icial , I am also a rent16 stabil ized tenant , part of an ever- dwindling17 group of Tribeca pioneers that helped make  loft18 living legal .19 In 1972, when I moved into  11620 Duane Street , my landlord welcomed my husband and21 me and offered me an illegal commercial lease  to22 move into his unprof itable building. He also got23 us to agree to pay an illegal  - - his  taxes24 illegally.25 Per our commercial  lease , in12 
2 winter our heat went off at five p.m. on  Friday3 and did not return until nine a.m. on  Monday4 morning. We had equally poor plumbing, wiring  and5 totally unsafe electrical  hookups.6 I worked extremely hard to get7 the Loft Law passed , and my family, working with8 our landlord , paid half of the cost of bringing9 our building up to code. I and my fellow  tenants10 poured thousands of dollars into a building  that11 is now legal and up for sale at $4.3  million.12 All of that money goes to  my13 landlord despite the thousands that I put in.  I14 don' t see a penny.15 So I come here today to pl ead16 for affordable housing knowing full well I  may17 also be facing a new owner who could be  working18 right at this moment to find a way to throw  me19	OU t .20 Down the street from me the  new21 owners of 131- 135 Duane Street are in the process22 of doing exactly that.23 But despite the real  jeopardy24 that I and other rent controlled and  rent25 stabilized tenants are facing, however,  our20 
1	2172 part icular peril only underscores what a3 tremendous success rent stabilizat ion has been up4 to this point. For over thirty years I raised  a5 family, created a business, became PTA president ,6 both elementary and high school , created wealth7 for others and paid hefty taxes on what I  earned8 for myself . As a writer married  to an artist ,  I9 never made much money, but I was able  to10 contribute to this City whil e raising a wonderful11 daughter as well .12 None of this could have  happened13 if this City hadn' t given special dispensations14 to both landlords and tenants to first create  and15 then maintain affordabl e rental housing.16 The key word in rent17 stabilizat ion is rent . We are not all meant to18 own the roof over our head for a variety  of19 reasons. Affordabl e rent is the only way I, my20 husband and my daught er, newly graduated from21 college, could have lived in New York City  and22 made our not insignificant contributions to  its23 well - being.24 As my daughter looks for  work,25 affordable rent is the only way this  incredible2 
1	2182 young girl , trained in pediatric psychology, can3 stay in this City. She has been offered many  jobs4 and cannot take any one of them because they  will5 not pay rent in this City. She is looking to  move6 to Louisville, Kentucky where rents  are7 reasonable.8	Now, this would be true if  she9 were a teacher, a public sector lawyer, a  museum10 curator.11 Another point I want to bring  up12 and others may not have mentioned, both her  dad13 and I took a terribl e financial hit as many of my14 neighbors  did when  9/11 happened . I live five15 blocks from the Towers and was evacuated  that16 day, blown out of my bed.17 My magazine work dried up  and18 never rebounded to its pre - 2001 levels. My19 husband , who works in the print ing industry, is20 also getting half of what he got prior to  9/11,21 including having to move from a company that  shut22 down.23 Any rent increase right  now24 would mean terrif ic financial strain on both of25 us.9 
1	2192	My husband is over 65. Like  many3 old New Yorkers we are now spending  retirement4 savings to pay our rent because we have  not5 fought back to the pre- 9/11 income that we had.6 Whil e many companies are getting7 financial help downtown for staying downtown,  it8 is incredulous that the only 9/11 survivors  now9 being asked to pay more are the very tenants  who10 stayed and rallied and kept our  neighborhood11 intact.12 Now is not the time for  three,13 four or seven percent increases, especially  for14 rent stabilized tenants, such as myself , who are15 making half of what we did only a few years  ago.16 A large rent increase w i l l mean17 many of us will slip from product ivity into18 poverty. This is no joke. Keeping  affordable19 housing i n New York City affordable keeps me20 here. You have my very life in your hands.  Treat21 it carefully.22 Thank you.23 (Audience participat ion.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Eric25 Margules,	followed by Ann Cunningham, followed  by3 
2	Sara Weinberg .3 Mr. Margules, are you here?4 MR. ERIC MARGULES:	H ,  I5	I 1   m here to say that  our6 expenses as a landlord have  increased7 dramatically.  Oil ,  insurance, real estate  taxes8 of course we all know are way up. The  vacancy9 decontrol  apartments have also  - - the vacancy  on10 the decontroll ed apartments has gone way up.11 Along with the higher rents  we12 also have higher collection costs. We go to  court13 and we can 1   t get legal fees. We can go to court14 at the same time with the same peopl e.15 There 1   s really not a lot  of16 relief .17 Your system actually has, in  a18 perfect world , we have a lot of outlets. A lady19 before ment ioned SCRIE and it takes too long.20 Well ,  obviously  that kind of process  should be21 speeded up.22 As  I said , but the courts are23 not fair. We have people who are  illegally24 subletting and there 1   s really very l ittle you can25 do about it without spending thousands  and6 
1	2212 thousands of dollars and months and months  of3 time.4	But , you know, I'm not really5 here to talk about all of that kind of stuff . I6 just think that the system itself is just  not7 fair. It ' s not fair to tenants; it ' s not fair to8 1andlords.9 It 's not right that we should go10 down - - we should have to come down here   and11 these people  should - -  they' re worried about12 their rent levels. I underst and that . At the same13 time I 'm worried  about my profit , which is14 gett ing squeezed all the time. And I'm sure that15 everybody has to understand that  also.16 The system is just very17 arbitrary. A lady talked about a poor woman in  a18 Mitchell - Lama apartment who	her rent is going19 way up and she can't afford to stay there. Well ,20 if she had been in another bui lding , it would21 have stayed rent stabilized and she wouldn' t have22 had a problem.23 So why is it that this building24 gets to be decontrolled and this one is  not?25 There' s just really - - it 1    s just5 
2 arbitrary. It ' s not fair. It doesn' t make a  lot3 of sense.4 I think that the whole  system5 ought to be phased out in that the low- rent6 tenants and peopl e that cannot afford higher7 rents should be compensated somehow so that  they8 can stay where they are.9 But at the same time the10 landlords should not be expected to  subsidize11 those people . They' re private people. The12 landlords are private companies and  they13 shouldn' t be expected to subsidize.14 You know, basically it has15 turned into a zero subgame and it ' s just  - - the16 whole thing has to be  changed.17 You know, people were  talking18 about making it based on a landlord' s return.19 Well , if you buy  a building  for $100,000 , your20 return is X; if you buy a building , the   same21 building, for $5 million, your return is not  X.22 So I don' t even see how you can do it based on a23 landlord' s return.24 You know, it really is not  a25 matter of landlord versus tenant. It 's a matter2 
1	2232 of old tenant versus new tenant. Because I  can3 tell you that tenants who have been there  for4 thirty years are paying very low rents.  People5 who want to come into the City now, they  can't6 afford to get into	they can't afford7 apartments because they are just not available  at8 low prices.9 The whol e thing has to be10 changed.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 MS. HOLDER :	I have a question.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You should14 make that argument to the Legislature, by  the15 way. But we appreciate it. Thank  you.16 Go ahead , Ms. Holder.17 MS. HOLDER:	You own the Park18 Lincoln SRO building?19 MR. ERIC MARGULES:	I'm a20 member of the LLC that does,  yes.21 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.22 How many deregulated units  are23 in that building?24 MR. ERIC MARGULES:	About25 sixty.12 
2MS.HOLDER:	Out of how many3units?4MR.ERIC MARGULES:	Out of 220.5MS.HOLDER:	220 units. And what6are they goingfor?7MR.ERIC MARGULES:	Oh, I'm8sorry. You said deregulated.9MS. HOLDER :Deregulated.10 MR. ERIC MARGULES:11 Deregulated ,  there  are probably  about thirty.12 MS. HOLDER:	Thirty deregulated13 out of 200?14 MR. ERIC MARGULES:	Yep.15 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.16 And how much do those17 deregulated units go for?18 MR. ERIC MARGULES:	The19 deregulated units? On average about  $1500.20 MS. HOLDER :	A month?21 MR. ERIC MARGULES:	Yes.2 2	MS. HOLDER:	The deregulated23 unit s?24 MR. ERIC MARGULES:	Not - -25 well , the ones that are not SROs, that have been23 
2	converted to apartments.3	MS. HOLDER:	Right .4	Okay. And then the building  in5 Chelsea, are you convert ing those units from SROs6 to apartments or are you7	MR.

Good to see you.17 MS. ANN CUNNINGHAM:	Good to18 see you too, Mr. Chairman.19 This afternoon  I 'm not going to20 read my oral test imony. I ' d like to go through21 the booklet with you. It 's only twenty- six pages22 and I talk very quickly.23 (Audience part icipat ion. )24 MS. ANN CUNNINGHAM:	By the25 way, this sign says welcome. Now, I cannot  invite12 
2 you to the hotel because it is over- occupied.3 Okay?4 Now, what 's happening here is5 you have a lot of documents because I always,  as6 you know, for many years I substantiate all  my7 claims.8 First I want to tell you  that9 The Tempo is what the old Commander was. It ' s   now10 called Tempo. So we' re in the Tempo of tourists.11 In 1996 to 2002 scores of12 tenants were evict ed , about a hundred of them.13 Now they were replaced by a hundred and  ten14 market rate tenants who were also evicted after  a15 year and they were replaced by  tourists.16 The building was sold in  199617 for $13 million and it was resold again last  year18 for $51 million. Tell me , are the landlords of19 the hotels making money or  not?20 I have the proof of the pudding21 right in here. Okay.22 Also when we talk about  hotels,23 the Tempo is a Class A hotel . Now, members of24 this Board , most of them, do not know how many25 Class A hotels there are. Could you please  tell2 
1	2282 me if you do know? I'd say there are about  three3 left , three of these.4	So, therefore , we  should never5 be in a separate category anymore. In the  old6 days the SROs, Class B hotels, were given two  and7 three percent increases whil e the Class A' s8 received five percent and up.  Okay.9	Now, you saw the new papers  and10 the stocks, AIV, please don' t buy it. That ' s  my11 landlord' s stock.12 Secondly, the sex attack on  the13 teen tourists. Now, those teen tourists that  were14 attacked lived in the Tempo Hotel where I  live.15 What 's happening with the tourists? We' re16 getting , other than tourists, we' re gett ing sex17 and drugs. We are getting very young people  that18 come in, prostitution and  drugs.19 Now, as far as the next20 document , which is the monthly, the monthly rate,21 this is not up- to - date because what is being22 charged for these rooms is $200 a night and  up.23 When the people are wait ing to get in and they24 are really booked , it 's $300.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ann, you need10 
2	to wrap up. We' ll look at the stuff.3 MS. ANN CUNNINGHAM:	I'll wrap4 it up.5 But I also want to tell you  the6 Park Lincoln is on this list. I have a list  of7 thirty hotels for you. I walked around and  got8 the C of Os and everything.9	Now, this really reflects for10 you how many units we have lost. Thirty  hotels,11 and the units in these hotels come to 7581  units.12 And we have 1284 tenants left. I threw in one  co-13	op there.14 But as I walk around my15 neighborhood	- this is only in my neighborhood16 as I walk  around , I see many  old buildings  that17 were hotels. They are now co- ops and condos.18 We do not need an increase.  In19 fact , no tenant really should be getting an20 increase from this Board.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me ask22 you. In your building, assuming that there is   a2 3	hotel increase, are you covered by the proviso?24 MS. ANN CUNNINGHAM:	My25 building, we are covered by the  proviso.24 
1	2302 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.3 MS. ANN CUNNINGHAM:	There4	aren't that many of us lef t.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank6 you.7 Any other questions?8 (No response.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10	(Audience participat ion.)11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sara12 Weinberg.13 Sara Weinberg? Coming? Is  Sara14 Weinberg coming? No. Is she  here?15 Janet Henne.16 Janet will be followed by  Sara17 Goldstein and followed by Hester Paster  after18 that .19 Go ahead. Janet Henne.20 MS. JANET HENNE:	Ladies and21 gentl emen.22 Thank you very much for  your23 time.24 My name is Janet Henne. I 'm also25 the President of the tenants associat ion and I've12 
2 lived in Queens for forty years.3 And the rents are already  at4 fair market value and are very rapidly going  off5 of rent stabilization.6	As you know, there are  no7 records kept by DHCR. If you were to call  my8 landlord , who actually owns around 1/3 of all  the9 rent stabilized apartments in the boroughs,  he10 will tell you that there are none, zero, off   rent11 stabilization. But there is no way that you  can12 check any record.13 I'm sure everyone in this  room14 already knows only the wealthy and peopl e15 doubling, tripling and quadrupling will be  able16 to pay these rents.17 I would like to list the  reality18 facts of life to you which I am positive are  not19 listed in any of the reports that you  receive20 provided by the  landlords.21 My  landlord,  I believe , who22 owns, as I said , a third of the rent stabilized23 apartments,  is doing a wholesale job of harassing24 tenants. Examples, employees verbally  abusing25 tenant s, cursing or, as a quote that I've heard,7 
2 " if you don't like it , move, we can triple  your3 rent. "4 They don' t make repairs.5 No heat or hot wat er on and off .6 Lack of security .7 Reduced staff.8	Reduct ion of lighting, et9	cetera.10 I'm sorry .11 All of which not only harass  us,12 but certainly cuts expenses. We all know,  yes,13 expenses go up. But they find ways to cut it.   So14 it goes up five cents, they cut it so it 's twenty15 cents.16 The latest weapon is to  send17 letters of terminat ion of leases and holdover18 proceedings  to dispossess tenants.19 Some of the reasons they use:20 claiming tenants refuse access to  their21 apartments, saying that they didn' t allow access22 to put in the carbon monoxide. Many of  the23 tenants that they sent this to had it in  for24 three mont hs.25 Violations where there are  no10 
2 violations; that 's another thing they put3 holdovers on.4	And the most recent ,  and5 certainly I have a very large target on my  back,6 is walking my dog through the lobby. I am  being7 taken to court on a holdover for the big crime  of8 walking my dog through the  lobby.9 I've lived there for forty- three10 years and most of those forty- three years I've11 had a dog and walked through the  lobby.12 But it ' s all right if we have13 madames,  if we have drug dealers, that ' s  all14 right. The tenants have had to get them out.  And15 that is also a form of harassment as you  well16 know, an old form, fill the building  with17 undesirables.18CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Where are you19living?20MS.

Thank6 you.7 (Audience participat ion.)8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sara9	Goldstein.10 Hold on one second.11 Is Sara Weinberg	in the room?12 You can go ahead. Go ahead , Sara13 Goldstein.14 MS. SARA GOLDSTEIN:	Good15 afternoon.16 My name is Sara Goldstein and  I17 am a rent stabilized tenant living in a  large18 apartment complex in Rego Park,  Queens.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The same one?20 MS. SARA GOLDSTEIN:	The same21 one.22 I'm a disabled individual.  I23 currently live with my husband and my  seventy-24 three year old mother.  Due to  - - we are  basically25 a one - income family and rent stabilizat ion10 
2	enables us to live in New York  City.3	The income that I get and my4 mother gets from Social Security is spent  towards5 health and medical payments. And so it is  very6 important. If we didn' t have the rent stabilized7 apartment , we would not be able to live in New8 York and would most likely have to move  out.9	Currently,  as Ms. Henne  said ,10 the landlord has really upped his act ions in11 trying to get the tenants out. He doesn' t seem  to12 care how long we've lived there. And , you know,13 he' s brought a lot of baseless litigat ion in the14 sense that ten people were brought up on  holdover15 proceedings based on the fact that they  are16 claiming they didn' t have carbon monoxide17 detectors based on the new carbon monoxide  law.18 And the upshot was the landlord three  months19 prior had  installed them himself  .20 If that didn' t work, he would21 bring termination notices on the long- term22 tenants based on let 's say terrace enclosures23 that we've had for thirty or forty  years.24 And all of these act ions seem to25 be calculated to try to get most of the long -10 
1	2362 term tenants out who have made this  apartment3 their home like I have.4	I've lived in New York City  for5 over thirty- five years. And without affordable6 housing and based on the income that my  family7 currently has, it would be almost impossible  for8 us to stay here and we would be forced to  move9 out.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11	(Audience participat ion. )12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Heather13 Paster.14 And then Beverly Clark  Grigsby.15 And then we are going to go to  a16 ten- minute break.17 Heather Paster.18 MS. HEATHER PASTER:	H , I19 My name is Heather Paster. And  I20 recently purchased  a bui lding up in Harlem.  It ' s21 all rent stabilized and all the tenants  are22 paying less than half , if not twenty- five percent23 of actual market value.24 I have a mortgage to cover.  I25 have expenses to cover. And it doesn' t make sense12 
2 that there are certain peopl e that are really3 being  subsidized while the free market  rents  - -4 for example, in a building that has both  free5 market and rent stabilized apartments,  people6 paying free market are being forced to  actually7 pay more money to cover the shortfall by  the8 subsidized tenants. And that just goes to  balance9 everything out.10 As  a landlord , you know, from11 both this building and from previous  experiences,12 when there' s a shortfall in cash, there' s less13 incentive to maint ain the building to the highest14 standards because no matter what one can do to  an15 apartment , there' s a cap on how much one can16 charge. And , you know,  it 's very prohibitive	for17 business.18 You know, obviously because19 there is more of a rent increase when  tenants20 move out , a higher jump, there is an incentive21 for landlords to have higher turnovers. So  for22 these people who are creating their homes and  are23 fighting against having their rent  being24 increased , there is an incentive for the landlord25 to get them out and have more turnover so  that2 
2 they can jump seventeen or twenty percent  as3 opposed to four percent or seven  percent.4	And ,  unfortunately, some5 landlords are a lot more aggressive about  trying6 to get people out as we've heard  these7 unfortunate	stories before.8 So in order to avoid all of9 that , you know, let the landlords make money. Let10 capitalism take place here.11 (Audience part icipat ion.)12 MS. HEATHER PASTER:	You know,13 it 's not popular, but , you know,14 (Audience part icipation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Keep going.16 MS. HEATHER PASTER:	Okay.17 You  know,  the free market	- - the18 people that are paying free market are  supposed19 to pick up the slack from the rent  stabilized20 tenants. And , you know, it ' s unfortunate.21CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22We  understand  your point .23(Audience part icipation.)24CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Beverly Clark25Grigsby.
2 (No response. )3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You are going4 to speak together, is that right , with Florence5 Rice?6	MS. BEVERLY CLARK GRIGSBY:	I'm7	the guardian ad litem for Ms.  Rice.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.9 MS. BEVERLY CLARK GRIGSBY:	My10 name is Beverly Clark Grigsby and my ward is  Ms.11 Florence Rice. She' s well -known to the United12 States, nationally  and internationally,13 (Audience part icipat ion.)14 MS. BEVERLY CLARK GRIGSBY:15 She' s well - known to the United States, nationally16 and internat ionally, as a consumer advocate.17 We came here last June. I  begged18 for help with Ms. Rice because she had been  given19 illegal leases. Two whole buildings were  given20 illegal leases. The other people don' t speak21 Engl ish. They didn' t know what kind of lease they22 were given. They were just told to sign on  the23 dotted line and they did.24 Ms . Rice, I fought for her case.25 We had some victory to get her rent rolled  back10 
2	from the illegal lease.3	But the landlord went in  with4 the firm of Guttman, Mintz and Baker and made  her5 homeless. They, in three days of doing  the6 repairs, which were over seventy- five violations7 by HPD in this one apartment , over 500 violations8 in the two buildings that are companion, she  was9 put into the street on September the 1st , 2004.10 Ms. Rice , as we stand  here11 today, is still homeless. She had to stay  between12 family and friends since that time.  They13 illegally demolished her apartment . They claim in14 a settlement statement here by two  attorneys'15 stip with Doug Kellner' s firm that they were16 doing her a favor by renovating her apartment  and17 upgrading it. Since HPD only told them to  remove18 the violat ions, they went beyond that point . They19 took out the floors, the walls, the ceiling,  the20 toilet , the bat htub, the kitchen fixtures. She21 came back to a gutted apartment . It was in The22 New York Times. It was in  The Amsterdam.	It was23 on  'Like It is' , two segments. It ' s going further24 than that .25 What I want to bring here  today,
2 this is a woman who lived in a building  for3 forty- three years and she moved down to the4 second floor of a walkup building. And when  they5 found out they could not get that apartment , then6 they went after her. And the landlord and  the7 landlord' s attorney told her in the hallway we8 are going to get you . And they came after her.9 And she's still homeless.  They10 have never, based on this document that I  would11 like to leave a copy with you today, they  have12 never repaired the apartment under  the13 guidelines. She has no gas in the apartment.   She14 has no approved electricity by the Bureau  of15 Electrical Control.16 The Department of  Investigation17 has asked us, please not to have her live in  the18 apartment because none of the work that was  done19 by the people they picked up in the street , who20 had no construct ion skills, that was done in  her21 apartment has ever been approved by the  Building22 Department.23 Con Edison removed the meter24 because of the gas leak while they were doing  the25 work and smoking in the apartment at the  same2 
  2 time. It 's just lucky that the other twenty- nine3 tenants in the apartment didn' t go up in smoke.4 So we stand here today  asking5 for the Rent Guidelines Board to please  do6 something . How can you give landlords increases7 in rent when violat ions, five hundred , two8 thousand , three thousand violations  are  on9 buildings? And you just automat ically close  your10 eyes and give them rent increases every  year.11 This is terrible.12 You talk about a holocaust.  Come13 up to Harlem and I'll take you on a walking   tour.14 You want to see a holocaust . You got one.15 (Audience participation. )16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It is now17 five after two. We will be recessed until 2: 15.18 Thank you.19 (There was a recess in the20 proceedings.) 21222 32425

are you here?
Clare is first.MS. CLARE DOCKERY:	Good
afternoon.My name is Clare Dockery. I'm  amember of Citizen Action, Statewide Senior Action, JPAC and I'm politically act ive.                     I love New York City and I have lived in rent stabilized housing for more than thirty years and I hope I can continue to do so so that I can stay in the  City.                     I currently pay more than 31 percent of my income for rent . My rent will be                      
1	2522 more than 31 percent of my income  beginning3 September 1, 2005. I will probably be able  to4 afford this increase, but I will not be able   to5 continue paying increases that are larger  than6 the increases in my  income.7 Other  people,  working  people -8 blue  collar, professional , technical  -  are being9 forced to leave New York City, not  just10 Manhattan, because they cannot afford the  rent.11 If they don' t  leave , they double or triple  up.12 I recently asked a social  worker13 who moved into a new building  in my neighborhood14 how do you afford to live here. I have  four15 roommates she said.16 In my building several17 apartments have become deregulat ed because of  the18 many, many rent increases. As a result , there  is19 now a couple on my floor with two kids living   in20 a one- bedroom apartment. On the first floor21 there' s a couple with five kids in a two- bedroom22 apartment. They are not going to stay in New   York23 any longer than they have  to.24 Who will do the necessary  work?25 Where will nurses live? Teachers? Police?   City2 
2	employees?3	Decent housing is a  human4 necessity.  People cannot live in shelters, on  the5 streets or commute for hours and still do a  good6 day' s work.7 I realize that landlords have  to8 make a living, but I have not heard of  any9 landlords going broke.10 Landlords refuse to open their11 books so that the rest of the City can learn  what12 their profits are. The increased prices for  oil13 and other supplies are usually more than  offset14 by rent increases and by MCis, Major  Capital15 Improvements, and you really don' t want to hear16 me talk about them.17 Do we want landlords to  make18 more money or do we want to keep rents   affordable19 for the folks who make New York City  work?20 Please , I urge you to vot e for a21 rent freeze this year and next. Landlords   have22 not shown that they need an increase and  tenants23 are paying larger and larger percentages of   their24 incomes  for rent .25 Please, no increase .4 
1	2542 Thanks for your attention.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 (Audience participation.)5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Rosie Mendez,6 District Leader.7 (Audience participation.)8	MS . ROSIE MENDEZ:	Good9	afternoon.10 I'm the Democrat ic District11 Leader in the Lower East Side represent ing12 residents who live  from approximately	14th Street13 to Delancy and from Avenue B to the  River.14 We have many regulated  tenants15 there and I was formerly a rent regulated  tenant16 and fortunate enough to have moved into a  low-17 income co- op.18 Many of my neighbors are  being19 displaced because apartments are reaching  the20 maximum rents and are now being  decontrolled.21 I ask that you freeze the  rents22 at the current levels so more tenants in  my23 community are not displaced. Currently, the  three24 soup kitchens in my district , in my area, are25 overf lowed with working families because they are10 
2 spending anywhere from fifty to eighty percent   of3 their income on rent and cannot afford to  buy4 food. And they all go to the soup  kitchens.5 In the last several years  we6 have lost about 5,000 rent regulated  apartments7 in the Lower East Side. And I think this is  a8 conservative number at best because I don' t9 believe that DHCR is doing great  recordkeeping .10 And , of  course ,  this does not  include apartments11 where tenants are being harassed out and  then12 those apartments are decontroll ed.13 Again I ask that the rents  be14 frozen and that rents be rolled back so that  we15 can keep tenants who have been residing in  this16 community safe in their apartments. We should  be17 freezing rents and not  tenants.18 Thank you.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thomas22 Siracuse.23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. THOMAS SIRACUSE:	Hold on a25 second , Thomas.2 
2 Af ter him is Robert Moratti ,3 then Betty Abbott.4 Let me also say that those  of5 you that are in the room that would like  to6 speak, right now I only have about six or   seven7 speakers and then we are going to adjourn unt il8 we get some other amount.9	So, Tom Siracuse.10 MR. THOMAS SIRACUSE:	I11 represent the Committee to protect  rent12 controlled tenants. I'm speaking of the  special13 guideline.14 We urge to reduce the  proposed15 fifty percent  increase for vacated rent16 controlled apartments and eliminate the HUD   Fair17 Market guideline.18 Because of the continuing  sharp19 increases for rent controlled units, many  rent20 controlled tenants are paying over $1000 a  mont h.21 This proposal , this proposed special guideline  of22 fifty percent , makes it much easier for landlords23 to reach the $2000 vacancy decontrol  threshold,24 thus taking these units off rent regulation  and25 further reducing the stock of affordable  housing.10 
2 DHCR reported that more  than3 13 , 000 apartments were removed from the rent4 regulated rolls in 2004 compared with 6 , 400 in5 2002. This hemorrhage in the loss of affordabl e6 housing seriously affects the City' s ability  to7 attract new workers such as teachers and   other8 City workers.9	It is estimated that there  are10 only about 50,000 rent controlled units left  in11 the City. This special guideline not only   helps12 remove vacat ed units from rent regulation, it13 also adversely affects the remaining  rent14 controlled tenants.15 By increasing high rental  market16 rate apartments the assessed value and taxes  of17 the building are increased. And this forms  a18 major component in the Maximum Base Rent   increase19 for rent controlled  apartments.20 The last MBR increase for  2004-21 2005 was 17.2 percent , the highest in twenty-22 eight years. At this rate rent controlled  tenants23 will have their rents increase one  hundred24 percent in ten years. And that is  without25 addit ional MCis and fuel pass- alongs.10 
2 According to the 2003  Housing3 and Vacancy Survey, rent controlled  tenants4 cont inue to maintain the lowest household income5 of all tenants in New York City. Since most  of6 these are seniors on relatively fixed incomes,  we7 face the spectacle of being forced out of  our8 homes, homes we have lived in for at  least9 thirty- five years.10 The special guideline may  also11 mot ivate certain unscrupulous  landlords to harass12 rent controlled tenants, many of whom are  quite13 elderly and vulnerable, to move out so that  their14 apartments could be taken off rent regulat ion. It15 is not uncommon for these apartments to  increase16 more than three hundred percent  from their  former17 rents.18 And why should the  vacancy19 turnover rate for rent controlled units be  higher20 than for rent stabilized unit s? The apartments in21 quest ion are in the same buildings and the22 landlords' costs are the  same.23 By making this difference the24 RGB is giving landlords an extra profit  boost.25 Although there are a few small landlords  who2 
2 claim that their profits have not increased ,  in3 May 2003 , Crain' s New York Business reported that4 rent regulated real estate is, quote, one of  the5 hottest  segments of the real estate market.6	Despite increased costs, such as7 fuel and  taxes,  since 1989, tenants  - - since8 1989, we never hear what the average net  profit9 in rent regulated buildings  is. Do you have those10 figures?11 Tenants who cannot afford  these12 rents cannot apply for a hardship decrease   as13 landlords can apply for a hardship  increase.14 We urge the RGB to limit  the15 special guideline increase to the same as  the16 twenty percent  turnover vacancy rate for rent17 stabilizat ion, to remove the HUD Fair Market18 guideline, and to calculate the twenty  percent19 rate on the actual rent of these  units.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 MR.

So we just added  thirty10 people to the witness  list.11	Robert Moratt i .12	A VOICE:	What number are you at13	now?14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	47, Mr.15 Moratti.16 Followed by Betty Abbott ,17 followed by Lisabeth  MacKinlay.18 Go ahead.19 MR. ROBERT MORATTI:	Good20 afternoon.21 My name is Robert Moratti. I  am22 a tenant living in Astoria which is part  of23 west ern Queens . But to the real estate industry24 we are known as, one, Manhattan East , two,25 Hollywood East , three, in seven years possibly14 
2 Olympics East , and four, the second highest3 county in the United States with a  foreign-born4 population of 45.1 percent with 1,000 , 000 new5 immigrants added since 1990, figures taken  from6 the U .S. Census Bureau.7 What does this all mean to8 tenants in Queens?9	Well , in Economics 101, a very10 short supply and a very high demand leads  to11 soaring prices. And the Mayor and  his12 administrat ion have taken full advantage of  this13 with their increases.14 In a recent Newsday art icle15 t it 1ed II  The New Hot Spot , 11        now more than ever16 Astoria is becoming the next best thing  to17 Manhattan say real estate agents who cite  the18 community' s convenience to Manhattan.19 As the country' s economic20 recovery sets rents soaring by the month,  many21 young professionals have been priced out  of22 Manhattan  and even previously  affordable parts of23 Brooklyn.24 Real estate agents say droves  of25 them are finding more reasonable leases in  the10 
  2 culturally diverse northwest Queens neighborhood3 driving up rents there by thirty to one  hundred4 percent in the past year, but also raising   fears5 among some that less fortunate residents will  be6 pushed out of the market.7 Earlier I mentioned	I was a8 tenant , but I am a rent controlled tenant. Tenant9 groups are probably saying here today why is   he10 test ifying. But to the landlord group they  are11 saying, oh, no, because they know last year  they12 were given increases of  17.2 percent	for the last13 and this year, the highest  in twenty- eight years.14 This increase cost tenants a minimum increase   of15 $1000 for the two-year period. And when 58 , 00016 tenants were involved, simple math says  that17 these landlords received a $58 million gift  which18 went from the tenants to the landlords and   part19 of  it back  to the City in their property  tax  2 O	increase.21 This is where the rebate- found22 money came from. It is not a coincidence that   a23 few days after our increases the Mayor  announced24 his rebate plan.25 And if all of this  sounds21 
2 familiar, you are right . This is the Mayor' s3 version of the old shell  game.4 The onslaught did not  stop5 there. We were also given fuel cost  increases,6 the highest ever, which now total close to   $207 per room per month, or for most tenants way   more8 than their ut ility bill. Most of these peopl e , as9 I am, are seniors. This is Robinhood  in reverse10 from our Mayor.11 And so to the Rent  Guidelines12 Board , if you examine the facts, if you examine13 the figures, and if you examine your  conscience,14 you will not allow yourself to be a victim to   the15 Mayor' s condit ions, but instead make the16 conditions and see fit to entitle the tenants  to17 a rent freeze since the landlords have  been18 overly compensated  for already.19 Thank you very much .20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 (Audience participation. )22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Betty Abbott ,23 followed by Lisabeth MacKinlay and  Mickey24 Gensler.25 MS . BETTY ABBOTT:	Good2 
2afternoon.3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Good4afternoon.5MS. BETTY ABBOTT:I am a6 senior on limited income. I moved in in  Forest7 Hills at $800 for a one-bedroom apartment.  It8 went up about $400 from the span of twelve  years .9 All right? A span of twelve years. I now pay   the10 landlord $1,185 a month, which is pinching  me.11 And I let him know that.12 As of August , he wants $1,240 a13 mont h. Under $1,185 a month it would come  to14 $14,220 per year. Under $1,240 per month as  of15 August , it would come to $14,880 per year,  which16 is close to $15,000.17 In bot h cases it 's over one -18 third of what I can afford from my income,   which19 is about $34,000 to $35 , 000 a year gross, not20 net.21 So then I have utilities. I  pay22 them separately. That 's not included in the rent:23 gas, electric , telephone and so   froth.24 And with food and clothes  I25 get  - - that ' s even a sharper increase of6 
2 expenditures  for me.3 I think that the thirty- three4 percent or whatever is really immoral  and5 impossible for a person like myself. I am  a6 widow. I am alone. I have no children. I have   no7 one to help me. I have two sick cousins  and8 that ' s about it . And I wouldn' t ask them9 certainly.10 I somet imes envision myself that11 if these hikes go on, I would f ind myself in  the12 street , or maybe under welfare, if possible, or13 I'll have to get myself a sugar  daddy.14 (Laughter.)15 MS. BETTY ABBOTT:	So as to the16 rent increase or the rent freeze, excuse me,   the17 rent freeze , it is not good if a person like18 myself , a senior on limited income, has it  frozen19 very high and way over one- third. It should be20 lowered to one - third or less.21 And I think even one- third is22 inappropriate as well as immoral and  highly23 excessive and very pinchy, very  pinchy.24 And I think that it should  be25 lowered to about twenty to twenty- five percent.2 
2 That 's all I have to say and3 thank you for this presentation.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5	(Audience part icipation.)6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Lisabeth7	Mac Kinlay.8	MS. LISABETH MacKINLAY:	Good9 afternoon, Mr. Chairman and Members of the  Rent10 Guidelines Board.11 Some of you may remember that  I12 was here two years ago and I submitted  about13 twenty photos.14 Well , I'm here to updat e you on15 this situation at the building where I've  been16 living for nearly the last ten years.  This17 September 13th will be starting my tenth  year.18 I live at the Dexter House,19 which is located at 345 West 86th Street ,  which20 is Gail Brewer' s District , as well as Scott21 Stringer' s District.22 The situation now, since  two23 years ago, is that our building has been   taken24 over from a year ago May by a man by the name  of25 Jay Wartski. I will not give you what I think   of9 
1	2672 this man and what he has done in the last   year,3 but I would like to bring you exactly up to   date4 as to what our tenants association has done  and5 has accomplished to  date.6	As of last Friday, June 9th,  the7 City of New York filed a case against  the8 landlord for illegal rental to  tourists,9 violating	zoning conditions because our locat ion10 is zoned strictly for  residents.11 When this new management , run by12 Jay Wartski , came to the building a year ago  May,13 we had twenty hotel rentals in the building.  Now14 the building  is an SRO.15 Already that should tell  you16 that there were illegal things going on  before17 Jay Wartski took over. But since then, we have   a18 very accurate count that the warehoused   rooms,19 prior to Jay Wartski taking on the building,   has20 now gone up to sixty. But they' re still not  under21 the seventy- five percent.  So any increase would22 not deter the landlord from continuing to do   his23 illegal renovations. None of the work was   done24 illegally with legal work  permits.25 And I for one have been the  most7 
2 vocal on my floor, the 16th. I was the first   one3 to get an evict ion notice. And part of the  reason4 for that was because I didn' t pay rent because  I5 have been without work for a good number of   years6 and was on Public Assistance and was going   to7 food pant ies and I am now a full - fledged 65 year8 old.9 Where do I move to? There is  no10 place to move to. And I am very proud to say   I'm11 a twelfth generat ion Dutch born. So I belong  in12 New York City. I have a right to live here. And   I13 have a right to decent  housing.14 The pictures that I just  showed15 you only gives you a very small exampl e of  the16 loss of our reduced services. The back room on   my17 floor, we' re lucky if it 's gets cleaned every two18 weeks . It's a mess.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to20 wrap up, please.21 MS. LISABETH MacKINLAY:	There22 are no more house phones. The new management   put23 in a new phone system and took away all the  house24 phones of all the regular permanent   residents.25 There has been possible  mail2 
1	2692	tampering. There' s been overcrowding because the3	hostel rooms and the hotel rooms now have   either4 private bathrooms or they have  subdivided5 bathrooms that are on the existing floor.  My6 floor, the 16th floor, is the only floor in  the7 building that does not have either a host el  room8 or a hotel room.9 These people do not deserve  to10 get any money. It would be unconscionable of   you11 to give it.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 MR. ZELNIK:	I have a question.14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question,16 ma' am.17 MR. ZELNIK:	I just have a18 simple question.19 Who handles the litigation  in20 terms of the Department of Buildings  and21 violat ions and zoning? How is that being handl ed22 by you and other tenants? Who represents  you?2 3	MS. LISABETH MacKINLAY:	The24 Corporat ion of the City of New York handl es that.25 MR. ZELNIK:	Have they been24 
2	effective  in terms of getting  - -3	MS. LISABETH MacKINLAY:	Well ,4 we've been after both HPD as well as the City  of5 New York to get going on filing a case  against6 Wartski and company.7	MR. ZELNIK:	But have they filed8	violations?9	MS. LISABETH MacKINLAY:	Oh, my10 goodness,  from what  I understand  they have  - -11 this last year paid between $50,000 and   $60,00012 wort h in violat ions.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 MS. LISABETH MacKINLAY:	And15 that 's all provable.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 MS. LISABETH MacKINLAY:	Thank18 you.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Gensler,20 Mickey Gensler, followed by Ida Pollack,   and21 followed by Michael Laden.22 MR. MICKEY GENSLER:	I'm Mickey23 Gensler from the Skyview Tenants  Association.24 Our elected off icials,25 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Skyview  is -10 
23 MR. MICKEY GENSLER:4 including our Mayor keep reminding us of  their5 concern for the senior citizen. This past  year6 the Social Security Administration	took into7 account the rise in price of gasoline,  food,8 medicine,  clothing, et  cetera , and decided  that9 my cost of living increase should only be $16   per10 mont h.11 The Rent Guidelines  Board,12 appointed by the Mayor, decided that the  landlord13 alone was entitl ed to $51.72 per month. At the14 rate of these rent guideline increases, it  will15 soon make more sense to send our Social   Security16 checks directly to the  landlords.17 (Audience part icipation. )18 MR. MICKEY GENSLER:	The19 Kaskels, the Trumps, the Lefraks, all  made20 fortunes building  affordable housing. The21 building boom of the late	'50s and the	'60s then22 created the boom in the economy.23 When people have affordabl e24 housing, the discret ionary funds they then spend25 move the whole economy. When housing is put   on3 
12722the back burnerand building  stadiums becomes3more  important ,only a few gain.4The Rent Guidelines Board  has5 always given the incompet ents in the real estate6 industry an increase whether they deserved it   or7 not. If as one member purports, the  Rent8 Guidelines Board is not a welfare agency,   then9 why do they constantly give rent increases   to10 landlords who do absolutely nothing to earn  them?11 (Audience part icipat ion.)12 MR. MICKEY GENSLER:	The last13 rent increase was supposedly needed by   landlords14 because the City raised the real estate tax.   Then15 the City found that they did not need that   money16 and gave refunds . Not only did they not give17 tenants refunds, but they continued to allow  the18 increase to be compounded in tenants'  rents.19 What a sham! It should not  be20 called a Rent Guidelines Board.  It ' s real name  is21 Rent Increase Board.22 To continue to plead our case  on23 the merit s to deaf ears is a wast e of t ime.24 (Audience participation.)25 MR. MICKEY GENSLER:	The only5 
2 approach that makes sense is to get rid of  the3 people on the Board by gett ing rid of the person4 who appoints them.5 (Audience participation.)6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ida Pollack,7 pl ease.8 Ida Pollack, are you here?9	MS. IDA POLLACK:	Yes.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Welcome back.11	MS. IDA POLLACK:	I'm Ida12 Pollack. I come from Queens and I represent a   lot13 of rent stabilized tenants, many of whom  are14 here . And it seems like for a hundred years  I've15 been fighting for affordable housing and   nothing16 changes except for the worse.17 The Webst er' s Dictionary' s18 definition of a kangaroo court is an   irregular19 tribunal ,  usually  disregarding  exiting principles20 of law and human rights. Such in my opinion   is21 the nature of this court , excuse me, board .22 It is irregular and even  illegal23 because it does not reflect any input from  the24 people who would be directly affected by   its25 decisions . It is not an elected body but  one12 
2	handpicked by one individual 1   the Mayor.3	We' re pretty big on the issue of4 people' s choice. We make a lot of noise on the5 subject of people' s choice. We even go all  over6 the world with military force to try to  teach7 peopl e peopl e' s choice and we are guilty of8 causing the death and maiming of thousands of   our9 young men and thousands of people of 1	Iraqi10 peopl e part icularly.11	However 1	we are bringing them12 people' s choice. That 's what we say.13 Let 's see about our choice. We14 live in a civilized 1	rich country and a free15countrywesay and we arefree to choosewhere16and howwewant to live.17 What we never mention is  that18 we' d bett er have money 1	lots and lots of it 1	in19 order to pay for that  choice.20 It 's true that this court only21 exists because of the law. None of us would  be22 here if the law didn't say there had to  be23 hearings. However 1	the law and the court are24 equally guilty of a violation of human  rights.25 A VOICE:	Fix the mike.

IDA POLLACK:	There' s one4 law right now right here in our State called  the5 Erstadt Law which gives the State full  authority6 to regulat e the housing of the City of New York.7 A mayor, who would  truly8 represent all of the people of our City,  would9 have spent his t ime, energy, money and  influence10 in trying to eradicat e that law instead of , like11 a spoiled brat , stumping for a new toy, the West12 Side Stadium13 (Audience part icipation. )14 MS. IDA POLLACK:	It is the15 21st century and it 's shameful that seniors, the16 working poor, the lower and middl e class,  the17 disabled and the very many unemployed these  days18 are forced to scrounge for a place to call   home19 where they can be sheltered from the elements   and20 feel secure and enjoy privacy.21 These are elementary human  needs22 and, therefore, human rights. Yet every year   we23go through this game of crying poverty  when,in24fact , the only motivation is greed and neverever25need.

I'll9	wrap up.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11	MS. IDA POLLACK:	The tenants12 of this City are demanding no increase at all.   We13 are not happy as our Mayor tells us we should  be.14 Tenants should be happy, he said  publicly,15 because they were offered such a small   increase.16 Any increase for tenants in this17 City is too much.18 The real estate industry in this19 City is a monopoly.

2	you - -3	A VOICE:	Speak a little louder.4	MR. MICHAEL LADEN:	- - for5 those of you who have worked for so many   years.6 And I'm deeply touched by the last statement   and7 some of the others I have heard. Thank you   so8 much.9	Michael Ladin is my name.  I've10 lived in the East Village part of the Lower  East11 Side. By that statement you can say a Lower  East12 Side Nationalist.13 I was distributing leaflets  at14 the Second Avenue Station at First Avenue  and15 Houston the past few days. And I was  deeply16 touched there by the intensity and the sadness  in17 the looks and the eyes of the people as  I18 mentioned	these things. I make a pitch, you  know.19 And many rushing by. A few stopped and I was   able20 to talk to a few. I gave out about a  thousand21 leaflets.22 And  it was exhausting.  And , of23 course, the heat  yesterday.24 There were three young adults in25 particular.  Two of  them  - -  this is very important10 
2 - - entry level jobs. And one was  - - they are  both3 post - college , one approaching  middle  level barely4 able to hold on. One of them, this young  woman5	said to me, I've been here for three months,   I6 have this wonderful job and I'm finding out   I7 can't live and no money to spend. I'm  losing8 money. I have to cut down on food. I don' t  have9 entertainment.10 I gave her some advice on how  to11 get a raise in pay. I don' t know if she'll  take12 it.13 I told her to tell her boss  that14 this is an advance of her increase that  she'll15 get when she become a supervisor. I don' t know  if16 that will work.17 The other one: my landlord18 called me yesterday. His off ice called me. From19 $1250 he' s going to raise me to $1550. What can  I20 do?21 The quality of life issues,  the22 things that support the mix in this City  is23 deteriorating. The Roman Catholic Church   is24 closing down a lot of their  facilities.25 You heard about the  food6 
2	pantries. You know about  that.3	My friends, if the landlords4 need our help, well ,  let them open their   books5 and let them go to the proper places to ask   for6 that assistance.7 I'm glad  - - we' ll be happy to8 help them. But this is not one of those  places.9 We don' t deal with the taxes here.10 I commiserate with them. I ' l l be11 glad to help them.12	There are 2 , 000,000, I13 understand , people  affected.  I'm  not  affected. I14 graduated  from the TIL program. But the  quality15 of life is such an  issue.16 Years ago Frank Sinatra sung  a17 song called "The House I Live In. " And the last18 line , if you would like to join in with me, "but19 especially the peopl e, that 's America to me. But20 especially the people , that ' s America to me. "21 And I thank you very  much.22 You've been very kind.23 (Audience participation. )24 MS.  LUSSKIN:	Lannie Hill ,25 please.13 
2	MR. LANNIE HILL:	My name is3 Lannie Hill. I live in an  SRO.4 My landlord has applied  and5	received from the City a Certif icate of No6 Harassment. This means that he can convert   my7 building into something other than an  SRO.8	Most all SRO owners, if  they9 can, are doing the same thing. Why should I  have10 to pay a rent increase now when he plans to   kick11	me out within the year?12 Since he has received  his13 Certificate of No Harassment , my landlord has14 allowed the building to run down. He  spends15 nearly no money to make repairs. Why should   he16 get more money when he refuses to keep  the17 building up?18 Why should I, along with  the19 elderly and the disabled who live in my   building,20 pay more?21 A VOICE:	You want an answer.2 2	MR. LANNIE HILL:	I do.2 3	MS. LUSSKIN:	So you are asking24 for a zero increase  again.25 MR. LANNIE HILL:	I am asking24 
2 for a zero increase in rents this  time,3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank4 you.5	MR. LANNIE HILL:	Thank you.6	(Audience participation. )7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Robert8 Sherwood , followed by Barbati Debi , followed   by9 Trina Semorile.10 MR. ROBERT SHERWOOD:11 Greet ings.12 You can certainly see  I'm13 disabled and I can ill afford any rent   increase14 of any kind.15 Let us remember the  provisos16 throughout your decisionmaking.17 Also I am calling for a  rent18 freeze for all regular tenants in this City,  plus19 a rent rollback for all irregular  tenants.20 Who is a regular tenant?  A21 regular tenant is one who enjoys the privil ege  of22 having a complete kitchen plus his or her   own23 privat e bath. Those tenants who do not have24 complete kitchen facilities or their own private25 bath, either/or or both, especially both,  but8 
2 either/or,  should have a rent rollback because3 they' re not living in a true home.4	Now, my building, The  Tempo,5 I've been told that corporations have bought   into6 it and sublet the units to  transients.7	Be that as it may, this is  a8 scam or a sham because the building  still9 functions substantially as a hotel. There' s no10 denying it.11	Now, philosophically, we've12 heard how great the City is. It 's the greatest  in13 the world. How can this be when it 's a colony  of14 Albany, being held hostage by the landed  gentry15 in the State of New York?16 I'm calling upon the Mayor  of17 this City plus a bipartisan committee of  all18 peopl e to go to Albany and work for home  rule.19 The first order of business  is20 to repeal the Erstadt Law and to make New   York21 truly the greatest city in the world by   letting22 it govern itself.23 If the rest of the State needs24 New York,  that ' s fine. Then they' d better divvy25 up and answer our needs and our desires   first.12 
2 We must have a day come  when3 this meeting is no longer necessary, that  the4 right thing is always done.5 The greatest good for the6 greatest number. Again, as I said in the past , no7 more mixing of small t ime and big t ime at this8 meeting. Let the small time take care of  itself9 with its own needs.10 We must have a situation  where11 perhaps the criterion is WWJD. What does  that12 mean? What would Jesus do? Think about  it.13 Again, rent freeze for  regulars,14 rollback for irregulars. I'm an  irregular.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Herbati Debi.18 Are you here?19 (No response. )20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Trina21 Semorile.22 Af ter Ms. Semorile will be23 Councilmember Gail Brewer and Walter  Gambin.24 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	My name is25 Trina Semorile and I'm just going to read  my2 
2 testimony quickly to make time go quickly  for3 everyone' s sake.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.5	MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	The RGB6 has dismissed , ignored and directly worsened the7 condit ions in which tenants live.8 Mr. Markus, the Chair, has9 legitimized the disgraceful privileging  of10 unbridled greed by landlords in claiming  at11 annual hearings that the RGB has no control  over12 these condit ions, a specious claim the Board uses13 to overlook the legal requirement to take  these14 factors into account when setting rent  increases.15 Landlords cont inue to claim they16 need massive  increases simply to maintain and17 repair buildings and cover increasing costs,   such18 as fuel. Such claims have repeatedly been  proven19 false not only by formal research, but  the20 test imony regarding bot h building conditions and21 rent burden.22 When small landlords  claim23 hardship, I have yet to hear any member of  the24 RGB ask if they have filed for a  hardship25 increase which would require proof  through6 
1	2862 opening their books. Please start asking  that3 question each t ime hardship is claimed.4 Landlords are not using5 increased rents for maintenance,	repair or hazard6 abatement , such as lead and asbestos, or living7 wages for workers, but rather as  windfall8 prof its.9 Further, there is no  incentive10 for landlords to control costs because they   are11 allowed to simply transfer all costs to  tenants,12 including taxes.13 Supers wast e water by running14 hoses for long periods on sidewalks rather than15 sweeping, bucket and brush cleaning and a   quick16 rinse with a hose.17 Heat is either non- existent. A18 record 5,000 heat complaints were registered  on19 January 18th alone, twice the usual number on20 that day. Many simply suffer without  documenting21 their lack of heat because prior complaints  have22 gone unheard and unprosecuted.23 Boil ers are not monitored and24 adjust ed during temperature  changes causing25 tenants with heat to open windows to  prevent2 
2 parboiling,  wasting fuel.3 Tenants pay the bill , yet  the4 RGB continues to give ever higher increases,   even5 in years when costs do not increase , a violation6 of its own regulations.7 Discrimination  against women,8 women with children and people of color  continues9 unabated; ever- escalating harassment  of tenants10 for prof it and pleasure continues not to be  taken11 seriously or prosecut ed , and women are seen as12 especially easy targets of displacement  by13 harassment and threats of  violence.14 Because of ongoing wage15 discrimination,	income and Social Security  for16 women remains lower. One consequence is that   the17 majority are renters and rent  increases18 perpetuate  and worsen conditions for women19 through an unacknowledged	sub rosa effect of such20 discrimination.21 Today, however, I would like  to22 focus on disabled tenant hardships. The last  RGB23 increase of 6.5 percent increased my rent  alone24 almost fifty percent of my income by $56.65.  This25 may not sound like a lot of money, but it is   an2 
1	2882 enormous amount for a fixed income and is  without3 any maintenance,  repair or benefit of4 accommodation  to me.5 The Social Security cost  of6 living increase for 2005 is 2.7 percent , a7 disparity of 3 .8 percent without factoring costs8 other than rent alone.9	My SSD check is insuff icient to10 cover the cost of my rent and has been  for11 several years. Congress changed the law for12 retirees allowing retention of  benefits13 regardless of wages earned. The disabl ed are14 limited to $700 per mont h, $1000 a mont h if15 you're blind, if they are able to  work.16 For them, for those who can17 work, employment discrimination  in hiring is  the18 rule rather than the exception, worsened by  high19 general unemployment  rates.20 SSI and SSD recipients are  often21 living on very small amounts, yet changes in22 eligibility requirements for food stamps  have23 left many without access to that  assistance,24 despite lacking enough income for  sufficient25 food.10 
2 In addition, many are medicat ion3 poor as a direct consequence of efforts  to4 privatize Medicare  and pharmaceutical	company5 prof iteering, which is especially diff icult in6 New York.7 These factors alone  create8 severe hardships for disabled tenants, many  of9 whom have no access to programs for the  elderly10 because we are under sixty- five.11 The Department  of Buildings12 continues to ignore and not enforce  requirements13 of accessibility in new and  reconstructed14 buildings, permanently  denying access to disabled15 tenants.16 In addition, Michael  Bloomberg17 continues to renege on his campaign promise  to18 include the disabled in the SCRIE  program,19 claiming cost as a factor. Yet the cost  of20 homelessness  is far higher.21 Huge sums that subsidize22 substandard inaccessible housing go to   landlords23 while the bootless poor are blamed for  not24 pulling  themselves up by  their bootstraps : " hey,25 look at  all the money	'thrown at the problem. ' "2 
1	2902 It 's time to stop throwing money3 at the rich and recognize accessibl e and4 affordable  housing  as a human  right .5 I remind you that the majority6 of homeless shelters are inaccessibl e with no7 legal requirement for retrofitting. The8 consequence is many disabled living in  the9 streets and subject to police harassment  and10 other forms of violence.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to12 wrap up.13 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	I will.14 I'm almost done .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.16 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:17 Wheelchairs  should not be considered mobile  homes18 for residents of New York.19 I am in the eighth year  of20 seeking disability accommodations mandated under21 Local Law #58 from my landlord , Nesor Associates,22 owned by Yetta and Benjamin Rosen, after  complet e23 reconstruction of my apartment due to a   fire,24 agreed to in Housing Court.25 The apartment was  rebuilt12 
2 without the benefit of the required  DOB3 inspect ion and permit and the contractors were4 explicitly ordered to install standard fixtures .5 They have paid far more to their lawyer,  William6 Eberight of Borah, Goldstein, Altshuler  and7 Schwartz, than such accommodations would  cost.8	I am now in the process of 9 having to file an Art icle 78 by self -10 representat ion because  I can 1    t afford  a lawyer,11 another limitation denying rights of  tenants.12 The New York City Commission  on13 Human Rights is a party to this filing  through14 its own discriminatory actions, first by ignoring 1516 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you17 wrap up, pl ease?18 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	I 1  m almost19 done.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You told me21 that a while ago. Plus we forgot to push  the22 button, so you 1   re way over.2 3	MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	Okay .24 Since lots of peopl e have gone25 way  over,  1 1    11 read the last paragraph  and be24 
2done.3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Appreciate4it.5MS. TRINA SEMORILE:The RGB is  6 directly responsible by its actions  for7 contributing to severe hardship  and homelessness8 in New York City.9 A recent article in Met10 Council 's paper,	"Tenant/Inquilino, "  showed that11 poor New Yorkers fear rent increases more   than12 terrorism, and for good reason. The former is   far13 more likely to cripple and kill in spite  of14 direct invitation to the latter by  Bush15 administrat ion act ions and policies and regularly16 hyperinflat ed fear-mongering.17 You have a still  unfulfilled18 duty not only to the law, but to the right  and19 justice for tenants in act ing on the evidence of20 rents which are out of control and services   which21 exist only theoret ically, but not in fact.22 I ask you to prove wrong  my23 belief that you will continue to support   the24 landlords' overdeveloped	sense of entitlement and 25	underdeveloped	sense of responsibility  through6 
2 increasing their windfall prof its.3 (Audience participat ion.)4	MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	And I5 would just like to say one brief thing in   answer6 to something a landlord said earlier about   lead7 abatement.8 I want to remind this Board  and9 everybody here that lead is a public  health10 hazard. It 's not just a hazard to children.11 Children are the canaries of a coal mine. And   so12 lead needs to be abated and the landlords  spent13 thousands and thousands of  dollars14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	to16 fight a lead law. Let them spend it on  abatement.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 Thank you.19 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	Thank you.20 (Audience participat ion.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Councilmember22 Gail Brewer.23 COUNCILMEMBER GAIL BREWER:24 Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Members   of25 the Rent Guidelines  Board.5 
2My name is Gail Brewer and  I3represent theWest Side of Manhattan and  the4northern partof Clinton.5And it 's a community that has6 the second largest stock of rent  regulated7 apartments in the City. Obviously there are  many8 families that want to be able to stay, but it 's a9 real challenge given the affordability. And  I10 think that you read this in the papers, but  when11 you're in our office, you see it on the  ground.12 I've been doing this work for a very long   time13 and I've never seen such rents and such  real14 estat e fever.15 Our City is emerging from  a16 citywide recession. We have been hit with  the17 highest rate of inflation. I think you know   that.18 It ' s a very  tough economic  climate, particularly19 when you are facing a housing  shortage.20 And the situation is  worsening.21 Financial hardship is widespread and rent   hikes22 have been very large in the last couple of   years.23 I don' t need to tell you what they are because24 you know what they are. And tenants have a   median25 income of only $32,000 a year, meaning that  many6 
2 of them are lower than  that.3 A growing number of  apartments4 are leaving - -  in my community  I have twenty- two5 Mitchell - Lama programs/developments	that are6 rental and those that are stabilized. Those  that7 are rentals and co-ops, obviously many of  them8 are no longer part of the Mitchell - Lama program.9 They are part of the Landlord Assistance   Program10 and Hans Votre	(phonetic) Program.11 And we are quite panicked  I12 would say because the fact is that the  Rent13 Guidelines Board decision today impacts14 dramatically those that are leaving the  programs,15 those families and those  individuals.16 We are also, of  course , faced17 with a Court of Appeals decision this week,   again18 another major  challenge  for Mitchell - Lama19 tenants, indicating that tenants who moved  in20 before July 1, 1971, only they will be   eligible21 for rent stabilization based on the rent as you22 leave Mitchell - Lama.2 3	This is a real challenge when an24 apartment in a nearby community, right next   door,25 can go for $6,000 or $7,000 a month for  three24 
  2 bedrooms, even $25,000 a month in some   cases.3 And so the fact of the matt er is4 what we really want is some relief in Albany,   to5 pass the Padavan Bill , 82061, which would mean6 that all Mitchell - Lamas when going privat e would7 be stabilized. But we don' t have that in  the8 interim. We need the Rent Guidelines  Board.9 We are losing a  significant10 number of affordabl e apartments through high  rent11 vacancy decontrol , a terrible bill.12 And I just want to ment ion that ,13 I think you've heard this before , but where  there14 are so many buildings that are a mixture of   rent15 controlled, rent stabilized and what I  call16 vacancy or high rent vacancy, it would seem to   me17 that we could have some kind of a proviso,  just18 as the hotels and the SROs do, if twenty- five19 percent are this high rent vacancy and the rest   2 0	are rent regulation, there should be no   increase21 for those units.22 (Audience participation.)23 COUNCILMEMBER GAIL BREWER:	The24 Rent Guidelines Board needs to also think   about25 those who were formerly homel ess moving into the21 
2 Housing Stability Plus. The Commissioner  of3 Homeless Services came up with this program4 because there is one unit of Sect ion 85 certificat e left from Washington, another6 challenge.7 That program may or may  not8 work. I have my doubts. But the fact of  the9 matt er is once the five years is up, that  public10 assistance tenant is supposed to be able to  pay11 his or her own rent.12 Again, we need the Rent13 Guidelines Board.14 Single room occupancy buildings,15 resident ial hotels, Ann Cunningham has been16 coming to the Rent Guidelines Board longer  than17 you I think Mr. Chairman. And the fact of  the18 matter is these are buildings where the   rent19 increase should not go up at all. There  should20 not be any increase for these residents. They   are21 the ones that are most at risk. Many of them  now22 are also facing the probl em of tourism and I  may23 add bedbugs.24 I want to conclude by  just25 talking about our seniors who live in  rent2 
2 stabilized and rent controlled apartments.  I3 remind the Rent Guidelines Board that there are  -4 - the issue not only for seniors but others   in5 terms of preferent ial rents and the 2003 change6 to the rent stabilizat ion law, this is a real7 challenge, particularly seniors who have been8 coming in who didn't know what they had  signed9 and they are finding that once their lease is   up,10 they have a dramatic renewal  challenge.11 And I know that 's not your12 problem specifically, but it is because if we   had13 affordable rents, they wouldn' t be signing14 preferential	leases.15 You know as well as I do  that16 the inflation is rising, real income is   dropping,17 the number of rent stabilized and rent  controlled18 apartments is falling, and many  buildings19 include , as I indicated earlier, market  as   well20 as regulated apartments or even co-ops and  rent21 regulated apartments,  giving the owners22 addit ional income to pay for their insurance ,23 taxes and other costs.24 I strongly urge the Rent25 Guidelines Board not to raise rents or not   to2 
2 have any increase in 2005. I feel very   strongly3 about this.4 Thank you very much.5 (Audience participat ion.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you for your8 testimony.9 One of the concerns this  year,10 as every year, is that we know that  operating11 costs in terms of maintaining good housing  stock12 is a problem.13 We also know that the income  of14 people who want to be in rent stabilized  is15 gett ing lower, and we want them to be able to16 move into good stock.17 I was just hoping that you  would18 share with us any other thoughts that you have.  I19 know that your district has the second  highest20 number of rent stabilized apartments as   anyplace21 else in the City.22 And the probl ems with regard to23 affordability  have  come  - - we've heard  from the24 Mi tchell - Lama people, public housing peopl e ,25 Section 8 , all of which is not in our direct
