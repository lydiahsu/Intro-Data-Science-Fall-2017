1	3012 ever lived in fear? That 's what the rent3 stabilized tenants are doing. We are afraid  of4 losing our homes .5 Stuyvesant Town/Peter Cooper6 residents are being pushed out by rising  rent7 costs and MCis added on to these  rents.8 Landlords are saying they don' t9 make money . But  - - I can't speak for the  entire10 landlord population of New York City, but here  is11 what is occurring in Stuyvesant  Town/Peter12 Cooper .13 If you pay $1000 monthly in  rent14 and wish to have a self - defrost refrigerator, $915 is added on to your monthly rent. A stove  costs16 approximately $8 monthly . Air conditioning a $18017 monthly for twelve months .18 All these additional charges  are19 added on to your base rent. And whenever the  RGB20 authorizes an increase, they are part of our  base21 rent and include it.22 Oh, by the way! Roof  renovation23 and new windows are considered MCis and  assessed24 to your base rent forever . Is this fair?25 Everything is considered an MCI .2 
1	3022 This is what is being done  to3 the Stuyvesant  Town/Peter  Copper residents .  The4 majority of residents recognize that the  landlord5 is in business and has to make money . But6 lifetime charging of improvements  is7 unconscionable.8	The landlords are doing this  so9 that our rents can be raised to the  $200010 decontrol level .11	So before you even consider 8 .512 and 5 percent increases, take into account  the13 high rents we are already paying. Not  everyone14 makes over $100, 000.15 In a survey taken in my building16 all the present tenants say they will have  to17 move if the rents keep escalating. They  simply18 cannot afford it . We are being driven out.19 The landlords say their  costs20 have gone up . They are still making enough to21 declare profits. Check their books. Maybe they  do22 have two sets of books. Look at the MTA .23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Could you24 wrap up? We forgot to push the button on you .  So25 it looks like you haven' t started yet .12 
1	30 32	Could you wrap up, please .3	MS. LILLIAN CATTERINA:	Okay.4 Sure.5 (Audience participation.)6	MS. LILLIAN CATTERINA:	Vacancy7 decontrol means having six people move into  a8 one-bedroom apartment to meet the rents.  Okay?9 But this is not what I'm here  to10 say . I 'm  begging  you. Don't  drive New Yorkers out11	of their homes. This is what will occur. We will12 have to leave New York, a City and State we  love.13 If this doesn' t touch you, think14 about the lost taxes and revenue .15 Thank you.16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Gertrude18 Schneider.19 Let me indicate who follows.20 After Gertrude Schneider  is21 Virginia Rosario, Roger Melzer, Parvat i Devi, and22 then Jimmy Silber .23 Gertrude Schneider.24 MS. GERTRUDE SCHNEIDER:	Mr.25 Marvin Markus and Members of the Rent  Guidelines12 
1	3042 Board:3 My name is Gertrude  Schneider,4 Secretary Emeritus of the Community  Housing5	Improvement Program and one of its  early founders 6	in 1967.7 Do the math. We can't provide8 decent housing with our increases in costs  of9 16.9 percent and cover them with a 5.8  percent10 and 8.5 percent  increases which you propose.11 With those paltry  increases you12 will seal the doom of affordable housing  because13 buildings no longer produce rental apartments  but14 will concentrate on condos and  coops.15 Building and management  of16 apartments is not the social experience  or17 experiment that protest ing tenants would have  you18 believe. They just want to protect their   sinecure19 which this outmoded law has prevailed  upon.20 (Audience participation.)21 MS. GERTRUDE SCHNEIDER:	Facts22 speak for themselves.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.24 MS. GERTRUDE SCHNEIDER:25 Tenants of the higher rental apartments  are7 
2 writing their own ticket. They are telling   the3 owners what they are willing to  pay.4 (Audience participation.)5 MS. GERTRUDE SCHNEIDER:6 Concessions  - -7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.8 MS.  GERTRUDE SCHNEIDER:9 Concessions are being given. Vacancies are a   fact10 of life.11	It is the lower rentals which12 need to be addressed. Tenants in the low- rent13 apartments do not move. Therefore, the  owner14 cannot apply the 18 percent vacancy allowance   so15 thoughtfully administered  by Joseph Bruno.16 (Audience participation.)17 MS. GERTRUDE SCHNEIDER:	Many18 of these owners19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet .20 MS. GERTRUDE SCHNEIDER:	Many21 of these owners are harboring tenants at rent -22 controlled rentals of less than $200 a  month.23 (Audience participation .)24 MS. GERTRUDE SCHNEIDER:	They25 may also have tenants whose rent is  frozen.12 
2 The best of worlds would be  to3 scrap rent regulation  for good and all  - -4 (Audience participation.)5	MS. GERTRUDE  SCHNEIDER:	- - and6	save the City and State a bundl e.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you8 wrap up.9 MS. GERTRUDE SCHNEIDER:	Other10 than this wish, you must come up with a  guideline11 of 11 percent.12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. GERTRUDE SCHNEIDER:	Mayor14 Koch announced that the City would go  bankrupt15 managing abandoned buildings and tore down  a16 great many during his  tenure.17 Do we want this chaos once  more?18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Virginia21 Rosario.22 MS. VIRGINIA ROSARIO:	Mr.23 Chairman and Members of the  Board:24 Virginia Rosario from  Stuyvesant25 Town.10 
2 The projected increases of  5.53 percent for one year and 8.5 for two years  are4 simply too high when combined with tax  increases,5 sales taxes, income taxes, transportat ion taxes6 and most of all , raises rather, and most of all7 the Major Capital Improvement rent  increases.8 In our community, Stuyvesant9 Town and Peter Cooper Village, we have had  at10 least three recent MCI increases and shortly  into11 the new lease, which we would sign October 1,  we12 will be given a new rent increase for our  roof13 replacement which meets the useful life  criteria,14 therefore it 's definite.15 That would mean 5.5 plus 6  or16 11.5 percent in the year one of the lease, or  8.517 plus 6 , or 14.5 percent for two years for18 landlords.19 Now, in addition to that , we20 have had at least ten percent of our  apartments21 restored  and  deregulated ,  ten percent renovated22 and deregulated , ten percent  warehoused ,  about23 twelve percent in a block to the New  York24 University students, about five percent are   in25 executive apartments.2 
2	If you add that up, you tell  me3 are landlords constantly and  continually4 deregulat ing or not. And at Stuyvesant Town and5 Peter Cooper Village, let me tell you how  the6 landlords are losing money.7 For $900 to $2000 a month that 's8 the deregulated amount . Now, the only others are9 the senior citizens who are  completely10 impoverished . They have only $750 a month in11 Social Security and they are on SCRIE .12 The other seniors, who  were13 going to the food banks, have had their rents   low14 because they are there since  1947 and	'48.15 Now, let me ask you a  question.16 Would I, as a member of the tenant  association,17 want to throw a 89-year old lady out on  the18 street? Why should I? Her husband fought in  the19 Second World War for this country and that  was20 the reason Stuyvesant Town was  built.21 (Audience participation.)2 2	MS . VIRGINIA ROSARIO:	My23 feeling is this. There is a fiscal  crisis.24 Landlords and real estate investors do deserve  a25 profit , but we all have to share this   pain .23 
2	When I retire, my pension  is3 going to be very low. Why? Because I  was4 profl igate? No. Because somebody had their5 fingers in the till in Wall Street. Let' s face6 it . If I have to share this burden, so does the7 real estate investor.8	Right now we' re all hurting. It9 is unfair to say they are the only ones in  pain.10 Everybody in the City, every investor is in  pain .11 All right?12 So my feeling is this. At13 Stuyvesant Town the residents are paying  our14 taxes, we' re still working, we' re not all seniors15 here and none of us are paying $238 a  month.16 Thank you very much.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 Roger Melzer.20 MR. ROGER MELZER:	My name is21 Roger Melzer. I'm the owner of a 27- family22 apartment building in Brooklyn and I just  came23 from that building where I work every day of   the24 week virtually.  I take Sundays off.25 I want to first read you  a9 
2 letter that I got from the bank that holds  my3 mortgage dated April 14, 2003 .4 It says: Dear Mortgagor: The5 recent New York City real estate tax  and6 insurance increases have caused large  deficits7 and shortages in many escrow accounts . Therefore,8 Dime Savings Bank of Williamsburg	chose to9 perform an interim analysis commencing with  your10 May 1, 2003 payment. The shortage has been  spread11 over twelve months and the deficiency over  two12 months. The next scheduled analysis will be  in13 September of 2003 .14 So I know I 'm not  collecting15 enough money to meet my mortgage and  escrow16 account. The bank knows it because they just  sent17 me a letter telling me they' re raising my monthly18 mortgage payments.19 But I don't understand why  you20 don' t understand that . And 5.5 and 8 or 8.521 percent for the guidelines is just not  enough.22 (Audience part icipation.)23 MR. ROGER MELZER:	For the past24 two years  - -  two years ago in the fiscal year  my25 real estate taxes were $18 ,500 . This year they2 
2 are going to be $28,000 .3 Two years ago my  insurance was  4	$7500. This year it 's $13 , 400 .5 Last year I spent $9600 on  fuel.6 This year I figure I 'm going to $13 , 600 on  fuel.7 These costs average about $50  to8 $60 per apartment per month.9 Last year most of my low- rent10 tenants under the 2 and 4 percent guidelines  took11 two year leases . I'm talking about people paying12 $475 to $500. That ' s $20 a month.  I'm  already13 short $40 per month on each of those  apartments14 that I'm not going to make up with their  two-15 year leases.16 So somehow your guidelines have17 to reflect the fact we've had two  disastrous18 years in a row in terms of costs. And last  year' s19 guidelines were definitely not enough. We  need20 low- rent adjustments, we need higher guidelines21 than you've  proposed .22 And I ask you to consider  that.23 I've actually got two rent -24 stabilized tenants that gave up their  girlfriends25 two years ago before they gave up  their5 
2 apartments because they would have had to  move.3 So that 's how much the whole system has skewed4 life in this City.5 Thank you.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	They couldn' t7 have been - -8 (Audience part icipation.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Parvati Devi.10 MS. PARVATI DEVI:	H . I11 I'm Parvati Devi and I  represent12 Disabled in Action. And I appreciate Adriene   your13 bringing up SCRIE.14 The disabled have no form  of15 SCRIE. The idea that you could put down  8.516 percent , I'm already spending seventy- five17 percent of my income. The woman was talking   about18 seniors getting $750. I get $639 a month.  That 's19 all I have to live on.20 Now, here we' re waiting	'till21 midnight  tonight seeing what they' re going to do22 in Albany, you know : First they wanted to take23 away some money from us on SSI. Now we are24 confront ed by this, 8.5 percent.25 We can't afford this. We  need10 
2 that SCRIE bill to be passed now . And you know3 something? An exception could be made . Everyone4 of you here could make a phone call to  Mayor5 Bloomberg because he' s the one who is preventing6 this bill from passing . They are ready to pass it7 upstate . More and more Republican senators have8 signed on to pass SCRIE. Your assistance,  your9 help, in this matter would be greatly  appreciated10 and you won 't find people with disabilities in11 the street and the cost of shelters and the  cost12 of nursing homes and what it 's going to bring13 upon us.14 Please, you got to do this . And15 you can do this right now before midnight .16 Thank you .17 MS . KAUFMAN:	Thank you.18 The next four speakers:  Jimmy19 Silber, then Thomas Syracuse, Judi Cheng  and20 Virginia Caswell.21 MR. JIMMY SILBER :	H •  .I22 I'm Jimmy Silber and I  represent23 SPONY, which is the Small Properties of New  York .24 We have about five hundred members in all   five25 boroughs in the City .2 
1	3142 You've heard a lot of  our3 members testify today at the  hearings.4 The one thing that the  small5 property owner has in common with each other is6 that almost all of us live in the buildings  that7 we own. These are the best - run buildings in New8 York. The owners of these buildings get  along9 fine with their tenants. We share common  needs.10 We want to make sure our buildings are secure.   We11 want to make sure they are clean. We want to   make12 sure they' re habitable. We want to make sure we13 have heat and hot water because they' re our14 homes. We live in them also. We share them  with15 our tenants.16 The small owner is an  endangered17 species in this City because of this system  and18 it 's the small owner who falls through the cracks19 by what happens with the Rent Guidelines   Board.20 These are the people that  we21 need to preserve  in New York to maintain  these22 buildings because if they give up, if they   walk23 away from their buildings,  they' re not replaced24 by people who live in the buildings and take   care25 of them. They' re replaced usually by speculators.2 
2 And communities actually3 deteriorate  - that 's a known fact  - when  owners4 don' t live there. We need to protect small5 owners.6 But when we have  - - when the7 Mayor decides and the City Council approves  an8 18.5 percent tax hike in December and the  Rent9 Guidelines Board proposes a 5.5 percent  rent10 increase, the small owner gets punished .11 When insurance costs go up  40.612 percent this last year and the Board proposes  a13 5.5 percent increase, the small owner  gets14 punished.15 When fuel goes up 66.9 percent16 this last year and the Board proposes  5.5 , it ' s17 the small owner who loses  out.18 Utilities go up 21 percent , the19 Board proposes 5.5 percent , the small owner20 loses.21 The small owner is a vital part22 of this City and small owners are sympathetic  to23 tenant affordability. But tenant affordability  is24 not an issue for the Rent Guidelines Board. It 's25 an issue for the Legislature. The Legislature  has2 
2 had ample time to clean up this mess of  rent3 regulation so that people earning over  $100,0004 are not protected by this unfair system and  pay5 below market rents.6 The Legislature ,  the City7 Council , SCRIE programs, they can affect8 affordability. This Board has to take  the9 initiative to make sure that you provide  income10 for owners to maintain their buildings .11 The Price Index was 16 .9 percent12 this year .13 (Audience participation.)14 MR . JIMMY SILBER:	Small owners15 need more than 5 .5 percent.16 MS . KAUFMAN :	Thank you.17 (Audience participation.)18 MS. ADAMS :	What would you say19 that they need?20 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	I would say21 that with the 16 .9 percent Price Index, look,  the22 Price Index every year is a guide that the  Board23 uses to come up with a number. It 's rough24 justice . It 's across the board. It affects25 everybody.2 
2 Our number is 10 percent on  a3 one-year lease.4 MS. KAUFMAN:	Howard.5 (Audience participation.)6	MS. KAUFMAN:	Quiet , please.7	MR. LUBELL:	Mr. Silber, do you8	know what the Core Price Index was this  year?9	MR. JIMMY SILBER:	The Core10 Price Index was a little over 10  percent.11 MR. LUBELL:	Do you recall what12 it was last year when the increase was only 2   and13 4 percent?14 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	I believe it15 was about five  something.16 MR. LUBELL:	Six percent.17 How old is your building,  Mr.18 Silber?19 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	My building20 is seventy  - -  over eighty years old.21 MR. LUBELL:	Could you tell us22 what kind of maintenance  requirements an  eighty-23 year old building needs?24 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Well , the25 thing that the Price Index doesn' t measure is  the10 
2 maintenance on a building like mine because  the3 frequency, where I have to call a plumber  for4 repairs, increases each year. It just stands  to5 reason . As a building ages, you're going to have6 to call a plumber for more repairs. That 's never7 measured by the Price  Index.8 MS. KAUFMAN:	Okay.9 Marty.10 MR. ZELNIK:	I've asked you this11 question before at different meetings but I  would12 like to ask it today because obviously you  are13 representing  SPONY and small property owners.14 Should there be a difference15 between  guidelines  passed  for, quote , small16 properties versus larger from your perspective?17 Should there be a different ial that would somehow18 reflect the fact that smaller properties,  older19 properties, propert ies that are being managed20 that may have been built in the 1860s or  early21 l900s are obviously more diff icult to maintain22 over the years?23 Do you see a way where  the24 guidelines could be different rather than  broad-25 based all over?2 
2 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Well ,3 there' s a lot of different factors, you know, for4 small building owners. There are  landmark5 buildings. They require special  assistance.6 They' re not dealt with at all by the Price Index7 or by the Rent Guidelines  Board.8 If - - you know, if we have  a9 Price Index that 's 16.9 percent and this Board is10 only offering 5.5 percent for a one-year  lease,11 then I would say, yes, you got to do something   in12 addit ion to that to help small owners.13 If you're willing to help every14 owner of property in this City who deserves  it15 because of the high increase in costs, then  at16 least you should help a small property  owner.17 So if you can't give an  adequate18 rent increase for everybody across the board ,19 give 12 percent for small property  owners.20 (Audience participation.)21 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	The City22 came out in December  - -23 MS. KAUFMAN:	Quiet , please.24 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	- - and they25 said we have a horribl e financial crisis in the2 
1	3202 City. And everybody who owns property has to  help3 us solve this crisis.4 So they raised our tax rate  by5 18 .5 percent .6 Well , doesn' t it stand to  reason7 that likewise those inhabitants of buildings,  who8 are living in those buildings, should also  absorb9 some of this increase? Why should the burden  fall10 solely on the individual man or woman who happens11 to own the building?12 (Audience participat ion.)13 MS. KAUFMAN:	Okay . Thank you14 (Audience participation.)15 MS . KAUFMAN :	Thomas Syracuse,16 then Judi Cheng and then Virginia Caswell .17 Thomas Syracuse.18 MR. THOMAS SYRACUSE:	I19 represent  the Teacher  - - Retired  Teacher Advocate20 Caucus of the United Federation of  Teachers21 (Audience participation .)22 MR . THOMAS SYRACUSE:	and23 the Committee to Protect Rent Controlled  Tenants.24 The question before this  Board25 is not whether landlord costs have increased,  but2 
1	321  2 if these increases have made regulated  buildings3 substantially less prof itable than before, and if4 tenants should or can assume recent increases  in5 the fuel and real estate taxes .6 If you examine the statistics7 that your Board , based upon the U .S. Census8 Bureau and the New York City Department  of9 Finance and published in the Housing and  Vacancy10 Survey, the following facts emerge .11 The vacancy rate in New York12 City in 2002 was only 2.9 percent , far less than13 the 5 percent considered to be a  housing14 emergency, and demand so outstrips supply  that15 new tenants looking for apartments in  the16 unregulated market must double or triple up  to17 af ford rents.18 After years of increases,  even19 regulated apartments have  become unaffordable	for20 low and moderate- income tenants.21 Citywide the average monthly22 stabilized rent was already $781 in 2001, and   in23 Manhattan below 96th Street the average was 24	$1,023 .25	Half of all City tenants  earn
1	3222 less than $31,000 a year in 2001. More than  half3 of stabilized tenants pay more than 28 percent  of4 their income in rent and rent controlled  tenants5 pay more than 33 percent of their income in rent ,6 and more than half of all tenants pay more  than7 50 percent of their income in  rent.8	MS. KAUFMAN:	Wrap up, please.9	MR. THOMAS SYRACUSE:	The10 Citizens Housing and Planning Council states  that11 since 1993 many elderly and single women  with12 children face long periods where  their rent   - -13 where they cannot afford their  rent.14 So considering all of this,  any15 additional increases would be a great  hardship16 for hundreds of thousands of tenants. But  would17 it also be a hardship on landlords not getting   an18 increase?19 MS. KAUFMAN:	Please wrap up.20 MR. THOMAS SYRACUSE:	According21 to the Department of Finance the cost- to- income22 ratio in stabilized buildings was that of  every23 dollar of income, fifty- six percent went for24 costs, leaving forty- four percent  for profit and25 debt service. And in Manhattan south of  96th10 
2 Street landlords got fifty- one percent prof it.3 And average rents  from4 stabilized tenants rose by almost five percent  in  5	2001.6	In Central Harlem  - -7	MS. KAUFMAN:	We need to move on8	to the next speaker.9	MR. THOMAS SYRACUSE:	- -	9.310	percent	- -11	MS. KAUFMAN:	Thank you very12 much.13 Thank you.14 MR. THOMAS SYRACUSE:	All15 right.16 In summary, in summary, despit e17 spikes in fuel costs and taxes, landlord  prof its18 have been and will be sufficiently high to   assume19 these costs without hardship. And this cannot   be20 said for tenants' ability to assume  these21 increases.22 MS. KAUFMAN:	Thank you.23 MR. THOMAS SYRACUSE:	In24 fact ,25 (Audience participation.)12 
2	MS. KAUFMAN:	Thank you.3	MR. THOMAS SYRACUSE:4 331,000 non- payment filings have been filed in5 Housing Court in 2002.6	MS. KAUFMAN:	We need to move7	on. I 'm sorry. Thank you very much.8 MR. THOMAS SYRACUSE:	Okay.9 I call on this Board to reduce10	its preliminary	increases11	MS. KAUFMAN:	Judi Cheng.12 We need to move to the next13 speaker.14 MR. THOMAS SYRACUSE:	or15 even freeze rents at their present level .16 MS. KAUFMAN:	Thank you.17 Judi Cheng , please.18 (Audience participation.)19 MS. JUDI CHENG:	I'm here to20 speak on behalf of those, my aging parents  and21 myself. My parents have lived in Village  View22 Housing for the last thirty- two years. I 'm the23 daughter of Chinese immigrants. My mother  worked24 in garment factories for the last twenty  years25 and my father in Chinese kitchens for the  last12 
2	thirty- two years.3	They receive about  $600 - - their4 rent is about $600 a month and their  Social5 Security income is approximately $850 a  month6 combined.7 This is hardly enough to pay  for8 rent and all the other expenses that  are9 necessary in a City as large as New  York.10 I myself , I recently graduated11 from Hunter Coll ege, City University of New York,12 in May of 2002.13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. JUDI CHENG:	And I have15 since been unable to find a job that pays  more16 than $25, 000 a year.17 This is my situation. I am  very18 low-paid and I'm having to pay my own rent  as19 well as the rising costs of gas, ut ilit ies,20 telephone, cable, Metro fare, sales tax, you  name21 it. The prices of everything have gone  up.22 I think that Members of the23 Panel should please have some consideration  for24 the working  class of New York City  - -25 (Audience part icipat ion.)4 
2	MS. JUDI CHENG:	- - who built3 this City, who live here and who should have   some4 say in the way that things are run in this City.5 We've been paying rents  day6 after day, month after month, and for  decades,7 and we have yet to see benef its in the  situation.8 The peopl e who live in Village9 View are paying more and more in rents every   year10 and we would like to see that level  stabilized.11 I want to speak on behalf  of12 young people because as you can see I'm not13 retired. I am struggling and this is true of  many14 of my peers as well.15 (Audience participation.)16 MS. JUDI CHENG:	As a young17 person, I demand that the quality of life  be18 improved for working people in New York City.  And19 we say put a stop to the landlords. Why don' t  we20 evict landlords and confiscat e their property?21 (Audience participation.)22 MS. JUDI CHENG:	Enough with the23 rent increases already.24 Thank you.25 MS. KAUFMAN:	Thank you.3 
2	(Audience participation.)3	MS. KAUFMAN :	Virginia Caswell .4	The next three speakers,  please5 come forward : Dawn Sullivan, Sona Fink, Susan6 Steinberg .7 Ms . Caswell .8	MS. VIRGINIA CASWELL:	My name9 is Virginia Caswell and I live in a rent -10 stabilized apartment in Stuyvesant Town .11 I work as a secretary in a  law12 firm.13 When I heard from a friend  that14 the Rent Guidelines Board was recommending a  2415 percent  increase - -16 A PARTICIPANT:	Louder.17 MS . VIRGINIA CASWELL :	When I18 heard from a friend that the Rent  Guidelines19 Board was recommending a 24 percent increase on  a20 two-year lease, I was in shock. Then the  media21 reported that they lowered it to 8.5  percent.22 Everyone  breathed  a sigh of relief , only  8 .523 percent.24 This was a calculated tactic.  In25 that context  it is "only an 8 .5 increase, "9 
2 whereas in reality an 8.5 percent  increase is3 ridiculously high. I do not get salary  increases4 of 8.5 or even 5.5 percent.5 Since I moved into my  apartment6 nine years ago, my rent has gone up 47  percent.7 Yearly increases are not the only sources  of8 addit ional income for landlords. In addition to  a9 twenty percent vacancy  increase, and sometimes10 huge vacancy decontrol increases, among others,11 the landlords also have Major Capital   Improvement12 increases.13 I am paying MCI increases  for14 electric wiring, for windows, and there  are15 rumors of an MCI increase for roofs. And , as  you16 know, these MCI increases become a permanent   part17 of the base rent , continuing even after  landlords18 have recouped their costs for the  improvements.19 I am a baby boomer and I have  to20 think about retirement.  If rent increases21 continue at current rates, when retirement  comes22 and my income falls off a cliff , I will not be23 able to stay in my  apartment.24 Will I wait until retirement  to25 make changes? I am already rethinking my   options.2 
2 I hope you are well aware that current rent   laws3 are forcing the middle class to move out of  New4 York sooner rather than later.5 (Audience participation.)6	MS. VIRGINIA CASWELL:	And that7 is the real question here: what kind of a  city8 are we trying to create? I am sure you will   agree9 that we need to keep New York as vibrant , diverse10 and interesting as it has historically  been.11 I know that keeping the middl e12 class in New York is necessary to achieve this.13 I would love to have you  answer14 two quest ions.15 First of all , I heard that if16 smaller landlords are having difficulty making   a17 prof it , they can go to the DHCR, open their18 books, and apply for a hardship  increase.19 (Audience participation.)20 MS. VIRGINIA CASWELL:	Is this21 true?22 And  secondly, if this fail - safe23 is built into the system, why recommend such   high24 increases which are totally out of balance  with25 the rest of the economy and which will  mainly7 
2benef ita few at the expense of many?3I would like to thank you  in4advancefor answering my questions.5MS. KAUFMAN:	Thank you very6much .7(Audience participation.)8MS . KAUFMAN:	Dawn Sullivan.9	MS . DAWN SULLIVAN:	H ,  I10 My name is Dawn Sullivan and  I'm11 chair of the East Side Tenants Coalition  which12 represents thousands of tenants on the East  Side13 of Manhattan.14 We are deeply concerned  about15 the affordable housing crisis that  exists16 throughout the City and we are  particularly17 alarmed about the high preliminary  guidelines18 that you've adopted and how it will worsen  the19 situation.20 Through no fault of yours,  you21 were named to your positions on very short22 notice. You were asked to vote before you  could23 fully familiarize yourselves with the24 complexities involved with your responsibilities.25 We hope you will give us a fair hearing and   then10 
2 decide to lower the 5.5 and 8.5  percentages3 because these increases will be devastating  to4 the lives of tenants.5 We do telephone counseling  and6 we constantly hear from people who are scared   to7 death. Over the years I've learned that my   own8 financial dilemma of being an aging New Yorker   is9 something that I share with  many.10 Every percentage point  you11 impose on us pushes us closer to having to  leave12 the City that we love and have raised  our13 families in. Will our communities miss us if  we14 go? I truly believe so. I'm on the Board of  my15 Police Precinct. I'm President of my  Block16 Association.	Other long- time residents I know17 well volunteer in our schools and hospitals.   Yes,18 I do think we will be missed.19 Every time we do a mailing,  we20 receive back a large number of returns  with21 expired forwarding orders. These tenants  don't22 move to the boroughs. They've left the  state.23 They're gone. We' ll never get them back.24 I recognize the names of many25 and believe me these were true blue New  Yorkers2 
2 who really loved the City.3 Small owners who properly4 maintain their buildings, as the last  speaker5 mentioned , do have an option to file for6 hardship. All they have to do is open their  books7 to prove the condition  exists.8 Tenants in need do not have  such9 an option. Please, I beg you, keep that in  mind10 when you vote.11 Most tenants feel safer having  a12 two- year lease. And the tenants who are renewing13 this year paid 6 percent two years ago. In  the14 2003 Income and Expense Study the core  Manhattan15 rents were $1182 , which is in line with what we16 and other tenants we know are  paying.17 MS. KAUFMAN:	Wrap up, please.18 MS. DAWN SULLIVAN:	An increase19 of 8.5 percent on my rent would be $86.79  a20 month. That is serious food money and we  are21 fighting an MCI of $63 per  room.22 MS. KAUFMAN:	We need you to23 wrap up.24 MS. DAWN SULLIVAN:	Please, I25 ask you, bear these things in mind. It takes  a2 
2 lot for us to get down here.3 The landlords have  deregulated4 apartments in every building that they' re getting 5	$4,000, $5,000, $6,000 for.6	For God' s sake, take that into7 consideration  - -8 (Audience participation.)9	MS. DAWN SULLIVAN:	- - when you10 start to feel sorry for  them.11 MS. KAUFMAN:	Thank you very12 much.13 MS. DAWN SULLIVAN:	Thank you.14 (Audience participation.)15 MS.  KAUFMAN:	Faith  Steinberg -16 - Sona Fink, excuse me. Sona  Fink.17 MS. SONA FINK:	Hl'  .I18 My name is Sona Fink. I've  lived19 in a rent - stabilized  Peter Cooper20 Village/Stuyvesant	Town apartment  for forty- two21 years.22 (Audience participation.)23 MS. SONA FINK:	And I have no24 plans to move unless I can no longer afford   it.25 I'm typical of many  retired10 
  2 professionals.	I 've lost my spouse . I live on3 Social Security plus the income I can  generate4 from what once seemed like solid savings,  an5 annual sum that provided modest comfort  when6 interest rates were 8 percent or even 6  percent.7 I have no pension. Things,8 particularly the security of my home , look a lot9 less comfortabl e right now, especially in view of10 the substantial permanent Major  Capital11 Improvement increases our landlord , MetLife, has12 pending.13 As I speak, Chase Manhattan14 Bank' s "High Yield'' savings account is yielding15 slightly more than 1/2 of 1 percent per  year.16 Money markets are paying under 1 percent.  Two-17 year Treasury notes are at 1.08 percent , and only18 an investment that risks capital is paying  more19 than 4 percent.20 Not  surprisingly, retirement21 incomes are sharply down.22 Even at an overall 4 percent , it23 takes investments of about $500, 000 plus $1000 a24 month from Social Security to generate an income 25	of $32,000 a year.2 
2 The suggest ion that those whose3 investments fall a mite short of that half - a-4 million should pay an additional month' s rent  per5 year, which is what an 8.5 percent  increase6 represents, is out of touch with both the  economy7 and reality.8 (Audience participation.)9 MS. SONA FINK:	It is - -10 MS.  KAUFMAN:	Quiet , please.11 MS. SONA FINK:	It is unfair.12 It is bizarre. It is  obscene.13 I ask you to carefully  consider14 what effect the decision you make in the next   two15 days will have on the many, many New Yorkers16 whose standard of living you are likely  to17 sharply diminish.18 These are peopl e who earned19 substantial money when $50,000 a year was a  big20 deal and a new Chevy cost $4,500, put their   kids21 through college with their own dollars,  planned22 the future by carefully saving for  their23 retirement years, and are now threatened  with24 living inches from  disaster.25 Thank you.2

TOM CASPER:	Hl•  .I12 Listening to the yearly  antics13 of these hearings is like a bad episode of  The14 Twil ight Zone.15 We keep warping between16 realities here. The paid directors of so- called17 not - for-profits organizat ions charge $700 for an18 apartment. Okay? And they get them built  with19 grant money. Okay?20 Rent  Guidelines  Board , your own21 minimum cost calculation, corrected to 2003 , has22 a no- prof it expense of $588 per month for an23 apartment , without  any profit . That 's your24 numbers, not mine .25 Yet the Board left the  minimum12 
2 rent of $214 a month with the strange claim  that3 you are trying to put  - - balance  landlord' s4 profitability  against  affordability. Okay?5 I've yet to see a hard number  on6 the minimum amount of return on investment   you're7 calculating. Apparently it's none in your own8 report.9 Either fire your staff for10 giving you an inaccurate report , or bring back11 the low- rent adjustment for the below- cost12 apartments, not below- market , below- cost.13 Have you ever asked the other14 tenants who are paying their fair share if   they15 want to subsidize the below- cost apartments?16 Seniors all claim to be desperately  poor,17 screaming they are eating catfood,  choosing18 between rent and food. So why have they all   not19 signed up for the SCRIE  program?20 (Audience part icipation.)21 MR. TOM CASPER:	I have plenty22 of applications here.23 MS. KAUFMAN:	Quiet.24 MR. TOM CASPER:	It 's only one25 page long.2 
2 The problem is that this  forces3 seniors to reveal the income of all of  the4 apartment applicants. Seniors want the option  of5 being able to pass the apartment onto the  next6 generat ion of freeloaders.7 (Audience participation.)8 MR. TOM CASPER:	But they do9 not want to list their children, their  grown10 children and grandchildren, on the  SCRIE11 applications because then they have to  include12 those children' s incomes.13 I'm looking at my utility  bills14 and do not find a discount checkoff for  two-year15 leases, seniors, blacks,  single mothers, college16 students,  people  saving  for retirement , Asians,17 new immigrants. So why are these social  programs18 being deducted from our  rent?19 I want to give you a look at  the20 approved bankruptcy  from one of my lawyers,21 Jennifer . She had over $600 per month listed  in22 new clothes, recreation expenses,  Internet and23 outside laundry expenses. She put herself   into24 bankruptcy for less than $200 a month. God   forbid25 she gave up her weekends clubbing in the  Village.2 
1	3392	(Audience participation. )3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You got to4	wrap up.5	MR. TOM CASPER:	Basically,6 let 's - -7 (Audience part icipation.)8	MR. TOM CASPER:	Excuse me.9	Let 's stop playing the race card10 and the stereotypes. They don' t change the base11 numbers and expenses.12 Let 's start leveling the rent13 load.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 (Audience part icipation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jo-Ann17 Polise.18 Jo-Ann, go ahead.19 MS. JO-ANN POLISE:	Thank you.20 I reside in one of the  dwindling21 number of rent - regulated apartments in Stuyvesant22 Town.23 Just a few short years ago  there24 was a waiting list of several years to get   into25 Stuy Town. Many on that list were the  grown10 
2 children of residents and tenants who  were3 beginning their families and hoped to transfer   to4 a larger apartment.5	MetLife, along with their agent ,6 Insignia, made a decision to throw that list  out7 the window.8 They have engaged in a series  of9 MCis, which were really just repairs, which   have10 gradually but consistently inched all  the11 regulated rents ever upward. I have been  charged12 for three so far and awaiting the bill on  the13 fourth .14 Vacant apartments are subject  to15 costly cosmetic changes to raise the rents to  the16 deregulat ion figure of $2000 per month. Those  who17 had been on that discarded list were  offered18 these deregulat ed apartments, but working,19 middle- class New Yorkers just cannot afford it .20 So there were few takers.21 Previously, vacant  apartments22 were treated to a paint job, new window   shades23 and new appliances and were occupied  within24 forty- five days of the previous tenant leaving.25 In contrast , the renovated apartment next door to6 
2me sat emptyfor almost a year before  anyone3could affordto move into it.4The rush of potential  renters5 did not occur as planned  and management	resort ed6 to offering free health club membership,  big7 screen TV . They leased hundreds of apartments to8 NYU to be used as student housing and they  have9 spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on  four-10 page color inserts in The New York  Times .11 Today, MetLife has to lure  and12 bribe people to move into a complex that  people13 had previously clamored to get into. But  rather14 than maintain that affordable housing stock  for15 tax-paying working New Yorkers who helped  make16 the neighborhood  a desirable one, they have opted17 to fill apartments with transient students who  do18 not pay taxes. They come from other states  and19 other countries. They do not vote and they do  not20 participate  in the good health of our community.21 (Audience participation .)22 MS . JO-ANN POLISE :	Today I23 could not apply for an apartment in  Stuyvesant24 Town because I don' t meet the minimum income25 requirement .5 
2	My so-called disposable  income3 is meager and is spent trying to restore  a4 greatly deflat ed retirement fund , an effort I'm5	sure that people, both landlord and tenant , are6 engaged in right now.7 But I do plan to spend my8 retirement years right here in New York City  and9 I hope this City is going to be taking care of  me10 because I am not too proud to go on welfare   after11	I've worked and paid taxes my entire life.12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. JO-ANN POLISE:	So if Iam14 going to be one of your unint ended consequences,15 I suggest you start to look at it as a  real16 possibility .17 Thank you .18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 Al Doyle.21 MR. AL DOYLE:	H ,  I22 My name is Al Doyle and I'm  the23 President of the Stuyvesant Town/Peter  Cooper24 Village  Tenants Association .25 (Audience participation .)12 
2	MR. AL DOYLE:	I am a life-3 long resident of Stuyvesant Town, which is  owned4 by The Metropolitan  Life Insurance Company.5 Fifty- five years ago MetLife6 embarked on an ambitious program to  bring7 affordable housing to New York City. Aided  by8 City and State government , MetLife created an9 affordable housing community praised for  its10 inspired urban planning.11 The opportunities offered by12 affordable housing helped renew and rebuild  New13 York City after the end of World War II.  Tenants14 in Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper  Village15 became part of the solid middle- class, tax-paying16 base of New York City. Former State Senator  Roy17 Goodman called Stuyvesant Town and Peter  Cooper18 Village the anchor of  Manhattan.19 However, over the past  twelve20 years residents have been battered by  Major21 Capital Improvement rent increases.  These22 increases were in addition to lease  renewals23 granted by the Rent Guidelines  Board.24 MetLife has spent over  $12025 million in property improvement for which  we3 
2 receive permanent	rent increases.3 And what did we get for  our4 money?5 The gradual but relentless6 effort to deregulate apartments in  Stuyvesant7 Town and Peter Cooper Village. For  years8 Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village  were9 fully rented with a multi - year waiting list for a10 vacant  apartment .11 Now we have hundreds of  empty12 apartments which MetLife would like to rent  at13 market rate but can't seem to find the  renters.14 Affordable  rents are no longer available  in15 Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper  Village.16 Middle class families need to  be17 able to feed, clothe, educate and provide  for18 their health care and housing needs. Rents  are19 rising faster than incomes, and when you factor20 in increased taxes and transit fares, it  becomes21 tougher and tougher to live in New  York.22 Stuyvesant Town/Peter Cooper23 Village  is home to firefighters, teachers, police24 officers, nurses, office workers, construction25 workers and thousands of others who may no   longer2 
2 be able to live in the community they serve.  The3 acute shortage of housing makes life in the  City4 more diff icult and jeopardizes New York' s5 economic recovery and future  growth.6 And what about our  seniors7 living in Stuyvesant Town and Peter  Cooper8 Village? What are they supposed to do?  Many9 seniors live on fixed incomes and find  it10 increasingly diff icult to pay MCI rent increases11 and lease renewal increases along with  increased12 sales taxes and increased transit  fares.13 We in Stuyvesant Town and  Peter14 Cooper Village are calling for relief from  this15 constant rent burden.16 Please, freeze rents now.17 (Audience participat ion.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Richard Barr.19 MR. RICHARD BARR:	Good20 afternoon.21 And for those of you who  are22 sitting through this for the first time,  some23 things never change here. The landlord  lobbies24 always sit together. The landlords who come  and25 make an appearance are always those who own   six2 
2 or eight units in a poor or working  class3 neighborhood  and are struggling to make ends4 meet.5	But the owners of scores and6 hundreds of big ticket buildings who are  taking7 advantage of vacancy decontrol to triple and   get8 five and ten and in some cases fifteen times  the9 rent that they used to get are advised not   to10 come within two miles of this  place.11 It 's no accident.12 (Audience participat ion.)13 MR. RICHARD BARR:	You ever see14 them here.15 (Audience participation.)16 MR. RICHARD BARR: They never  say17 anything.18 But the fact is you've got  some19 owners in this City who are struggling to  make20 ends meet and you've got some that are making   out21 like bandits.22 And the answer is not a  one-23 size- fits- all approach. Let them all open up24 their books and those that are struggling,   give25 them some help, and those that are making   obscene6 
2 prof its, as some of them are, why should they be3 getting increases when tenants are up against   in4 so many other ways that this 5 or 8 percent  might5 be the difference between paying your rent  and6 being able to buy food or paying your rent  or7 being able to buy clothing or be out on  the8 street ,  or medicine.9 So I just urge you to  change10 this approach.11 Granted there are some people12 out there who are not making a living  as13 landlords and some who are making an  obscene14 living. Don't treat them all the same  way.15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 Sylvia Fields, is she here?18 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	Yes.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oh, Sylvia.20 After that is Ida Pollack,  Penny21 Laforest , Queen Simmons and Joe  Lamport .22 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	Hello!23 I didn't think I would be here24 again, but , unfortunately,	I thought the rent25 guidance , you would do away with the guidelines,2 
1	3482 the rent guidelines.3 But I have to be here.4 I'm glad to see new faces  here5 and I would like to ask them if they live in  rent6 stabilized houses. Do any on the Panel live  in7 rent stabilized houses?8	You see, again, you have to  live9 - - good. You have to live in there to know what10 it ' s all about .11	Now, if you don' t live there,12 you have no idea what it 's about.13 Now,  the landlords  are  talking -14 -  I want  to tell you something.  I know some15 landlords, even Trump where I live, they  say16 there isn't one landlord that isn't making  money17 on houses, that nobody wants to sell. They  all18 make money on houses.19 And I wonder, I'll ask  another20 question. Do you people really listen to what  we21 say?22 (Audience participat ion.)23 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	I don't know24 if you listen.25 (Audience participation. )12 
2 MS . SYLVIA FIELDS:	I don't know3 if you listen to what we  say.4 (Audience participation.)5	MS. SYLVIA FIELDS :	We talk and6 we talk and we talk and then they want to  make7 the rent guidelines higher.8 It really - - I get - - I want to9 tell you something. A woman next door to me  died.10 She was paying $650 a month rent. She died.  They11 put in a couple of cabinets, they did the   floor,12 and they' re getting $2000 a month.13 Now you tell me if the  landlord14 isn't making money? $2000 a month than what  they15 got before.16 They are making money, all  the17 landlords. And I only got Social  Security.18 Now I don't know	I have to -19 - if I get another raise, I'm going to have  to20 come to one of your people' s houses to feed me21 because22 (Audience participation.)23 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	- - I really24 - -  I can't afford to buy food.25 I pay over $1000 a month  rent.6 
2 My Social Security is $1040. They take off  for3 Medicare. And here I am.4 And with the prescriptions	that5 I pay, forget it. I don't even have enough  money6 for prescriptions. And I can't get EPIC either.  I7 applied to EPIC and didn' t even get it.8 So what are you supposed to  do?9 You got to lower the rents and keep us  seniors10 alive.11 Thank God we are here and we  can12 part icipate.13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	And you got15 to keep us alive.16 And lower the rents.17 (Audience participat ion.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sylvia, I19 will make sure you're here next  year.20 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	What?21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'll make22 sure you're here next year.23 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	Yeah. But24 don' t - - if you invite me here for dinner,   I'll25 come.2 
1	3512	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.3	MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	But to come4 to dinner, I'll come. But not for rent  increases.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'll tell6 Anita to order an extra dinner next  year.7	MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	Okay. Don't8	forget.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go get them.10 Thanks. Bye- bye.11 (Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ida Pollack.13 MS. IDA POLLACK:	Well , it14 looks like it's another year and the same  old15 business is going on. A few different  faces up16 there, but it seems like it doesn't matter who   is17 up there because already you agreed to 5.5 and 18		8.5.19 I bet there is not one of you  up20 there that ever has to worry about whether   you21 are going to be able to pay your rent or how   much22 of it you are going to have to  pay.23 (Audience participation. )24 MS. IDA POLLACK:	There are25 tenants - -19 
1	3522 (Audience participation.)3 MS. IDA POLLACK:	That only4 doesn' t apply to you. That applies to every5 elected official , to every person in6 administration,  to every power structure, and7 particularly  to every landlord because they  have8 to live in a house too. And they never have  to9 worry about how to pay their  rent.10 You know, I read a book  called11 ''Number One. n  Americans  like to think of12 themselves as number one.13 Well , we certainly are number14 one in homelessness. And the estimates  for15 homelessness for the following year is 10,00016 people.17 Now, what are we going to  do?18 Are the streets going to be lined with   shelters?19 Is every vacant building going to be  transformed20 into a shelter?21 And then Mayor Bloomberg  can22 come around and ticket them for living in   illegal23 places, you see.24 You guys on the Board ,  you'll25 forgive me, are a disgrace to democracy in   this2 
2	city and in this country.3	(Audience participation.)4	MS. IDA POLLACK:	Every human5 being has to live in a house. This is the  21st6 century. It 's not medieval times.7	And if you are asking people on8 a minimum wage, which is $5.15 an hour, do  a9 little arithmetic. Figure out what the income   is10 for the year and then tell me whether anybody   can11 pay $1000 rent , $900 rent. What kind of idiocy  is12 that?13 What do you want?	To step over14 bodies in the street?15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Penny17 Laforest , please.18 MS. PENNY LAFOREST:	Penny19 Laforest.20 First , I really have  some21 questions for you.22 First of all , I don' t know who23 you are. We weren' t even told who you would be24 this year around. We know that most of the  time25 you're either bankers or finance capitalists  or8 
2 venture capitalists or people in finance.3 None of you are teachers  or4 workers, union workers, that belong to  unions.5	You don' t really represent the majority of people6 in this City. You represent a particular  class of7 people in this City.8 (Audience participat ion.)9 MS. PENNY LAFOREST:	And yet I'm10 supposed to stand here and listen to you tell  me11 what you think is best for me, a working   class12 person. I find that totally  irrelevant.13 How many of you rent?14 (Indication.)15 MS. PENNY LAFOREST:	Thank you.16 The tenant rents.17 How many of you own homes?18 Obviously the rest of  you.19 How many of you make  under20 $50,000 a year, which  is what  eighty- five percent21 of New Yorkers make? How many of you make   under22	$85 , 000 a year, $50,000  a year? Do you?23 None of you make under $50,000 a24 year. This is disgraceful  that you're telling25 us - -23 
2 (Audience participation.)3 MS . PENNY LAFOREST:	- - what our4 rents should be.5 I make under $50 , 000 and I teach6 for a living and I make under $50,000 a year .7 And the people you are  imposing8 your percentages on, most of them make under  9	$50,000 a year .10	(Audience participation .)11	MS. PENNY LAFOREST :	Just a12 minute. Just a minute. That 's my time.13 One other thing. How many of  you14 walk around with $25 to $30 in your pocket  every15 day? Because most New Yorkers who are going  to16 pay your rents, when you look at a  $49,00017 salary, and you take out for the rents  you'll18 have us paying and Con Ed and electric  and19 telephone	- -  or maybe they shouldn' t have20 electric and maybe they shouldn't  have21 telephones,  or food - -	they  will  walk around22 with between $20 and $30 in their pocket a   day.23 None of you sitting up  there24 walk around with that little tiny bit of money   in25 your pockets every day .12 
2 I'm sure most of the men  sitting3 up there walk around with $200 to $300 in   your4 pockets every day and wouldn' t go out of the5 house because you would feel naked if you  didn' t6 have that kind of money in your pockets  every7 day.8 (Audience participation.)9	MS. PENNY LAFOREST:	You are10 robbing us. You are fleecing us. This is  a11 political game we play every single year.  The12 landlords own this city. They pay for  the13 elections. They put the money in the  politicians'14 pockets. And you do what they  say.15 And any minute there' s going to16 be a phone call and Mr. Bloomberg is going   to17 tell you how to vote because none of you  really18 are under the illusion that you make any  real19 decisions, are you, guys?20(Audience participation.)21CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Queen22Simmons.23(No response. )24CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Queen25Simmons?
2	(No response .)3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is she here?4 (No response.)5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Joe Lamport .6 Af ter Mr. Lamport will be Raul7 Rodriguez, then Louis Scheeder, Diane Weston  and8 Leslie Dalton.9 Joe Lamport.10 MR . JOE LAMPORT:	Thank you11 very much .12 I'm not necessarily here to13 berate you and make the kind of claims  others14 have made .15 But I am here as a tenant and  as16 a working- class person. I came to the City about17 two years ago and was very fortunate to get  a18 rent - stabilized apartment .19 I'm here today because I  think20 that I represent a group of people that you don' t21 here  from, and  that 's working class people,	•22 because everybody I know right now, a lot  of23 people I know in my building are working and   they24 are working two jobs, three jobs, just to  make25 the rent.7 
2 I work two jobs and half of  my3 income goes to rent. I'm not making enough.  I4 could bring my pay stubs if you  want.5 Now, when you talk about a  86 percent or a 5 percent increase in rent , you  are7 talking about a significant amount of money   for8 people  like me. And , frankly, ·we  can't deal with9 it . I mean the increase in the MTA fares, the10 increase in everything has gone up. And it   seems11 as though everything keeps going up and  people12 are not paying attention.13 And you are going to lose people14 who can't afford this. Because I tell you my  wife15 and I are considering seriously leaving  this16 City. We can't afford this.  Okay?17 I mean the fact is that I don' t18 think you can relate to this kind of situation19 that we are in.20 Now, what I found  deeply21 offensive and that really brought me here   today,22 because generally I would be working, was  that23 some clown, and he actually said it again   today,24 called people like me freeloaders because  we25 can't afford the rent.2 
2 Now I find that deeply3 insulting. I work two jobs.4	Now I've never taken a  handout5	in my life.6 (Audience participat ion.)7 MR. JOE LAMPORT:	And to have8 some guy come here and call us freeloaders  and9 then start to use these little, you know,  code10 words, like the elderly or the blacks, I  find11	this deeply	I find this disgusting .12 Everyone I know in my  building13 is working. No one is sitting up there  and14 collecting rent	or collecting a paycheck  and15 just , you know, giving it out and living in  some16 sort of paradise.17 We are working. In fact , you18 guys know from your own numbers - I went on your19 websit e - $32,000 the average income. Yes, I  see20 things in the paper like, oh, this is to  protect21 the people on the Upper West Side because  they22 make that kind of money and they want to   keep23 their cheap apartments.24 Come on! Who' s spreading this25 stuff? You guys have to start asking  yourselves12 
2 some quest ions about how this stuff gets spread.3 Is this about the elderly? Come on! This is  a4 joke. It 's about every working person in this5	City and you guys have to take it seriously.6 Because a rent increase of  this7 dimension is going to hit us and it 's going to8 hit us hard and you are going to lose  working9 class people from the City. You already  are10 losing them.11	Thank you.12 (Audience participation. )13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 Raul Rodriguez,  is he here?15 Mr. Rodriguez?16 (No response.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No.18 Hold on.19 A PARTICIPANT:	I'm not Mr.20 Rodriguez.

2 parked in front of the house and they own   houses3 on their own.4 We cannot progress with  these5	rents.6	They should change.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank8 you.9 Louis Scheeder.10 MR. LOUIS SCHEEDER:	Hi! Good11	afternoon.12 My name is Louis Scheeder.  I13 occupy a rent stabilized apartment  in Stuyvesant14 Town.15 Many of - -16 (Audience participation.)17 MR. LOUIS SCHEEDER:	- - my18 neighbors have spoken quite eloquently about   the19 disastrous business practices that MetLife  and20 their henchmen,  Insignia Corporation,  are engaged21 in.22 I'm here to speak on behalf  of23 the future. The decisions that you people  make ,24 the little 8.5 here, 6.5 here, are inimical  to25 the future and growth of the  City.12 
2 I'm a master teacher at New  York3 University. I don' t know how many of you are4 actors or poets or dancers or at all  interested5 in what I'm saying . But the decisions that you6 make are going to seriously damage the future  of7 this City as a mecca for young people in  the8 arts.9 (Audience participation.)10 MR. LOUIS SCHEEDER:	And you11 must  consider that. You are going  to create  - -12 you are going to create Paris and that 's not a13 good thing.14 You are going to create a  very15 wealthy, wealthy city that only the rich can   live16 in. And I think you've got to consider  these17 decisions that you make each year.18 Thank you very much.19 (Audience participat ion.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Diane Weston.21 MS. DIANE WESTON:	Greetings!22 My name is Diane Weston. I'm  a23 tenant , rent stabilized tenant. I moved here from24 Boston many years ago, 1975. Never did I know   I'd25 become an SSI recipient because I was   traumatized2 
2 - - an emotionally  traumatized  victim  of a man.3 I've been living in my  apartment4 now coming up on twenty- six years with a  landlord5 who has given me no heat in four years. Not   only6 have I not had heat , I've been harassed7 indirectly.8	I bundle up in the evening  in9 the wint ertime. My windows are closed. I'd  like10 to know why so many people have more than   enough11 heat. I've watched from the time this man  took12 over the building, and there is another woman   who13 has the same landlord as myself , who made The  New14 York Times, in 2001, and her name is Jane  Wood.15 And I'm sure if any of you  are16 familiar, you know who my landlord is.17 And I have no problem saying  his18 name is Mach Schofmann	(phonetic) and he needs to19 be investigat ed.20 Now, let me just get to what  I21 have to say.22 This is insane what 's going on23 in the City, what 's going on in all the boroughs.24 We are going to be in boxes, living on  the25 street. It 's unfair.9 
2 There was a woman who spoke  not3 too long ago. She asked you if you are  public4 servants. Are you school teachers? Did you  live5 your life going around in the garment center   like6 I did in sales? I doubt it.7 I barely can	I walk. I walk8 where I have to go today. $2.00 is ridiculous.   I9 am walking back and forth wherever I go, if it 's10 five or six miles, I go.11 Take a look at your12 grandparents. Did your grandparents come  as13 immigrants from Russia like mine did? Or  Austria?14 Did they work their ass off to make America  what15 it really is today?16 The working class made  America17 what it is. Corporate people and people born  with18 a silver spoon in their mouth don' t have a damn19 thing to say about what we are going through.  I20 want the landlords to open their books  because21 I'm fucking pissed off.22 (Audience participation.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 MS. DIANE WESTON:	Thank you.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Leslie2 
2	Dalton.3 (No response .)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Leslie5 Dalton .6	(No response. )7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is she here,8 Leslie Dalton?9 (No response.)10 A PARTICIPANT:	We don' t need11 the Enrons.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Martin13	Charles.14 (No response. )15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me read16 the list of what we  - - Martin  Charles, are  you17	here?18 (No response.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	John Lux, L-20 u-x?21 MR . MICHAEL LUX :	Yes.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay .23 After Mr. Lux is Jamie Jee,  J-24 e- e.25 After that is Ann  Salzberg.18 
2 After that is Len Storm. And after that is  Linda3 Zoblotsky. And that 's going to be the end until 4	7:15.5 Those of you who want to  testify6 - -  7:15 to 8:15 is supposed to be hotels. But   I7 don' t think we' re going to have too many people8 here. So if you want to testify on  the9 apartments, even though it said 8:15, come  back10 at 7:15. You should probably get  on.11 A PARTICIPANT:	What number are12 you up to?13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We are right14 now - - we' re on 93 . We are right now not - - we15 are going to finish all the people who  pre-16 registered , and right now we' re not expecting any17 - - or too many people  involved in hotels.  So  do18 come back at 7:15. We will take everybody  who19 wants to speak then.20 So it 's going to be Mr. Lux,21 then Jamie Lee, Ann Salzberg, Len Storm and  Linda22 Zoblotsky.23 Go ahead , Mr. Lux.24 MR. MICHAEL LUX:	Okay.25 My name is Michael Lux. I'm  a5 
2 New York City public high school teacher. I   teach3 social studies at Murray Betram High  School4 downtown.5 I live in the neighborhood  where6 I teach and, believe me, I don' t know how many of7 you have your kids going to public school.8 How many of you have your kids9 going to public school?10 (Indication.)11	MR. MICHAEL LUX:	Interesting.12 It 's very important  - - let me13 illuminate you a little bit  - -  it 's very14 important that the teachers who teach your  kids15 come from the area where you live.16 Teachers are going to be  leaving17 New York City because the Mayor - I'm a member   of18 the Unit ed Federation of Teachers. We are19 currently working without a contract. Our  Mayor20 has told us if you want a raise, the raise he   is21 offering right now is zero percent. Okay?22 So he' s telling us zero percent.23 But let me tell you about our financial   crisis.24 Every time somebody says there is a  financial25 crisis in New York City I do not believe  them.12 
2 They can find the money to build a  ballpark.3 They' ll find the money to fund some redevelopment4 thing. They' ll find the money even, you know,5 rebuilding the Twin Towers thing, they' ll find6 the money for that. But they won' t find the money7 for anything else.8 Let me tell you about our  fiscal9 crisis, teachers' fiscal crisis. The price  of10 going to and from work just went up 33  percent.11 Our sales tax just went up, State and City  sales12 tax went up.13 The litany - - the people of  my14 generation that went to City College , you know15 how much tuition was? Zero. That 's how people16 were educat ed then.17 You' re in a situation where18 you're charging us 5.5 percent and 8.5  percent.19 It 's unacceptable.	I agree with the other20 speakers who said open the books. Let 's look at21 landlord profits.22 (Audience participat ion. )23 MR. MICHAEL LUX:	Let 's look at24 their expenses because our books are wide  open.25 We know exactly what it 's costing us.2 
2 If you happen to be unfortunate3 enough to smoke cigarettes, your taxes,  your4 cigarette taxes just went up like a couple  of5 hundred percent. These are our  realities.6 I say open the books. No profit7 should be made on people' s housing. Housing is a8 right for people.9 (Audience participat ion. )10 MR. MICHAEL LUX:	So I would11 recommend that there be a zero percent  increase12 which is exactly what the Mayor is offering us  as13 teachers,  zero percent.14 Thank you.15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jamie Jee, J-17 e- e. Here?18 (No response.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ann Salzberg.20 MS. ANN SALZBERG:	Good21 afternoon.22 My name is Ann Salzberg.  My23 husband and I live in Peter  Cooper/Stuyvesant.24 (Audience participation.)25 MS. ANN SALZBERG:	I am a2 
1	3712 social worker. My husband works in the  computer3 industry and is also a part - time musician.4 We were both brought up  in5 Mitchell - Lama projects. These projects allowed6 our parents, who came to America as penniless7 refugees, to work hard, sometimes two to  three8 jobs each to live in New York  City.9 Affordable housing has  allowed10 them to send their children to college and  they11 and their children became part of the  great12 American middle  class dream.13 With affordable housing,  has14 also given me the opportunity to go back  to15 school to retrain myself when I was laid off   and16 became employable in my recent  career.17 Please, please reconsider your18 proposed 5.5 and 8.5 percent rent increases.   They19 are too high, too high especially in these  very20 difficult times for many low- income and middle-21 income New Yorkers as myself.22 I have not received any pay23 increases in the last three years. My  husband' s24 industry, computers, are constantly having   layoff25 plans.2 
1	3722 We are constantly receiving  high3 rent increases and high Major  Capital4 Improvements in Peter Cooper/Stuyvesant.	They're5 increases to our monthly  rent.6 This year' s proposed rent7 increases are unbelievable in lieu of the  fact8 that we are in a recession and the very  high9 unemployment  rate in New York City.10 Because of these terrible11 suggested increases in our rents we are   seriously12 thinking the unthinkable. We are going to  move13 out of New York where we have lived most of   our14 lives. We may have to join the many other   former15 New Yorkers who cannot afford to live in   this16 City.17 Again, I ask you to  rethink18 these high, incredible increases, and at  least19 lower them. These high increases affect so  many20 lives as myself and future generations of  New21 Yorkers .22 Thank you for your time.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Len Storm.2 
1	3732	(No response.)3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Len Storm?4 (No response.)5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Linda6 Zoblotsky.7 Is she here?8 (No response.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right.10 We' ll try two more here.11 W.

1	3742	MR. ARNOLD BREDEFELD:	Here.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Give them4 hell , Arnold.5 And we' ll do one more after6 Arnold.7	MR. ARNOLD BREDEFELD:	Well , I8 seem to  - -  the objectionable  character has been9 living in the same place a long time,  assuming,10 you know, the arrogance of being a  wealthy11 surbanite that lives in their own house a  long12 time. We stayed there and we enjoyed it  too.13 But , of course, after dead14 bodies in the hall , broken door, a fire in  the15 front and no garbage pickup, nobody with a  broom16 out there except me.17 Well , I moved out to uptown and18 got another place there.19 And this was a handyman' s20 paradise that I was warned about the trouble   they21 had. But it couldn' t have been worse. You know,  I22 gladly accepted it.23 And after one year I don' t think24 they've ever serviced my apartment again  because25 their faucet would just continue to leak   again.8 
2 And then there' s a pipe in the wall. The wall  has3 to be fixed, the pipe in the wall leaking  down.4	And well now I know you can get5 a strainer anywhere for the sink. I have two  of6 them and it takes out  everything.7 So pealing paint I'm not  worried8 about. I did have a paint brush and  everything.9 And so I've been living here and I've  been10 paying, you know, since it was under $500. They11 charged me eight percent a year instead of  the12 regular four for a  two-year.13 And so, you know, I don' t think14 it 's one or two - -  it was three years when I  was15 there. I took the three  years.16 And so because I'm a long- time17 resident , I stayed there for almost thirty  years18 so far.19 And I believe I was a credit.  I20 was rewarded. I had two jobs. And I like the   air21 outside, even though they fixed the streets  and22 everything.  They get now  - - we' re getting more23 traffic through there. And that seems to be  big24 trick, to walk through the garbage, you  know.25 Well , don' t pay this guy too much money. He' s5 
2 walking through these empty oil cans and  busted3 tires and what ever, abandoned cars all the time.4 I shouldn' t have complained, you5	know. I was having it good. But I guess my  time6 is coming up.7 And so that' s the story. We' ve8 been paying  it all. And  - -9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where do you10	live, Arnold?11	MR. ARNOLD BREDEFELD:	Huh?12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What13 neighborhood  do you live in?14 MR. ARNOLD BREDEFELD:	I' m   in -15 - let 's see what you call that. Near the Bronx16 Community College there. So it's fixed up.  They17 got a track there. But they fixed up the fence   so18 you can't use the track too  much.19 And I don' t see them in there.20 The guards must be working extra  hard.21 And then they built  another22 elementary school there with a big fence on   it.23 But I've got different  exercises24 and I enjoy the Long Island Marathon and,   you25 know, walkathon.12 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3	MR. ARNOLD BREDEFELD:	So I'm4 not really complaining.  I'm just - -  I haven' t5 been at any of these meetings.  So I thought  - -  I6 had the time and energy to come over. And this   is7 the first time. I just had to read my city  book.8 I was wondering where the heck - I was  hearing9 about SCRIE and everything. So I read the  book10 about the Rent Guidelines.11 But I still think, you  know,12 it 's gett ing - - you know, as they say, I'm  really13 enlightened and I think it is getting too  high.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We appreciat e15 your interest.16 MR. ARNOLD BREDEFELD:	Okay.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,18 Arnold.19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Next is Alice21 Sutter.

Okay, Paul.24MR. PAUL FREIBOTH:I've been25	attending Rent Guidelines Board meetings  for
2 many, many years and I've discovered an  amazing3 thing. The landlords know more about what 's going4 on than many of the tenants.5 They have the statistics  for6 what 's going on. It's something that we define as7 the arrogance of power.8 (Audience participat ion.)9	MR. PAUL FREIBOTH:	It 's the10 same arrogance of power that when millions  of11 people around the world demonstrat ed against  the12 war in Iraq, the greedy rulers of this  planet13 decided to go ahead and get the oil and kill   the14 children and decimate the  cities.15 And that 's what they're doing to16 tenants . They know what our annual incomes are . I17 mean  it 's - - you don' t have to be a magician to18 know. You don' t have to know statistics.19 You just have to be  observant.20 And even IRS tells you when you look - - when  they21 give average citizens advice, they focus on22 incomes between $25,000 to $45,000 a year.  And23 that 's still high for millions and millions of24 our citizens.25 The landlords  - and it 's in the
2 dictionary  -  the landlords are  just greedy3 bastards. And that 's so obvious. And that 's in4 the dictionary, just as when I hear my  brothers5 and sisters using the word  "mf. " That 's also  in6 the  dictionary	"mf "  is a despicable person. And7 that ' s in Random  House Dictionary  and Merriam-8 Webster Dict ionary.9	The landlords just want one10 thing. They want one thing. Everything. They  want11 what they have and they want what we  have.12 But the bottomline is that  they13 are not going to win. They are not going to  win.14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 MR. PAUL FREIBOTH:	And if you17 rubberstamp their desires, you're going to go18 down in history  and get  - -19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 MR.

1	3912	P R O C E E D I N G  S34	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	This is the5 continuation of the public hearing discussing   the6 Rent Guidelines Board' s determination  for rate7 increases.8 We have some speakers who  want9 to speak on SRO hotels which is what we said  we10 would take those first , then go immediately into11 apartments.12 Mildred Ortega, are you here?13 MS. MILDRED ORTEGA:	My name is14 Mildred Ortega. I live at 258 West 97th  Street.15 We have had four  landlords16 already because	we have had four  landlords17 already because we are the Malibu which  is18 affordable  housing where we have  - -  in a19 commercial hotel.20 We wanted to be permanent21 tenants and then we would ask and they pay  the22 legal rent.23 And the last landlord we  have24 right now, they try to do the same , but we25 couldn' t and we made few then to become a5 
1	3922 permanent  tenant .3 And after September 11th  the4 tourist business go down and the landlord  crazy.5 He not know how to pay his mortgage with  China6 Trust Bank. It 's $3 .5 million.7	And he find out the CDs,8 homeless  service, HRS, HASA, HIV, or  - - the9 peopl e who are homel ess with HIV, the City is10 willing to pay $100 a night and he' s trying to11 (unintelligible) in order to get more  people12 homeless and then he can pay his mortgage and  in13 less than one or two years.14 I find out	as you can see15 here, this is all my research . According to the16 HRA, they told us that she need to place  those17 fellows . And then we find out that Mr . Charles18 Rangel fighting for $52 million to build  new19 housing for HIV people, but the City need  the20 money now . The money is going to pay the mortgage21 of my landlord. It ' s $3 .5 million.  I don't know -22 - we don' t know how much money.  I believe  $223 million go already to the  mortgage.24 It 's no fair, that this money,25 which was to build housing for homeless with HIV ,8 
1	3932	is with this landlord and pay his  mortgage.3	I didn' t - - they cut my - - I4 didn' t	(unintelligible) for two years. With the5 kind of money the City pay they are supposed  to6 bring my mail to my door and he return my  mail.7 And the people who8 (unintelligible) they die because they no  have9 heat , no have a blanket.  It 's really sad that - -10 the last article in The New York Post I find  out11 that the City is paying already in one year  only12 $400 million in homeless family. It 's $30,000. We13 talking $30,000 family and $400 million. If  we14 give you $1 million to each family, we still  have15 money. I don' t know where does the money go. I16 think this is corruption going on  here.17 This is not only18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mildred, you19 need to wrap up.20 MS. MILDRED ORTEGA:	I think21 that 's it.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That 's it?23 MS. MILDRED ORTEGA:	That 's it.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 MS. MILDRED ORTEGA:	Any4 
1	3 942 questions?3 Oh! By the way, you have4 everything in the newspaper.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay .6	MS. MILDRED ORTEGA:	You know7 because the landlords say they don' t have8 records, they don't have nothing. But we  have9 everything in the paper .10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.11	MS. MILDRED ORTEGA:	I think12 it 's time to do something - - to make  it13 different. Okay?14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 Let me read the speakers that  we16 are going to hear from on the hotel  side.17 The next speaker will be  Don18 Lewis. Mr. Lewis, are you here?  Okay.19 After that it will be Anthony20 Wint ers, followed by Larry Rourke, followed by21 Kathleen Lyons, followed by Doris Charpentier  and22 then Dan Golub representing Assemblyman23 Gottfried.24 Mr. Lewis.25 MR. DON LEWIS:	My name is Don12 
2 Lewis. I own Riverside Tower, a tourist hotel  at3 80th Street and Riverside Drive. For  tourist4 hotels, the last rent increase for  permanent5 tenants was in 1995, eight years  ago.6	I want a rent increase this  year7 for my permanent tenants, but I don't want  that8 money for myself. I want that rent increase  money9 to be sent each month to the City to help  poor10 tenants living in SRO buildings in  poor11 neighborhoods.12 SRO tenants have been given13 annual rent increases, but not us. This  has14 created an unfair situation where poor  SRO15 tenants may be paying more rent than my  tenants.16 Some of my tenants pay less than $300 a  month.17 If you pass this rent increase18 that I seek, the money given to the City from  all19 the tourist hotels would total hundreds  of20 thousands of dollars each year for helping  the21 needy.22 Secondly, by not giving hot el23 tenants rent increases, the City and State  has24 lost millions of dollars in taxable income  from25 tourists due to hotel rooms occupied by  permanent7 
2 tenants . The absence of rent increases has3 created a disincent ive for them to move. They may4 be able to afford regular apartments, but  they5 have an incredible bargain and they don't want  to6 give it up .7 Hotel rooms are commercial8 space, just like office buildings, and they  are9 being used for residences with the resultant  loss10 of taxable income.11	You can solve this and help the12 budget crisis. Let hotel tenants move to  regular13 apartments on a voluntary basis and have  hotel14 owners subsidize their monthly rents .15 If a hotel tenant is presently16 paying $400 a month in rent and moves to a  $90017 apartment , I would be willing to pay the $500 a18 month difference on a permanent basis. The  tenant19 wins by getting a larger living space, a  regular20 home with a kitchen, not a hotel room where  they21 cannot cook.22 The City and State get  tax23 income , and tourists are able to then visit this24 City in hotels that are not sold out because  of25 rooms occupied by permanent  tenants.12 
2 Everyone wins. Please don' t3 limit yourself to the standard decisions that  are4 repeated year after year.5 The purpose of your Board is  to6 help people in need. You can be creative  with7 this chance to help poorer tenants and also  help8 to get income for the City.9 I 1  d like to meet with a Board10 employee to answer any details and provide  the11 suggested wording or language that you might  use12 if you find my proposals worth  considering.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 Any questions?15 (No response.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you,17 Mr. Lewis.18 Anthony Winters.19 MR. ANTHONY WINTERS:	Good20 evening. My name is Anthony Winters. I 1  m a  tenant21 at the Apton Hotel on the west side on 107th22 Street , Manhattan, after they recently rename the23 Morningside	Inn, which was my home for the  past24 seventeen years.25 When I move in the building,  it2 
2 was all permanent tenants. Since 1998 when  the3 current owner landlord took over, management  has4 gotten rid of almost everyone . Out of ninety5 units,  only eleven left .6	On weekends, the lobby is  like7 Grand Central Station. You have luggage all  over8 the lobby. You have to step over luggage,  you9 have to walk over it .10 To make matters worse, the11 landlord applied for MCI, an increase of $95  per12 room. Most of the work is done for the  tourists13 and the students. They put us in the back of  the14 building. We are second class  citizens.15 Eleven of us, we are a  problem16 to the landlord . He can make more money on17 tourism. How does that feel? We are treated  like18 second class citizens in that one  building.19 Yet now they want us to pay  for20 the privilege.	I am one of the younger permanent21 residents. One of my neighbors has been there   for22 over forty- one years, as the oldest living man  in23 New York City.24 I'm an active member of25 Ascension Church. I'm also a volunteer at  Holy7 
1	3992	Name Church on 96th Street .3	I 'm also an SRO tenant , SRO4 United. And I work for my fellow SRO tenants.  And5 we simply can't afford an increase , especially6 these difficult times.7 Most of our landlords make  money8 off of tourists or the City. So they can - - so9 they don' t need a rent increase either.10 Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you.12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,14 Mr. Winters.15 Larry Rourke. Mr . Rourke.16 MS. HOLDER:	I'm sorry.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sorry. Mr.18 Winters, there' s a question. Sorry.19 MS. HOLDER:	I have a quick20 question.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure. No22 probl em. Sorry. I didn' t see you.23 MS. HOLDER:	That 's okay.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Rourke,25 just hang around here. We' ll be done quickly.4 
1	4002	MS . HOLDER:	Okay.3	Mr . Winters, can you tell me4	exactly where your building  is?5	MR. ANTHONY WINTERS :	It 's6	located at 235 West 107th Street .7	MS. HOLDER:	Wait.8 And how many  - - you said - - you9 had said how many units.10 MR . ANTHONY WINTERS :	Ninety.11	MS . HOLDER :	And  how many are12 permanent?13 MR. ANTHONY WINTERS:	At the14 time it was all of them,  ninety.15 MS . HOLDER :	All  ninety .16 MR . ANTHONY WINTERS:	At the17 time when I moved  in .18 MS. HOLDER:	When you moved in.19 But right now?20 MR. ANTHONY WINTERS:	Now it ' s21 only eleven.22 MS. HOLDER:	Eleven .23 And what is the rent for  anybody24 new coming in in the building?25 MR. ANTHONY WINTERS :	I have no12 
2	proof but I heard it 's over $900 a month.3 MS . HOLDER:	$900 a month?4 MR. ANTHONY WINTERS :	Yes .5 MS . HOLDER:	Okay . Thank you.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 Mr. Rourke.8 MR. LARRY ROURKE:	Good9 evening. My name is Larry Rourke. I live at  25810 West 97th Street , the Royal York Hotel.11 And I just wanted to make a  few12 brief comments about the permanent tenants of  the13 hotel . Many of them have been living there for14 more than fifteen or twenty years . And this hotel15 is basically the last stop before the streets  for16 these people.17 Many are living on fixed18 incomes, either welfare or retirement , and any19 rent increase is onerous to  them.20 Also, about half the building  is21 comprised of permanent tenants and the rest  of22 the rooms are rented out to people from HASA  for23 between $1500 and $2000 a month, a pop for a  1024 by 12 room with no services of any  kind.25 So the gentleman was speaking9 
2 before about moving people from SROs to  an3 apartment and having the landlord provide  the4 difference in the rent , I would certainly welcome5 our owner to take that act ion .6 Thank you .7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .8 (Audience participation. )9 MS . HOLDER:	Mr . Rourke? I'm10 sorry.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	There' s a12 question . Mr . Rourke.13 MS . HOLDER:	It just would be14 easier for me if I can just get an idea of  where15 the buildings are located for  everybody.16 MR. LARRY ROURKE:	Our building 1718 MS. HOLDER :	Where the buildings19 are located, how many units there are in  the20 building, how many are permanent and then what  is21 the asking rent of people coming  in.22 If everybody could do that , then23 I won' t have to keep interrupting people.24 MR.  LARRY ROURKE :	The Royal25 York is between Broadway and West End Avenues  on18 
2 West  97th Street , 258.3 I'm sorry I don' t know the exact4 number of units, but I'm sure Mildred  does.5 How many units are in  the6 building?7	MS. MILDRED ORTEGA:	We had 958	units.9	MR. LARRY ROURKE:	95 units.10 MS. MILDRED ORTEGA:	55 percent11 is permanent , the rest is HASA clients.12 MR. LARRY ROURKE:	55 percent13 permanent tenants and the remainder are  HASA14 clients.15 MS. HOLDER:	And how much money16 for peopl e coming in?17 HASA was what? About how much  do18 they get?19 MR. LARRY ROURKE:	They charge20 between $1500 and $2000 a  month.21 MS. MILDRED ORTEGA:	$2,400.22MS.HOLDER:How bigare the23rooms?24MS.MILDREDORTEGA:It's like25a closet.
2 MR. LARRY ROURKE:	Ten by3 twelve room. Many of them are - - most of them do4 not have private baths or refrigerators.  People5 with AIDS need refrigeration for the  medication.6	And there' s basically no service7	and no supervision, no support  services.8	MS. MILDRED ORTEGA:	They're9	dying.10 MR. LARRY ROURKE:	So this is11 what you get for $2000 a month basically .12 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.13 MR . LARRY ROURKE:	You' re14 welcome.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Kathleen16 Lyons.17 (No response.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is she here?19 (No response.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Kathl een?21 (No response.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	She' s not23 here.24 Doris Charpentier.25 MS. DORIS CHARPENTIER:	H ,  I10 
2	My name is Doris Charpent ier. I3 live at what is called Riverside  Terrace,4 formerly known as Hotel Riverside,  formerly known5 as Simmons House. At that point it was  a6 residential hotel for women.7 It is located on the Upper West8 Side, Riverside  and 88th Street  in a R B9 residential only, no commercial allowed zone.  It10 is a Class A building. The difference between  a11 Class A hotel and a Class B hotel is the  length12 of residency. It is totally illegal to rent  for13 one night at a time in a Class A  hotel.14 Even though that 's true, the15 owners of my building have been renting for  one16 night at a time for the past several  years.17 Currently, there are around 160 rooms, maybe  150.18 They used to be 172. The landlord five or  six19 years ago, without building permits,  started20 reducing the number of rooms by combining  two21 small eight by ten rooms into one larger  room.2 2	There are approximately,23 depending on who is counting, forty or  fifty24 permanent tenants. There are about forty  rooms25 that are used that are rented out to  an23 
1	4062 organization which then sublets them to  foreign3 businessmen coming to town for a month  on4 average.5 The remaining rooms have been6 rented , as I said , to tourists  illegally  for six7 years. They were getting approximately  $125 a8 night if you called the hotel itself , or $89 if9 you went to hotels. com or any of the other forty10 websites you could get access to them  on.11 Yes, the City sued them and , no,12 they have not stopped doing it  yet.13 It is very important for these14 types of buildings, the previous speakers  and15 myself , if you allow any rent increase at   all ,16 you must , must , must put  that proviso  in where17 it 's seventy percent permanent tenants or no18 increase.19 These people are getting $2000  a20 month on these hotel rooms being  rented21 illegally. And I bet every penny I have they  have22 never paid a hotel tax in their life. You  know?23 And they broke every other law that you got  about24 buildings  in this City. They probably broke that25 one too.2 
2	And when I moved in, they  lied3 to me for six months refusing to let me be  a4 tenant at all , charging me hotel rates.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you6	MS. DORIS CHARPENTIER:	Thank7	you.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Dan Golub11 representing Assemblyman  Gottfried .12 MR . DAN GOLUB :	Good evening.13 My name is Dan Golub . I represent Assemblyman14 Gottfried who represents the 75th  Assembly15 District in Manhattan which includes  Chelsea,16 Clinton, Midtown, Upper West Side and  Murray17 Hill .18 Due to the legislative  session19 in Albany, he' s unable to be here, but I'll20 provide excerpts of his  testimony.21 For many years, the Board has22 increased rents way above landlords' costs . This23 year' s proposals are one of the most blatant24 examples of this trend in recent memory . The25 poorest New Yorkers, who profited least from  the10 
2 economic expansion of the	'90s, will be the3 hardest hit now that the City has entered  its4 third year of a deepening  recession.5 These proposals are unjust ified6 and would make life harder for all New Yorkers . I7 strongly oppose this year's rent increases  and8 urge that the Board reject  them.9 The SRO rent increase is10 insupportable. As anyone who has witnessed  the11 conditions of most SRO housing knows, it  is12 housing of last resort. For a person with a  low13 income, even a four percent increase could  mean14 the difference between being on the street  or15 being in one own' s room.16 SRO tenants have absorbed  an17 eight percent rent increase in the last  four18 years.  Between	'93 and	' 99 hotel  tenants' average19 income has fallen twenty percent while  landlords'20 real income in rent collections has risen  forty21 percent.22 The Board should not approve  any23 SRO rent increase in order to protect  vulnerable24 housing for those who need it most and who  can25 least afford  to pay more .2 
2 In past years, the RGB  justified3 increases in rents by citing unusual  temporary4 surges reflected in the Price Index. But  last5 year the Board approved rent increases  despite6 the fact that the Price Index had  fallen.7 This pattern defies logic  and8 invites the conclusion that the Board seeks  to9 raise rents regardless of any justification.  The10 Board should be enacting a rent freeze this  year11 or at least dramatically scaling back  its12 proposed increases.13 (Audience participation.)14 MR. DAN GOLUB:	In fact , it 's15 long past time to abandon the Price Index.  It16 only reflects changes in prices, not in  actual17 expenditures and it does not take into  account18 the incomes of tenants, and its data on  landland19 income and expenses are outdated by the time  the20 Board votes.21 Because it ' s so one- sided , the22 Index is incapable of addressing the  central23 question that the Board should be asking: what  is24 the fairest way of distributing the impact  of25 this recession? Who can most afford to  pay?2 
2 Tenants' incomes showed  a3 decrease over the same ten years that  landlords'4 operating  income  increased . The average rent -5 stabilized household earns $32 , 000 a year and6 pays a third of its pre- tax income in rent . One -7 fourth of rent - stabilized tenants pay at least8 half their income in  rent.9 The Board has a duty to  consider10 the fairness of this equation and reflect  on11 whether landlords or tenants can bett er afford  to12 pay the costs of our slumping  economy.13 The needs and concerns of14 tenants, especially low- income tenants, are15 fundamental to the health of New York' s housing16 markets, and safe, affordable housing is  the17 foundation of those  concerns.18 So for these reasons and  several19 more which are in the writt en testimony,20 Assemblyman Gottfried urges the Board to  vote21 against these unjustified  rent increases.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have two25 public off icials, and then we are going to  hear2 
2 from two final speakers on the hotel side . Then3 we are going to go to the apartments' issue .4	Let me read these . Councilmember5 Gerson, then Councilmember Jackson, then  Michael6 Oullette and then Cynthia Doti .7 Okay.8 Councilmember Gerson.9	COUNCILMEMBER ALAN GERSON :	Good10 evening, Mr. Chair , and Madam Executive Director,11 Members of the Board.12 I, first of all , thank each of13 you for you public service. I represent District14 #1 in Lower Manhattan known as the Ground  Zero15 District , including  Ground  Zero and the16 surrounding communities - TriBeCa, Battery  Park,17 Chinatown, the Lowest East Side, the  South18 Village, Soho, Noho and inclusive and  surrounding19 areas, Southbridge, South  Street.20 My district  includes countless21 garment factory workers now  unemployed,22 restaurant workers who've seen their incomes  drop23 precipitously  or also unemployed , struggling24 formerly middl e- income workers in all civil25 servant and laboring professions barely  holding10 
2	on.3	These people, and many more,  are4	literally dangling, holding on to that blade  of5	grass at the edge of the cliff over the chasm  of6	homelessness.7	These people, like so many8 others throughout the City, cannot afford  the9 proposed 5.5 increase for the one-year of  rent10 stabilized apartments and the 8.5 increase  for11 the two years, or the 4 percent proposed  increase12 for SROs, nor the 4 and 7 percent  increase13 proposed	for loft units.14 This is a time of crisis  in15 which we are living and so many barely  surviving.16 It is morally incumbent on you to either  freeze17 rents during  this t ime of crisis - -18 (Audience participation.)19 COUNCILMAN ALAN  GERSON:	- - or20 to keep any increase to  - -21 (Audience participation.)22 COUNCILMAN ALAN  GERSON:	- - the23 bare minimum.24 In the time remaining I just25 want to point out beyond the numbers that we  get8 
1	4132 caught up in what is fundamentally involved  and3 what is our fundamental charge in this  process.4 You, the Board , and we as a City5 in a humane society are charged with  preserving6 the special and sanctif ied relationship between7 the person, a person, any person, and the  place8 where they live. In a humane society the  place9 where a person lives must never be subject to  a10 bare market commodity, must never be subject  to11 unfair and unexpected  increases which could drive12 a person from the place which they call  home.13 In a city of renters a rental14 apartment must be a full- fledged home and that15 requires basic	a basic expectation of16 stability and reasonableness which the  proposed17 increases far exceed.18 We are also charged with19 preserving the diversity of our great City.  And20 as our Mayor and our Governor have  noted21 repeatedly, it is our diversity in  close22 proximity to one another which makes our City   so23 great.24 Well ,  diversity  and demographic25 diversity requires housing diversity. And  that2 
2 requires fair and reasonable rents. And that   in3 this case in this t ime of crisis requires, again,4 a freeze or the bare minimum.5 I'll just conclude with a  final6 plea.7 We recognize the hardships  many8 owners have in the increases of insurance  and9 taxes. But that does not - - and if you look at10 the totality of the situation, that  cannot11 just ify the proposed increases.12 Let us not do through13 unreasonable  increases to rent stabilized low-14 income people barely hanging on what  the15 terrorists could not do. Let us not drive  fellow16 New Yorkers from their  homes.17 Thank you.18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you20 very much.21 Councilmember Jackson.22 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:23 Thank you, Mr. Chair, and Members of the  Board.24 My name is Robert Jackson and  I25 am the City Councilmember that 's representing the2 
2 7th Councilmanic District in Nort hern3 Manhattan,4 (Audience participation. )5 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT6	JACKSON:	and I represent approximately7 163 , 000 residents, the majority of whom are8 renters and they live in rent stabilized and  rent9 controlled apartments.10 I am here this evening as a11 representative	for my district to voice12 opposition to the proposed increase of  5.513 percent for one-year leases and 8.5 percent   for14 two-year leases.15 Many tenants have told me  that16 they are opposed to these increases.  Such17 increases will have a devastating impact on  their18 1ives.19 The 2000 census statistics  show20 that for a family of four in my district  the21 average family earns $35,000. An 8.5  percent22 increase would be very difficult on the  people.23 That would mean an increase of $60 a month  for24 someone that is paying $700 a month rent and  $6825 a month increase for someone paying $800 a  month.7 
2 And if you factor that over  a3 year it would be $714 and $816 respectively for  a4 two-year lease .5 The impact of such increases  on6 top of all the additional taxes that  residents7 must pay will be too much to  bear.8	The proposed increases will  lead9 to increased homelessness in our great City.  It10 is currently  at an all - time high . With the11 economy being what it is and thousands of  New12 Yorkers being laid off from their jobs  and13 thousands of more receiving pink slips within  the14 past two or three weeks, you must not take  action15 that will send this great City sliding  deeper16 into a hole.17 (Audience participation .)18 COUNCILMEMBER  ROBERT JACKSON:19 I ask you to be responsive to the needs of  all20 New Yorkers, those that are owners and those  that21 are renters, or take into consideration  the22 economic situation of our great City and  the23 residents who live here.24 I know that you have heard  from25 many peopl e today . And as a City legislator9 
2 myself , I sit and listen to testimony all day at3 hearings . I listen to the agency and department4 commissioners give testimony, and last but  not5 least the public and interested parties .6	When it ' s all over, we decide7 matters that affect the ent ire City.8 I ask you to please consider  the9 arguments being made and being put forward  by10 tenants and representatives  such as myself. You11 have the authority to make a big difference  in12 the lives of millions of people.13 Help make this a great City  and14 a place where we all can  live.15 Thank you very much.16 (Audience participation .)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 Michael Ouellette. Michael19 Ouellette?20 MR. MICHAEL OUELLETTE:	Yes.21 (Audience interruption.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead , Mr.23 Ouellette.24 (Audience interruption.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.7 
2	MR. MICHAEL OUELLETTE:	Good3	evening, everyone.4	My name is Michael Ouellette.  I5 live at the Malibu Hotel , the corner of  103   and6 Broadway.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Which hotel?8 MR. MICHAEL OUELLETTE:	Malibu9	Hotel , 103 and Broadway.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.11	MR. MICHAEL OUELLETTE:	I 've12 been there since June 2001 . Pursuant to the Rent13 Stabilization Law and Code, I requested a  lease14 for my unit.15 About three weeks later,  my16 landlord locked me out of my unit in an  attempt17 to prevent me from becoming a permanent tenant.  I18 called the police, showed them proof that  I19 requested a lease.20 A month later, the landlord' s21 son, Brandon  Fried , and  a manager,  Rose, made22 accusatory statements alleging that I entered  an23 empty unit and stole a picture.	I was arrested.24 The arresting officer made  a25 statement to me while being en route to the  24th12 
2 precinct . The off icer said: It looks like you're3 being railroaded.4	Again, about three weeks later,5 off icers came to my door and served me with a6 criminal summons. This time the landlord' s7 employee made statements that accused me of  two8 more charges. Again, false allegations were  made9 by the owner' s son and his manager.10 I went through months of  court11 dates. My attorney told me the landlord' s son and12 the manager were lying a lot to the  District13 Attorney. Aft er having to appear in court a  dozen14 t imes, the District Attorney finally dismissed15 the charges.16 On September  9, 2002 , my17 landlord registered my unit with DHCR as  high18rentvacancy decontrolled,  even though I have19beenin occupancy since June 2001.2021My landlord is conductingbusiness with HASA. These clients are  being22denieda decentplace to live. They have no  legal23rightsand theyare being treated like  animals.24These people are being kept  in25	emergency housing at a rate of $85 per room  per
1	4202 day. That 's approximately $2500 a month for rooms3 that measure about 150 square  feet.4	I know why my landlord is  lying5 to the District Attorney and lying to DHCR. If  my6 landlord gets me out of my rent stabilized unit ,7 he will make a lot more money with the  City.8 With my landlord collecting  this9 excessive rent from the City from ninety- five10 percent of the rooms of his buildings, there   is11 no reason for the RGB to grant him a  rent12 increase for the few rent stabilized rooms  that13 are available.14 Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 Any questions17 (No response.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 Cynthia  Doti , please.20 MS. CYNTHIA DOTI:	H .  I21 My name is Cynthia Doti and  for22 the last nine years I worked for a  State23 Assemblyman  that represents the 69th Assembly24 District and I did a lot of  casework.25 Our district has at the  bottom5 
2 over a dozen SRO hotels. We used to have a  lot3 more, but they whittled down to about a  dozen.4 Many of the people who have spoken already  live5 in that district : the Malibu, The Royal York.6 And I'm here to urge you  to7 freeze the rents.8 (Audience participation.)9	MS. CYNTHIA DOTI:	Although10 there are many very good SRO owners,  hotel11 owners, the vast majority, especially in  our12 district , are very  corrupt.  There  is a real13 racket going on right now in the SRO  hotel14 business.15 They are notorious for not  doing16 repairs. They are also unfortunately  notorious17 for personally harassing and tormenting  the18 fragile clientele that often lives there. We  have19 - -  I heard  last year case after case of people20 who were being exploited. There was loan   sharking21 going on by the owner of the building . There was22 intimidation, harassment.23 And these rent increases  will24 only go to reward those landlords. There is no  -25 - there is very little oversight ,   legal10 
2 oversight , that is happening in the SROs. They3 should be forced to do repairs and to conduct  a4 very honest business.5 (Audience participation.)6	MS . CYNTHIA DOTI:	But ,7 unfortunately, the City is unable to catch  them8 on many  - - to enforce the laws that do  exist.9 The other point is that when  the10 hotel business was going on, the luxury hotel ,11 the tourist  business  was happening,  it was - -12 there was a lot of intimidation and eviction  of13 tenants happening then.14 But when that dropped off , the15 City has then replaced that incentive for  hotel16 owners with all of the placements of people  on17 social services, whether it 's housing the18 homeless in the SROs or housing people  with19 HIV/AIDS in the SROs.20 The profits that landlords  now21 are making  are incredible ,  $100 a night . So they22 are choosing those people over the  permanent23 tenants that would be there. They're  evicting24 them, they're harassing them.25 Many people are leaving . We7 
2 still need SROs, especially as people are  being3 evicted from their other homes or new people  who4 come into the City who don't have  capital.5 SROs are a very important part6 of the fabric for low- income people and people7 without capital , especially seniors . Many of the8 permanent	tenants are seniors, very fragile.  And9 freezing the rents will help them to stay in  New10 York City.11 I urge you to do that.12 (Audience participation. )13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 There' s a question. Question.15 Go ahead , Mr. Lubell .16 MR . LUBELL:	Both loan sharking17 and harassment are illegal  activities.18 MS. CYNTHIA DOTI:	Yes.19 MR. LUBELL:	Have you on behalf20 of , as a representative, reported that to21 appropriate authorities?22 MS. CYNTHIA DOTI:	We tried.23 And, unfortunately,  the clientele that are being24 victimized by this are very fragile,  intimidated .25 They should come up and testify. They're  scared.2 
l	4242 They' re intimidated and sometimes they' re bought3 out too. The owner will go to them, after  charges4 are begun, and they will say, look, we' ll give5 you - - I'll give you $1000 . I don't think he does6 that much . I think it 's I'll give you a few7 hundred  dollars, don' t testify, don ' t make any8 waves, remove the charge .9 And they do that. And it 's a10 MR . LUBELL :	But they can't11 remove the charge. They  can12 MS . CYNTHIA DOTI :	Well , they do13 it before - -14 MR . LUBELL :	- - once the charge15 is made, the charge is made .16 MS . CYNTHIA DOTI:	But they17 refuse to testify.18 It 's very hard. The laws should19 be increased because this a real racket that  is20 going on. People are gett ing away with it. And21 it 's a bad name on good landlords.22 I 'm sure that neither of  you23 would participate in this kind of thing . But24 (Audience participation .)25 MR . LUBELL :	We' re not2 
2	landlords .3	MS. CYNTHIA DOTI:	Okay. I 'm4	sorry.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Gale, go6	ahead.7	MS. KAUFMAN:	What 's your 8 opinion on rent increases for hotels  in 9 accordance with  the proviso,  you know, with more  1O	than - -11 MS. CYNTHIA DOTI:	I think the12 proviso is too	right now it 's very hard with13 all the transient tenants coming in through  the14 City' s placing of people in the buildings,	it15 makes it harder for us to have - - to have seventy16 percent of the tenants be permanent  tenants.17 So the protection should be18 there for everybody.19 There is - - what 's happening in20 our buildings, like the Malibu and the  Royal21 York, there are people being placed by the  City22 through social services. They're moved  around23 every thirty days so they never have the right  to24 become a permanent tenant.25 And the other tenants are,  if11 
2 they are not intimidat ed to leave, are struggling3 to stay on.4 And  it 's - - the formula should5 be so that it stays fair for the  permanent6 tenants who are there. They should not have  to7 have their rent increased.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 The next speaker is Bill  Foley,10 followed by Councilmember  Christine Quinn.11 And then we' re going to go to12 the apartment sector right after Mr.  Foley.13 Mr. Foley, go ahead.14 MR. BILL FOLEY:	Yes. Good15 evening.16 I'm Bill Foley from The  Hudson17 Hotel located in Manhattan at Ninth Avenue  and18 extending one block from 57th Street all the  way19 to 58th Street. It 's a boutique hotel with about20 830 tourist rooms. Stabilized tenants  number21 about 107. That' s roughly eleven percent of the22 total rooms.23 The bar is a playground	for New24 York night life, and the hotel has been the  site25 of parties for top political figures  and2 
2 hollywood celebrities. It 's fashionable to be3 seen at The Hudson.4 There' s a saying that money5 makes money. And  - -6	A PARTICIPANT:	Louder.7	A PARTICIPANT:	Speak into the8	mike.9	MR. BILL FOLEY:	There' s a10 saying that money makes money. When you can  make11 your own rules, the pot gets even sweeter. By12 assuming a practice of vacancy decontrol,  hotel13 owners are recovering stabilized rooms to  be14 rented at the very profitable rates when a  tenant15 leaves. A stabilized unit disappears,  lost16 forever to the hot tourist  market.17 You should have a sheet , a typed18 sheet. Did they give you the typed sheet from19 upstairs?20 MS. VISSER:	They' ll get it.21 MR. BILL FOLEY:	Well , anyway,22 that sheet is from last year' s sheet that I23 passed out , the same data from last year.24 And it demonstrat es the basic25 effects of vacancy decontrol in these  hotels.10 
 2 First , there is a big drop in3 the number of units that are available, and  there4 is an increase in revenue for the hotel owner .5 You don 't have those sheets in6 front of you so I can't refer to any  particular7 sections. But in Section A, which you don' t have,8 we can see that in ten years forty- three percent9 of a block of stabilized units had  disappeared.10 In other words, ten years ago, let 's start with11 two hundred stabilized rooms . At our place we had 12	195.13 And if you see the sheet , you14 would see that , if you used the 5.5 percent15 disappearance rate per year, that you would  end16 up with about 114 after the ten years. So  that17 would be a loss, that 's a permanent loss of 4318 percent of the stabilized  rooms.19 Anyway, if you use even  an20 occupancy rate of seventy- five percent and you21 take a boutique rate of $200 a night , the22 increase for a given block between any two  years23 would be like forty- five percent.24 Let 's say the rooms you had in25 force now are 120 . The year before that it was13 
2 120 and then it comes down to 114. Those  six3 rooms that are terminated more than make up  such4 an additional revenue at the market rate that  it5 will give a fifty percent increase for that  1206 block that started the year  stabilized.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I understand .8	So wrap up.9	MR. BILL FOLEY:	Yes.10 We' re asking for a zero percent11 increase.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well , let me13 ask you a question.14 Doesn' t the proviso apply to15 your, to The Hudson Hotel?16 MR. BILL FOLEY:	It has, yes.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.18 MR. BILL FOLEY:	We are thankful19 for it.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Effectively,21 if the Board were to vote the current  guideline22 which is, the guideline suggested 4 with  the23 proviso, it wouldn' t affect the Hudson because24 the Hudson - I forgot the number, but it 's over25 800, the number of regular hotel .10 
1	4302	MR. BILL FOLEY:	We got about3	934 rooms . We occupy ten percent.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.5 So basically the proviso makes6 sure that you don' t have to pay more.7 MR. BILL FOLEY:	Thank you.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 MR. BILL FOLEY:	Thank you for10 listening.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. We12 appreciate it.13 Councilmember Quinn.14 COUNCILMEMBER  CHRISTINE QUINN:15 Thank you.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' re17 welcome.18 (Audience participation.)19 COUNCILMEMBER  CHRISTINE QUINN:20 My name is Christine Quinn. I represent the  3rd21 Council District which is basically  the Lower22 West  Side of Manhattan	- Chelsea, Hell 's Kitchen,23 Greenwich Village, parts of Murray Hill  and24 Soho - a large rent -protected district.25 And I'm here today as I've  been6 
2 here actually numerous  times before  - - as  I've3 been numerous times before to urge this Board   to4 think about the plight of the tenants in New  York5 City first .6 You know, although this has7 been a year where property taxes have  been8 increased, and that is certainly a hardship  on9 ail New Yorkers, the landlord real estate   housing10 industry is one of the few business sectors  in11 this City that is continuing even in these  tough12 economic times to make money.13 You know, if you look at  - -14 (Audience participation.)15 COUNCILMEMBER  CHRISTINE QUINN:16 If you look at the Department of Finance,  their17 analysis of the data that landlords provide  them,18 from 1989 to 2001 there was a 19 percent  increase19 in the operating income of landlords in  this20 City.21 And even if you look at  more22 recent data over the - - the most recent data of  a23 year' s period, there still, I believe, is a  624 percent increase in the operating income  of25 landlords in this City.2 
2	There is no other industry  out3 there right now that is seeing that type  of4 continuing increase in  numbers.5 (Audience participation.)6 COUNCILMEMBER  CHRISTINE QUINN:7 And my message really to the Board is look at   the8 information that you have before you, and  when9 you look at it , remember the plight of tenants10 because the information on the other side of   the11 ledger, one you have this increasing income  of12 landlords, and on the other we have  sharply13 increasing rates of unemployment	in this City,14 job loss, and some of the highest  homeless15 shelter rates we've ever seen in the  City.16 The two need to be looked  at17 together.18 If the Board moves forward  with19 the type of increases that have been talked  about20 at past meetings, I believe when you look  at21 what' s happening with unemployment , we will see22 many tenants in my district in this City who  have23 been able to hold on and contribute to this   City24 as rent -prot ected tenants being pushed out of25 their rent -protected homes, and I don' t really3 
2 know where they will end  up.3 Lastly, I just want to  say,4 after we finish the process this year, I  would5 welcome the opportunity to speak with the  Members6 of the Rent Guidelines Board about legislation   I7 have that would change the methodology used  by8 the RGB and the City, to change it to  the9 methodology  like what we have in the suburbs10 (Audience participation. )11 COUNCILMEMBER  CHRISTINE QUINN:12 - - where we look at actual  real  same year data  as13 opposed to the Price Index of Operating  Costs14 market basket information which is what you  all15 use now.16 Thank you very much.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 Any questions?19 (No response.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 (Audience participation. )22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We are going23 to go to the apartment sector  now.24 We will start with Mr.  Freund,25 Jack Freund.2 
1	4342 (No response.)3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	He's going to4 lose his chance.5 Nari  Matwani , are you here, an6 owner?7 (No response.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me call9 Susan Steinberg.10 MS . SUSAN STEINBERG:	I 'm Susan11 Steinberg and I 've been a resident of Stuyvesant12 Town for more than twenty years, during  which13 time I've seen about three economic  downturns,14 about every ten years.15 In the early	' 90s, I was laid16 off and remained unemployed	for eleven months and17 eleven days . Unemployed at that time, because I18 live in a reasonably priced apartment , I was able19 to cover my rent and a few other expenses.  True,20 I had to deplete my savings for food, but  I21 didn' t have to take a roommate. I'm too ornery. I22 didn' t have to move in with my parents . I 'm too23 old. I kept my home.24 And now, when I finally did  get25 work, I was very happy about it , but had to take2 
2 a $10,000 cut. And it took a few years to  recoup.3 But all during that time that  my4 income went down, my rent went  up.5 (Audi·ence participation.)6	MS. SUSAN STEINBERG:	And now7 the economy is soft and my industry is  having8 massive layoffs and things are rather shaky at   my9 firm and I could find myself unemployed  again.10 But luckily, because my11 apartment is still reasonably priced , with the12 unemployment	I will still be able to keep my  home13 even though I have to deplete my savings  for14 food.15 However,  I will  - - it will be16 really diff icult to have an 8.5 percent increase17 being faced with a layoff. I'm telling you   this18 just to try to underscore to you the fact  that19 the realities of middle class life are that   our20 labor market is not always secure nor is  the21 stock market.22 And no matter what happens  to23 the economy, rents always go up. Rents never  get24 downsized  like people.25 And  since the early	'90s - -7 
2(Audience participation.)3MS. SUSAN STEINBERG:	rents4havebeen inextricably increased with MCis  and5withsure- fire RGB increases. In fact , in the6lastten years my own rent has gone up  337	percent. Boy, I'd love it if my paycheck  did!8 (Audience participat ion.)9 MS. SUSAN STEINBERG:	Why is10 the middle class rent penalized? We' re the City' s11 tax base, but , you know, our pockets aren't that12 deep.13 I mean why is it okay for us  to14 be forced to move out of our homes or to  face15 decisions about do we have medicine or do we  have16 food. These are choices that many of  the17 residents of Stuyvesant Town and Peter  Cooper18 Village may well be making with a 8.5  percent19 increase or a 5.5 percent  increase.20 You know, I doubt that any  of21 you on this Board ever have to face those kinds22 of decisions.23 (Audience participation.)24 MS. SUSAN STEINBERG:	I doubt25 that you are going to be faced  - - I doubt   that10 
1	4372 any of you are ever going to have to be  faced3 leaving your home, being forced  out.4 And I respectfully request  that5 you consider the bigger picture when you make6 your final decision. In this economic climate  5.57 and 8.5 are not only unrealistic , they're8 unconscionable.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10	(Audience participation.)11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Vajra12 Kilgour.13 MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	Hl.  I14 I spoke with some of you a  few15 days ago and gave you copies of this which  I16 recommend to everybody.  It 's called  " Let Them17 Rent Cake. " It is available on the web.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Available19 where?20 MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	On the web.21 It 's very clear from what is22 there that the name of the game at that end  of23 the table is maximizing  profits.24 I find it very interesting  that25 actually not a very great number of  smaller12 
2 landlords were here to say that they were in  such3 dire straits they couldn' t do it anymore.4	Now, if a smaller landlord is  in5 such dire straits they can't do it anymore,  they6 have a remedy. They can go to the State. They   can7 open their books. They can get a  hardship8 increase.9 I know of no tenant who can  go10 to any State agency and say I can't do  the11 housing thing, can you help  me,12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	- - can you14 bring my income up to where I can keep myself   in15 a house.16 The landlord can go and say  can17 you bring my income up to where I can keep   the18 building. The tenant cannot do  that.19 The other thing is that the20 majority of landlords, the majority of  property,21 as you must know, is owned by very  large22 corporations.23 So if a small building owner  is24 looking to getting $3 , 000 to $5,000 more a year,25 those large corporations are looking to  get5 
2 hundreds of thousands of dollars more a year  out3 of peopl e who don' t have it to give.4	As I said , this is money that5	doesn' t go into small businesses.6	Let me tell you something  and7 give you a warning. If you do the right thing   on8 Thursday, if you vot e for no increase, which I9 know will be hard , or if you vote for a much10 lower increase, there is a good chance that  our11 friend Marvin here will vot e with you, take you12 out back and scream at you for half - an-hour, and13 then come back and call for a new  vote.14 (Audience participation.)15 MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	Well , I16 don' t think any of you are the kind of people  who17 are going to want to look at homeless  statistics18 a year or so down the line and say, whoa, see   how19 homelessness went up , I did that. I had a hand  in20 that , I helped that to happen.21 (Audience participat ion.)22 MS. VAJRA KILGOUR:	I don' t23 think you're that kind of peopl e. I think it24 would be well worth it to you to put up with   a25 half - an-hour of screaming in exchange for years7 
2	of a tranquil conscience to  come.3	So that 's one thing to bear in4 mind.5 Another thing to bear in mind  is6 that if - - if , as has been said, it 's not  your7 job to try to make society a better place, I  know8 it 's not your job to make it worse. And I would9 ask of you, please, a lot of harm has been  done,10 an enormous amount of harm has been done.  Please11 do no more harm.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Freund.15 MR . JACK FREUND :	Thank you,16 Mr . Chairman.17 Mr. Chairman, Members of  the18 Rent Guidelines Board:19 For the record, my name is  Jack20 Freund. I represent the Rent  Stabilization21 Association  and  its approximately	- -22 (Audience participation .)2 3	MR. JACK FREUND:	- - and its24 approximately 25,000 owners and managers  of25 regulated housing in New York  City.24 
2 The majority of these  owners,3 some of whom you've heard from, are mom and  pop4 operators of small businesses. These  owners5 provide the bulk of New York City' s affordable6 housing.7 Many of these mom and pop  owners8 are extremely fearful that they will not be  able9 to pay their real estate taxes and maintain  their10 buildings with the 5.5 percent rent increase  when11 building operating costs have increased by  1712 percent or more.13 They are fearful of even  coming14 before this Board to make their case  because15 (Audience participation. )16 MR. JACK FREUND:	- - they know17 that you, acting as judge and jury, are as  likely18 to reduce, rather than increase, the already  low19 proposed  rent guidelines.20 Your desire to keep rent21 increases low for the sake of households  under22 economic duress is understandable. But if  you23 express your charitable impulses by placing  that24 burden on property owners,25 (Audience participation. )2 
2 MR. JACK FREUND:	- - you are3 making a terrible mistake.4 (Audience participation. )5	MR. JACK FREUND:	Do not ask6 mom and pop owners to donate to tenants out  of7 their pockets when many  of their tenants  - -8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.9 MR. JACK FREUND:	- - are better10	off than the property owners.11	A PARTICIPANT:	Go up to Boston.12 (Audience part icipation.)13 MR. JACK FREUND:	All the14 evidence, the history  - -15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.16 MR. JACK FREUND:	All the17 evidence, the history and the formulas before  you18 call for significantly higher rent increases  this19 year. There is no formula which tells you  how20 much to reduce the required rent increase  needed21 to meet operating costs because some tenants  may22 not be able to afford that rent  increase.23 But there is another formula  you24 should consider. For every owner who will not  be25 able to maintain their building with  inadequate12 
2 rent guidelines, this Board will threaten  the3 living conditions of six, ten, twenty or  more4 tenants. Your effort to avoid tenant  hardship5 will backfire and hurt more tenants than  are6 benefitted.7 (Audience participation.)8	MR. JACK FREUND:	I'm here9	today - -10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.11 MR. JACK FREUND :	I'm here12 today to ask you to help save New York' s housing .13 I thank you for the time and effort that you  have14 already put into these  deliberations.15 (Audience participation .)16 MR. JACK FREUND:	But I fear17 your effort will be in vain unless you find  the18 wisdom and the courage to substantially  increase19 the proposed guidelines.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 Questions? Yes, Mr. Lubell.22 Question .23 We need order here because  we24 only have approximately two hours left and we  are25 trying to get everybody who wants to speak  to10 
2 speak. So we got to let everybody speak and  no3 interruptions or else it's not going to  work.4 Mr. Lubell.5	MR. LUBELL:	Mr. Freund , we have6 heard a number of tenants make reference to  the7 opportunity  for an owner to apply for a hardship8 increase if they are not making enough money  or9 not making any prof it from their building.10 Could you comment on the11 hardship  increase process for us, please?12 MR. JACK FREUND:	Sure.13 You asked an important  question,14 Mr. Lubell , because that is often thrown up if15 you're not making money on a building, why don' t16 you apply for a hardship rent  increase.17 The hardship rent increase18 process  is laughable. I'll give you an example.19 Last week I had an owner call ,20 Hispanic woman, three buildings  in Brooklyn,21 three six-unit buildings. The City had sold   tax22 liens and water and sewer liens on all of  those23 buildings because her rents did not enable her   to24 maintain the buildings and pay real estate,  wat er25 and sewer charges.6 
2 It doesn' t take long for the3 City to foreclose these days on liens. It  takes4 them only a year .5 It takes DHCR at least two  years6 to process the very few hardship  applications7 which manage to get through.8 The hardship application  itself9 is thirty- six pages long and comes with fifty-10 four pages of instructions . You need to hire a11 lawyer and an accountant to fill out  that12 hardship application .13 An owner, such as this owner who14 barely speaks English, has three small  holdings15 of eighteen units cannot  - -16 (Audience participation .)17 MR . JACK FREUND:	cannot18 even fill out the paperwork, and even if she  did,19 would not have that request processed in time  to20 save her building.21 So while we have gone to Albany22 year after year and talked to DHCR about a  quick23 way of processing hardship applications , the24 reality of the hardship application is that  it25 does, in effect , not exist in any practical way.2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mr . Lubell ,3 another question.4 MR. LUBELL:	Yes .5	Mr. Freund , we've had an6 opportunity to review, but I would like to  ask7 you to comment on the sublease allowance and  the8 need for that sublease allowance and the  reason9 for it.10 MR. JACK FREUND:	Sure .11 We were rather disappointed  that12 - I think a swell of confusion  - the   sublet13 allowance was not authorized at the  preliminary14 guideline .15 Let me make it clear that  the16 sublet allowance is a temporary surcharge,  that17 it does not affect the prime tenant who holds  the18 lease. It is something that that tenant passes  on19 through to a sublessor so that the tenant is  not20 affected, and after the sublease is over,  that21 sublet allowance drops off. It is not a  permanent22 addition to the base rent.23 What it is is an allowable24 the State legislat ion says you get a sublet25 allowance equal to the vacancy allowance.  That6 
2 was fine as long as we had a vacancy  allowance3 issued by the Rent Guidelines Board. They  forgot4 to change the language when they made it a  State5 vacancy allowance rather than an RGB  vacancy6 allowance, although you are still allowed  to7 issue a vacancy allowance if you so choose  in8 addition to the State vacancy  allowance.9 But it is a justifiable10 reimbursement essentially for the liabilities11 that the owner12 (Audience participat ion .)13 MR. JACK FREUND:	- - incurs in14 a sublet.15 The owner bargained  for a given16 tenant. The owner is now undertaking  the17 liability of another tenant. Okay? And the  owner18 deserves to be reimbursed for that liability   and19 the costs incurred it.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 Any more questions?22 (No response.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,24 Mr. Freund.25 Leslie Dalton.2

1	4 4 92 northwest Bronx.3 (Audience participation.)4	MR. JAMIE JEE:	I'm here today5 to testify about the hardship my neighbors and   I6 face and the need for more reasonable  rents.7 Whil e my neighbors and I come8 from many different backgrounds, most share  at9 least one thing in common: the battering of  high10 rates. And while advocacy groups in  my11	neighborhood , like the Northwest Bronx Clergy12 Coalition, do much to stem the t ide of eviction13 and dislocation, many of us are  simultaneously14 dealing with unemployment , stagnant and low15 wages, reduced or non- existent benefits,16 decreased  social services and increased family17 responsibilities.18 With all these undue  burdens,19 the last thing we can bear is to pay more  rent.20 To force us to do so would only further  displace21 our other basic  necessities.22 We would like as much as  anyone23 to ensure our landlords can maintain our24 buildings properly. But we haven' t seen that  with25 the current rent rolls. Instead we have  seen12 
1	4502 small owners go big and grow more  distant.3 (Audience participation.)4	MR. JAMIE JEE:	With the current5 proposed rent increase we would be even  worse6 off.7 In contrast , we know that8 landlords have been doing well. And all we' re9 simply asking is for accountability first , not  a10 rent increase.11 Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Nari Matwani.15 Are you here?
