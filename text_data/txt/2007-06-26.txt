4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good afternoon.5 My name is Marvin Markus.	I'm chair6 of the New York City Rent Guidelines Board.7 I'd like to welcome you - -8 (Audience participation.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'd like to10	welcome you to one in a - - the last in a  series11	of public meetings and public hearings all12 designed to fulfill our legislative mandate to13 vote for the one and two-year lease renewal14 guidelines for apartment houses that are subject15 to rent stabilization, hotel units that are16 subject to hotel stabilization and loft units17 that are subject to loft stabilization.18 Our agenda will consist of first19 doing the rent stabilized apartment and loft20 guideline, followed by the rent stabilized hotel21 guidelines.22 For the record, I will read in the2 3	draft guideline that was approved, other than the24 numbers, back about a month or so ago.	It's25 Order No. 39, Apartment and Loft Order No. 39.24 
1	52	And then we' ll begin the debate.	You' ll have to3 bear with me, it will take a little bit of time.4 For the record, we have to do this.5	2007 Apartment & Loft Order No. 39.6	June 26, 2007.7	Order Number 39 - Apartments and8	Lofts, rent levels for leases commencing October9	1, 2007 through September 30, 2008.10	Notice is hereby given pursuant to11	the authority vested in the New York City Rent12 Guidelines Board by the Rent Stabilization law of13 1969, as amended, and the Emergency Tenant14 Protection Act of 1974, as amended, implemented15 by Resolution No. 276 of 1974 of the New York16 City Council and extended by Chapter 82 of the17 Laws of 2003, and in accordance with the18 requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City19 Charter, that the Rent Guidelines Board hereby20 adopts the following levels of fair rent21 increases over lawful rents charged and paid on22 September 30, 2007.23 These rent - - these rent adjustments24 will apply to rent stabilized apartments with25 leases commencing on or after October 1, 2007 and12 
2 through September 30, 2008.3 Rent guidelines for loft units4 subject to Section 286 subdivision 7 of the5 Multiple Dwelling Law are also included in this6 order.7 Adjustment for renewal leases8 (apartments).9 Together with such further10 adjustments as may be authorized by law, the11 annual adjustment for renewal leases for12 apartments shall be:13 For a one-year renewal lease14 commencing on or after October 1, 2007 and on or15 before September 30, 2008: Blank percent.16 For a two-year renewal lease17 commencing on or after October 1, 2007 and on or18 before September 30, 2008: Blank percent.19 These adjustments shall also apply20 to dwelling units in a structure subject to the21 partial tax exemption program under Section 421a22 of the Real Property Tax Law, or in a structure23 subject to Section 423 of the Real Property Tax24 Law as a Redevelopment Project.25 Vacancy Allowance for apartments.2 
2There shall be blank Vacancy3Allowance.4Supplemental Adjustment.5There shall be blank Supplemental6 Adjustment for apartments renting below any7 specified amount for renewal leases.8 Equalization Allowance.9 There shall be blank Equalization10	Allowance for apartments continuously occupied11	for a specified period of time for renewal12 leases .13 Additional adjustment for rent14 stabilized apartments subject - - sublet  under15 Section 2525.6 of the Rent Stabilization code.16 In the event of a sublease governed17 by subdivision (e) of section 2525.6 of the Rent18 Stabilization Code, the allowance authorized by19 such subdivision shall be blank percent.20 Adjustments for lots (units in the21 category of buildings covered by Article 7-C of22 the Multiple Dwelling Law.)23 The Rent Guidelines Board adopts the24 following levels of rent increases above the25 "base rent, " as defined in Section 286,12 
2	subdivision 4, of the Multiple Dwelling Law, for3	units to which these guidelines are applicable in4	accordance with Article 7-C of the Multiple5 Dwelling Law:6 For one-year increase periods7 commencing on or after October 1, 2007 and on or8 before September 30, 2008:	Blank percent.9 For two-year increase periods10	commencing on or after October 1, 2007 and on or11	before September 30, 2008: Blank percent.12 Vacant Loft apartments.13 Blank Vacancy Allowance is permitted14 under this Order.	Therefore, except as otherwise15 provided in Section 286, subdivision 6, of the16 Multiple Dwelling Law, the rent charged to any17 tenant for a vacancy tenancy commencing on or18 after October 1, 2007 and on or before September19 30, 2008 may not exceed the "base rent"20 referenced above plus the level of adjustment21 permitted above for increase periods.22 Fractional Terms.23 For the purposes of these guidelines24 any lease or tenancy for a period up to and25 including one year shall be deemed a one-year12 
2	lease or tenancy, and any lease or tenancy for a3	period of over one year and up to and including4 two years shall be deemed a two-year lease or5 tenancy .6 Escalator Clauses.7 Where a lease for a dwelling unit in8 effect on May 31, 1968 or where a lease is in9 effect on June 30, 1974 for a dwelling unit which10 became subject to the Rent Stabilization Law of11	1969, by virtue of the Emergency Tenant12 Protection Act of 1974 and Resolution No. 276 of13 the New York City Council, contained an escalator14 clause for the increased costs of operation and15 such clause is still in effect, the lawful rent16 on September 30, 2007 over which the fair rent17 under this Order is computed shall include the18 increased rental, if any, due under such clause19 except those charges which accrued within one20 year of the commencement of the renewal lease.21 Moreover, where a lease contained an22 escalator clause that the owner may validly renew23 under the Code, unless the owner elects or has24 elected in writing to delete such clause,25 effective no later than October 1, 2007 from the12 
2	existing lease and all subsequent leases for  such3	dwelling unit, the increased rental, if any,  due4 under such escalator clause shall be offset5 against the amount of increase authorized under6 this Order.7 Special Adjustments under prior8	orders.9	All rent adjustments lawfully10	implemented and maintained under previous11	apartment orders and included in the base rent in12 effect on September 30, 2007 shall continue to be13 included in the base rent for the purpose of14 computing subsequent rents adjusted pursuant  to15 this Order.16 Special Guideline.17 Under Section 26- 513(b) (1) of the18 New York City Administrative Code, and  Section19 9(e) of the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of20 1974, the Rent Guidelines Board is obligated  to21 promulgate special guidelines to aid the  State22 Division of Housing and Community Renewal in  its23 determination of initial legal regulated  rents24 for housing accommodations previously subject  to25 the City Rent and Rehabilitation Law which  are12 
1	112 the subject of a tenant application for3 adjustment.4 The Rent Guidelines Board hereby5 adopts the following Special Guideline:6 For dwelling units subject to the7 Rent and Rehabilitation Law on September 30,8 2007, which become vacant after September 30,9 2007, the special guideline shall be: Blank.10 Decontrolled Units.11 The permissible increase for12 decontrolled units as referenced in Order 3a13 which become decontrolled after September 30,14 2007, shall be: Blank.15 Credits.16 Rentals charged and paid in excess17 of the levels of rent increase established by18 this Order shall be fully credited against the19 next month' s rent.20 Statement OF Basis and Purpose.21 The Rent Guidelines Board is22 authorized to promulgate rent guidelines23 governing apartment units subject to the Rent24 Stabilization Law of 1969, as amended, and the25 Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974, as2 
2	amended. 3 The purpose of these guidelines is4 to implement the public policy set forth  in5 Findings and Declaration of Emergency of the Rent6 Stabilization Law of 1969 (§26-501 of the New7 York City Administrative Code) and in the8 Legislative Findings contained in the Emergency 9 Tenant Protection Act of 1974 (L.1974 c. 576, §4 10		[§2].)11	The Rent Guidelines Board is also12 authorized to promulgate rent guidelines for  loft13 units subject to Section 286 subdivision 7 of  the14 Multiple Dwelling Law.	The purpose of the loft15 guidelines is to implement the public policy  set16 forth in the Legislative Findings of Article 7-C17 of the Multiple Dwelling Law (Section 280.)18Dated June26,2007.19Do we haveanymotions?Does20 anybody have any motions to make?21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Yes.2 3	(Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Languedoc.25 (Audience participation.)24 
2	MR. LANGUEDOC:	Mr. Chair?3	(Audience participation. )4	MR. LANGUEDOC:	Mr. Chairman.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. Mr.6 Languedoc.7 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.	Thank8 you, Mr. Chairman.9 I would like to move this Board to10 adopt a rent freeze.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ron, today12 you've got to13 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I would like to14 move this Board to adopt a rent freeze for  this15 year; zero percent increase on both one  and16 two-year renewal lease guidelines.	Zero percent 1718 (Audience participation.)19 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Zero percent20 Supplemental Adjustment.	Zero percent Sublet21 Allowance and zero in Special Guidelines22 increase.2 3	In support of that motion I would24 like to point out that the evidence provided  to25 this Board in the course of its deliberations  was24 
2 that the vacancy rate for the last year was only3 3.09 percent ; that the median rent of rent4 stabilized units is already unaffordable to the5 majority - -6 (Audience participation. )7 MR. LANGUEDOC:	- - of rent8	stabilized tenants; that the median rent - -  the9 New York City Fair Market Rent for vacant10 apartments far exceeds the affordable amount for11	the average New York City resident ; that12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. LANGUEDOC:	the City has lost14 over 6,000 rent stabilized units in the last15 year, that we have information available; that in16 contrast, since the state law was changed in17 1997, landlords have benefited from the18 amendments of those laws by being able to collect19 rent increases of 20 percent on vacancy, and in20 many instances there have been multiple21 vacancies, 20 percent vacancy increases.22 Additionally, approximately 60,00023 units have left rent stabilization due to having24 rents over $2,000 and/or high- income, high- rent25 deregulation.	And the city has lost already12 
2	thousands of units previously under the3	Mitchell- Lama program.4	At the same time, this Board has5 heard ample evidence to show that the existing6 enforcement of the City Housing Code and State7 Housing Code has been lax; that many rent8 stabilized tenants are forced to live in9 substandard conditions.10	(Audience participation. )11	MR. LANGUEDOC:	And that the DHCR12 has - -13 (Audience participation.)14 MR. LANGUEDOC:	The DHCR has15 failed to enforce the annual registration16 requirements resulting in unjust enrichment by17 many landlords.18 And therefore, Mr. Chairman, I feel19 that a rent freeze is warranted at this time.20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there a second22 on the motion?2 3	MS.

SCHLEIDER:	And welcome to the16 public assembly gathered here.17 (Audience participation. )18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	As I've said many19 times before, "This year's deliberations have not20 been easy for the owner' s members in spite of21 reports illustrating a very easy case to be made22 for rent increases as a result of continued2 3	higher operating costs. " We've all seen the press24 and staff reports highlighting positive25 developments in the City.24 
3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Hold on, Mr.4Schleider.5MR. SCHLEIDER:NewYork City' s6economy - -7CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Mr. Schleider,8hold on.9Could we pleasehaveorder.	Please.10	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair, that's11	fine.	It doesn' t bother me.	Mr. Chair?12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider,14 go ahead.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.16 New York City' s economy grew by17 almost four percent between the fall of 2000 and18 2006, continuing the rate of growth for all of 19	2005.20 (Audience participation.)21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The City gained22 more than 52,000 jobs in 2006 up from the 200523 total employment, and the unemployment rate24 decreased to 4.9 percent last year, and the25 inflation rate in New York City was less than the20 
2 national rate, and the leading economic3 indicators suggest a continued, but cautious4	expansion.5 But still, as you all know here, all6 is not milk and honey for everybody as reports7 show we are up against a severe housing crisis, a8 crisis in a broad range of housing affordability.9 And housing affordability is a chronic issue for10	New Yorkers.11	As I've said many times before this12 assembly, affordabiJity has been an issue for as13 long as I can remember and will probably be an14 issue for some time to come.	Yes, housing15 should be affordable.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider,17 hold on.18 You guys need to sit down.	You need19 to sit down.20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We need the22 audience members to sit down.	Sit down.	Sit2 3	down.	You got your picture, now sit down.24 Beautiful.25 MR . SCHLEIDER:	All right, Mr.24 
2	Chair?3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider,4	hold on.5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.6 (Audience participation.)7 (There was a pause in the8 proceedings .)9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right, Mr.10	Chair? Mr. Chair?11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.12 Mr. Schleider.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' ll try again.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.16 Yes, housing should be  affordable,17 but availability drives market pricing.  And18 documentation shows this administration has done19 a major effort towards increasing  housing20 availability for half a million people - and at21 pricing affordable to the vast majority of low22 and moderate- income New Yorkers. This is sound2 3	public policy.24 The administration has offered25 housing subsidies of up to $14,600 to entice new24 
2	Math, Science and Special Education teachers to3	work in the City' s most challenging schools.4 That' s another great public policy move .5 And this administration has expanded6 the SCRIE program.	And Speaker Quinn has7 testified before us that this and the DRIE8	program will be expanded . I hope that continuing9 sound public policy will move the City Council to10 press for further expansion of these and other11	programs to help those most at housing risk .12 This is what is needed. This is what13 has always been needed, a workable public policy14 to address housing affordability and15 availability.	And the key to affordable housing16 is to produce more and to preserve what' s already17 in place . We need to continue to preserve the18 vast majority of private rental stock that has19 become the backbone of the City.20 But what of the affordability issue?21 What of the homelessness issue? What of the22 lower- income households in a chronic state of2 3	stress over living expenses - all expenses and24 not just rent payments?25 Public policy that addresses income24 
2 assistance is necessary.	The Board will not be3 silent on this.	And the Board has discussed the4 income gap that effects about one in five rent5 stabilized households and the Board will address6 it for many years to come unless appropriate7 income subsidies become public policy; a workable8 public policy to address income gaps in housing9 affordability that puts responsibility where  it10	needs to be - on the shoulders of government -  is11	what' s needed.12 As noted in a memo from Community13 Services Society, an advocacy group for tenants,14 in a memo dated December 2006" ... Rent burdens15 are the combined result of two distinct  forces16 that affect families - those that drive rents  and17 those that drive wages and income. "18 The memo also notes low income19 renters in the private market faced rapidly20 escalating rents and small income gains, with  the21 effect of eating into the real value of household2 2	income left to meet other needs.2 3	The critical part of the solution,24 according to this tenant advocate group, is  the25 need to raise incomes.	For most low- income New24 
2	Yorkers, that means policies to increase3	take- home pay. The memo cited policies to4 include:	One, indexing the New York State5 minimum wage so its value is not eroded by6 inflation;7	Two, expanding opportunities for job8 training; and9 Three, the City should extend its10 annual property tax rebate to low-income renters .11	It's an income issue, it's an income issue, and12 it's an income issue and government policy to13 address cost of living for those most at risk14 needs to be devised .15 We've read reports that, finally,16 another 22,000 Section 8 vouchers will be made17 available for rent assistance.	We've read that18 Speaker Quinn thought a renter rebate would make19 sense . We've heard testimony from a tenant20 advocacy group that it's flexible  housing21 assistance that works to lift families out of22 homelessness and to prevent recurring episodes of23 homelessness.24 Tenants, a sizable voting block, and25 their advocacy groups, need to focus their12 
2	efforts and energies on assisting the3	administration to further focus these income gap4 closure initiatives.5 But the tenants' income gap is only6 one of the problems facing this Board tonight.7 The vast majority of landlords own  small8 buildings.	About 40 percent of the regulated9 rental housing stock is in buildings of less than10 11 units, including buildings of up to 30 units11	covers the majority of the regulated rental12 stock .	The vast majority of these landlords have13 been suffering the cost increases of real estate14 taxes, insurance, fuel oil, labor and services15 for years without a commensurate increase in16 rents.17 There is no government income18 subsidy for these gatekeepers of the existing19 affordable housing stock.	These gatekeepers are20 the private citizens that the City has21 inequitably forced to shoulder a public cost with22 higher real estate taxes, an 11.5 percent23 upcoming increase in water and sewer charges on24 top of last year 's 9.4 percent increase and the25 announced 17 percent Con Ed rate increase .
2	Some say the landlords don't need3 the help in shifting the burden for subsidizing4 tenant incomes or meeting costs.	Some point to5 the press for lowered real estate tax rates, but6 fail to see that assessments for rental7 properties went up on average more than  218	percent for this next tax year.	So the small tax9 rate decrease will mean that taxes increase of10 more than 12 percent on average for rental11	properties.12 Although the City' s housing stock13 condition has improved in recent years, the14 residents are noting improved neighborhood15 conditions.	And we've seen the staff reports16 that show the large increase in distressed17 housing where expenses are greater than rents,18 and this is frightening.	The percentage of19 distressed renal properties doubled in five  years20 and still eleven out of 100 rental properties  are21 in economic distress.22 What does this mean for the future23 of rent stabilization?	The damage from24 inadequate rent increases so far has encouraged25 the sale of barely profitable rent stabilized
2 buildings from long- term stable ownership to3 speculators that have no other agenda but to4 clear the building for higher rents or convert5 the properties to condos which will permanently6 remove those apartments from rent regulation.7 No amount of rent increase will satisfy that8 property manipulator because that property9 manipulator doesn' t want any tenants to collect10 rent from.11	But unless commensurate rent12 increases finally begin, more and more landlords13 - those willing to remain as landlords providing14 rental housing for the City - more landlords will15 sell to property manipulators because the16 landlords can't keep up with the rapid rise in17 operating expenses.18 Remember, a rent stabilized19 apartment lease is not a birthright, but an20 obligation to the process, both of tenants and21 sharing the cost increase burden and the22 landlords in providing habitable and safe23 housing.	And our reports show the overwhelming24 majority of housing continues to be  well25 maintained, but we can't ignore the rising  tide12 
2 of distressed housing.	This Board can't regulate3 the market forces but we need to be responsive to4 them.5 And this year's continuing operating6 cost increases of 5.1 percent on top of last7 year' s 7.8 percent on top of the prior 6.98 percent increase on top of the prior year' s 16.99 percent increase in operating costs must be10	shared.	This is a 36.7 percent increase in11	operating costs in just four years.	The tenants12 must share in these cost increases.13 The Board' s own calculation show14 commensurate rent increases almost as high as ten15 percent for a two-year renewal lease. This Board16 must allow landlords to protect New York' s17 housing and to equitably share the burden.18 I've said this before, "That this19 Board can and must respect the expectations of a20 reasonable return if the market is to maintain21 its investment in, what is referred to as, 'the22 largest inventory of affordable housing in the23 City. I	This Board cannot frustrate the24 expectations of a steady and predictable25 operating income for landlords and expect them to12 
2	preserve the housing stock called the backbone of3	this City' .4 To be fair, there should be a5 sharing of the cost  increases .	The landlords6 have been burdened with the lion's share of cost7 increases and will continue so given the Board' s8 reluctance to provide for adequate rent9 increases .10 But that being said, and in the11	spirit of sharing the burden, I call for a vote12 for a commensurate rent increase lower than what13 the owners called for at the preliminary vote.	I14 move for an increase limited to five percent for15 a one-year renewal lease and a nine percent16 increase on a two-year renewal lease .17 Thank you, Mr. Chair.18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 Is there a second on that?21 MS . CRUZ:	I second that motion,22 Mr. Chair.2 3	(Audience participation.)24 MS . CRUZ:	And I would like to add25 a friendly amendment?24 
2	(Audience participation.)3	MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Chair, I would like4 to add an amendment to the motion, please.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.6 Ms . Cruz.	Go ahead.7 MS. CRUZ:	We have heard much8	about the struggles of the small property owners.9 These are the property owners that are key to10 enabling the City to continue its affordable11	housing - a concern that all the Board members12 are concerned about.13 It is our obligation under the law14 to provide sufficient increases to those property15 owners that provide the affordable housing of16 this City.17 (Audience participation.)18 MS. CRUZ:	In support of the core19 group of property owners, I move that a20 Supplemental Adjustment be enacted, in  addition21 to any other renewal guidelines, that in  a22 building of 20 units or less for any  apartment23 continuously occupied for ten years or more,  an24 additional $15 increase for those apartments.25 (Audience participation. )12 
2 MS. CRUZ:	These are apartments3 that are renting at less than $600 a month.4 (Audience participation.)5 MS. CRUZ:	I also would like to add6 on the subletting, a subletting provision for an7 allowance of ten percent which this Board has8 traditionally allowed - -9 (Audience participation. )10 MS. CRUZ:	And lastly - - one more,11 one more, one more.12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. CRUZ:	And lastly, Chairman,14 for the initial rents on decontrolled units15 entering stabilization, for the Maximum Base16 Rent, plus 100 percent of that rent, plus a Fuel17 Adjustment, or alternatively, the approximate18 Fair Market Rent for Section 8 housing as19 established by HUD for New York City PMSA20 adjusted for gas and electric charges, whichever21 is greater.22 I'm going to pass down, because of23 the volume of the audience, to the other Board24 members the proposal for the supplement.25 MS.

HOLDER:	I want to - - I would18 like to - -19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Go ahead,20 Ms. Holder.21 MS. HOLDER:	Good evening.	Good22 even, Board members.	Good evening.23 I - - I had a prepared speech tonight24 and I'm not really feeling good, not necessarily25 about the speech, but also I'm not feeling well12 
2	today.3	I especially don' t - - I4 especially - -5 (Audience participation.)6 MS. HOLDER:	I especially don' t - -7 (Audience participation.)8	MS. HOLDER:	I especially don' t9 feel good about the impossible situation that10 every year it seems that the Board is put in  in11	dealing with this housing stock here in New York12 City.13 I listen to my colleague, Steven14 Schleider, and he talks about that this is  an15 income issue and to a certain extent he' s right.16 It is an income issue but it also is an17 affordability issue and it's something that we18 have to grapple with as a Board.19 Flexible housing assistance does20 work and I'm glad that he has heard that  through21 testimony and I think everyone understands that.22 There are subsidies and there are other  things23 that we should be doing here in the City and  the24 state should really allow the City to be able  to25 be in control of its housing stock12 
2	(Audience participation.)3 MS. HOLDER:	be it through the4 amendment of rent regulation or a national  repeal5 of Erstaed.	Something needs to change.6 (Audience participation. )7	MS. HOLDER:	But the idea that8 people have to share the burden - - there is a9 burden and I'm not going to sit here and I'm  not10 going to talk about how there are not increased11	costs.	We all experience them every day.12 But we know that the impact of13 increased costs on certain populations in New14 York City do not have the same effect on others.15 And so the idea of sharing the burden, it  can't16 be shared.	It's nothing that can be done equally17 but it must be done equitably.18 (Audience participation.)19 MS. HOLDER:	It is unconscionable20 for us to sit here and think that tenants are21 supposed to continuously shoulder the burden of22 these costs and increases in trying to maintain2 3	housing for themselves and their families.24 I was going to talk to you all25 about how tens of thousands of New York  City24 
2	families every year - -3	(Audience participation.)4 MS. HOLDER:	are finding5 themselves facing eviction.	As a Legal Aid6 attorney, you know that I see this every day.	We7 handle tens of thousands of cases.	And remember,8 for every seven people who come to us and to9 Legal Services, our sister agency, we can  only10 take one of their cases.	For every seven we can11	only take one in the housing context.	And that12 is sad and it leads to evictions and13 homelessness.14 But what we' re talking about, we're15 talking about - - just as we look out in this16 audience, we're talking about a diverse group of17 people who live in rent regulated housing.18 We' re talking about families and singles.	We' re19 talking about the elderly.	We' re talking about20 the disabled.	We' re talking about children.	And21 we' re talking about people of color as well as22 white people, middle income people, but all  of23 them with average median rents under $31,000  a24 year.25 There' s no way that we can continue12 
2 to think that these folks are going to be able to3 maintain housing as we continue to every year4 after every year saddle them with such high5 increases.6 (Audience participation.)7 MS. HOLDER:	I wanted	I wanted8	to talk to you about how between 2002 and 20039 New York City lost over 44,000 rent regulated10 units and buildings constructed before 1947 to11	high rent vacancy decontrol .	But you know this12 and they lost it also to coop and condo13 conversions.14 I wanted to talk to you about how in15 my neighborhood district most - - I mean my16 neighborhood, which is Harlem, I live in Central17 Harlem where there were a number of shootings18 this weekend, as you all know, I live very, very19 close to there.20 But despite all of those things, we21 are all being priced out of Harlem.	All of us22 are being priced out of Harlem.	I'm not someone23 on public assistance, but I'm being priced out of24 Harlem.	As a rent regulated tent I, too am25 finding it increasingly difficult to understand12 
2	how it is that I might decide if were to have  a3	family, how it is that I could afford to live  in4 my neighborhood where I also worship, where  I5 also tend to the gardens, where I also6 participate on my block association.7 And what we have found is that in8 our own - - the RGB' s 2007 Housing Supply report,9 the Attorney General' s office has reported a 75.810	increase in the number of condominium or11	cooperative unit plans that were accepted in12 2006.	And, you know, we all know it's going on.13 I see it in my neighborhood, East Harlem, Central14 Harlem, West Harlem.	I see it everywhere and15 it's going on throughout New York.16 And so we have been trying to17 encourage our colleagues, this Board, to  really18 reconsider how it is that we do business.	And I19 have been pleased, and I want to state for  the20 record that I have been very pleased that my21 colleagues here on the Board have entertained22 suggestions that we have had, but how it is that2 3	we must deal with this and grapple with  this.24 And I've had conversations with25 every member of this Board about this.	Now, we24 
2	don't all agree, but I think that we all do agree3	that the one-size- fit-all approach has to change .4 (Audience participation. )5 MS. HOLDER:	And I've appreciated6 that part of the conservation.	And I hope that7 we can see to it making sure that the8 one- size- fit-all approach will change.9 My background as - - my background as10 an attorney at the Legal Aid Society dealing with11	race and poverty issues and the history of my12 organization and the cases and the struggles that13 we are faced in trying to help low income New14 Yorkers is one where we have tried to be15 creative, and we 've tried to stretch the16 parameters of what was always known to be the way17 or the things that people had to live with.18 And we've had many successes.	And I19 look at you and I know there are advocates out20 there and there are legislators and there are21 people who support all of us as New Yorkers, who22 have too stretched and done everything that you23 all could to make sure that we have affordable24 housing.25 You've gone to D.C. when it comes to12 
2 public housing and when it's dealt with3 subsidies.	And I've ridden on those buses  with4 you and we've brought those lawsuits.	And we've5 won some of them and we've lost others.	And I6 know that you all will continue to be there  and7	I'm so happy for that.8	I've been with you at the State9	Capitol as we have not only asked for the  repeal10	of Urstadt, but as we have tried, during the11	sunset of the rent regulation laws, tried to make12 them stronger but always in the last minute  it's13 just about saving them. And so they've continued14 to erode.	And I've seen you there and I see  you15 there repeatedly as you're trying to deal with16 these issues of high vacancy decontrol and what' s17 happening with the Mitchell-Lama program.	And I18 will continue to be with you in that  struggle.19 But I have to say, even at the City20 level, that we've had some great fights and21 there' s been some great victories.	But we have22 to admit that as you come here and you've been  to2 3	all those other places and you come to Cooper24 Union, you know that we are the other body  that25 you need to really sit on and make sure that  we24 
2	do the right thing.3 The Rent Guidelines Board is a part4 of the problem.	And I am so embarrassed to have5 to sit here and be a part of the problem year6 after year.7 (Audience participation.)8 MS. HOLDER:	It increasingly - - it9	increasingly becomes more and more difficult  to10	have to go through this process where we are11	constantly seeing the loss of affordable housing.12 And we should know that we are adding to that.13 We, this Board, are adding to that.	And I really14 do - - I do commend my colleagues for thinking15 outside of the box to try to figure out things16 that we can do and I really hope that we will.17 I hope that we will continue to try18 to talk about the one-size- fit-all approach not19 working.	And I hope we also will talk about20 resolutions that we could perhaps pass to ask  the21 state and force the state to seriously consider22 what our voice hears - - our voice says here in2 3	New York City about what we're supposed to do24 with housing.25 But Chair, what I propose now, and24 
2	I'm not happy about it, but we all know there' s3	going to be an increase.	You even hear it on the4 news and you see it in the papers and you know5 historically what' s happened.	So I can't go on6 and say a zero percent increase.7 But what I would to say is that on a8 one-year lease I would propose a one percent9 increase.	And on a two percent lease - -10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Two-year lease.11	MS. HOLDER:	I would propose a12 two percent - - a two-year lease, I would propose13 a two percent increase.	But I also would like to14 introduce some provisos that I hope that we could15 actually entertain.16 (Audience participation.)17 MS. HOLDER:	And let me just say18 I'm not saying - - and I'd like to repeat that I19 am not saying that owners do not have increased20 costs.	What I'm saying is that - -21 (Audience participation.)22 MS. HOLDER:	What I'm saying is2 3	that the idea that there has to be	every year24 the idea that gets forced to us is that this type25 of burden has to be shouldered by the tenants is24 
2	ridiculous.	And every year - -3 (Audience participation.)4 MS. HOLDER:	And every year as we5 consider all of the relevant data, what it  shows6 us is that landlords are actually doing  really7 well for the business that they' re in.8 (Audience participation.)9 MS. HOLDER:	I'm not going to sit10 here and tell you to sell your buildings.	I'm11	not going to sit here and tell you that what you12 all are talking about may be bad business13 practices or that you're bad business people.14 That' s not what I'm going to say.15 What I'm going to say is that let's16 think about these issues and let's talk about it17 in such a way where we're not saddling the18 tenants with the full burden of increases  in19 costs.20 So, Chair - -21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.22 MS. HOLDER:	one percent on a2 3	one-year lease.24 Two percent on a two-year lease.25 And then the annual adjustment  for
2	renewal leases commencing on or after October  1,3	2007 or before September 30, 2008 shall be  zero4 percent if 50 percent or less of the residential5 units in a building are occupied by rent6 stabilized or rent controlled tenants paying no7 more than the legal regulated rent at the  time8 that any rent increase in this Order would9 otherwise be authorized, or five or more10 hazardous violations which are B&C violations  per11	unit exist, calculated by the number of unit and12 public area violations13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. HOLDER:	- - and have not been15 corrected within the required statutory timeframe16 and will remain zero until such time that HPD  can17 verify, through its own inspection, that the18 violations have been corrected.19 I think we can all agree on this20 Board that owners that are not putting the21 increases that they receive back into maintaining22 these buildings in safe conditions do not deserve23 these increases.	And I think that we should all24 also agree that in those buildings where there25 are market rate apartments, that landlords  are
2	experiencing a fair return on their rent.	And I3	would like to just remind everyone that the Rent4 Guidelines Board' s mandate and what we are5 supposed to be talking about is we' re supposed to6 be dealing with - - we' re supposed to be able to7 set rent guidelines that are going counteract the8	effects of an acute housing shortage and9 free-market conditions and the rules of supply10 and demand do not apply to the New York City11	rental market.12 We all know this.	And this13 shortage still exists because we all know that14 the vacancy rate is at 3.09 percent.	A vacancy15 rate of less than five percent creates abnormal16 market conditions.	So we need to protect this17 housing stock.	We need to maintain18 affordability.	And what I really would ask is19 for my colleagues to support my motion at this20 final vote for apartments.21 Thank you.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there a second25 on that motion?
2	MR. LANGUEDOC:	I second.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there any4 debate?	Let me repeat the motion.5 For one - -6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.	Mr. Chair.7 Mr. Chair.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Let me just9 repeat the motion, then we' ll have a debate.10	For a one-year lease, a one percent11	increase;12 For a two-year lease, a two percent13 increase with two so-called provisos, one is if14 50 percent of the units are destabilized, you do15 not get the one percent or two percent, and five16 major capital	major violations.17 Go ahead, Mr. Schleider.18 MS. HOLDER:	Five hazardous19 violations defined as A or B violations.20 MR. LANGUEDOC:	B or C.21 MS. HOLDER:	I mean B or C22 violations, sorry, per unit as calculated by the2 3	number of units and public area violations.24 That' s what I'm talking about, not just five25 period.
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Per unit.3 MS. HOLDER:	Per unit; per unit or4 public area.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Or a public area.6 Okay .7 Go ahead.	Mr. Schleider.8 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you, Mr.9 Chair.	Thank you, Adriene, for pointing out a10	few things that I've been trying to articulate11	but you do it so much better.12 But I have to take umbrage with the13 characterization that it's all tenants who can't14 afford increases.	Maybe we should do a means15 test.	And I brought that up to you before.	And16 certainly not all landlords are experiencing wild17 profits as you put out there.18 But the so-called proviso19 prohibiting landlords from collecting the lawful20 guideline increases if an arbitrarily selected21 percentage of units within a building are22 deregulated, is ill- formed, unresponsive and23 counterproductive to maintain the rent stabilized24 housing stock .25 (Audience participation.)12 
2	MR. SCHLEIDER:	What testimony do3	you bring for us to decide this issue?	And there4 has been no debate of this issue before the Board5 and airing or discussion of any fact or  evidence6 illustrating its direct impact, if any, on  the7	operation of rent stabilized housing.8	What of the deregulated unit rents9	that are at parity with rent stabilized rents10	within a building?	How are they treated?	Why11	would it make a difference?	And remember that12 Citywide rents are fairly homogenous and13 deregulation does not mean windfalls.14 What of the small building where15 this low number of deregulated units would16 effectively freeze in the income in the face  of17 rising expenses.	Sorry Adriene, but this18 position has not be properly vetted and a vote  on19 this would be inappropriate, therefore, I move20 that this proviso, the so-called proviso be21 struck.22 Also, the so-called proviso23 prohibiting landlords from collecting the  lawful24 guideline increases if an arbitrarily  concocted25 number of violations exist, is ill- formed,12 
2	unresponsive and counterproductive to remedies3	already in place.4 I'm not against the notion of5 providing safe and affordable and habitable6 housing.	And if you remember, at least week' s7	public testimony I was the only Board member to8 go on record that I was families with poor9 housing conditions in the Bronx and that a10 landlord with 600 violations for a 16-unit11	building should not be entitled to collect the12 rent increase.13 That answer makes sense.	And that14 answer is appropriate and that answer from  an15 owner' s representative amazed the Board members16 and the attending public audience.17 (Audience participation. )18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	There is no19 argument that there are a small number of  owners20 that neglect their property and their tenant' s21 basic needs, but there are remedies in place  to22 protect tenants from such conditions.	And there2 3	are remedies in place to prod, push and act24 against owners to redeem their property.	There25 are remedies in place to criminally prosecute24 
1	532	owners who blatantly violate safe housing3	condition statutes.4 In testimony before this Board, DHCR5 told us of its proactive expanded reach out to6 tenants including an improved call service and of7 a commitment to addressing housing violations.8	HPD is also committed to the process9 of addressing and correcting violations and both10 the DHCR and HPD told this Board that our11	assistance in pressuring owners was not welcome12 and rightly so.13 These agencies have promised us14 enhanced attention and a shifting in priorities15 towards code enforcement.	Additionally, Mayor16 Bloomberg, along with Speaker Quinn the other17 week, announced the Safe Housing Act to further18 prod, push, and prosecute correction of housing19 violations and sets out a mechanism, guidance and20 timeframe for owners to answer, address and21 correct the violations.22 This is an addition to last year's2 3	measure to involve the lending community in the24 process.	That' s a well thought out remedy. There25 are more remedies in place now and more public24

54awareness of the procedures than before . It's prudent and responsive to give the remedies in place and the commitments from DHCR and HPD their promise to give teeth to the numerous remedies in place and the opportunity to do their job .                 Any comment, action or opinion by this Board, however well meaning, can only serve to confuse or diminish the impact of those codes and statutes and may also confuse or diminish the efforts of the agencies' tasks to enforce the laws .I move that that proviso be struck. (Audience participation .)CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	These MS. CRUZ:	Mr . Chair?                 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	movements, if you will, are in the form of a question whetheror not you're willing to amend your motion to strike those provisos.                 Are you willing to amend the motion to strike the provisos?MS. CRUZ :	Mr. Chair MS. HOLDER:		No .CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No. Okay .
2	MS. CRUZ:	- - before Ms. Holder3	answers, I did want to just add to Mr. - -4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.5 MS. CRUZ:	That in addition, we've6 received an opinion letter from Corporation7 Counsel that has advised this Board that the8 provisos that Ms. Holder is proposing is beyond9 the authority of this Board.10	MS. HOLDER:	When did you receive11	that?12 MS. CRUZ:	This was the memo that13 was given to this Board in which your office14 commented and put in opposition to that legal15 opinion.16 MS. HOLDER:	No.	But the provisos17 - - just as point of correction, the memo that was18 submitted to this Board last week changed, and19 you know, the proposed provisos, and actually20 eliminated two of them so - -21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	But the question222 3	MS. CRUZ:	These two were24 specifically addressed by the Corporation25 Counsel' s memo.	And it very clearly advised this
2	Board that it was beyond the scope of our3 authority to enact such - - that type of a housing4 policy.5 MS. HOLDER:	Right.	And we6 disagreed in our analysis.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.8 MS. HOLDER:	I just had one - - so9 no, I don' t accept that.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You don't accept11	the amendment.12 So is there any - -13 MS. HOLDER:	May I?14 (Audience participation. )15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.	Sure.	Go16 ahead.17 MS. HOLDER:	I still would just18 like to say that when we're talking about19 (Audience participation.)20 MS. HOLDER:	When we' re talking21 about all the reports that we have and we' re22 talking about the information we have before  it,2 3	you know, it is wonderful what the staff of the24 Rent Guidelines Board every year is able to put25 together.24 
2	But I have to say that this year' s3	Price Index of Operating Cost, also what people4 say is referred as the PIOC, has to be understood5 in a larger historical context.6 The dramatic increase in Net7 Operating Income or NOI, between 1989 and  20028 suggests that the RGB has historically9	over-estimated owner' s operating and maintenance10	costs and instituted guidelines higher than those11	which were required to enable owners to properly12 maintain their buildings and profit margins.13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. HOLDER:	And as we continue to15 see, as we continue to· look at the data, it16 becomes more and more clear that this is not  a17 perfect way of looking at it.18 What we should think about is that19 the PIOC, as we are looking at it, is an20 extremely imprecise and controversial measurement21 of owner' s income and expenses.	The New York22 City Rent Guidelines Board should have the2 3	ability to make decisions based on owner' s actual24 yearly data.25 (Audience participation.)24 
1	582	MS. HOLDER :	And so when my3	colleague - -4 (Audience participation .)5 MS. HOLDER :	So when my colleague6 Steve Schleider says that there are tenants who7 are able to afford their rent, he is absolutely8 right.	I can afford my rent, but at the same9	time that we talk about that there are landlords10	who cannot afford to keep their buildings, we11	can 't all have it both ways.12 And so to the extent that there are13 tenants who cannot afford their rent we know that14 there are landlords who actually are making15 hand-over- fist profits .16 (Audience participation. )17 MS. HOLDER:	And so what Ipropose18 that we talk about - - and we don't need	you19 know, Ihave a motion that' s out there, but I20 want people to always consider is that the Rent21 Guideline Boards of Nassau, Westchester, and22 Rockland Counties, which have the power to23 subpoena owner's revenue and income data,24 consistently pass significantly lower increases25 than the New York City Rent Guidelines Board.12 
1	59r	2	Tenants in New York City should have3 the same rights as tenants in Nassau, Westchester4 and Rockland Counties to know that the increases5 on their apartments are based upon their6 landlords' income and cost.	And so this is an7 imperfect process, but we can make it better and8 I would just really encourage that my colleagues9 really think about it.10 And I do appreciate the11 conversations that we've been able to have this12 year .	But we need to do more and constantly13 remind ourselves that we cannot sluff off the14 responsibility of this housing crisis to someone15 else.16 We were all appointed to sit on this17 Board and we represent different constituencies,18 it's true.	But we all have heard the testimony.19 We've seen the reports .	We live in this City . We20 know what' s going on.	And please, let's try to21 do something different to really help folks who22 need to maintain this affordable housing stock.23 And we balance it, but the balance is not one of24 equality, it's about what's equitable .	What is25 equitable for tenants versus landlords who are
2	making a lot of money.3 (Audience participation.)4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair, just a7 point of clarification.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Point of9 clarification.10	MR. SCHLEIDER:	If Ms. Holder' s11	going to cite from the reports, let's also look12 at the 2007 Income and Expense study which shows13 that the average rent growth since the '89- '9014 year15 (Audience participation.)16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	- - was - -17 (Audience participation.)18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	These are taken19 these are taken from city records, certified20 income and expense statements from the owners.21 (Audience participation. )22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The average rent2 3	growth over those 12 years averages 4.6 percent a24 year.	The average income growth, 4.7 percent.25 The average cost growth is six percent.	And the
2	average NLI growth much to - - sorry, but to3 counter what you said before, Adriene, the4 average NLI growth is 1.6 percent.	In fact, the5 last two years of the report show negative NLI6 growth.7 So I have to take a position in8 opposition to your characterization of the health9 of the rental stock.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any additional11	debate?12 (No response. )13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Call the14 question.15 The question is for a one-year16 lease, one percent.	For a two-year lease, two17 percent with two provisos, which I'll give18 shorthand, the 50 percent non-regulated proviso19 and the five violations proviso; is that correct?20 MS. HOLDER:	Well, that' s short21 shrift, but I mean do you want22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, I think2 3	the Board understands it - -24 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	okay?

2	MS. ADAMS:	Yes.3	(Audience participation.)4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.5	MS. ADAMS:	Mr. Chairman.6	(Audience participation.)7	MS. ADAMS:	Mr. Chairman, I think89	(Audience participation.)10	MS. ADAMS:	Mr. Chairman, I think11	this is your meeting and I'd like to proceed with12	two of my other colleagues.	And I'd like to say1314 MS. LEVINE:	Betty, you should use15 the microphone.16 MS. ADAMS:	that I do think17 that Adriene is right.	I think that Adriene is18 right when she says this mechanism is broken.	I19 think Steve is saying the same thing in another20 way.21 I agree with him when he says that22 we're talking about a public policy issue -23 one- size- fits-all is not working and we have all24 said that in various ways.	However, the problem25 of affordable housing for everyone, particularly
2	those people that we are most concerned about,3 those being:	Firemen, Teachers, Policemen,4 nurses, service workers and others - -5 (Audience participation.)6 MS. ADAMS:	- - is not something7 that this Board alone can resolve.	I think that8	the interest - although coming from different9 perspectives in doing something about the problem10 - is present, as I have spoken with all members11	on this Board.	That is what I have found.12 However, I think that the solution13 involves not only us, it involves state14 officials.	It involves federal officials.15 However, I think that we can start at the16 Citywide level.17 And I would ask you, Mr. Chairman,18 who' s also heard all of this from everyone,19 hopefully that you will make a statement at the20 end of this meeting that reflects the frustration21 that all of us feel with the way this process has22 operated23 (Audience participation.)24 MS. ADAMS:	and begins to call25 on others who play a big role in resolving  its12 
2	function.	We have asked those who have presented3 testimony.	Here I'm thinking specifically of4 City officials in terms of what are they doing,5 what' s in the plan to carry out their part of6 solving this problem.7 (Audience participation.)8 MS. ADAMS:	I also agree, both9 with Adriene and with Steve, that this10 administration has made some steps in the right11	direction.	It has not solved the problem, but we12 have not seen steps like these for some time.	I13 think that we need to convene others to resolve14 them and decide what can be done for this.15 I am not going to try to talk over16 this crowd.	Therefore, I stop at this point .17 (Audience participation. )18 MS . CRUZ:	Mr . Chair, may I - - can19 Ms. Adams repeat her last sentence, what she was20saying - -can Ms.Adams repeat her last sentence,21please?22MS.ADAMS:	I beg your pardon?2 3MS.LEVINE:	Repeat the last24sentence.25MS.CRUZ:	Can Ms. - - please.
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	The last sentence.3 We' ll, she's not going to speak over this .4 MS. ADAMS:	Okay .	The last part of5 what I said was that I hope that the Chairman6	would issue a statement which reveals the7 frustration that we have all felt and calls on8 the other players in the problem to meet both at9 the City, state and federal level, starting with10	the City.11	We can't deal with the state .	We12 can't deal with the Feds, but I think that if we13 called for this at the City level, that would be14 a big step forward.15 An example would be when we talk16 about untenable housing and the violations that17 all of us have seen in all of the boroughs.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 Do we have any other motions?20 (Audience participation .)21 (No response. )22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I would like to2 3	read a statement.24 (Audience participation. )25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The statement
2 will be made available to the press after I read3 it.4 As you are all aware, the Rent5 Guidelines Board is charged with setting annual6 renewal lease adjustments for roughly one million7 rent stabilized apartments, lofts and hotels in8 New York City.	These units are located in9 thousands of buildings throughout the five10 boroughs and vary in size, age and operating11	profiles.12 Not only is the population of13 buildings in the City diverse, so are the14 residents that reside in them .	In particular,15 tenant incomes vary widely not only from16 neighborhood to neighborhood, but often within17 the same building. These two very diverse18 components make the Board' s job, at best, a19 difficult one.20 The Board - in particular the public21 members - try to balance the escalating costs of22 running these buildings with the tenants' ability2 3	to pay their rents.	I, and I believe other24 members of this Board, have come to realize that25 as our colleague tenant representative, Adriene
2	Holder says, the one- size- fits-all approach has3	serious shortcomings.	Our traditional approach4 is a blunt instrument at a time when laser- like5 precision is likely required.6 I, and other public members are7 frustrated by the fact that we do not reach those8	who are in the most need of financial assistance9 - the poor tenant and the owners with rents that10 cannot sustain the building.11	Many will argue that the owners have12 been awarded substantial increases in rent due to13 changes in rent laws in the past 12 years. In14 particular, apartments that become vacant may15 have substantial increases and can even be16 subject to deregulation when the rent reaches 17	$2,000.18 Whether one argues in favor of these19 increases or not, it is hard to ignore the fact20 that only certain owners have benefited from21 these rent hikes.	Owners who benefit most are22 those who see high turnover rates in buildings2 3	and that are located in areas that command large24 rent increases.	Owners of buildings that have25 witnessed little or no vacancies over this time
2	have not seen the same increase in their rents.3	Owners with many long- term rent stabilized4 tenants, along with escalating operating and5 maintenance  costs, face the reality that  these6 rents are increasingly unable to meet the7	operating costs of these units .8 Our single guideline approach does9 not offer significant relief to these owners.	On10 the flip side, our increases impact all tenants11	who are renewing their lease regardless of their12 ability to pay.13 Whether it was the intent of the law14 or not, it is hard to ignore the fact that rent15 stabilization is an integral part of the16 affordable housing support system in New York17 City.18 Half of the stabilized units have19 rents of $844 or less.	In fact, it is likely20 that the rent stabilization system has become the21 biggest affordable housing tool in the City.22 (Audience participation. )2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I believe we24 need to put in place an income-based approach,25 which protects tenants who cannot afford an24 
2 increase and at the same time raises rents for3 owners who cannot maintain their buildings.4	There are many anomalies in today' s5 rent stabilization system. Ironically, the  most6 irrational public policy is contained in the  only7	portion of the rent stabilization system  that8 acknowledges that a tenant income-based approach9 is good public policy.10	I am referring to the "high11	rent/luxury decontrol provisions" which provides12 that when a household occupying a Rent Stabilized13 unit has an annual income that exceeds  $175,00014 for two consecutive years, and the apartment' s15 legal rent is $2,000 or more, the unit can be16 destabilized.17 Alternatively,  a tenant who pays18 less than $2,000, for example, $900 and earns19 $1,000,000 annually is not subject to loss of20 stabilization protection.	This makes no sense.21 With this concern in mind, I, and22 several public member colleagues - -23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	- - explored25 putting in place a guideline that would  increase12 
2	rents significantly beyond the base guidelines3	for low rent apartments only if the tenant could4	afford the rent increase.	Those tenants whose5 rent- to- income ratio was 30 percent or greater6 would not be subject to this increase .7 Due to what I believe are8 significant impediments in the Rent Stabilization9 Law, similar in nature to the impediments that10	proscribe the activities of the Rent Guidelines11	Board with respect - - with regard to the12 so-called "provisos" suggested by the Rent13 Guidelines Board' s tenant representatives, and14 the administrative burden it would place on the15 State Division of Housing and Community Renewal,16 I ultimately concluded not to pursue this policy.17 This is despite the fact that I18 believe that truly addresses the inequities  in19 the Rent Stabilization system and makes for  a20 rationally based underpinning.	The adoption of21 such an approach could have resulted in as many22 as 120,000 new complaints being filed with the23 DHCR, an agency that handles roughly 5,500  each24 year.25 Let me make this clear :	I do
1	732	believe that there is an affordable housing3	crisis in New York City. I applaud Mayor4 Bloomberg for his efforts in not only building5 affordable housing, but maintaining what we6 already have.	But I believe more needs to be7 done.8	The City Council and the State9 Senate and Assembly, some of whose members came10 to testify before this Board stating that there11	is a housing affordability crisis, along with the12 State and City Administrations, need to address13 the serious imbalances in the system and  fashion14 solutions that will be fair and equitable and15 appropriately place the burdens of affordability.16 The way the system works now, the17 individual owner must subsidize tenants by being18 forced to charge rents that may not cover19 operating costs.	This is the case, regardless of20 the tenant' s ability to pay rent.	I do not21 believe the burden belongs with the individual22 owner .	Society at large should shoulder the23 burden of affordability.24 (Audience participation. )25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	My suggestion
2	would be a system structured in a similar manner3 to the approach embodied in the existing Senior4 Citizens Rent Increase Exemption and the5 Disability Rent Increase Exemption programs is6 required .	This will target assistance where  it7 is needed - to both the poorest tenants and8 owners in New York City.9 We realize that the legal restraints10	that govern our activities results in the actions11	of the Rent Guidelines Board being described as12 "gross justice ."	In my opinion, the system at13 this point calls for a precision well beyond the14 powers envisioned by the lawmakers who created a15 very serviceable system for 1969, not for today.16 The Rent Guidelines Board struggles17 to make our decisions as relevant as possible to18 the areas we impact.	Unfortunately, the system19 inevitably results in two innocent bystanders20 being most negatively impacted - the  marginal21 owner and the poor tenant .22 We are cognizant that our decisions2 3	do have a significant impact on affordability so24 we must explore ways to maintain reasonable rents25 for poor tenants and at the same time switch the
2	undo burden of subsidizing rents from  the3	individual owner to the public purse.4	Whatever the relief, I call on5 public officials to make significant changes  so6 that next year at this time we can enact7 guidelines that truly impact the Rent8 Stabilization system in a way that allows it  to9 be a system that maintains both the housing  stock10	and tenant affordability.11	Some might scoff at the likelihood12 of achieving such a result.	Yet as recently as13 this month, the New York City Council, Mayor14 Bloomberg and representatives of the owner  and15 tenant communities reached agreement on  an16 approach known as the "Safe Housing Act"  to17 appropriately address rational code enforcement18 policy. This initiative and the common  approach19 are heartening to those of us who strive  for20 balance.21 Until this hoped for balance is22 achieved, the Rent Guidelines Board has a duty  to2 3	achieve these	to balance these tenant/owner24 needs within the constraints of the dictates  of25 the law and practical administration. We must  do24 
2sonow.3I'd like to offer a motion.4(Audience participation.)5CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The motion is:6I move to adopt the language and7 Loft Order No 39 as read into the record at this8 meeting;9 And I further move to adopt the10 Explanatory Statement and Findings for Order No.11 39 substantially in the form submitted by the12 staff to the Board on June 26, 2007 contained in13 your packet, and to be modified by the RGB staff14 after this meeting to reflect the adopted rental15 adjustments;16 And finally, I move to adopt the17 following rental adjustments for rent stabilized18 apartments and lofts:19 Together with such further - - excuse20 me.21 Adjustments for renewal leases and22 Apartments.23 Together with such further24 adjustments as may be authorized by law, the25 annual adjustment for renewal leases for the7

HOLDER:	May I?21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.22 MS. HOLDER:	I really do23 appreciate everything that this Board has done24 this year in terms of the debate.	We did not25 agree on the conclusion and I believe that the
2	increases that were passed today are too high.3	But I would actually like to think4 that we can continue this conservation about5 trying to change this one- size- fits-all process.6 And in that spirit in which we've come this  year,7 I would ask Chair that we plan a time to meet8 following the summer months so that perhaps we9	can meet in the early fall still in this year  to10	perhaps have some more meetings and talk  about11	maybe different types of reports we might want12 the staff to work on as well as other approaches13 this Board might be able to take to have a14 meaningful response about this process and  also15 about the housing stock and all the different16 constituencies that we serve.17 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Chair, I would18 support that proposal as well.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Unanimity.20 Okay, we' ll do it.21 Any motion to adjourn?22 MS. ADAMS:	So moved.23 MS. LEVINE:	Subject to Ms.24 Holder' s and Ms. Cruz' amendment.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank12 
2	you.	We' re adjourned.3	(At 7:36 p.m. , the proceedings were4	concluded. )5678910111213141516171819202122232425
