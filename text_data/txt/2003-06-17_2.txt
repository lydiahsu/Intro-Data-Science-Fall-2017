2	(Audience participation.)3	BROOKLYN BORO PRES. MARKOWITZ:4 This is simply too much personal	income being5 spent towards rent. We need to lower rents,  not6 raise rents.7 (Audience participation.)8 BROOKLYN BORO PRES.  MARKOWITZ:9 At least one third of New York City' s  families10 live below - -11	That 's okay, Chairman. It's12 okay.13 - - live below the  Federal14 poverty level. This is just not acceptable   for15 people living in the richest city in the  world.16 Last year there were more  than17 six thousand evictions in Brooklyn alone. We18 cannot and should not allow this to  continue.19 It 's irresponsible government to20 allow the City' s supply of housing to deteriorate21 and decrease when the need for affordable,   safe22 and decent housing is so great. This must   stop23 and we must stop it now.24 These excessive and  unwarranted25 increases threat en affordability and affects12 
2 every rent stabilized and rent controlled  tenant3 in the City, including almost 285, 000 tenants in4 Brooklyn . These proposed increases must be5 revoked and they must be revoked now .6	Thousands of tenants are  being7 forced out of their homes that they have lived   in8 for generation after generation. This must  stop9 and stop now.10 Landlords are trying to  weaken11 rent laws which threaten to end protection for12 all tenants and raise rents to $2 ,000 where  you13 and I know apartments will no longer  be14 regulated. Now, Chairman, you should know  that15 also means that the right of automatic  lease16 renewal is removed as a right of the  tenant17 thereby giving owners complete control of  all18 housing units in this City at $2000 or more   rent.19 Since 1994, more than  100,00020 apartments in New York City have been  deregulated21 due to high- rent and high- income vacancy22 decontrol. Tenants are being forced out  because23 of deregulated rents because they can't  afford24 those apartments anymore .25 And so basically what  I'm7 
2 asking, what we are asking is that we have  a3 stake here in preserving middle- income , quality4 housing. This increase proposed really sets  a5 pace far beyond the cost factors that rent -6 regulated apartments have faced. And it 's your7 responsibility, each and everyone of you,  to8 preserve housing for long- standing residents of9 this City who need this kind of housing in   order10 to live.11 Chairman, I do not want to see  a12 City where we have the very wealthy and  those13 that are very poor.14 (Audience participation.)15 BROOKLYN BORO PRES.  MARKOWITZ:16 There must	there must be a balance,  public17 balance.18 Now let me just finish by  saying19 the following.20 New York City has no competition21 when it comes housing. There is no  competition.22 You can't set market rents or these enormous   rent23 increases when there is no competition  because24 there are no available apartments in the City  of25 New York.2 
2 And so, therefore, we must3 preserve our long- standing residents and , in4 fact , preserve  the neighborhoods  and those mult i-5 family buildings. I want you to do the  right6 thing and I expect the Mayor of New York  City7 will ask you to do the right thing for  the8 tenants of New York.9 (Audience part icipation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Borough11 President , there is a question. Mr. Borough12 President .13 MR. ZELNIK:	Borough President14 Markowitz,	I think a number of us are, in fact ,15 listening not only to you, but to State  Senator16 Kruger and to Betsy Gotbaum and so  on.17 And obviously there are18 tremendous issues that the City is facing  today.19 One thing that I am not  hearing20 addressed , not only at today' s meeting but over21 the years, is why the people who are  in22 responsibility are not building more  affordable23 housing, which is part of the  problem.24 I'm just wondering what is25 happening  in Brooklyn and the other boroughs and2 
2 from the City Council to get more  affordable3 housing units.4 BROOKLYN BORO PRES.  MARKOWITZ:5 Well, you are  - -  I could not agree with you  more6 in terms of the fact that there used to be  a7 State program. When I was elected as a  Senator,8 it was already history. And that was called  the9 Mitchell - Lama program.10 And the Mitchell - Lama program11 was the most innovative national housing  program12 in America. Regrettably over the  last13 twenty/twenty- five years the State of New York14 has put affordable housing way in the back  of15 priorities rather than to the front.16 And this we all share, we  share17 as elected officials, we share in the  private18 sector. You're right. The real answer to  the19 housing crisis is more affordabl e housing.20 If we can - - in fact , my mother21 told me that right after World War II there was   a22 time when building owners would offer  a23 thirt eenth month free or a chandelier and wall -24 to-wall carpeting to encourage tenants to  move25 into their buildings.2 
2 I'd like to see those days3 again. But until those days happen again,  the4 priority of government , both on the state and the5 federal level especially, should be  the6 construction of affordable new housing for  all7 levels, those of the low and moderate  income,8 those of the middle income. We desperately  need9 that.10 As Borough President of11 Brooklyn, let me tell you what I see.  The12 majority of developers that come to see me   only13 want to build market rent  houses.14 Now let me tell you  something.15 Market rent housing in this City is well  beyond16 the great majority of people to be able  to17 afford .18 So I'm hopeful that as a  public19 member you can use your influence on the Board.20 I'm assuming you were appointed by the Mayor   and21 the Mayor has done a good step in terms  of22 putt ing money, good money, by the way, into23 construction of housing.24 But we need to do more. And  I'm25 hopeful  since he encouraged the Republican party2 
2 to hold their party here next year for  their3 presidential  convention, perhaps they might make4 housing, affordable housing, one of the  major5 planks in the Republican Party  platform.6 I'm not going to hold my  breath.7 But hope springs eternal. Let 's see if we can do8 that.9 Thank you very, very much.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,11 Mr. Borough President.12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	A couple of14 announcements.15 First of all, if you called  in16 and want to be a speaker, you must register   again17 - -  not  register, but  indicate upstairs that18 you're here. Again, anybody who called in  and19 wants to be a speaker, you have to  indicate20 upstairs that you're here.21 Let me call the next order  of22 people.23 Mr. Margolies  and Ed Korman  - -24 Dan Margolies, Ed Korman, Gloria Freedman,  and25 then Tom Waters.2 
2 Okay. And please, you know,  be3 prepared as soon as the previous speaker is   done4 to step briskly to the microphone. We are  trying5 to get everybody in.6 Mr. Margolies.7	MR. DAN MARGOLIES:	Good8 afternoon.9 I have to hand it to the10 politicians,  particularly  the City Council11 Members who supported a budget that they  couldn't12 afford , then put their hands in owners' pockets13 to pay for it , then came here to tell you not  to14 pass it on to the voters because they don' t want15 to get caught doing that. And I guess that 's the16 def inition of a New York City politician,17 chutzpa.18 Many of you are new  Board19 members. I think this is a record for new  Board20 members or relatively new members. Yet in  the21 short time that you've had to look at  the22 condition of housing  - -23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	They' re24 battle- worn at this point. So don' t worry about2 5	it .
2 MR. DAN MARGOLIES:	In the3 short time that you've had to look at  the4 condition of housing, you've quickly arrived at   a5 solution that so many previous Boards have  found.6 You've proposed  cutting the baby in half.7	Unfortunately,	the moral of the8 biblical story is that half a baby is not a  good9 thing. Neither is half housing. Housing must  be10 kept whole. There were extraordinary  cost11 increases in taxes, fuel and insurance during  the12 past year and a resurgence of inflation in   almost13 all cost areas affecting housing, from  plumbing14 to labor.15 Increases of 5.5 percent  for16 one- year leases don' t cover owner' s increases17 even for the tenants who have leases expiring  and18 choose a one-year lease. Increases of 8.5  percent19 for those who choose a two- year lease won' t cover20 last year's increases nor will they cover  your21 staff' s projection for next year's increases.22 And about a third of  tenants23 won' t have leases expiring under Guideline 35.24 They get pretty much a free  ride.25 I don' t know if you appreciate8 
2 how much the Board has shortchanged  owners3 historically. Just look at the  one-year4 guidelines since 1990. $100 in rent in  1989,5 compounded by the guidelines through 2002  would6 be about $147 today . Increasing those rents7 annually by the Price Index, instead,  however,8 even though we've had zero and negative  increases9 during some of those years, would be $165 , about10 thirty- eight percent more than the Board actually11 permitted.12 And even more striking  would13 have been the difference if you had  approved14 annual increases consistent with the Core  Price15 Index. $100 would have risen to $173 , fifty- five16 percent more than the Board actually allowed , but17 the right number to keep up with basic  operating18 costs.19 The effect of two-year20 guidelines,  of  course ,  is even more pernicious .21 It 's time for you new members to22 take a fresh look at what 's becoming an ancient23 problem. It is time for annual increases  that24 reflect real cost increases . It is time to25 eliminate the favorable treatment  for two-year2 
2 leases.3 There may be some  justification4 for giving a tenant a deal for a long - term5 commitment  in a free market , but  it adds  insult6 to injury under rent regulation .7 Tenants will argue that  they're8 suffering an economic recession. So are  owners .9 The difference is that we've been suffering  real10 cost inflat ion for more than a year already . It11 is time to share that burden .12 Thank you.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No questions.15 Thank you .16 All right . Go ahead . Mr . Lubell .17 MR . LUBELL:	Mr. Margolies,18 approximately how many owners are there in  New19 York City?20 MR. DAN MARGOLIES:	Well , there21 are approximately  25,000 owners of rent22 stabilized housing.2 3	MR. LUBELL:	Do you think it is24 rational for the 25,000 owners, some of whom  are25 wealthy, some of whom are not wealthy, some  of24 
2 whom are indeed poor , to subsidize those many3 thousands that are unemployed or  poor?4	MR . DAN MARGOLIES:	I think5 it 's clear that we have a social responsibility6 as a society to support people who cannot  afford7 shelter. It is not the responsibility of  any8 individual owner to do that . It 's the9 responsibility of the  society.10 (Audience part icipation .)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 MR. DAN MARGOLIES:	That 's13 something we would hope to see reflected in  the14 rents here, reasonable rents that provide  for15 reasonably  well - maintained housing.16 And  contrary  to Mr. Markowitz '17 testimony about the deplorable condition  of18 housing in Brooklyn, clearly all the census  data19 shows that housing is the best it 's ever been in20 New York .21 But , you know, we want to22 provide good housing, and whatever it costs to   do23 that is the right amount of subsidy that  should24 be provided by government to the tenants who  need25 it .5 
1	1632 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,3 Mr. Margolies.4 MR. LUBELL:	One more question.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.6	MR. LUBELL:	You spoke of the7 unfairness, and Mr. Hoffman also spoke of  the8 unfairness of the second -year guideline. What  do9 you propose under the circumstances that  the10 second year guideline should be to avoid  that11 problem and that unfairness?12 MR. DAN MARGOLIES:	Well , I13 think, as Mr. Hoffman indicated , right now and14 historically there has always been an  incentive15 to choose the two-year guideline. It was a  deal16 relatively, and people who have chosen it  have17 consistently done remarkably well over  time.18 The idea would be to remove  the19 incentive by making it double the one -year20 guideline. And  I think the one-year guideline21 should be reflective of the Core Price  Index.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.23 Adriene.24 MS. HOLDER:	How long have you25 been head of CHIP?7 
2 MR. DAN MARGOLIES:	Seventeen3 years.4 MS. HOLDER:	And during that5 time has your membership increased or decreased?6 MR. DAN MARGOLIES:	It 's7	roughly the same.8	MS. HOLDER:	It's roughly the9	same.10	Do you find that there are more11	people who are going in to being owners of rent12 regulat ed housing?13 MR. DAN MARGOLIES:	Maybe I14 should rephrase15 MS. HOLDER:	Sure.16 MR. DAN MARGOLIES:	- - my17 answer to your first question.18 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.19 MR. DAN MARGOLIES:	Because not20 everyone who buys housing joins an  organization.21 I think what we have found  is22 the typical member of CHIP is a professional   who23 owns somewhere between five and twenty  buildings,24 who owns and manages their  own property.	It 's a25 subset of owners who are professionals who  do12 
2 this for their principal	living.3 I mean obviously we have very4 large and very small owners as well , but that 's5 really the typical member.6 The largest number of new  owners7 in the owner community tend to be smaller  than8 that . They tend to be the immigrants who buy a9 building or two, often live in it , expect to be10 able to pay their mortgage from the rents in  the11 smaller buildings also  typically.12 Sometimes  they get  larger . They13 buy neighboring buildings. It 's a traditional14 immigrant path.15 But those people don't have  the16 t ime, because they usually have other jobs and17 they are maintaining their building at night  and18 on weekends, they don't have the time to  network19 and join professional organizations.  So we don' t20 tend to see them at that level in  our21 organizat ion.22 But , yes, I do run into them  in23 Housing Court and elsewhere. And, you know,  we24 see the nationalities changing dramat ically by25 neighborhood around the City. And there  are2 
2 always new faces.3 But there' s also a lot of4 falloff in that small ownership category  because5 it ' s a very tough business.6 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.7 But your core membership,  are8 they staying in the business or do you  see,9 because of what the Rent Guidelines Board  has10 been doing, that they are actually going out  of11 business?12 MR. DAN MARGOLIES:	Well , I13 think- -14 MS . HOLDER:	Your membership .15 MR. DAN MARGOLIES :	My core16 membership has probably gotten larger,  they've17 obtained more units over time because  smaller18 people fall out of the business and because it 's19 closed shop. You have to really understand  this20 very complex system. That 's one of the reasons21 it 's so bad for housing.22 And , again, it 's contrary to my23 members'  interest. In a way being the specialists24 in a really arcane field is good for them,  but25 it's bad for the business generally  because8 
2 people from out - of - town don' t tend to come in and3 buy New York  City property.  People from - -  you4 know, who invest and own apartments around  the5 country, in the region, don' t come to New York6 generally because it' s too weird and they don' t7 know how to operate here.8 They don' t build here for the9 same reasons because we've had a unique  building10 code and because so much of the new  construction,11 at least temporarily, is subject to  regulat ions.12 All of these oddities  discourage13 outside investors. So in a perverse way  they' re14 not so bad for the people who survive in it ,  for15 the families and businesses that have been  doing16 it for fifty years because they' re the only  ones17 who know how to survive in  it.18 MS. HOLDER:	And just a19 clarif ication. When you say that new construction20 is subject to regulation, you are talking  about21 when folks want to take advantage of  tax22 credits - -23 MR. DAN MARGOLIES:	Yes, which24 I believe  the majority  of new construction  - -25 MS: HOLDER:  - -  or abatements.2 
2 Okay.3 MR. DAN MARGOLIES:	- - does4 take advantage of  incentives.5	MS. HOLDER:	All right. But it's6 not that it 's mandatory that if you are a7 developer coming into the City, that you  are8 going to be subject  - - in fact , that 's not the9 case at all.10 MR. DAN MARGOLIES:	No. But11 most people looking at it either from in- town  or12 out - of - town and looking at the cost structure13 would look to take advantage of the tax  benef its.14 That 's due to the basic cost of the land and the15 construction costs. You take advantage of  every16 incentive you can.17 But once you factor those  things18 in and then see that you are going to have  to19 learn the system of regulation for a period  of20 time, you pass. And  so most people  from out - of -21 town pass.22 MS. HOLDER:	All right. Thank23 you.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 (Audience participation.)6 
1	1692 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Korman,3 followed by Gloria Freedman, Tom Waters. Aft er4 Mr. Waters will be Helen Daniels. After  that5 Myrna Beth Hurwitz.6 Okay. Mr. Korman.7 MR. ED KORMAN:	Good afternoon,8 Chairman and Members of the  Board.9 I'm the Executive Vice  President10 of the Small Property Owners of New York. And  we11 mainly work with owners that have  smaller12 buildings, up to about ten or twelve units  per13 building.14 The small owners house the  most15 diverse populus in the housing industry,  the16 undocument ed, the low earners, people on17 different governmental programs, where most  of18 the rent , if not all , is paid by  others.19 All we hear today is about  how20 much the landlord is getting. Nobody talks   about21 the City paying SCRIE for the seniors, or  if22 you're a welfare recipient , when the oil was  high23 this year, the tenants got a check to   subsidize24 the high cost of fuel which was not passed on  to25 the property owner.8 
2 At present there is double  and3 tripling up of apartments causing more wear  and4 tear on the property, more wat er consumption,5	more cost of fuel to heat the water for these6 people to bathe. And nobody ever talks about   why7 the housing is not  affordable.8 Did any of you people ever  come9 in to see the destruction that these  tenants10 cause?  If you want  to know - -  they call the11	landlords the slumlords. I'm not saying that12 every landlord is a perfect Al. But there are   as13 many tenants that destroy the properties in   order14 not to pay rent that they claim landlords don' t15 fix.16 (Audience participation.)17 MR. ED KORMAN:	The Price Index18 is based on an average property which means19 citywide. All we hear about is the  bigger20 buildings.21 This Rent Guidelines Board  must22 divide its Price Index based on the  bigger23 propert ies that have a hundred/two hundred24 apartments in a property versus a six- family25 house.12 
2 The tenants that bring  their3 cultures to New York, they include  throwing4 garbage out the windows which causes us  fines.5 (Audience participat ion. )6 A PARTICIPANT:	Racism.7 MR. ED KORMAN:	Racism? You' re8	the people that are causing the  racism.  9	They have no concept ion about - 1011 (Audience participation.)12 MR. ED KORMAN:	They have no13 conception about14 (Audience participat ion. )15 MR. ED KORMAN:	When repairs16 have to be made, especially when it comes  to17 water, it 's a little drip, and then all of a18 sudden it bursts and they don' t care. They don' t19 know about any kind of  repairs.20 That 's all I have to say.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank22 you.23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Gloria25 Freedman .11 
2Thank you. Gloria.3MS. GLORIA FREEDMAN:	Hello!4It 's good to be here today. I'm5sorrythat it 's such a horrible cause that we6have,struggling so hard to keep the tenants  from7beingdestroyed.8I've lived in New York  almost9 eighty- eight years. I've never seen anything like10 this. It's been horrible for tenants in the  City11 of New York.12 I'm a leader of the Retirees13 Association of District Council  #37.14 (Audience participation.)15 MS. GLORIA FREEDMAN:	My16 members have suffered mortally  from these17 increases. They're on fixed income and they  keep18 raising their rent. When they try to get  on19 SCRIE, they are told that they are a dollar  too20 high.21 (Audience participation.)22 MS. GLORIA FREEDMAN:	They are23 told that.24 Also when the tenant asked  to25 get some heat , did they suffer this wint er. Our9 
2 tenants have died. They have gotten  pneumonia.3 They've been sick due to the lack of  heat.4	The landlord says I'm sorry,  I'm5 running out of money. The boiler is broken.  I6 have no money to fix it.7	Major  Capital  Improvement , we8	need your money.9	So what is the tenant doing?  The10 tenant is paying. And don't forget that  this11 Board was created by a landlord and his name  was12 Urstad. He took home rule away from the City  of13 New York and gave it to the State. And that  has14 been a curse on the City of New  York.15 I'm sorry to tell you16 (Audience participation.)17 MS. GLORIA FREEDMAN:	that18 you're doing that.19 (Audience participation.)20 MS. GLORIA FREEDMAN:	The21 people in my union, there are 25,000  retirees.22 They approach me. They tell me how  they're23 suffering.24 We work together to try  to25 improve the conditions. We cannot help them  and10 
2 give them more money to pay that rent. And  they3 told us Major Capital Improvement , I was slapped4 with a bill , and yet the landlord didn' t fix the5 roof . It's still leaking. My bathroom, the water6 is coming down. I'm suffering. Please help  me.7 And I'm still paying the  rent.8 So don' t - - I feel that people9 of good will right now who are sitting on  that10 platform, if you are people of good will , and  if11 you've studied the records, you' ll know that  the12 City of New York is being destabilized, they   are13 destroying our entire  City.14 People like us don' t count. We15 built the City. We actually gave all of our  money16 from the very beginning  into Social Security17 which they' re trying to steal away.18 And then at the same time  you19 are told in a cool , abstract way to make a20 decision that is going to affect people for  the21 coming years because rents should have  been22 rolled back. They should have been rolled  back.23 (Audience participation. )24 MS. GLORIA FREEDMAN:	They2 5	should have been rolled back.
2	(Audience participation.)3	MS. GLORIA FREEDMAN:	Roll4	back, roll back5 (Audience participat ion. )6 MS. GLORIA FREEDMAN:	roll7	back.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9	Thank you.10 MS. GLORIA FREEDMAN:	Wait.11 The increases in the last  few12 years have really been  unconscionable.13 And I urge our tenant14 representatives, you could ask me any  question15 related to the suffering and more suffering  of16 the retirees who built this City and are  being17 treated like dirt.18 (Audience participation.)19 MS. GLORIA FREEDMAN:20 Disgraceful. Absolutely  disgraceful the way we21 are being treated.22 (Audience participation.)23 MS. GLORIA FREEDMAN:	And24 freezing in the apartments and getting  pneumonia25 and dying in the City  hospitals.10 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You have to3 wrap up.4	MS. GLORIA FREEDMAN:	I'm5	wrapped up.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. You're7 wrapped up.8 (Audience participation.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any10 questions?11 (No response. )12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Gloria, we' ll13 see you next year.14 MS. GLORIA FREEDMAN:	Well,15 thank you. I hope I make it . I'll be eighty- eight16 next mont h.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We hope so.18 (Audience participat ion.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Wat ers.20 MR. TOM WATERS:	Hi! I'm Tom21 Waters and I'm an organizer with the New   York22 State Tenants & Neighbors Coalition.23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. TOM WATERS:	I'm Tom Waters25 and I 'm an organizer with the New York State10 
2 Tenants & Neighbors Coalition.3 The proposed rent guidelines  of4 5.5 percent	for one-year leases and 8.5 for  two-5 year leases are unfair. If these become the  final6 guidelines, they will contribute to the  ongoing7 decline in the standard of living for poor  and8 working people in New York  City.9 Mayor Bloomberg' s policies are10 directly contributing  to this decline,  including11 regressive tax increases, diminished  City12 services, increased fees and fares and  perhaps13 even excessive fines.14 Since 1970, landlords have  seen15 their net operating incomes rise from 38  percent16 to 44 percent of income.17 During the same period  tenants18 have seen our rents rise from 20 percent to   28.619 percent of household  income. Operating these20 buildings cost landlords less and less of   their21 income. Living in the same buildings costs  us22more andmore of our income. And a primary  reason23for thisis that this Board gives  landlords24unfairlyhigh rent increases year after year.25This year landlords and  Mayor
2 Bloomberg just ify huge rent increases because of3 Bloomberg' s property  tax increase. The proposed4 increases are set high enough so that  landlords5 will not have to pay any of the increased  tax.6 They will make the entire burden of the  property7 tax increase fall on tenants. With  these8 increases, there is no property tax increase   for9 landlords, only for us.10 We as a city and state are  faced11 with a weak economy and the government  revenue12 problem that is the predictable result of a  weak13 economy. That is why taxes were  raised.14 But according to the proposed15 rent guidelines, the responsibility to deal  with16 the weak economy should fall exclusively  on17 tenants. The landlords should not be allowed  to18 experience any weak economy at all. All of  the19 burden should fall on  us.20 We, with our median income  of21 $32,000 a year, should sacrif ice to hold the22 landlords harmless. This is absurd. It is  as23 absurd as giving a pregnant woman a ticket   for24 sitting on a staircase.25 (Laughter.)2 
1	1792 MR. TOM WATERS:	The proposed3 four percent  increase for hotel and SRO tenants4 is also unjust. It will result in  enormous5 hardships for some of the poorest people in  the6 City, even the loss of their  homes.7 If this Rent Guidelines Board8 goes ahead with its proposed guidelines,   tenants9 will hold Mayor Bloomberg responsible for   this10 injustice.11 Thank you.12 (Audience participat ion.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 Adriene.15 MS. HOLDER:	Tom, thanks for16 being here. I know that one is really busy  in17 Albany right now. I appreciat e your coming  down.18 Tom, could you tell me what  your19 position or the organization' s position also  is20 in regard to some of the other guidelines that  we21 will be setting?22 You mentioned hotels. But23 looking at apartments, I mean could you give  us24 figures that you might be proposing and then   talk25 to us about the special  guideline?2 
1	1802 MR. TOM WATERS:	We are for3 holding the rents at zero  percent.4 (Audience participation.)5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is that your6	compromise position?7	MR. TOM WATERS:	That' s the8	organization' s.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That' s your10	compromise  from negative.11	MR. TOM WATERS:	That 's right.12 That the increase that the13 landlords received last year is enough  to14 accommodat e for the increase in costs that15 they' ll see this year.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.17 MS. HOLDER:	What about the18 special guideline, Tom?19 MR. TOM WATERS:	I have a20 handout on the special guideline which I'm   going21 to give to the Board.22 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.23 MR.

2	(No response.)3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,4	sir.5	Helen Daniels, followed by Myrna6 Beth Hurwitz, followed by Chris  Athineos,7 followed by Paula Chabrowe. Hopefully I got  that8 name right.9 Again, Helen Daniels, then Myrna10 Beth Hurwitz.11 Go ahead.12 MS. HELEN DANIELS:	Thank you.13 Good afternoon, Rent  Guidelines14 Board.15 I'm Helen Daniels, President  of16 the Black and Latino Property Owners Coalition,   a17 coalition that represents the interests  of18 minority owners who own property  in all the19 boroughs of New York City except for  Staten20 Island. I must fit that in.21 Our members own property  that22 represents the spectrum of property  in New York23 City. They own two- families, three- families, even24 buildings up to twelve and fifteen- family  units.25 And our members are  owner-6 
2 occupied. Most of our members live in a  building3 or one of the buildings which they own . That4 means they have a vested interest in how  that5 property is managed and what happens to  their6 neighbors who are the people who are renting  from7 them .8 I'll not bore you with9 statistics this afternoon because you have them10 all as relates to why the numbers should be  where11 they are.12 But I will talk about how we  as13 minorities became property owners . Historically,14 minorities were taught you always own where you15 live. That is not only southern but that is   also16 a belief of people from the islands .17 So many of the members have18 bought  small properties  initially: a two- family19 home, a three- family home, and then they  leverage20 that to buy a larger piece of property or   even21 several more pieces of property. This is  what' s22 called the American Dream.23 I point this out because in  New24 York City rather than this being a dream, it   is25 more like a nightmare. And it truly  is2 
2 unfortunat ely.3 People who own property need  to4 be proud of what they own. Those who do not   own5 it need to be proud of those who have  persevered6 and have purchased property because we  are7 providing housing for the many people here in   New8 York City who have chosen to be renters  rather9 than owners.10 A PARTICIPANT:	Chosen?11 MS. HELEN DANIELS:	That 's12 right . Have chosen.13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. HELEN DANIELS:	When one15 purchases property,  it is understood  that certain16 responsibilities  accompany  that ownership. Taxes17 must be paid , utilities must be paid, regular18 maintenance  and upkeep must be taken care of.  You19 must have heat , you must have lights and20 insurance must be paid.21 But in order to make  these22 bills, one must have the financial resources   to23 do so.24 If the property is a rental25 piece of property, then it is appropriat e for  the2 
2 resources to come from the tenants. This  is3 simple, not brain science.4	As we know, taxes have  truly5 increased as well as the insurance costs  have6 increased in the City of New  York.7	The other option, if we do not8 own the property, then it means that New  York9 City becomes your landlord or your  property10 owner. We know what it 's like for New York City11 to manage and own rental and resident ial12 property. They were and still are the  worst13 landlord around.14 (Audience participation.)15 MS. HELEN DANIELS:	Housing, at16 least rental housing, is a business and it 's a17 business that should be respected and treated  as18 such. Do not nickel and dime the property  owners.19 They' re the ones who provide the housing.20 (Audience participation.21 MS. HELEN DANIELS:	Small22owners23CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Quiet.24Could you wrap up,please.25MS. HELEN DANIELS:Yes, I am
2	trying to.3	Small owners need to receive4 realistic rents in order that they may  continue5 to provide quality housing. Let us work  in6 partnership with you, not be caught up  in7 political battles of housing  issues.8	Owners need renters, renters9	need owners.10 Thank you.11 (Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Mr.13 Lubell.14 MR. LUBELL:	How many members15 are there in your association?16 MS. HELEN DANIELS:	Well,17 currently right now my membership  rolls we18 probably  have  about  fifty. But , however,19 recognizing there are far more minority  owners20 than what' s in our organization.21 As one of the speakers  said22 earlier, what happens with small owners  is23 because they're so busy, oftentimes working a   job24 and managing their property,  it's diff icult for25 them to become members  and participate	in10 
2 organizations.3 MR. LUBELL:	So that there is a4 large number of minority owners in addition  to5 those who belong to your associat ion.6 MS. HELEN DANIELS:	Yes. In7 fact , our members know that. We talk with them8 regularly. When there are issues, they will   call9 us and , you know, ask for assistance on what ever10 their need might be.11 And we are finding that more  and12 more minorities  are buying property in New  York.13 But , however, on the flip side, those who owned14 for an extended period of t ime, many are saying15 they' re getting tired now because they came  into16 this as a business with the intent to  provide17 quality housing.18 And in this environment  in New19 York City, as it has been over the years, this is20 a very difficult process. But there are those   who21 are still committed to doing that and they  want22to do it. Butthey can only do itwith the23assistance ofthe City, the Stateand their24renters .25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Thank you.
2	Oh! Excuse me. Adriene.3	MS. HOLDER:	Of those fifty4 members, how many actually own rent - regulat ed5 units?6	MS. HELEN DANIELS:	I don' t7 have statist ics for you today, but if you would8 like, I can get it to you.9	But they are	all the property10 is rent regulat ed. Whether it's rent controlled11 or stabilized I don' t have that with me today.12 MS. HOLDER:	All the properties13 are regulated?14 MS. HELEN DANIELS:	Yes.15 MS. HOLDER:	Is that because16 they have six or more units or because they   take17 advantage of tax abatement programs or  renovation18 programs?19 MS. HELEN DANIELS:	The members20 in the organization who I'm familiar with, and   I21 think I know them all , I don' t know any who have22 taken advantage of any of the tax advantages   in23 order to have their properties  deregulated.24 MS.

HELEN DANIELS:	As I10 said ,11 MS. HOLDER:	all of our12 units are about to be, you know, the  regulation13 protections are running out .14 I mean I've known you for a  long15 time . I know - -16 MS . HELEN DANIELS:	Also17 members who I am familiar with from the top of  my18 head today,19 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.20 MS . HELEN DANIELS:	I21 cannot think of any at the moment .22 MS. HOLDER:	That is23 interesting .24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank25 you.10 
1	1892	Myrna Beth Hurwitz, please.3	MS. MYRNA BETH HURWITZ:	Thank4 you.5 I am Myrna Beth Hurwitz, a  rent6 stabilized tenant in a condominium- converted7 building  in Greenwich Village.  I'm seventy years8 old, retired , on a fixed income, paying $1112 a9 month rent , half of my taxable income of  $26,600.10 I've lived in my apartment11 thirty- four years and I thank the Board Members12 who defeated the proposed  longevity charge on  May13 5th.14 I also urge the Board to reject15 the unjustified	increases adopted that day.  My16 Social Security did not go up the same percent   as17 my last rent increase and it surely won' t keep  up18 with the proposed 5.5 and 8.5 percent .19 I live in fear of the time  when20 the rent may exceed my capacity to pay  it.21 Mr.  Lubell , I wish you were22 still here. Mr. Lubell said something on May   5th.23 He said people who pay a hundred percent of   their24 income on rent and the homeless, quote, are  the25 responsibility of all of us. I agree.  Everyone' s4 
2 responsibility.3 With some of the money I  have4 left over from paying the rent , I embrace the5 obligation to support New York' s service and6 cultural programs, hunger, homeless and  health7 services, assistance to disadvantaged  elderly and8 children, AIDS programs, the New York  Public9 Library.10 Last year my philanthropic11 contributions  totalled  $2300 , not  much in12 absolute terms, but significant according to  my13 means.14 Those proposed rent  increases15 would soak most of that  up.16 I'm not unique. I've asked  many17 tenants in similar economic circumstances.  And18 most contribute to multiple causes  benefitting19 New Yorkers, just civic - minded people trying to20 do the right thing and still keep our  cherished21 homes.22 The private sector has been23 called upon to help make up for shrinking  public24 funds for human services. Not only would  the25 proposed rent increases price many of us out  of2 
1	1912 our present homes and swell the ranks of  the3 homeless, but they would take a sizable cut  out4 of critically needed philanthropic	funds.5 And if you think I'm  appealing6 to this Board' s conscience , you're absolutely7	right.8 I make a special plea to the  new9 members of the Board . Reject these unreasonable10 increases and seize the opportunity to  help11 preserve New York City' s diversity and viability.12 Thank you.13 (Audience participation. )14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have a15 question.16 Mr. Hurwitz, we have a  question17 from Mr . Schleider .18 MS. MYRNA BETH HURWITZ:	Mr.19 Schleider, yes, sir.20 MS. SCHLEIDER:	Hi! Thank you21 for speaking this afternoon .22 You craft a beautiful	letter I23 must tell you. Thank  you.24 I happen to agree with your25 points on increasing the SCRIE threshold. To  what8 
2 level would you say the threshold should  be3 increased to?4	MS . MYRNA BETH HURWITZ:	Well ,  5 a figure that a number of my colleagues in  the6 tenant movement have spoken of has ranged  between7 $30,000 and $35,000 because when you think  about8 what it takes to live in this town, as you  know,9 Mr. Schleider, the eligibility requirements   for10 SCRIE are so, so limited.11 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Yes, I know.12 MS . MYRNA BETH HURWITZ :	And13 then, as you know as well , then people who even14 are aware that they are eligible for it. And  that15 takes some doing too just to know you're  eligible16 for it .17 Then they run up against  all18 kinds of hindrances.19 But I would say $30,000  to20 $35,000 would be a more realistic threshold  for21 eligibility .22 MS . SCHLEIDER:	And I would23 suggest that tenant advocates petition  the24 legislators in power to achieve that sort of 25	increase.5 
1	1932 MS. HOLDER:	As a tenant3 advocate - -4 (Audience participat ion.)5	MS. HOLDER:	As a tenant6	advocate I have to respond. As a tenant  advocate7	and housing attorney, we have done that as  well8 as gotten passed by the Assembly an extension  of9 SCRIE for people with disabilities.10 I would love for help from11 anyone, including anyone on this Panel if  they12 have the capacity, to try to get the Senate  to13 help us to get companion legislation so that  we14 can do that.15 (Audience participation. )16 MS. HOLDER:	We work really17 hard, we really do, Steve. We are  trying.18 MS. MYRNA BETH HURWITZ:	Mr.19 Lubell , you missed  my  quoting you.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 Mr. Athineos, followed by  Paula22 Chabrowe.2 3	MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:	My24 name is Christopher Athineos and I am a  small25 owner from Brooklyn. My family and I live  and24 
2 operate the properties which we  own.3 And I'm here today to urge  you4 to vote for guideline increases that keep  with5 your mission and purpose as Members of the  Rent6 Guidelines Board, which is to preserve  and7 maintain rental housing for renters in New  York.8	As we all know, expenses for9 properties  in New York City have skyrocketed  this10 past year. Specif ically, my insurance has gone  up11 over two hundred percent  in the last two years.12 We cannot even keep pace with this magnitude   of13 an increase. And our property taxes have gone   up14 over twenty percent this past  year.15 And it is unthinkable to  propose16 such low increases as 5.5 and 8.5  percent.17 The Mayor has said over and over18 again when he had to increase our property   taxes19 that we must all share the pain so that the  City20 does not go backwards. Everyone in this  City21 wants to keep crime down and sanitation  pickups22 the same.23 This goes for apartments  too.24 I'm sure that tenants would not want  their25 services to go down or maintenance put off.9 
2 If that is the case, the Board3 must pass increases that are consistent with   its4 mission to preserve and maintain housing in  New5 York .6 I think the Board should7 specif ically consider a longevity increase8 because those stabilized tenants who have been   in9 occupancy for long periods of time have  the10 lowest rents in the building.	In my building11 these tenants have lower rents than even the  rent12 controlled apartments.13 And also let me make clear  that14 low rents do not correlate with low income.  I15 have plenty of tenants with rents under $700  a16 month with summer homes, weekend homes,  boats,17 they drive Mercedes and  Jaguars.18 (Audience participation.)19 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:	It 's20 not fair to property owners and it is even  more21 unfair to the other tenants in the building  if22their neighborsare paying a fraction of what23they are payingjust because they are  in24occupancy for alonger period of time.25These apartments still  require
  2 the same amount of maint enance.3 That being said, so that  the4 system works for everyone, I would recommend  that5 this Board lobby the City Council and the  Mayor6 or the Senate and the Legislature and  suggest7 that the SCRIE program be expanded, and the  age8 requirement eliminat ed so that it includes those9 tenants who do have low incomes. It 's this type10 of program that benefits the owner, tenants  and11 ultimately the building itself so that the   income12 generated can pay for the maint enance on the13 property.14 It 's also important to remember15 that older buildings require more maint enance.16 Our building was built in the 1850s and  the17 maintenance  never ends. The PIOC just looks  at18 the incremental increase of an expense or a   cost.19 It doesn' t look at the frequency of that expense.20 And my building requires much more  maintenance21 than a building built in the  1960s.22 So, therefore,  I would suggest23 that Board pass an increase of 8 percent for   a24 one- year lease, 13 percent for a two- year lease - 252 
2 (Audience participation.)3 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:4 and an addit ional 10 percent increase for tenants5 in occupancy for more than ten years .6 Thank you .7 (Audience participation .)8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mr. Lubell.9	Mr . Lubell , go ahead.10 MR. LUBELL:	Mr. Athineos, do11 you have any tenants in your building that  are12 paying more than $2000 a  month?13 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:	In14 two buildings I have some apartments that  are15 deregulated.  I have  in this eight - family building16 that was built in the 1850s, I have  one17 deregulated  apartment . And , yes,  they are18 paying  - - the lowest rent  in the building  is $25819 and the highest rent in  the building	is $2300.20 MR. LUBELL:	Do any of those21 people earn more than $175,000 a year, or  did22 they earn more than $175,000 a year for  two23 years?24 MR . CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:25 Well , the great injustice is, the way the law  is10 
2 now, even if your rent is $250 a month and  you3 have income over $175,000, you are  still4 protect ed by rent regulation because they attach5 that income and the rent  level.6	And so if your income  is7 $175,000 for two years and your stabilized  rent8 was $2100, I could petition DHCR to  deregulate9 that apartment.10 But I've had specif ic instances11 where tenants' rental is about $600 a  month,12 their income is over $175,000, but they are  not13 able to be deregulated because of the way the   law14 is written.15 So this is the great injustice.16 Thee is no correlation between low rent and  low17 income. There are plenty of upper income  people18 in apartments that just have low  rents.19 MR. LUBELL:	Do you think that20 this - -21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. LUBELL:	Do you think this23 Board should be sympathetic to tenants that  are24 earning over $175 , 000 a year and paying $2000 a25 year or more for rent?ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212·) 840-1167
1	1992	MR . CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:3 Absolutely not. I mean I think that the  free4 market , that 's the way this country is built.5 Anywhere else in the country the free  market6 works. It works.7	And that 's why for years and 8 years we have the Rent Guidelines Board, we  have 9 rent regulation. And everyone says the same 1O	things.11 But the system is not  any12 better. The buildings are not any better  off13 maintained with this  system.14 MS. HOLDER:	Sir, is it your15 test imony that the buildings are not being16 maintained well?17 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:	I18 think the building	- - this City is in a  very19 serious housing crisis. Buildings are being  held20 together with Band- Aids. And if you don't pass21 realistic rent increases to cover our taxes,  to22 cover our insurance, to cover facade  improvements23 - I have to spend over $100,000 on this  building24 that was built in the 1850s in Brooklyn  to25 prevent the facade that was crumbling so  God11 
2	forbid it hurt someone.3	MS. HOLDER:	Are you applying4	for MCis?5	MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:	II  m6 glad you brought that up because the  MCI7 increases that we can apply for are being held  up8 in DHCR for four years.9	And when people move out of  the10	building, then I can' t get the MCI.11	And then financing costs are not12 even - - we can't even recoup. I had to put   a13 second mortgage on the building. So I can  recoup14 my financing costs for the cost of that  facade15 improvement.16 And then - - you asked  the17 quest ion and I'm glad  - -18 MS. HOLDER ;	No. I'm glad you're19 answering it.20 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:21 because  it touches on a very sensitive issue.22 MS. HOLDER:	Sure.23 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:24 because when we had to go refinance the  building,25 then they look at all sorts of other things.   They12 
2 start testing for lead paint. We have to  abate3 lead paint in the building even if it 's not in4 any - -5 (Audience participat ion. )6 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:7 bad condit ion. And in the 1850s that was a legal8 thing to use. And now we have to remove it.  So9 that was an additional cost which is  not10 recoupable by an MCI.11 Asbestos removal is not12 recoupable by my MCI .13 Oil tank removal , because the14 building was converted to a gas boiler, an  old15 oil tank in the basement that is empty had to  be16 removed because the bank requires it .17 So all of these are costs18 associated with refinancing the building,  for  the19 facade, and none of that recoupable from an  MCI20 increase.21 MS . HOLDER :	How many buildings22 do you own?23 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:	We24 own ten buildings,	150 apartments.25 (Audience participation. )2

We are a family business .7 We live in the buildings that we own and we  take8 pride.9 And for people who say why  don't10 you sell your building, you 're all missing the11	point. We should be, tenants and owners should be12 working together to preserve and  maintain13 housing, people that live in it and people  that14 own it .15 MS.

I got my20 Doctorate in Music with the Juilliard, and  did21 all of that stuff , and consider myself still22 such.23 But I had the good fortune  to24 put my money together and buy a little  building25 with eight units, eight little studio  apartments.12 
2 And I remember something in  a3 magazine. It was a cartoon and it said: what  has4 sixteen green eyes and seventeen claw- like arms5	and roars and stands at the foot of my bed.  I6	don' t know - -7	(Audience participation.)8	MS. KATHLEEN WALSCH:	- - but as9	long as I'm rent stabilized, I'm not  moving.10	Well , it 's kind of funny but11	it 's not so funny because I have four tenants12 which pay minuscule rents, and I think they   live13 a little better than I do.14 (Audience participat ion.)15 MS .

This23 is the way I feel.24 Because of no mortgage I  was25 able to like pull my belt in the last time  when12 
2 things really got tough. But I would just like   to3 be able to support them at this point because   I4 think I'm going to lose my building because   I5 think it ' s going to be back  in the City.6 And I think you guys are  going7 to find out that next year you're going to  have8 tons of little buildings that are going to  be9 gone. They're going to be back with the  City.10 And then you'll sit there  and11 wonder what happened.12 Anyway that 's my fear and I hope13 that you do something to help small owners  that14 can't make it because that' s the feeling I have15 at this point.16 Thank you.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 Regina Walsch,  followed by20 Mickey Gensler, followed by Vince  Castellano.21 Regina  - -  excuse me, sorry.22 Regina Shanley.

2 MS. REGINA SHANLEY :	Good3 afternoon.4	My name is Regina Shanley . I5 live in a rent stabilized apartment in  the6 Sunnyside, Woodside, Long Island City area  of7 Queens .8 Many New Yorkers are afraid  not9 of terrorism but of losing their homes.  For10 millions of New York City residents,  including11 myself , home is not a shingled house but an12 apartment .13 The rent paid for these14 apartments has been increasing more quickly  than15 incomes. The percent of income paid towards  rent16 is close to seventy or eighty percent for  some17 people, again myself included .18 The stories of peopl e deciding19 to buy food or medicine or pay rent are not  myths20 or urban legends. It 's happening now and it is21 happening  increasingly more often. A doctor22 recently told me about a medicine that he  thought23 would help me. It 's not covered. I couldn' t24 afford it. I can't even try  it.25 If I were the only one with  this5 
2 problem, it would be personal and I wouldn' t be3 here. Unfortunately,	I'm far from the only one4 suffering with this situation .5 The problem of rising rents  is6 one that cuts across the boroughs and across  the7 board . All kinds of people are affected : senior8 citizens, working people, growing families  and9 young people with their first jobs who are  trying10 to find a first home .11 What is happening and will  keep12 happening is that working people will leave  New13 York City for a more affordable place.  Other14 people will be forced into nursing homes or  long-15 term care facilities . Other people will flood16 social service agencies for aid and homes .17 For the good of the City and  its18 people we need affordable rents and  tolerable19 increases .20 (Audience participation .)21 MS . REGINA SHANLEY :	When the22 COLA increase is less than two percent , a 5.523 percent or 8.5 percent increase in rent is  not24 tolerable.25 Thank you .2

MICKEY GENSLER:	Hello!9	I 'm a member of the Skyview10 Tenants Association and the Citywide  Tenants11 Coalition .12 Crain' s business magazine,13 hardly an advocate of tenants rights, stated  in14 an article that one of the best investments  in15 New York City is to be a landlord of  rent16 stabilized property . Let me explain why with a17 little background.18 When the City did away with19 tenant protections under Nelson  Rockefeller,20 chaos reined . So the politicians and the real21 estate industry decided not to make that  mistake22 again.23 The strategy then became one  of24 slow emasculation of tenants rights . By wisely25 dispensing campaign funds, they could do so . They10 
2 first got the Legislature to allow them to  do3 away with three-year leases thus any  increase4 could be compounded every one and two  years.5 Then they got the tenants to  pay6 for the cooperative boom with MCis. They also  got7 the MCis put into the MBR so that the  tenant8 would pay forever at a compound  rate.9 At the same time the Rent10 Guidelines Board called for a higher rate  than11 usual. This frightened many who fled to  Florida12 or forced them to buy an apartment they  really13 could not afford.14 Still not  content , they got15 their friends to give them bonuses with  vacancy16 and luxury decontrol. This took a large chunk  of17 rent regulated  apartments off the market . •18 All they need now is for  the19 Rent Guidelines Board to continue  unconscionable20 rent increases and the remaining tenants will  be21 priced out of their apartments. This is  called22 homeless.23 I wonder as to the legality  or24 propriety of tenants in the same building  paying25 different increases simply because of the date  of2 
2 their lease.3 As for the makeup of the Board ,4 I find it inconceivable that a Board hand - picked5 by a Mayor unfriendly to tenants can be  honest6 and fair in the decisionmaking process of  rent7 increases. I think that the Board should  be8 confirmed by the City Council.9 (Audience participation .)10 MR. MICKEY GENSLER :	In fact ,11 the City Council that makes the laws  should12 select the Board which is responsible for  any13 rent increases.14 (Audience participation.)15 MR . MICKEY GENSLER :	In the16 event that an increase is ever justif ied for a17 particular time period, it should never be  made18 part of the MBR. It should be treated as  a19 separate item and removed after the  time20 designated .21 We tenants are tired of22 subsidizing landlords.23 Thank you.24 (Audience participat ion .)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mr. Genzler,2 
2 you have a question.3 Go ahead.4	MR. LUBELL:	Skyview is a5	cooperative  in Riverdale,6 MR. MICKEY GENSLER:	Right.7 MR. LUBELL:	- - is that correct?8 And what  is your rental , sir?9 MR. MICKEY GENSLER:	What?10 MR. LUBELL:	How much is your11 rental?12 MR. MICKEY GENSLER:	$874.13 MR. LUBELL:	And what is the14 size of your apartment , sir? A two-bedroom?15 MR. MICKEY GENSLER:	I don' t16 know. I don't ask anybody.17 MR. LUBELL:	Is it two bedrooms?18 No, the size of your  apartment.19 MR. MICKEY GENSLER:	What was20 that?21 It 's and three and three- quarter22apartment.23MR. LUBELL:	Okay.24Do you know what the  maintenance25charges areforyour apartment?
2 MR. MICKEY GENSLER:	Probably -3 - at this stage of the game probably a  little4 less than my buying it , perhaps more at this5 stage of the game.6 MR. LUBELL:	Thank you.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 Mr. Castellano.9 (Audience participation.)10 MR. VINCENT CASTELLANO:	I11 thought I would come down here and give you  my12 two cents worth.13 The New York City housing  market14 is the most intensely studied housing market  on15 the planet and I've been looking at that data   for16 more than ten years. So frankly I think I   know17 something about the data.18 To tell you the truth, I was  on19 this Board for a couple of years before  I20 realized that nobody is sworn to tell the  truth.21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. VINCENT CASTELLANO:23 Consequently, very few people do, even people you24 invite rarely telling you the whole  truth.25 So everything you have to  take10 
2 with a grain of salt.3 I have a couple of issues  I4 want ed to mention.5	One is the low- rent adjustment.6 If we exclude core Manhattan, which frankly  I7 consider a unique place on the planet , and you8 just look at the rest of the City, the  average9 operating cost of an apartment in New York   City10 is approximately $450 a  month.11 I don' t understand what the12 public policy purpose is by force of law to   keep13 rent below  $452 a month.  I find - -  I don' t find14 the logic - -15 (Audience participation.)16 MR. VINCENT CASTELLANO:	When17 the Mayor increased real estate taxes, he  didn' t18 want to know, you know, what owners are making.19 He just increased real estate taxes. And  real20 estate taxes are the first dollar  taken.21 Another piece of data that  you22 struggled with, and I know some of you  struggled23 with this data and complained about being   buried24 under data, is tenant income data. Basically   it25 comes from the Housing and Vacancy Survey done   by6 
2 the Census Bureau . It 's a survey of 18,000 people3 every three years. It 's a twenty- page survey.4	If you look at the 1993 HVS,5 page 72, a footnote, by Ant hony Blackburn, that6 was the last HVC report by an  independent7 consultant. Even since then it 's been written by8 a political appointee at  HPD.9 But according to Anthony10 Blackburn this is the worst data in the  entire11 report. Thirty percent refused to answer  the12 tenant income questions. Anot her forty percent13 obviously are lying. In fact , fifteen percent of14 the tenants who answered that question say  that15 their rent is higher than their incomes .16 So when people say to you the17 median income of tenants is X, that 's got to be18 taken not with a grain of salt but with a  pound.19 The special guideline,  the20 special guideline was written the way it is  now21 for a particular reason. When an apartment goes22 from rent control to rent stabilization,  the23 landlord has an opportunity to set a first  rent.24 That rent can be challenged by any tenant at   any25 time with no more than a one- line complaint to5 
2	DHCR.3	And it is not then the4 landlord' s lawyer versus the tenant 's lawyer. No.5 It 's the State of New York interrogating the6 landlord. Now, if that landlord happens to  be7 Donald Trump, who can afford the best lawyers   in8 the country, believe me, the State loses  every9 time.10 When that State agency, which  is11 DHCR,12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to13 wrap up. Make your point.14 MR. VINCENT CASTELLANO:	When15 that State agency is interrogating some  small16 landlord from Crown Heights,17 (Audience participation.18 MR. VINCENT CASTELLANO:19 he' s clearly overmatched.20 And the problem  is that  - -21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. VINCENT CASTELLANO:	any23 complaint  - - not  democracy' s finest moment.24 The purpose of using the  Fair25 Market Rents and the special guideline was  to4 
2 give owners a safe harbor so that if  they3 selected a rent number below this number in  the4 guideline, they could not be  challenged.5	A challenge by DHCR to an  owner6 under the special guideline could cost  thousands7 of dollars and the owner could still  lose.8 So the point was to select  a9 third party rent level that was unbiased , created10 by HUD . This way the owner could pick a number11 and not be subject to  challenge.12 I had other points, Mr.  Chair,13 but I've run out of time .14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank15 you .16 Any quest ions?17 Yes, Mr . Lubell.18 MR . LUBELL:	Vince, were rents19 ever established based upon what a tenant 's20 income is?21 MR. VINCENT CASTELLANO :22 Wouldn' t that be wonderful .23 (Audience participation .)24 MR . VINCENT CASTELLANO :	Most25 programs for the needy require the recipient   to6 
2 prove need. Rent regulation in New York City  is3 one of the few places where the only thing  the4 tenant has to prove is  longevity.5 And so you have  - -  I think the6 owner community would support rent  regulation7 that was contingent upon the tenant proving  need.8 There is an enormous number  of9 tenants out there who don' t have need. And I10 don' t know how much sympathy that group has. I11 mean they don't even have much sympathy  in12 Albany.13 Tenants who have genuine14 demonstrable need is a different strategy.  I15 think we can deal with those  people.16 MR. LUBELL:	Do you know what17 percentage of tenants don' t have need?18 MR. VINCENT CASTELLANO:	I19 don' t think anybody knows.20 MR. LUBELL:	Would you hazard a21 guess?22 MR. VINCENT CASTELLANO:	The23 HPD has data which again is rotten income  data,24 says that almost forty percent claim to  have25 income less than $11,000 a  month.2 
2 In fact ,  I think you made the3 point last year or the year before that there   is4 supposedly 1.8 million people in New York  City,5 tenants, with need. That number never seems  to6 change. We could be in a depression, we could  be7 in recession, we could be at the top of  the8 business cycle, that number never  changes.9 Now the interest ing thing about10 that number is where is the underground  economy?11 That 's my daughter, the nurse.12 Where are the cab drivers?13 Where are the waitresses? Where are  the14 bartenders? The entire people who work off  the15 books, they appear in that low income  category.16 So what is their income? The  IRS17 can't find out. If they can't find out , I18 certainly can't.19 (Audience participat ion. )20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Vince, even21 your daughter is saying that your time is  up,22 Vincent.23 (Audience participat ion. )24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	David25 Robinson .2

DAVID ROBINSON:	My name is8 David Robinson . I'm with Legal Services for  New9 York City.10 And together with The Legal  Aid11 Society, we've submitted some extensive  written12 testimony today which I hope you will have  a13 chance to read between now and  Thursday14 documenting the impact of past rent  guideline15 increases on low- income people throughout the16 City, tracking the really desperate housing   needs17 that low- income people around the City have.18 And despite the twisted19 arguments by Mr. Castellano, just nearby  there20 are thousands and thousands of desperate  low-21 income tenants who need the services of The   Legal22 Aid Society, Legal Services for New York City,   to23 defend their homes against homelessness,  which  is24 now at a record high in the City .25 And the Rent Guidelines  Board8 
  2 has a mission  to prevent  the imposition of unfair3 rent increases. And you have a chance between   now4 and Thursday to reverse the decision you  made5 last month to impose 5.5 and 8.5  percent6 increases. And we hope that you will do  so7 because you really are the last resort of  low-8 income and moderate- income and middle- income9 tenants around the City.10 And there is no  alternative11 housing. There is no public housing  available12 really for low- income people. There is a waiting13 list of 200, 000 peopl e.14 There is no available Section  815 housing for low- income people.16 By contrast , landlords have17 pl enty of help and they've had plenty of help18 over the past years. In the 1993 and 1997  Rent19 Regulation Reform Acts have helped landlords 20	immensely .21 And they have plenty of ways  of22 getting rent increases that have nothing to   do23 with the Rent Guidelines'  increases that you  will24 impose this week. They have the twenty  percent25 vacancy allowance that was given them that   they21 
2 don' t need. They have vacancy decontrol that  they3 don' t need and have taken advantage of.4 (Audience participation. )5	MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	And I would6 like to see an analysis by the Rent  Guidelines7 Board of the profits that landlords have made   off8 of vacancy decontrol. I don' t see that anywhere9 in the reports that have been  prepared.10 They have Individual  Apartment11 Improvement increases that are not monitored  and12 become a permanent part of the permanent  rent13 increase.14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	They have16 Major Capital Improvement increases that become   a17 permanent part of the  rent.18 (Audience participation.)19 MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	And they20 get away with murder in terms of  rent21 overcharges. The four-year rule that has  been22 passed by the State Legislature and by the   courts23 allows them to get away with rent  overcharges.24 And the reason that - - I  think25 one of the main reasons they want to do away   with6 
2 two-year leases is every lease renewal is  an3 opportunity  for rent overcharges and for fraud  on4 the part of landlords.5 (Audience participation.)6 MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	Phoney7 personal  use evictions, phoney non- primary8 residence evictions add further opportunities   for9 landlords to make more and more profits at  the10 expense of tenants.11 Some costs have gone up  this12 year. But now is the time to make up for some   of13 the overcharges, the excess increases that   the14 Guidelines Board has given to tenants in  past15 years.16 We urge you don' t add to already17 the plenty of profits that landlords have had   to18 make. We' re not concerned with the higher  income19 tenants. That is a phoney issue. The real  issue20 is the - -21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	saving23 of affordable housing for the people and  the24 preservat ion of neighborhoods  throughout the25 City.2

HAL BRILL:	H ,  I13 Why is it that the long- term14 rent stabilized tenants have the lowest  rents?15 How come they want large sums of money from   their16 landlords to move? It is because the  rent17 stabilization program  is a rent subsidy program.18 The rents have not kept up  with19 inflation.20 (Audience part icipation.)21 MR. HAL BRILL:	They have not22 kept up with our water bills. They've not kept   up23 with  insurance costs, maintenance	costs, fuel24 costs, real estate  taxes.25 The rent stabilization  program12 
1	2242	is broken. It doesn' t work. Okay?3	There has been year after  year4 of insufficient , inadequate rent increases.  This5 pattern is only going to continue this  year6 (Audience part icipat ion.)7 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Quiet .8 MR. HAL BRILL:	- - with rent9 increases of 5.5 and 8.5 percent.	It simply is10 not enough.11	The people in our buildings,12 they pay more for their parking spaces than   their13 apartments.14 The low rent supplement  is15 important to all of us. These same low  percentage16 increases are meaningl ess with long- term tenants17 with the lowest rents. In order to survive,  we18 need low rent supplements. We need them. We   need19 them this year for all rents under $500.20 So please support higher21 increases, 8 percent , 10 percent , low- rent22 supplements, the Urstadt Law, and  continued23 decontrol of rents above $2000 so  further24 generations of landlords will have a chance   of25 making a living in this business despite   their12 
2 rents will still be under $500. They' ll still3 have low- rent apartments.4 Thank you.5 (Audience participat ion.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 Clare Dockery. Clare  Dockery.8 Aft er Clare Dockery, Nancy Sepe9 and William Mordente and then Nancy  Schauffler.10 Yes, Ms. Dockery.11 MS. CLARE DOCKERY:	Thanks for12 listening to testimony from apartment  renters.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on one14 second , Clare. We have to - - okay. Go   ahead.15 MS. CLARE DOCKERY:	I'm a16 member of the Park West Village  Tenants17 Association  and other tenant advocacy groups.18 I believe  that  safe, decent ,19 affordable housing is the right of every  person.20 It is not right to expect to make a  fortune21 providing  the necessities of life to middle  and22 working  class people, and housing23 (Audience participation.)24 MS. CLARE DOCKERY:	- - is25 surely a necessity, not a  luxury.2 
2 Information provided by the  RGB3 in a letter dated November 2002 states that  the4 Price Index of Operating Cost fell 1.6  percent5 this year, the first time the overall Price  Index6 has been negative.7	Thus, although costs rose during8 the first half of 2003 , they decreased in 2002.9 Although tenants ask owners to release prof it and10 loss information, owners consistently refuse   to11 do so. Why?12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. CLARE DOCKERY:	If14 landlords need to make more money, why won' t  they15 open their books?16 A PARTICIPANT:	They're opened.17 MS. CLARE DOCKERY:	We must	- -18 no, they are not open.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No debate.20 MS. CLARE DOCKERY:	We must21 also recall that a few weeks ago Crain' s22 published  an article stating that rent stabilized23 buildings were considered very good  investments24 because of the steady income they  produced.25 I also do not recall hearing  of8 
2 any real estate management	company going3 bankrupt.4	The RGB justifies increases in5 the guidelines every year even when landlords'6 costs have increased very little.  These7 increases, they say, are justif ied so that when8 costs are higher, increases will not need to  be9 so high. This was the reason we had  rent10 increases last year of two and four  percent.11 (Audience participation.)12 MS. CLARE DOCKERY:	As the RGB13 increases rents year after year, middle  and14 working class people are paying a larger  percent15 of their incomes for rent and we hear of  more16 families with children going to food pantries  and17 of more homeless  families.18 Young people tell me of  doubling19 and tripling up in studio and one- bedroom20 apartments or having to stay with their  parents.21 Older people are being forced to choose  between22 medication or rent .23 Rent increases of 5.5 and 8 .524 percent are obscene .25 (Audience part icipation.)5 
2 MS. CLARE DOCKERY:	New York3 City' s economy is shrinking, unemployment	is4 rising, but the net operating income among  rent5 stabilized building owners increased 3 .5 percent6 while rental income in stabilized buildings   grew7 6.2 percent , again according to information  from8 the RGB.9 Does grant ing the largest rent10 increase in fourteen years make good  economic11 sense? Can it be justified when economic  trends12 are going down while building owners are  still13 making nice profits?14 Please listen to tenants  and15 respond to their pleas. No increases for  2003 .16 Tenants cannot afford them and landlords do  not17 need them.18 (Audience participat ion. )19CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Perfect.20Thankyou.Three minutes  to - - youwin the prize.21Nancy Sepe.22(No response.)23CHAIRMAN MARKUS:No?24(No response.)25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:William

I'm the managing agent of   6618 East 93rd Street , which is owned by my father.  We19 both live in the building. It 's the only building20 he owns. It 's a five- story walkup with two21 apartments per floor.22 Five of the apartments are  rent23 regulated. Just one of those is at market  value.24 The other four are substantially  below.25 In fiscal year 2003 the  building10 
2 sustained a $12 , 000 loss. The insurance went up3 $1000. The fuel bill went up $900. The taxes  are4 going up $4000. At the same time, the rents   on5 the unregulated units have dropped $150 a  month6 for a total decreased revenue of  $5400.7	There are major structural8 repairs .that the building needs that I have  been9 putting off year after year because  I couldn't10 afford them. The brownstone window casements   are11 cracking and chipping and need to be repaired.   I12 patch the front steps every year but they   really13 should be replaced. Three of the bathtubs  are14 sinking into the floor and need to be shored  up.15 There' s no money to pay for any of these  repairs.16 The rent stabilized tenants  in17 my building have not been paying their fair   share18 of the building' s expenses. And they can easily19 afford to. The tenant in apartment 3F pays $450  a20 mont h for a two- bedroom.

2 tenants are not carrying their  weight.3 Please move towards  correcting4 this unfair situation by granting a  substantial5	increase. The tenants can afford it and  the6 building  desperately needs it.7 Thank you.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience part icipation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Virginia11 Hyland, please,  followed by Baishue Reday,12 followed by James Jones, followed by Gurdip   Singh13	Narula.14 Virginia  Hyland ,  is she here?15 She's coming.16 When you hear your name, pl ease17 try to move to the front  earlier.18 Followed by Baishue Reday .

2 Virginia.3 MS. VIRGINIA HYLAND:	I'm the4 fourth generation New Yorker who went to New York5 City schools.6 I've worked for thirty years  as7 a secretary in New York City corporations.   I'm8 also a tenant , a taxpayer and a vot er. Unlike my9 ancestors,  it may soon be economically  impossible10 for me to grow old and die in my family's  home11 city.12 The real estate lobby tries  to13 portray rent - stabilized tenants in the media as14 wealthy cheats or as welfare cases who should   be15 cared for by government , not landlords.16 The truth is that the  average17 rent - stabilized tenant is an ordinary, working18 class vot er and taxpayer who often must pay19 around half his monthly take- home wages20 (Audience participation.)21 MS. VIRGINIA HYLAND:	to pay22 rent. And our wages have not kept pace with the23 cost of living in New York City for  years.24 (Audience participation.)25 MS. VIRGINIA HYLAND:	Landlords2 
2 think they deserve an 8.5 percent increase.  The3 rank and file workers are lucky to get a  three4 percent pay increase, if their salaries have  not5 been frozen and if they have not been laid  off6 from their jobs.7 The majority of New York8 commercial real estate is owned by  large9 corporate entities making huge profits who  feel10 entitled to guarant eed and ever- growing increases11 every year.12 Our salaries may not be as  high13 as those of our critics, but for years our   taxes14 have supported the State and City of New  York.15 Our labor has supported New York business and   we16 have the vote.17 We are not welfare recipients  of18 charity from either government or the  private19 sector. We are the vot ers and taxpayers of the20 working class, and our right to a decent   standard21 of living is being sacrificed to the greed  of22 corporations.23 No matter how hard we work  or24 how much pride we take in our contributions   to25 this City, the real estate industry intends  to2 
2 raise our rents to a level we can never hope   to3 pay, intending to replace us with higher   income4 tenants imported from outside the  City.5 If this  " Tale of Two Cities"6 dream is realized and masses of workers  are7 expelled from their home city, the  great8 disparity of wealth among New York City   residents9 could eventually result in social disruption  and10 increasing violence.11 Government agencies should12 insist that understandable	corporate pursuit of13 the bottomline be tempered by  social14 responsibility before  that happens.15 Please do not cooperat e with16 those working for the economic cleansing  of17 working class tenants from New York  City.18 You are not being asked  to19 support the homeless. You are being asked not   to20 add to the ranks of the homeless when it's  in21 your power to prevent  it.22 (Audience participation.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 Mr. Reday?25 (No response.)2

JAMES JONES:The events of7 September 11, 2001 may have persuaded  The8 Honorable S. E. Frank to take an early  retirement9 to her judgeship. Judge Frank indicated to  one10 tenant the act of the illegal lockout is  well11 known to the court at 111  Centre  Street .12 I thank God and three  unknown13 contributors.  I would like to offer a disclaimer14 if my comments are taken out of context . Thanks15 be to our stenographer.16 Since this Board convened  and17 adjourned  June,  2002 ,  the Appellate Division18 First Department has overthrown Judge  Leland19 DeGrasse in his support decision for Patrick   J.20 Lynch, union boss police. The word the  Appellate21 Division uses is, quote , modify, unquote.22 Evidently, the eighteen-page23 Appellate Division does not present one   instance24 of commonality by the division justice  where25 Patrick J. Lynch, police union boss, and  his7 
2	supporters. Please find five copies of  that3	decision which was provided by this	which was4	provided for this Board.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' ll get6	them.7	MR. JAMES JONES:	Some of you 8 may have access to The Law Journal. The case   is9 encaptioned  Patrick J. Lynch,  Police Union Boss,10 et al against  The City of New York, dated   January 11	7, 2003.12 Thank you.13 I would like to revisit  the14 uniform of the Union Army during  President15 Abraham Lincoln' s Administration. This uniform16 was dark blue. That is the inert on the dark   blue17 uniform of the Union Army in 1860. I found   this18 " cameo" insert in a book on clothing trends in19 1860 in the 42nd Street  Library.20 Incidentally, the art books  have21 been moved into the James Lenox Room 10.  But22 first let us understand the cliche landlord  and23 tenant.24 The Tax Commission, 100 Church,25 refers to this item as an entrepreneur, not as   a12 
2 landlord. The Tax Commission,  100 Church,3 literally ousted the entrepreneur from  the4 building,  1886 ,  Seventh Avenue,  delinquent tax.5 The Tax Commission installed6 their own building administrators. However, this7 entrepreneur became aware of some  loophole8 involving lying the tenants in the dark,  also9 known as a false affidavit.10 Jones was at Central  Harlem11 Board #10 meeting, 12/5, 6:00 p.m.  A12 representative of HPD, named Wendell  Walters,13 announced HPD would be pursuing a  policy14 prohibiting  Donald Trump and his15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Jones,16 you have to wrap up.17 MR.

Only21 young, short black males would be allowed to   bid22 on property in Central Harlem.23 Earlier this week, former Mayor24 Ed Koch was on Bloomberg Radio with a lecture   on25 the draft dodging of young northern whit e men2

2Go ahead , Mr. Narula.3MR. GURDIP SINGH NARULA:	Yes.4Ladies and gentlemen,  good5evening.6	First of all , let me introduce7 myself. My name is Gurdip Singh Narula. I came   in8 this country since9	(Audience participation. )10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet ,11 please.12 MR. GURDIP SINGH NARULA:	I came13 in this country since 1975. But before I speak   to14 anyone, please,  I request everybody we should15 listen to each other. We should make a  nice16 friendly  room. We  are a responsible  people. And ,17 please, all of us keep quiet , when anybody  spoke,18 landlord or tenant. I request everybody  should19 speak, so listen everybody.  I request everyone.20 I came in this country	'75 and21 this dream that  - - my  dreams would  be difficult.22 But , unfortunat ely, we had two things happen23 since September 11th after this one. And we  have24 tax increase, another smaller tax increase, which25 is very hard for small owner to pay to the   taxes.10 
2 Taxes gone up eighteen percent . Heat has gone up3 almost a hundred percent. Wat er' s gone up4 fourteen percent.	Insurance has gone up5 tremendous.6 And  sometime the tenant  - - I7 have a tenant , they had owned , purchased   their8 own property, and they put their ancestor in   this9 building because of the lower rent. I don' t  know10 why, if this country believe that we have a   free11 country and everybody has free enterprises,  why12 not we can enjoy our  business.13 Right now I'm going to be  sixty.14 In this kind of dream I had when I get older,   I15 can enjoy, although I have a small building.  But16 as I am now looking, it is more burden on my   head17 instead of rather I can enjoy. I have three  kids,18 which are already in the  college.19 And tenants, I mean they  are20 saying there is a violation. In my building  I21 have no violation. I have no violation any of   the22 heat. Tenant pay less rent. Even I have a   $600.23 One, the Rent Guidelines Board, they  should24 increase the threshold of people who are  paying25 less than $600. They should pay extra  money.2 
2 And also tenants who are  left3 the building,  they are - -  I mean some people,4 they don' t pay the rent , and those people in the5 court allow us to collect the rent , but they6 finally they left the apartment with  no7 whereabouts.  Those kinds of losses we have  to8 suffer always.9 Instead  - -  I mean the landlord10 has a lot of responsibility to take care of   the11 tenants . If the landlord does not provide,12 automatically they are going to the  Housing13 Department , we have a problem. And then the14 tenant  - -  the landlord get another violation.	If15 there is no heat , then he get a big violation  and16 they pay $2500 penalty.17 In this case I request Rent18 Guidelines Board , they should increase minimum  at19 least 18 percent and 3 0 percent increase.20 And also they should  increase21forthethreshold for an apartmentat $600.22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Thank you.23Any questions?24(No response.)25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:All right .

So please try to be a little15 quicker.16 I guess that' s the only rule we17 are changing right now. We are trying to  get18 everybody  in. We  are scheduled to - -  it is now19 approximately ten to four. We are scheduled  to20 recess at 6:00 o'clock.21 So we' ll try and get everybody22 in. Two- and - a- half minutes.23 MS. EDRIE COTE:	Ladies and24 gentlemen:25 My name is Edrie Cote. I am  a10 
2 rent stabilized tenant who has lived in New  York3 City for over forty years.4 Since the early	'90s I have been5 involved in the leadership of the London  Terrace6 Gardens Tenants Association in Manhattan.7	My husband, a teacher, and I,  a8	computer programmer, have worked,  lived9	(There was a brief pause in the10 proceedings.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	He just needs12 - - he wants to hear.13 MS. EDRIE COTE:	I'm going to14 back up just a little bit.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.16 MS. EDRIE COTE:	My husband, a17 teacher, and I, a computer programmer,  have18 worked , lived and paid taxes in New York City  all19 these years. Now that we are nearing  retirement ,  2O	New York  City  seems to be  saying  II thanks for  the21 good work, now go find yourselves affordable22 housing  elsewhere. 1123 The 5.5 and 8.5 percent24 increases proposed by the Rent Guidel ines Board25 are way out of line with inflation.  Working21 
2 people, like ourselves, are fortunate to hold   on3 to our jobs, let alone receive salary  increases4 in the current economy.5	Retirees have had decreases in6 their pension payments due to the bear  markets,7 and those who rely solely on a fixed  income8 and/or Social Security have not  received9 increases anywhere near those proposed by  the10 Rent Guidelines Board.11 (Audience participation.)12 MS. EDRIE COTE:	Tenants cannot13 deduct rent increases from their income taxes   as14 landlords can deduct increased real estat e  taxes15 and business expenses from their income  taxes.16 Virtually every apartment  at17 London Terrace Gardens that has vacated  since18 vacancy decontrol was enacted has  been19 decontrolled. Once an affordable housing   complex,20 it is rapidly becoming an exclusive, high- rent21 community.22 There was every indication  that23 the owners found these ten buildings to be  very24 prof itable before vacancy decontrol was  enacted.25 Now they must be very pl eased indeed.6 
2 Tenants in rent controlled  and3 rent stabilized apartments have been  assessed4 additional rent increases in the form of  Major5 Capital Improvements, many of which are  of6 questionable merit and all of which reward  the7 landlord with permanent rent increases long   after8 the costs of those improvements have been  offset.9 (Audience participation.)10 MS. EDRIE COTE:	The income11 threshold  for determining seniors' eligibility12 for SCRIE has not kept up with inflation  either,13 putting extreme pressure on the tenants  least14 able to pay.15 5.5 and 8.5 percent increases16 and the resulting erosion of affordable  housing17 sends a signal that the working class is  not18 welcome here and will result in a city  of19 transients.20 Thank you for your time.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 Thank you.23 (Audience part icipation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	J. Allison25 Crockett , followed by Adele Bender, followed by2 
2	Mr. Ramirez, followed by Paul Podhaizer,   followed3byMosesVila.4Go ahead. J. Allison Crockett.5MS. J .   ALLISON CROCKETT:	Hl' .I6I'm giving this presentation7 today because I believe the numbers that  I'm8 going to be reading to you are  very9 representative of other building owners in  the10 neighborhood where I own an apartment  building.11 The building  in Brooklyn has12 thirty units . Sixteen of those units pay less13 than $500 a month. Three of these are  rent14 controlled, from $127 to $212 for a large  two-15 bedroom.16 The thirteen rent  stabilized17 apartments are as low as $375. 81 for a one-18 bedroom and $453 .37 for a two- bedroom. And that 's19 a little less than 900 square  feet.20 Six pay an average of  $526.21 Seven pay market rents, although renovations  are22 not yet paid for, so I've not yet seen the  profit23 from that.24 An 8 .5 percent increase passed25 on to the nineteen apartments that are  below7 
2 market prices would net me $11,203 .18 a year.3 If fuel consumption for  the4 second half of 2003 is the same as for the  first5 half , my fuel bill , just the fuel bill ,  will6 increase by $15,400. Even if consumption of   fuel7 is reduced for the second half of this year by  258 percent , my bills just for fuel would increase by  9	$11,000.10 Where do I get the $5,000 to  pay11 the increase in the real estate  taxes?12 I was already three -months late13 paying the first installment because it  was14 either paying the taxes or paying the fuel   bills.15 A PARTICIPANT:	Open your books.16 MS. J . ALLISON CROCKETT:	Even17 with an 8.5 percent increase, six apartments plus18 the three rent controlled would still have   rents19 below $500 and well below monthly  operating20 costs.21 Even with a $20 supplement , only22 one of these apartments would then reach   $500.23 The cheapest apartments in  my24 building aren't occupied by the poorest , but by25 those who have simply lived there the  longest.10 
2 (Audience participation.)3 MS. J. ALLISON CROCKETT:	The4 immigrant families that were in my building  were5 no doubt very poor when they first moved in . But6 they don' t live there anymore. Most of the7 apartments have been passed down, some of  them8 several times to various relatives who can afford9 an increase.10 How can this Board justify  my11 losing money on apartments everyday just  because12 the original occupant has been there a long   time?13 My building had over  seventy14 violations when I bought it four- and - a-half years15 ago.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you try17 and wrap up.18 MS. J. ALLISON CROCKETT:	I am.19 The only MCI increases were  in20 2000. They resulted in a $2.52 increase for  a21 one - bedroom and $3 .36 for a two- bedroom.	I now22 have zero violations and a beautifully  maintained23 building.24 I cannot continue to keep  it25 this way without the help of the  Board.2 
1	2542 Thank you.3 (Audience participation. )4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .5 Adele Bender .6 You don' t like the way you look7 in the hat , Adele?8 MS. ADELE BENDER :	I don' t know9 what I did to deserve that accolade that you   gave10 me before, but , anyway, here goes .11	My name is Adele Bender. I'm a12 member of the New York Citywide Tenant  Coalition,13 The Queens League of United Tenants, Met  Council14 on Housing and I'm the Queensboro Coordinator   for15 JPAC, Joint Public Affairs Committee, for   Older16 Adults .17 You know, homelessness, which18 will and could and which will increase from   the19 constant increases in rents because a lot  of20 people are going to be ending up being  evicted21 because they will not be able to afford   those22 rents.23 If I lost my job, we' re up a24 creek without a paddle because I don' t qualify25 for SCRIE and the rents keep going up and don' t12 
2 forget the MCi s which the landlords get.3 Homelessness also costs the  City4 more money because what they' re doing with5 homeless people is they are putting them  into6 motels for $92 a night , putting them into7 dilapidat ed buildings and dilapidated apartments8 for like $3000 a month to the  landlords.9 I walk along Queens Boulevard10 and I keep seeing what's the apartments that   are11 available. They have studios and little  one-12 bedroom apartments. They go into the four13 figures. It goes like that in my building  too.14 Where is this going to  end?15 I would also like to say  that16 people not being able to afford the rents end   up17 maxing their credit cards because if you  can't18 manage the rent , you have to buy your food  and19 also health- related costs have to be paid with  a20 credit card. So they end up maxing that  out.21 And a remark was made about  an22 underground economy and taxicab drivers  were23 named. Let me tell you something. There' s a  cab24 driver in my building. He pays over $500 a  week25 to horse hire. They have to pay to take  their2 
1	256  2 cabs out. It 's about a $100 a day. If they make3 out , they get the rest. If they don' t , they  have4 to work like fourteen hours a day and they do  in5 order to make ends meet. And they work like  six6 days a week and they pay their taxes. They  are7 nice, decent family people. There is  no8 underground  economy there.9 I would also - -  I want to bring10 out one other really  - -  two other things.11 If you looked at Crain' s and12 reports that I hear on the radio all the  time,13 that the real estate industry, with  everything14 that' s going on, is making out okay.15 Real estate deep pockets,  here16 you go, $10,000, $25,000 and even more. RSA   and17 the REBNY - I forget what that stands for,  Real18 Estate Board of New York - members made  fifty19 contributions worth $10,000 or more.20 Campaign cash comes home  to21 Albany. $2.7 million in campaign donations since 22	1999.23 Republican  Campaign Committ ee24 received  $475,750 in real  estate trade  - - from25 the real estate trade  associations.23 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you3 wrap up, please.4 MS. ADELE BENDER:	And one more5 - - real fast? Okay.6 The Albany was totaled over $2.77 million in campaign donat ions. And so on and so8 forth. Where are they all getting the money   from?9 Okay?  It ' s from the tenants and they are  crying10 poor and it 's not so.11	And if some small landlords, if12 there is a small landlord having a problem,  they,13 they can claim hardship, they can get some  sort14 of assistance. But otherwise they are telling   the15 lie loud enough and long enough, and we are  not16 going to believe it because that is the   Hitlerian17	theory.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 MS. ADELE BENDER:	Thank you.20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Ramirez.22 Mr. Ramirez, or Ms. Ramirez,  sorry.2 3	MS. EMPERADRIC RAMIREZ:	My24 name is Emperadric Ramirez. I'm the owner of   one25 building of six  families.24 
1	2582 I've got deep problems  in3 building. My tenants, I don' t say they' re bad4 tenants, but the rent is very, very low. One   is5 $250 a month and the other one is $400,  $450.6 My taxes are very high.  The7 water bills is $4000. The insurance is $4,000   a8 year. And the taxes is $35,000 a  year.9 Everything  is increased. How we10 can support?11	I'm the person  - -  I'm retired. I12 receive from the Social Security $450. My  Social13 Security go into my  buildings.14 How I can survive in  this15 increase the rent?16 Sometimes I tell my tenants,  I17 want to renew the tenant leases, sometimes   the18 tenants they don' t want to renew their lease.19 It 's no increase. How can I support this20 building?	I don' t think it 's fair. We don' t21 enough increase.22 That is my testimony.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.24 MS. EMPERADRIC RAMIREZ:	You25 think about this. This is small owners, not   the12 
2 big buildings, just the eight - family. How we can3 control all of these buildings? How we can  pay4 the gas, electricity and water and  everything?5	They need service for the tenants. How we can   get6 them service when we don' t have the money for7 everything?8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 MS. EMPERADRIC RAMIREZ:	Thank10	you.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any12 questions?13 (No response.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.17 Podhaizer,  Paul Podhaizer.18 MR. PAUL PODHAIZER:	My name is19 Paul Podhaizer. I'm Chairman of the Coney   Island20 Brightwater  Towers Tenant Council.21 I would like to address my22 remarks particularly to the four new public23 members and the  Chairman.24 I expect that you are  conducting25 a true public hearing and that the dye has  not12 
2 been cast by your preliminary  recommendations  of3 5.5 and 8.5 percent increases, and that  this4 decision is not etched in  stone.5 Those increases are really  not6 justified. The facts are the landlords  today,7 their income, their profits and equity, are  the8 highest it has ever been. Landlords'  cost9 statistics are made available to the  Board.10 However, income aff idavit statements are not11 submitted by the landlords.12 The question is how can  the13 Board just ify its decision without balancing  off14 costs to income. I wonder whet her the members  saw15 the following record of the past twenty- year16 lease renewal rent increases: that  one-year17 leases went up 79.5 percent , two- year leases went18 up 67 percent.19 This information was printed  in20 The Daily News and the source was the  Rent21 Guidelines Board.22 I wonder if the Board has  also23 added the poor tax increases for rents under   $50024 and the very high vacancy allowances to all   the25 tenant rent increases. You do not have to be  an2 
2 accounting major to understand  that our current3 rents are more than 35 percent higher than  they4 should be due to the cumulative effect of  the5 past overstat ed rent increases ordered by the6 Rent Guidelines Board.7 Let me emphasize. Landlords  are8 guaranteed a profit through Major  Capital9 Improvements. And today the landlords find  that10 they don' t have to put in for a hardship11 increase.12 In conclusion,  I hope that your13 final decision will be based on the merits  and14 will not accept the landlords' propaganda   as15 fact , and for the first time will give the16 million tenants the justice we deserve and   should17 expect , because the past history of the Rent18 Guidelines Boards was to be very partial to   the19 landlords.20 And in closing let me say a  just21 result will show the public that our  current22 Mayor by his appointments of the new  Board23Members nowrepresents all the people, not  only24the specialmoney interests.25And I thank you very much  for

I have the13 income for me the rent in my house  $2,845.14 And it cost me each month  $334315 when I pay mortgage, I pay gas for boiler,  heat ,16 taxes, everything.17 I buy this house in 1   86 and  then18 in '95 I am sick. I got three times heart  attack19 and diabetic. I have  arthritis.20 I don' t have money.21 And	'98 I can't pay my taxes for22 my building and the City save my building,   the23 one company.

I go three times to the  court.11 Don't listen to me. I pay lawyer. Don't  do12 nothing for me.13 I have proof to pay for the14 lawyer. The City, everything, but nobody help  me.15 That 's why I come here today .16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.19 Sharon Rogoff.20 MS . SHARON ROGOFF :	Good21 afternoon.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good23 afternoon.24 MS. SHARON ROGOFF:	I thank you25 for the opportunity to  speak.6 
2	I faxed you ladies and  gentleman34	PARTICIPANTS:	Louder.5	MS. SHARON ROGOFF:	I faxed you6 some information seven p.m. last night which  will7 be easier for me to have you read. I wanted   you8 to meet me in person because whenever I see  the9 press covering these hearings - and I'm not   here,10 this is the first time.11 And I'm a born New Yorker.  My12 father owned a factory in New York. I've   worked13 for some of the most huge corporat ions in this14 country. I know them. I talk to them  daily.15 And I know that what 's going on16 now is many of them don' t want to return to New17 York because they feel that their employees   will18 not have affordable housing . And they don' t want19 to pay their employees, who I would be  working20 with and am working with to try to do  business,21 they don' t want to have to pass that rent22 increase that would occur on into their salaries.23 Because, as you know,24 corporations today are trying to have  the25 bottomline work with Wall Street. It 's very6 
2 apparent we' re going through hard times, all of3 us.4 9/11, we' re all hurt ing. And I5 am heartbroken to see that at this stage of  my6 life where I'm starting to get close to the  age7 of being a senior citizen, I've suffered  two8 disabilities  due to landlords' circumstances9 during renovations which were not  necessary.10 Yet I forge on. I don't sue.  I11 forge on to try to get back on my feet and  get12 back into the workforce where I belong with  my13 campaign launch, which is Pro  USA.14 That 's why I'm wearing an eagle15 on my neck. It 's one of my sculptures and one of16 my properties.17 Now, I think that what I  heard18 here today about people being sworn in  and19 opening books makes sense. I don't  think20 landlords should suffer, but I don' t believe a21 great deal of what I'm hearing about   landlords.22 My family' s owned real estate. I23 know some of the most affluent real estate  people24 in this City since I'm a child and they are   fair25 people. Greenthal , when I lived in a Greenthal2 
2 building, whatever rent I'm paying now is   higher3 than what I paid in a luxury  building.4	A PARTICIPANT:	How much do you5	pay now?6		MS. SHARON ROGOFF:	Under 7	$1000.8	A PARTICIPANT :	Come to9	Brooklyn.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.11	MS. SHARON ROGOFF:	I don' t want12 to come to Brooklyn. Manhattan is my  home.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right.14 Hold on. No debate. Go  on.15 MS. SHARON ROGOFF:	Excuse me.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.17 MS. SHARON ROGOFF:	In the18 meantime when you think about the interest   rates19 you get when you put money in a savings  account ,20 what is it? One, two, three  percent?21 (Audience participation.)22 MS. SHARON ROGOFF:	You know?2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.24 MS. SHARON ROGOFF:	Things are25 not in proportion.24 
2 (Audience participation.)3 MS. SHARON ROGOFF:	There truly4 are very few people who take advantage of  this5 system. Honest  to God, you know it , I know  it ,6 everybody knows it.7 This City was built on  artists8 and designers. That 's my community. We don' t9 always get our fair share. We have to  suffer10 sometimes to get the respect that we  deserve.11 And the bottomline is that  money12 talks. We need you to do the right thing for   us.13 What 's going to happen to us as14 we get older? Where do we go? You take  these15 apartments away from us, we' ll be homeless.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to17 wrap up.18 MS. SHARON ROGOFF:	All right.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.20 MS. SHARON ROGOFF:	We don' t21 need more homelessness. We don' t need more  pain.22 Let us all try to get together and figure  out23 solutions on how to bring business back to   the24 City, bring jobs.25 And , you know, no wealthy people2 
2 want to be ripped off with exorbitant  rents3 either. They are not  fools.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 MS. SHARON ROGOFF:	Thank you.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 (Audience participation.)8 MS. SHARON ROGOFF:	Please9	refer to my document.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We will.11 MS. SHARON ROGOFF:	Because I12 can't talk in front of my landlord. I'm  very13 uncomfortable.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.15 (Audience participation. )16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Nick Petras.17 Mr. Petras.18 MR. NICK PETRAS:	Hl'  .I19 My name is Nick Petras, Jr.  and20 I'm representing my family's interests.  Among21 other things, we own several hundred rent -22 stabilized apartments, about ninety percent  of23 which are in Queens County.24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.10 
1	2692	MR. NICK PETRAS:	I have an MBA3 from NYU down the street.4 My dad bought his first  building5 in 1959 and I've been running our real  estate6 operation basically	for the past several years.7 I know everybody has been8 discussing the surging costs for insurance,  real9 estate taxes and energy, but I would like  to10 testify about two things before you vote:  the11 long- term tenant discount and increased security.12 I think everyone in New York13 knows that the longer a tenant has been in a   rent14 regulated apartment , the better the deal the15 tenant probably has. And	" savvyer" owners of New16 York apartments know that the lowest rents in   a17 building belong to the long- time rent -18 stabilized , not  rent - controlled, tenants.19 In 1981, my family purchased  a20 48-unit building on 29th Street in  Astoria21 consisting mostly of one-bedroom apartments  with22 a total of 127 rentable  rooms.23 Average rent per room is  now24 $260.07 a month or $702.76 per apartment  per25 month, which is an increase of four percent   over3 
  2 the previous year mostly due to an elevator  MCI.3 Last year' s operating cost4 including real estate taxes for each room was5 $156.00 per month, which was an increase of  over6 twenty- five percent over the previous year due to7 surging insurance, real estate tax and  energy8 costs.9 When my dad bought  this10 building, the tenants were attempting to get a   7A11 Administrator  appointed and were conducting  a12 rent strike. Well , I guess the striking tenants13 got the well - run building they want ed. More than14 forty percent	- nineteen of the forty- seven15 rental apartments - of the tenants have been   in16 the building, have been there for more  than17 twenty years.18 This number includes only four19 rent - controlled tenants.20 Average rent for these  long-21 term rent - stabilized tenants is $542.57 a month 22	or $193 .78 a room.23 Average rents for the rent -24 controlled tenants is actually  more.25 These tenants don' t pay their23 
2 proportional cost of running the building . Sad  to3 say, perhaps we shouldn' t run the building as4 well as we do.5 I would ask you to please6 reconsider a longevity increase of six percent   or7 more for tenants in possession ten years or  more8 to have these tenants  - -9 (Audience participation.)10 MR. NICK PETRAS:	- - pay more11 of their fair share of the  costs.12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. NICK PETRAS:	This would14 amount to about $30 an apartment for my  29th15 Street tenants.16 Also, it will balance out  the17 increases that the market , not the rent18 stabilizat ion regime, will prevent me from19 getting from my tenants who have been there   only20 a few years.21 Thank you.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Barry25 Jamison. Mr. Jamison.2 
1	2722	MR. BARRY JAMISON:	Good3	afternoon.4	My name is Barry Jamison. I am  a5 DC37 Executive Board Vice President , but more6 importantly, I serve as Chair of DC 37's  Housing7 Committee.8 On behalf of the 125,000  members9 and 50, 000 plus retirees, we welcome the10 opportunity to testify before  you.11 A vast majority of our  members12 have a City residency requirement. The  City13 requires our members to maintain City residence14 but they make a dismal effort in ensuring  that15 affordable housing is available. Our members   do16 not have a choice. They cannot move outside   the17 City for better rents.18 Besides the already low  wages19 received by our members, their salaries are  not20 keeping up with the pace of skyrocketing   housing21 costs.22 Needless to say, the  proposed23 increases will negatively affect DC 37 rent -24 stabilized apartment members. Hardest hit will   be25 our retirees as earlier testified to.  Our5 
2 families are living from paycheck to  paycheck.3 The proposed  rent adjustments4 for apartments adopted by your Board on May  5th5 are unfair. Property owners' operating  costs  have6 gone up this year, but the 5.5 and 8.5  increases7 are much higher than  needed.8 The present proposal will9 unjustly enrich the New York City property   owners10 and be a tremendous financial burden on  working11 families if this body does not reduce it at  the12 final vote on the 19th.13 Tenants continue to get  poor14 because they can no longer afford the  rent15 increases that you have  sanctioned.16 Our MELS Housing unit staff  is17 seeing record numbers of tenants who cannot  pay18 the rent and we anticipate this getting  worse.19 The rising cost of rent  in20 apartments in New York City is one of the   reasons21 the majority of their clients are rent - regulat ed22 tenants. Everybody  suffers from inflation.23 However, the poor and the City tenant  population24 suffer from inflat ion the most.25 Two years ago you voted to2 
2 eliminat e the poor tax. Please continue that3 practice . Do not reinstate it.4	Landlords should not be allowed5 to impose a longevity tax. Please say no to  that6 proposal .7 (Audience participation. )8	MR. BARRY JAMISON:	Now is the  9 time to consider the impact unjustified  increases10 would have on all rent stabilized tenants of   this11 City . The poor and working families will be hurt12 more by the current rent increase proposals   than13 property owners suffering without any  rent14 increases .15 Our members and retirees'16 pocketbooks  are already stretched with rising17 costs of  raising  children,  health care ,18 prescript ion drugs, food and other basic needs.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Please try to 20	wrap up.21 MR . BARRY JAMISON :	They are22 paying an increasingly greater proportion  of23 their salaries for housing and other  necessities .24 DC 37's slogan is Members Come25 First . Let 's stop the present  trend of taking21 
2 more  from the poor. Let ' s put tenants 1	needs3 first.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .5 (Audience part icipation .)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mr. Kunzmann,7 Fred Kunzmann.8 The next two speakers after  Mr.9 Kunzmann are Alan Birner and Therese  Kontos.10 MR . FRED KUNZMANN :	Thank you,11 Chairman Markus and Members of the  Rent12 Guidelines Board , for this opportunity to address13 you.14 Most landlords that will  be15 affected by your decision own only one or  two16 small apartment buildings. We are not the  large17 real estate developers that are building  new18 luxury apartment projects throughout the  City.19 The tenants that will be20 affected are middle- class families and21 individuals, neither well - to- do nor the truly22 poor. They 1   re covered by Section 8 .23 (Audience participation .)24 MR. FRED KUNZMANN:	My wife and25 I have owned a seven-unit brownstone for the  last
2 five years and have seen our costs  escalate3 beyond all predictions. During that time  the4 regulated rents have remained dismally  below5 market level .6 For over a decade the staff  at7 the Rent Guidelines Board has prepared the  annual8 Price Index of Operating Costs for  Stabilized9 Apart ment Buildings. This April , their report10 indicated that the average costs in pre- war11 buildings	- ours was built  around  1860 -  rose12 18.4 percent , insurance  costs over  forty percent ,13 the most in almost a  generation.14 Fuel costs rose 66.9 percent ,15 electricity 21. 7, real estate 14.8.16 These are all costs for  services17 mandated by the government. We cannot turn   down18 the heat in the apartments, nor should we.  We19 cannot extinguish the lights in the hallways   nor20 turn off the required ventilation. And if we   fail21 to pay our taxes, the City may take over  the22 building. And we all know how good a landlord  the23 City can be.24 Yet in spite of this  information25 provided by your own staff , the Board is2 
2	proposing only a 5.5 and 8.5 percent  increase.3 (Audience participation.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet. Let5	him finish.6	MR. FRED KUNZMANN:	This is7 clearly not even enough to cover  increased8 expenses.9 Tenant Member Holder  mentioned10 the need to share the increased cost  confronting11 owners. Although most of the increases  affect12 items the landlord has absolutely no  control13 over, the sharing that this Board is  proposing,14 through allowable rent increases, is not even   a15 50/50 deal of 9.2 percent.16 She mentioned  that the tenants17 are also being hit with some hidden taxes in   the18 form of fare increases, et cetera. We should  not19 forget that the landlords have to take the   same20 trains and buses and are being affected by  the21 same hidden taxes.22 (Audience participation.)2 3	MR. FRED KUNZMANN:	Ms. Holder24 also spoke about her meeting with landlords   for25 whom these meetings have no effect because   their24 
2 rental units are already at market value. I   only3 wish I were in the same  situation.4 I would be happy to meet  with5 Ms. Holder and explain that the tenant  paying6 $650 per month for a one- bedroom unit does not7 even cover the tax cost per square foot for  the8 apartment. Another tenant paying  $980 for a9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Please wrap10	up, Mr. Kunzmann.11	MR. FRED KUNZMANN:	- - similar12 unit covers the taxes, but doesn' t leave  enough13 for heat and hot water.14 In conclusion, I ask you to15 allow the rent increases to keep pace with   your16 own Price Index, especially in those cases where17 the rents are significantly below market  value.18 Do not artif icially force the19 rents to lag so far behind building owners'   costs20 that you wind up hurting both the landlords   and21 the tenants in the long  run.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Alan Birner.25 After Mr. Birner and  Therese12 
2 Kontos will be Andre Stolte - I think that' s3 right - then James Peyton, then April  Humphrey,4 then Avi Siev.5 Go ahead, Mr. Birner.6 MR. ALAN BIRNER:	Thank you.7 Good afternoon, ladies  and8 gentlemen. My name is Alan Birner. I'm a  Member9 of the Tenant Research Team. I've provided  copies10 of my testimony to all the Board with  exhibits11 for your reference .12 The first exhibit includes  news13 articles, correspondence with the Mayor  and14 Finance Commissioner and a City  Council15 resolution. These documents address $1.4 billion16 in unpaid taxes and fines from real  estate17 interests, over $160 million  in lost property  tax18 revenue from the bribery of tax assessors,  and19 $634 million in uncollect ed ECB fines, part of20 which involves actions of property  owners.21 Any industry that is  truly22 unable to meet its costs does not incur  millions23 of dollars in fines. If anything, such   fines24 would be scrupulously avoided .25 Tenants should not be asked  to8 
2subsidizethe incompet ence, lawlessness or3arroganceof their landlords.4(Audience participation.)5MR. ALAN BIRNER:	Lost revenue6increasesthe budget deficit. Property  owners7have alsoreduced the taxpayer base by  displacing8thousandsof tenants. These factors helped  to9	bring about the recent property tax  increase.10 Now we' re being asked to pass11 that tax along to tenants in the form of  rent12 increases.13 Through vacancy decontrol  the14 real estate industry has increased both  its15 profits  and homelessness.16 Exhibit 2 addresses the  millions17 of taxpayer dollars that are spent to house   the18 homel ess. Through the Department of Homeless19 Services the industry prof its again from this20 solut ion to the problems that it helped to21 create.22 Real estate owners and  investors23 are the only winners in this  scenario.24 As concerns the small  realty25 owners, their insolvency only leads to   increased10 
2 consolidat ion of property ownership by larger3 investment companies.4 In the mortgage provided by5 Exhibit 3 , an investment group acquired most of6 the eleven properties through in rem tax  lien7 sales. Individual shell corporations may  claim8 hardship and request rent increases.  However,9 once you lift the veil of corporate  ownership,10 these claims lose their merit.11 The question is not  solvency,12 but a guarantee of increased return  on13 investment.14 I'm going to leave you  one15 thought. My landlord was asked under oath why  he16 decided to leave the Mitchell- Lama program . His17 answer was, and I quote, natural  greed.18 If reaping profits from  the19 misery of thousands of City residents is  natural ,20 then our society is embracing its  basic21 inst incts . No good can come of this.22 You can stop the destructive23 cycle of injust ice and predatory greed and24 eliminate the suffering of thousands of  honest25 hard- working people.2 
2 I ask that you vot e your3 conscience before any interest and freeze  our4 rents.5 Thank you for your attention.6 (Audience participat ion.)7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Birner,8	what Mitchell - Lama do you live in?9	MR. ALAN BIRNER:	What?10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What11 Mitchell - Lama do you live in?12 (Audience participation. )13 MR.

If you10 make a left , it will be Times Square , if you   make11 a right it ' s going to Hell 's Kitchen. 45th  and12 Eighth, owned by Malone  Properties.13 My building is quickly  becoming14 decontrolled. When a tenant moves out or  is15 evicted , the apartment is totally renovated and16 then some are rented to an agency at $33 00 a17 mont h or more who then rents them on a quick18 basis to corporat ions.19 It is becoming a corporate20 transient hotel. I feel somewhat unsafe. I  never21 know who the strange person in the building  is.22 The owner has leased the  roof23 rights to Sprint who has put an enormous  antenna24 up there with all its radiation at the cost  of25 $100 , 000 a month to Sprint I'm told. That 's over9 
2	$1 million a year.3	There is a large Urinetown4 banner down the side of  the building.	I don' t5 know the profits to the landlord for  that.6 However, it is the theatre  district.7 When I go home, there may be  a8 Wendy' s on my floor. I don' t know .9 There are many performers  and10 artists, dancers, singers, who work in  the11 neighborhood  who need affordable housing.  Some12 work two and three jobs between roles. None   whom13 I know has a house on the  Riviera.14 I wondered where would the  City15 be without its artists and where would  the16 artists be without  affordabl e housing.17 (Audience participation.)18 MS.

JAMES PEYTON:	I would like
1	2852 us to really take a look, a serious look, at   who3 are here. And when we take that serious  look,4 consider that the people that are here are  aging5 people they have been in apartments for  years.6 Their rents are low, very  low.7 (Audience participation.)8 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	Excuse me.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let 's keep10 order here. Please.11	This is not a debate.12 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	And they13 would like it to remain that  way.14 Now, I can understand that  some15 of these people need help. I can understand   that.16 But the landlord is not the person to bear   the17 burden of these people.18 (Audience participation.)19 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	They are20 it is not even sensible to consider such a   thing.21 A PARTICIPANT:	Why not?22 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	Why not?23 Listen to this.24 Consider the gas is up. Consider 2512 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Talk to us.3 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	Consider4 insurance since 9/11 is  ridiculous.5	Consider maintenance owned6 buildings.  If you call in a maintenance man,  you7 are up to $500. My God , I'm just going to  run8 down something for you for a  minute.9 One apartment , and I'm talking10 about one building, one apartment , $239.26. I11 paid  $1100 for maint enance, paint , et cetera , in12 this apartment. Do you know how long it 's going13 to take to get that money  back?14 Okay. Let 's go to the next one.15	$380.06.16	The next one, $481.11.17	Next one, $328.85.18 Next  one, three hundred  - - and I19 don' t mind showing rent rolls.20	Next one, $369.45.21 My God! It's not even  sensible22 to consider not giving small landlords a raise   of23 at least 8.5 percent.  It's not even sensible.24 (Audience participation.)25 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	Excuse me.21 
2	Excuse me.3	There is paint ing, there is4	maintenance, there is gas, there is electric ,  and5	sometimes when we do not suit them, there  is6 court. We have to pay for the lawyer, they  do7 not.8 Look who' s here. You don' t find9 anyone here but retired people . I understand  some10 of - -11 (Audience participation.)12 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	- - their13 hurt. But let 's - - excuse me. Let' s look at  one14 thing.15 I think something should be16 fair. I think something should be drawn  up17 equitable, that these people that need help   can18 get the help they need.19 But not through the burden  of20 landlords. Because guess what 's going to happen?21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	Guess what 's23 going to happen? When the small landlord   goes24 out , big business moves in and you are going  to25 move out because that' s the way it is.6

Thank8 you.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	April11 Humphrey.12 MS. APRIL HUMPHREY:	Good13 afternoon.14 My name is April Humphrey  and15 I'm testifying as a representative for  State16 Senator Eric Schneiderman who is in  legislative17 session today and is unable to attend  this18 hearing.19 Senator Schneiderman represents20 the 3 1st Senate District which includes part of21 the Upper West Side, West Harlem,  Washington22 Heights and Inwood in Manhattan and Riverdale   in23 the Bronx.24 For more than half a  century,25 New York City has had a housing emergency.  With8 
2 vacancy rates consistently below five percent  and3 market - rate rents skyrocketing out of control,4 the crisis is as real today as it was when  rent5 regulations were  first implemented.6 In addition, decontrol of7 regulated apartments and yearly rent  increases8 approved by the Rent Guidelines Board have  pushed9 thousands of previously  regulated apartments out10 of the system and eroded the stock of  affordable11 housing.12 It is virtually impossible  to13 find affordable housing in New York  City.14 I join with tenants in urging15 the Board to approve guidelines  significantly16 lower than those approved in the  preliminary17 vot e. I understand that owners are facing  large18 increases in property taxes this year as a   result19 of the City and State's severe fiscal  crisis.20 The large increases proposed  are21 on top of increases granted during the boom  years22 of 1995-2002. It's time for everyone,  including23 landlords, to shoulder their fair share of   this24 economic crisis that we now face .25 (Audience participation.)2 
1	2902 MS. APRIL HUMPHREY :	The burden3 should not be transferred  solely onto the backs4 of tenants, most of whom are low and  middle-5 income families who have already been hit  with6 increased taxes and fees on everything  from7 subway fare to CUNY tuition.8 The generous increases that  the9 Board has granted owners in the past  have10 contributed to a healthy return on  owners'11 investment in rent regulated property.  The12 Board' s 2003 Income and Expense Report shows that13 of every rent dollar collected , owners spent  5714 cents on maintenance	and operations, leaving  4315 percent in net operating income , a very healthy16 return on investment.17 The large increases proposed now18 by the Board are not warranted and do not   reflect19 the severity of this City's affordable  housing20 crisis.21 This week, possibly today,  the22 State Legislature will vote on New York' s rent23 laws. In typical Albany fashion, we have put  off24 until the last possible minute negotiations on   an25 issue that will impact millions of  tenants.2 
2 Ult imately, it is a handful of upstate3 legislators, whose campaign coffers  receive4 substantial contributions  from landlord groups5 and who have no experience with or concern  for6 the particular plight of New York City  tenants,7 who will decide8 (Audience participation.)9	MS. APRIL HUMPHREY:	- - the fate10	of our rent and evict ion protections.11	The Legislature and Governor are12 poised to renew the laws as is without repeal  of13 decontrol provisions which have taken  nearly14 100,000 units out of regulation .15 New York City' s housing crisis16 exists here, in New York City, not upstate.  There17 is no rational reason that upstate  legislators18 are allowed to make decisions regarding  this19 important local issue - -20 (Audience participation.)21 MS. APRIL HUMPHREY:	to which22 their only connection is the money they  receive23 from the landlord lobby.24 The fate of rent regulations25 should rest here in New York City, not in  the
2 hands of these legislators.3 As the Board appointed by  the4 Mayor of New York City to study rent regulat ions5	in this City, I urge you to call on the Mayor  to6 ask the Legislature for home rule on  decisions7 relat ing to the City' s housing crisis. Only when8 the Urstadt Law is repealed and the City can  make9 its own policy decisions regarding our  housing10 crisis will we have a system that  truly11	protects - -12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Please wrap13 up.14 MS. APRIL HUMPHREY:	- - tenants,15 safeguards affordable housing and supports  the16 rich diversity of this great  City.17 Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me read21 the next several names.22 The next speaker is Avi  Siev.23 After Mr. Siev is John Marsh. After Mr. Marsh   is24 Joseph Chandrauti or Chandrauti Joseph, I 'm not25 sure which is which. Then Lillian Catterina,  then12 
2 Gertrude Schneider.3 Let me indicate that there  are4 no more green pieces of paper which  would5 represent owners . So if there are any owners in6 the audience, if you want to sign up and  speak,7 you have to go back upstairs, get their name,  and8 we' ll bring the green sheet down.9 The next speaker is Mr. Avi10 Siev .11	MR. AVINADAV SIEV:	My name is12 Avi Siev. I am a property  owner.13 I would like to concentrate  on14 an opinion which I have heard that we don't  need15 any increase because the rents which we collect - 1617 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Speak into18 the mike.19 MR. AVINADAV SIEV:	Yes.20 - - because  the legal rents are21 already above market rates. And this is not  true.22 If this were so, then we wouldn' t need rent23 control at all by def inition .24 So there are some apartments25 where the legal rent is above the market rent ,17 
2 and usually these tenants get what we  call3 preferential	rent . Most of the apartments, the4 rent is below the market.5	Some apartments the rent is  much6 below the market. And these apartments are  the7 big problem.  These apartments,  f irst of all , if8 there is an increase, the increase there is  very9 small . If we get an increase which doesn' t keep10 with the expenses like what is proposed here,  the11 rise of expenses is 16 percent and the  increase12 is something like 8.5 for two years, it  means13 that we get in two years what the increase was  in14 one year.15 And the whole issue of market16 rent , that the market rent is lower or higher,17 has never come before. When the rents were  much18 below market , nobody came and said , oh, you,19 landlords, you get rents which are much  below20 market rent , why don' t we give you higher21 increase than the cost of  this.22 So that 's - - we cannot change23 suddenly the rule of the game . The rule of the24 game is there is an increase in expenses. We  have25 to get - - we have to get an increase in rent6 
2 which is proportional.3 The most important thing is  this4 longevity subject which was mentioned before.   In5 these apartments the tenants, the cheaper  the6 apartment , the more it is a bargain to the7 tenant , the more he is going to cheat and do all8 kinds of tricks not to leave the apartment. If  he9 dies, the landlord is not told about it , and the10 apartment  is given to somebody else.11 So something must be done  about12 this longevity problem.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 MR. AVINADAV SIEV:	Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	John Marsh.18 John Marsh. This is John Marsh,  right?19 MR. JOHN MARSH:	Yes . Thank you.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.21 MR. JOHN MARSH:	My name is22 John Marsh . I'm a computer consultant by  training23 and a lifelong resident of Peter  Cooper24 Village/Stuyvesant	Town.25 (Audience participation. )2 
  2 MR. JOHN MARSH:	Stuyvesant3 Town is the largest rent regulated community   in4 this State . It is home to more than 20,0005 people, housed in 11,250 apartments in  1106 buildings.7 Your recent vote of 8.5  percent8 is out of line with inflation, the cost of  living9 and the well - documented owner profits last year10 of 5.9 percent.11 This proposed  increase threatens12 to drive out the economic engine of New  York13 City, its middle  class. My home is - -  my14 community is home to crucial , hard- working New15 Yorkers like nurses, teachers and firef ighters.16 Many nurses that staff Hospital Row on  First17 Avenue live in Stuyvesant Town. If they  are18 forced to move, who will staff the  already19 critically understaffed emergency and operating 20	rooms?21 How will teachers be able  to22 live close enough to our schools to rise  early23 enough to ready the classrooms for our  children?24 And what about the  firefighter25 who must move to Suffolk County or New Jersey   to21 
2 find an af fordable home and now must battle a3 lengthy and exhausting commute instead of  just4 fires?5 In our community rent regulated6 tenants are already paying an average of $1100  to7 $1500 a month for their homes. For the past  ten8 years in a row previous Boards have voted  for9 raising rents well above inflation and  landlord10 profits.11 But Rent Guidelines Board12 increases are not the only source of rent  hikes13 that benefit landlords and adversely  affect14 working class New Yorkers. Owners also  receive15 permanent	increases in the form of a  vacancy16 bonus and Major Capital Improvements,  permanent17 increases that are applied to our  rent.18 Today 3500 of my neighbors  in19 Peter Cooper Village face a large MCI  retroactive20 to the year 2000 of close to $45 per room  for21 electrical rewiring. If approved , many would face22 a retroact ive charge as high as $4300 with an23 additional permanent  rent increase of $180 per24 month. For me that would amount to a 14  percent25 increase in my base rent and would be  folded2 
2 retroactively  into any increase that you might3 vote for on Thursday.4 It 's terrifying. Tenants are5 already faced with higher commuting costs,  sales6 taxes and income taxes. This is not the time   to7 further hurt hard working New  Yorkers.8 Mayor Bloomberg  and Honorable9 Board Members,	I call on you to roll back  rents10 or freeze them.11 (Audience participation.)12 MR. JOHN MARSH:	But for New13 York State do not increase  them.14 Thank you.15 (Audience participat ion.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Joseph17 Chandrauti or Chandrauti Joseph.18 Is he here?19 MS. CHANDRAUTI JOSEPH:	Good20 afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm happy  that21 you can give a listening ear to a small   property22 owner.2 3	My name is Chandrauti Joseph24 again and I live in Brooklyn and I own a nine -25 family building. And I would like all of you   to24 
2 listen to small property owners what we  are3 facing.4 The tenants are crying out and5 we are boiling because the tenants  - - okay,   we6 have apartment with tenants, and I would like  you7 to listen to this, because when they are  not8 paying their rent , they' re three months arrears9 and four months arrears, and you ask them,  they10 slam the phone at you, they tend not to speak  to11 you.12 You take them to court. You  have13 to wait five months and four months and  six14 months before you can get some money from them   or15 get them out of your apartment . It takes money16 and we are losing all the  time.17 In this period of this time  we18 still have to give them the same services as  with19 the other tenants that are  paying.20 So I would be really happy  if21 you are to look into this on our behalf .22 At the same time one and two  of23 them have come to rent an apartment and in  that24 same apartment ten people be living in  there25 using water that we have to pay a meter,  and2 
1	3002 everything is going up on our behalf .3 (Audience participation.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.5 MS. CHANDRAUTI JOSEPH:	Is6 going up on our behalf .7 I have nothing against the8 tenants, but , please, if they can look in, and I9 would  really appreciate  if you can - - we  can have10 our increases fairly on our side and their  side.11 Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 Lillian Catterina.14 MS. LILLIAN CATTERINA:	Good15 afternoon.16 I'm Lillian Catterina and a17 resident of Stuyvesant Town/Peter Cooper. This   is18 directed to the Rent Control  Board.19 New Yorkers are saying that  this20 is a let them eat cat administration. The  news21 media says that this meeting  is an exercise  in22 futility and you have already made up your  minds.23 Prove them wrong.24 (Audience participation.)25 MS.
