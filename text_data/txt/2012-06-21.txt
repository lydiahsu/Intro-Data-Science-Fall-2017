2 The purpose of these guidelines is3 to implement the public policy set forth  in4 Findings and Declarations of Emergency of the  Rent5 Stabilization Law of 19696 (§ 26 - 501 of the N. Y. C. Administrative Code) and in7 the Legislative Findings contained in the  Emergency8 Tenant Protection Act of 1974 ( L. 1974 c. 576 , 9	§ 4 [§ 2 ])10 The Rent Guidelines Board is  also11 authorized to promulgate rent guidelines for  loft12 units subject to Section 286 subdivision 7 of  the13 Multiple Dwelling Law.	The purpose of the loft14 guidelines is to implement the public policy  set15 forth in the Legislative Findings of Article 7 - C of16 the Multiple Dwelling Law ( Section 280 ).17 Dated June 21 st, 2012 , Jonathan18 Kimmel, Chair, New York City Rent Guidelines  Board.19 I would now like to open the  floor20 for a proposal.

2 MR. SCHLEIDER: Thank you to  the3 members of the board for their work this year  and4 to those concerned citizens attending this  meeting5 tonight.6 More affordable housing is needed,7 plain and simple.	More affordable is needed.	More8 affordable housing is needed just to replace  the9 conversion of rent stabilized rental apartments  to10 ownership apartments. And the pace of  conversion11 will increase as owners are forced to  subsidize12 rising real estate taxes, constant double- digit13 increases in water and sewer  costs.14 More affordable housing is needed15 just to replace the rent stabilized units lost  to16 deregulation.	And the pace of deregulation will17 increase as owners struggle to meet  rising18 insurance costs and unfunded public mandates.	More19 affordable housing is needed, plain and  simple.20 And right now thousands of21 affordable units are being built in the City with  a22 mix of public and private funding.	Various23 rezoning initiatives alone have produced more  than24 3 , 300 affordable homes in concert with Mayor25 Bloomberg' s sweeping affordable housing productionROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 initiatives.	These are all good things.	More3 affordable housing is needed.4 ( Audience Participation.)5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But what was6 missing this year was testimony from  Borough7 Presidents, State Legislators, City Councilmembers8 regarding their efforts to produce more  affordable9 housing.	The elected officials all cited the  weak10 economy and the burden that rents place on  some11 tenants - no solutions to the day- to- day problems12 maintaining the physical health of aging  rental13 housing stock.	No solutions to the long- term14 problem of capital investment to preserve  the15 rental housing stock.16 The elected officials only cite17 the weak economy and the burden that rents place  on18 some tenants.	They all call for a zero  rent19 increase just this one time but this  deceptively20 simple one- shot deal would complicate a difficult21 situation.22 So how do we get to a  generally23 affordable rent increase?	The board' s data this24 year shows that operating costs increased again  and25 even though mortgage rates are historically  low,ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 the number of distressed properties still  is3 problematic.	Clearly low interest rates and prior4 rent increases have not been sufficient to  lessen5 the burden.6 And indications are that operating7 expenses are continuing to escalate higher.	It' s a8 dire situation and tenants need to share  the9 burden.10 The vast majority of landlords,11 and this year we heard testimony from as many  small12 landlords as from tenants, this large number  of13 landlords own small buildings, about 40 percent  of14 the regulated rental housing stock is in  buildings15 with less than 11 units and they struggle to  keep16 their property from deteriorating.17 These are the gatekeepers of  the18 existing affordable housing stock. These19 gatekeepers are the private citizens that the  City20 has forced to shoulder at public cost with  higher21 real estate taxes, water and sewer charges  and22 dozens of administrative fees and a constant  stream23 of unfunded public policy mandates without24 commensurate rent increases.25 The rapidly escalating fuel, oil,ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 water and sewer, electricity, administrative and3 maintenance costs are a day- to- day reality.	And4 the cost of operating affordable rent  stabilized5 housing keep going up year after  year.6 The findings of the City Council7 in enacting the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969  and8 the State Legislature adopting the Emergency  Tenant9 Protection Act of 1974 , clearly established that10 fair and generally affordable rents are a  primary11 objective of these laws.12 So how do we get to a  generally13 affordable rent?	How do you make it so it' s14 equitable?	Yes, there are at- risk tenants.	No one15 ignores that reality.	And tenants and landlords16 need more programs like the SCRIE to  provide17 assistance to our elderly tenants at risk  of18 falling behind in their rent.	We need more19 programs like SCRIE to finally recognize  and20 provide better rent increase relief to  our21 non- senior citizens and disabled tenants on fixed22 incomes.23 The legislature needs to expand24 SCRIE program eligibility by increasing income25 thresholds to include a larger percentage of  ourROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756

2	at- risk tenants.3
Our legislators provide subsidy
4 programs and pass zoning initiatives to create  new5 neighborhoods with affordable housing.	Why not6 help those at- risk households who' ve spent many7 years in their old neighborhoods where the  tenants8 and friends and their roots are?9 We need programs to provide rent10 relief.	To preserve the rent stabilized housing11 stock, we need long- term government programs, not a12 one- shot deal at the owners' expense and the13 elected officials won' t do anything to help those14 tenants at risk if a zero or low increase is   passed15 because then our elected officials are off the  hook16 for another year.17 The elected officials shift their18 responsibilities to the landlords and the  elected19 officials don' t hear the bigger message.	Stop the20 battle between the landlord and the tenant  by21 actually helping the tenant meet the rent.	Tenants22 and landlords together need long- term programs, not23 a one- shot deal.24 This board can help bring the25 message to elected officials that owners  andROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 tenants need their help, that owners and  tenants3 need long- term assistance, not a one- shot deal and4 owners and tenants need their help and owners  and5 tenants need long- term assistance.6 Additionally, the message to7 elected officials that unfunded public  policy8 mandates put upon the landlord are not fair  and9 need be addressed.	With your help, we can tell  the10 elected officials to completely think  issues11 through, to think issues through towards a  real12 solution and not pander or defer  their13 responsibilities for yet another year.14 So the question to the board  is15 simple.	How do you make it work so it' s  equitable?16 No one on this board denies there are some  tenants17 one paycheck away from hardship.	There are some18 tenants in desperate need of assistance to  merely19 make ends meet. That there are some tenants  who20 simply cannot afford any increase.	This is of21 concern to the board but we are powerless  to22 address it.	No one on this board  ignores23 compelling testimony from tenant advocates that24 housing affordability is a critical concern  for25 some tenants.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 However, tenant advocacy groups3 recognize that four out of five tenants can  afford4 to share the burden.	Four out of five tenants can5 afford to share the burden of higher real  estate6 taxes.	Four out of five tenants can afford  to7 share the burden of higher water and sewer  charges,8 unpredictable fuel costs and dozens  of9 administrative fees.	And four out of five  tenants10 can afford to share the burden of a constant  stream11 of unfunded public policy mandates without12 commensurate rent increase formula.13 Four out of five tenants can14 afford to share the burden and subsidize the  low15 rents for at- risk tenants.16 As such, and as a message to  the17 elected officials to do their job and not  shift18 responsibility onto the largest provider of19 affordable housing, based on the RGB staff  reports,20 invited testimony and testimony heard at  public21 hearings, the owner members move for a five  percent22 increase for a one- year renewal lease and a  nine23 percent increase for a two- year renewal lease.24 Additionally, minimum guideline25 increase where the most recent vacancy lease  wasROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 executed six or more years prior to the date of   the3 current renewal lease under this Order, a  minimum4 rent increase at the greater of five percent or  $ 505 for a one- year renewal lease and a minimum rent6 increase at the greater of nine percent or $ 90  for7 a two- year renewal lease to be adopted in this8 year' s guideline.9 A vacancy allowance, five percent10 in addition to whatever other vacancy allowance  is11 allowed under applicable law.12 Sublet allowance, ten percent.13 Special adjustments under prior14 Orders are to be continued.15 And a special guideline for16 decontrolled units at the greater of 100  percent17 above maximum base rent or the fair market rent  as18 established by HUD, adjusted for whether  the19 tenants pay their own gas and/ or electric charges20 as part of their rent.	And such gas and/ or21 electric charges are accounted for by the New  York22 City Housing Authority.23 Thank you, Mr. Chair.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.25 Schleider.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756

 2 Thanks for coming out.3 I' d like to also say good evening4 to our Chair, Mr. Kimmel, to my colleagues on  the5 Rent Guidelines Board and to our staff,  good6 evening and also, thank you for all the hard  work7 that you put in this  year.8 If there ever was a time  that9 there should be a rent freeze, I think so --   I10 think the time is now, this year -- a rent   freeze.11 ( Audience participation.)12 MS. HOLDER:	New York City is a13 city of renters, millions of renters.	Almost 7014 percent of New Yorkers rent their housing  and15 approximately 45 percent of renter households  in16 New York City are rent stabilized with a  vacancy17 rate of 2 . 63 percent.18 These rent stabilized renters and19 their families have a median household income  of20 $ 37 , 000 a year and a median gross rent of $ 1 , 160 .21 Rent stabilized renters and their families endure  a22 median gross rent to income ratio of 35 . 2 percent 23	in 2011 .24 The 2011 Housing Vacancy Survey25 reported that rent stabilized tenants are  theROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 tenants facing the highest financial burden with  a3 median gross rent to income ratio of 35 . 2 percent.4 This is the highest ratio in the history of  the5 Housing Vacancy Survey.	Meaning -- meaning a6 majority of rent stabilized tenants are not able  to7 afford their apartments based on the HUD  benchmark8 for housing affordability.9 The 2008 HVS reported it at  only10 30 -- well, not only, but at a lower amount of 31 . 711 percent. That kind of increase in the ratio  over12 only three years from 31 . 7 percent to 35 . 2 percent13 is enormous and in terms of its impacts on  tenants.14 This is shocking.15 And we, the Rent Guidelines Board,16 have contributed to the staggering statistics.	We17 are partially responsible.	We keep hearing --18 ( Applause.)19 MS. HOLDER:	-- we keep hearing20 that there' s nothing that we can do.	There' s21 something that we can do and I want my  colleagues22 on the board today to do  something.23 Furthermore, a third of rental24 households pay more than 50 percent of  their25 household income in gross rent.	Although theROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 owner/ advocates -- the owner/ advocates would have3 everyone believe that rental subsidies are4 plentiful, we know that 84 percent of low  income5 tenants do not have assistance or a subsidy  through6 Section 8 .7 This board' s failure to respond to8 clear data over the past few years borders  on9 extreme and profound neglect.	The board' s failure10 to acknowledge and address excessive compensation11 for owners in the 2008 and 2009 period,  when12 unemployment soared and incomes plummeted, is13 precisely why rent to income ratios  have14 skyrocketed and this board has utterly ignored  the15 fact that during recessions rents decline or  remain16 flat.17 These rent regulated renters and18 their families - and they are who this board  is19 charged to consider when making critical  decisions20 about the Rent Guidelines Board - this year  the21 stakes are too, too high.	And, again, we have to22 assume responsibility for our role in causing  the23 dramatic increase of rent burdens to  these24 families.25 The Community Service SocietyROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 issued a report yesterday entitled, " Making the3 Rent."	Did you see it in The New York Times --   I4 mean, in The New York  Daily News?	Did you see the5 report that the Daily News had -- The New  York	6 Daily News reported about this report  entitled,7 " Making the Rent" before and after the recession?8 Rent pressures on New York  City9 tenants, 2005 through 2011 , we' re talking about10 this period and this is what  it reported.	The11 report says that rent levels rose  persistently12 throughout the six- year period during good economic13 times or bad, out pacing the income gains made  by14 low income tenants.15 Median contract rents rose by 2516 percent, overtaking a net income gain of only  1717 percent.	And among the poor, rent burdens18 escalated from 60 to 65 percent  of income.	The19 proportion paying 50 percent or more of  income20 spiked from 66 to 80 percent.	Median rents have21 been consistently rising since 2005 whether  the22 local economy was thriving or receding while  median23 income -- household incomes flattened or  declined24 after 2008 .25 Though and through 2008 , duringROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 relatively good times, rents increased in  tandem,3 more or less with rising household  incomes.4 However, in the post recession economy,  following5 2008 , incomes and rent began to diverge as6 continuing rent escalation outpaced a  significant7 falloff in tenant incomes.8 David Jones, the CEO and  President9 of the Community Service Society, had a  wonderful10 opinion piece in The New York Daily News where  he11 -- he asked that this board vote for a rent   freeze.12 And, again, the Community Service13 Society evaluating what' s going on with low income14 New Yorkers, low income New Yorkers who are in  rent15 regulated units, them and their families are  who16 this board are charged to  consider.17 We need to be honest and  address18 and make a correction in our vote  this year.	In19 recent years, guideline increases have been20 excessive and over compensated owners.	This board21 has consistently over estimated projected owner22 income and operating costs compared to the  actual23 increases later reported in owner surveys.24 For instance, in 2007 , the Rent25 Guidelines Board projected a 7 . 1 percent increaseROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 in owner costs against an actual increase of 5 . 23 percent.	And in 2010 , the projected increase was4 5 . 5 percent against an actual increase of . 95 percent.6 Recent increases in local property7 tax levels account for some of the upward  cost8 pressures on owners and resulting rent increases  on9 tenants.	And consider this, and this is what  we10 know about when these types of things happen  with11 local taxes, we know that they' re passed on to12 renters.13 A new study by the Furman  Center14 for Real Estate and Urban Policy of New  York15 University released in April of the year,  explained16 just that.	The report explained that the high  rent17 that renters and their families have been paying  is18 probably inflated even more than it should be  due19 to tax -- City tax policy that strongly  favors20 homeowners over renters.	And the problem according21 to the Furman Center is, " radically different tax22 treatment of equally valued properties."	We know23 this.24 And large apartment buildings,25 including any property with more than three  unitsROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 where most renters live, yes, where most  renters3 live, are taxed at more than four times  the4 effective rate of smaller one to three- family homes5 where most homeowners live.6 This is all according to  the7 Furman Center' s report.	So they say, quote, the8 Furman Center report says, " The tax code9 effectively requires renters to subsidize  owners10 even though the demographic and social  economic11 characteristics of the two groups suggest  that12 renters already have a harder time meeting  their13 housing costs," the Furman Center study  reports.14 The disparity is so stark  that15 high rises in New York are taxed at nearly  the16 highest effective rate of large metropolitan  areas,17 just after Detroit, and the owners of smaller,  one,18 two, three- family homes are taxed near the bottom.19 According to this study, 1 , 636 , 02320 rental units in New York fall into the higher  tax21 class.	Those renters are poorer and more likely  to22 be renters of color than those who inhabit  the23 393 , 673 units in the lower taxed buildings.24 The effective property tax rate in25 Washington Heights and Inwood, for example,  twoROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 neighborhoods of color, dominated by persons  of3 color, in northern Manhattan where the  housing4 stock is mostly large buildings, averages 4 . 35 percent as opposed to Park Slope, a neighborhood  in6 Brooklyn with more restored brownstones and lots  of7 homeowners, where the effective tax rate  averages8 . 9 percent.9 As CSS quite clearly stated, it  is10 fair to say that the rental industry has shared  far11 less pain as a result of the wrenching  recession12 than have its lower income tenants.13 Also, we know that any  increased14 costs, like local taxes, are considered by  this15 board and passed on ultimately, to the  renter.16 In light of these factors and  the17 ongoing employment crisis and under employment18 crisis that many low income New Yorkers face  and19 just out of fundamental fairness, I propose a  rent20 freeze.21 Chair.22 ( Applause.)23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Ms.24 Holder.25 Is there a second?ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756

2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair, I -- I3 read the CSS report and there are things in  there4 that -- that owners do agree with and make note   of5 and, especially, that the CSS urges New York  State6 to reform its circuit break of real estate  property7 tax credits, provide significant relief to  low8 income renters bearing high rent burdens in  New9 York City and throughout the  State.10 That said, and it' s been11 recognized that real estate taxes are a  significant12 component of the expense profile and unless  there13 is some property tax relief for owners, this  board14 cannot, in good conscience, ignore the realities  of15 the expense push and cost push that impact  rent16 stabilized housing.17 Now, Ms. Holder is eloquent and18 she' s also made mention that landlords are in the19 business of providing housing.	Landlords are in20 the business of providing housing.	Costs have to21 be met and that said -- and even in the CSS   renter22 sub sample, it shows that 18 percent of --  percent23 of households with high burdens.24 Again, that' s less than one in25 five.	And as I said in my speech before, four  outROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756

It15 is a thankless task but one that members of  this16 board take very seriously.	I would be remiss if  I17 did not thank them for their hard work,  dedication18 and sincerity that they have brought to  this19 process.20 I would also like to thank the  RGB21 staff for their tireless efforts in producing  the22 reports on which the foundation of the board' s23 decisions are based each years -- each  year.24 The RGB research is supplemented25 by data presented to the board by its  members,ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 State and City agencies, government officials  and3 housing professionals, all of which are  invaluable4 resources, used for the task at  hand.5 ( Audience participation.)6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And, finally, I7 would like to thank the members of the public  who8 come to testify before this board at our two  public9 hearings this year.	Each year we hear honest and10 passionate testimony from tenants struggling to  pay11 the rent and from owners who feel that they  will12 not be able to keep pace with rising  expenses.13 The testimony does not fall on14 deaf ears and it truly impacts the decisions  made15 by this board. As Chair, I assume  the16 responsibility of working toward a result that  will17 inevitably prove to be difficult for all  those18 affected by the decisions of this  board.19 ( Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	However, it is21 important to keep in mind that this board does  not22 have the power to cure all the ills of this  system.23 We cannot make owners whole for expenditures  that24 they are forced to make under the law and we   cannot25 make owners whole on the backs of the  tenants.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 Yes, it is true that there  are3 tenants who can easily afford the increases  we4 adopt but there are many living on fixed,  limited5 income for whom every dollar is counted and  there6 is little room for increases.7 Clearly there is a cost to  being8 an owner and there is a cost to being a   tenant.9 All too often the problems associated with  these10 rising costs land on the shoulders of this  board.11 We struggle to make our decisions as relevant  as12 possible to the areas that we  impact.13 Unfortunately, the system14 inevitably results in two innocent bystanders  being15 most negatively impacted; the marginal owner  and16 the poor tenant.17 Elected officials have come before18 us and asked for no increases in prior years  when19 costs were higher. And this year when the  price20 index is under three percent, several  have21 recognized the need for some sort  of increase.	I22 ask these same officials to implement  legislation23 that will extend more rent subsidies to those  who24 qualify.25 Such programs as SCRIE, DRIE  andROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 Section 8 help to meet the needs of both  tenants3 and owners. Extending these programs to  include4 more of the population will go a long way to   giving5 relief to those who struggle the most.	And, quite6 honestly, make our job more equitable and  just.7 After considering the commensurate8 rent adjustments calculated by the RGB staff  and9 balancing these calculations with relevant data10 regarding housing affordability as well as11 listening to testimony of advocates on both  sides,12 I now propose the following rental  adjustments:13 I move to adopt the language  of14 apartment and loft Order 44 as read into the  record15 at this meeting.16 And I further move to adopt  the17 explanatory statement and findings for Order  No.18 44 , substantially in the form submitted by staff to19 the board as of June 21 st, 2012 and to be  modified20 by the RGB staff after this meeting to reflect  the21 adopted rental adjustments, as well as to  include22 the memos which are in the members' folders  at23 tonight' s meeting.24 ( Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And, finally, IROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 move to adopt the following rental adjustments  for3 rent stabilized apartments and lofts:4 Apartments, one- year renewal5 lease, two percent or $ 20 , whichever is greater.6 Two- year renewal lease, four7 percent or $ 40 , whichever is greater.8 Sublet allowance of 10 percent.9 No vacancy allowance is permitted10 except as provided by Sections 19 and 20 of  the11 Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1997 .12 Lofts, I propose a one- year13 increase period -- one- year increase period, two14 percent or $ 20 , whichever is greater.15 Two- year increase period, four16 percent or $ 40 , whichever is greater.17 Vacant loft units, no vacancy18 allowance is permitted under this  Order.19 Therefore, except as otherwise provided in  Section20 286 Subdivision 6 of the Multiple Dwelling Law,  the21 rent charged to any tenant for a vacancy  tenancy22 commencing on or after October 1 , 2011 and on  or23 before September 30 th, 2012 , may not exceed the24 base rent referenced above plus the level  of25 adjustment permitted above for increased periods.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756

CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I' m sorry, Ms.MS. HOLDER:	Yes.	On the issue
 5 of the supplemental that' s been proposed, I' m6 alarmed by this board' s lack of understanding and7 concern for the dire straits of the vast  majority8 of rent stabilized tenants.9 All the supplemental increases is,10 is simply a poor tax.	Fifty percent of poor rent11 stabilized tenants would be affected by this  type12 of supplemental.	And when we say " poor," poor is13 below 100 percent of the federal poverty  threshold,14 that' s $ 17 , 552 for two adults and a child.15 Fifty- three percent of the near16 poor would be impacted and devastated by this  type17 of poor tax.	The near poor is defined as  10018 percent of the federal poverty -- 100 to 200  --19 it' s 100 and below 200 percent of the poverty20 threshold and that for two adults and a child is 21	$ 35 , 104 .22 And by this type of  supplemental,23 44 percent of middle income tenants and  their24 families will be -- be impacted.	The middle income25 is 200 to below 400 percent of the federal  povertyROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756

I don' t understand why we can' t
4 stay away from a poor tax.	When you look at who5 are in these units that are going to be impacted,  I6 appreciate all the work that this board has  done.7 I really do appreciate the candor which the  public8 members have engaged my colleague, Brian Cheigh  and9 I this year but, really, this is just  devastating10 and it' s just so much that these households just11 cannot continue to bear.12 We' re not powerless in addressing13 this and I know we cannot cure all the ills but   we14 can make sure that these folks, our community,  the15 clients of my organization, the Legal Aid  Society,16 so many folks who actually are making New  York17 work, they' re the heart and bone of our City.18 Please let' s not burden them with19 this -- this supplemental or what we know as   the20 poor tax.21 Thank you.22 ( Applause.)23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.

We never17 see, for example, owners of the largest  apartments.18 I think that everyone has tried to represent  those19 that they are attached to as well as they  can.20 The overall objective of the Rent21 Stabilization Program is to provide housing  for22 teachers, policemen, nurses.	As one of the Council23 representatives pointed out to us the other  day,24 the artists, whether they be in the theater, art  or25 dramatic art, that are so much a part of New   York.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 I think that it is time for us  to3 recognize that rather than simply a fight for  low4 income tenants, which I' m all in favor of, this5 requires a different fight. It requires a  mechanism6 that works.	This mechanism is not working.	One7 size does not fit all and we all know  that.8 ( Audience participation.)9 MS. ADAMS:	Now we can continue to10 pretend that this is the mechanism for  addressing11 the needs of low income housing.	We can pretend12 that this is the mechanism which addresses  the13 needs of owners, whether they are small owners,  say14 if Courtney and I decided to buy a brownstone  and15 we were going to rent out some apartments, there' s16 no way in the world that we can compete with you   or17 some other owner who buys 5 , 000 units.	We can' t18 negotiate.	So this mechanism is broken.19 Some of the elected officials  who20 have come before us have said as much and  have21 indicated their willingness to try to come up  with22 another mechanism.	I, personally, was very, very,23 very disappointed last year when the  legislation,24 which established this as a way to decide on   rent,25 was up for renewal.	And I said, oh, this is  goingROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 to be the chance to make some of the changes  that3 need to be made.	It was not.4 I don' t think that the Chairman or5 the staff director was even called or  inquired6 about how this program was working.	We received7 testimony from a number of New York City  government8 departments, most of them are doing better, but  all9 of them will acknowledge that there is a  problem10 with enforcement, enforcement that would make  the11 provision of decent housing for all New  Yorkers12 much easier.13 Again, not to go on because  I14 don' t want to take up an awful lot of time to  say15 this but it is my view and of a lot of the   public16 that I talked to that this mechanism, like all  too17 many in our democracy, is  broken.18 ( Audience participation.)19 MS.

As well, I' d like to thank Andrew14 Mc Laughlin, the Executive Director of the Board,15 his staff, especially Brian Hoberman and  Danielle16 Burger for their work on behalf of the  board.17 The members of this board are18 required to work within the statutory  rules19 governing the RGB, namely Section 26 . 5 . 10 of the20 New York City Administrative Code.	Those rules21 require us to consider not only the  matters22 affecting tenants but also the cost to landlords  to23 operate buildings in New York City in  the24 determination of rent increases.25 In furtherance of theirROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
2 obligations, members of this board spend many  hours3 -- excuse me, many hours listening to  testimony4 from public officials, tenants and landlords5 reviewing reports and data prepared by the board' s6 staff and considering all the materials  presented7 to them.8 Our board members are highly9 conscientious and deliberative and take  the10 responsibilities very seriously.	I bring this up11 as a response to a statement made by City   Council12 Speaker Christine Quinn on the steps of City Hall  a13 number of weeks ago.14 ( Audience participation.)15 MR. SCHEINBERG:	Speaker Quinn16 called this board a kangaroo court.	This abject17 name calling is entirely unwarranted, is  without18 foundation and serves to de- legitimize this board.19 If Ms. Quinn does not like how this board  operates,20 then she is free to try to change the  laws21 governing our duties.	Until then, however, we are22 compelled to comply with the laws governing  the23 legal framework under which we operate.24 I call on Speaker Quinn and  other25 public representatives to tone down the acerbity  ofROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756
