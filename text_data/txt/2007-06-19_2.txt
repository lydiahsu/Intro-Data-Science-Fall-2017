2	$800 - - approximately $880 a month at this point.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.4 MR. THOMAS SIRACUSE:	And most of5 the rent control tenants in Manhattan, in my6 neighborhood, are paying over $1,000 a month.	And7 that' s on the West Side.8 (Audience participation.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.10 MR. THOMAS SIRACUSE:	Now, what is11 - - now that I've given you my personal figures,12 what is your net profit?13 (Audience participation.)14 MR. THOMAS DIANA:	What is my net15 profit?16 MR. THOMAS SIRACUSE:	Yes.	Because17 I happen to know that it cost to maintain an18 average apartment $400 a month, to maintain19 MR. THOMAS DIANA:	$400?20 MR. THOMAS SIRACUSE:	Yes. To21 maintain that apartment.22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:But this is not23a - -24MR. THOMAS DIANA:$400?25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:If the two of
2 you want to debate, go debate up there.3 Council Member Sears.4 (Audience participation.)5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Council Member6 Sears.7 (Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Welcome. Welcome.9 (Laughter.)10 COUNCIL MEMBER SEARS:	It's all11 right.	I've attended many.	That's good.12 Okay.	I have just a brief13 testimony.	Well, I have just a brief testimony so14 maybe you can hear what I have to say for just a15 moment.16 A VOICE:	Speak into the mike.17 COUNCIL MEMBER SEARS:	I will now.18 I will now.19 I just want to - - I'm going to read20 my testimony and mind you, these are my21 prescription glasses. I left the others in the22 case.23 And then I would just like to24 expand, which is not in my testimony, on two25 issues that, one issue in particular that I heard
2	addressed in one of the previous speakers.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.	Go ahead.4 COUNCIL MEMBER SEARS:	All right.5 I want to thank Chair Markus and6 Board members of the New York City Rent Guidelines7 Board for your consideration of the testimonies8 you heard today and of mine.9 For too long New York City has seen10 its stock of affordable housing shrink leaving11 middle and lower income families with little12 choice, if any, in finding safe and affordable13 housing across the City.14 Queens has been particularly15 affected by this trend as seen through overcrowded16 housing, dangerous and illegal improvised17 dwellings, and the loss of affordable housing.18 Many landlords in New York City have19 been given the opportunity to raise rents while20 not providing - and I've seen it - while not21 providing adequate or safe housing to their22 tenants.23 The Rent Guidelines Board, we' re24 asking you take steps to curb this trend and to25 disallow those landlords that maintain buildings
2 in violation of the law from increasing rents.3 Those that - -4 (Applause.)5 COUNCIL MEMBER SEARS:	Those that6 do not provide safe housing should not be allowed7 the benefit of raising rents.	To continue to8 allow New York City and Queens and actually the9 City of New York - because we are middle, lower10 income families - the Rent Guidelines Board must11 not allow an increase in a one-year rental lease12 of more than two percent or more than four percent13 if it's for two-year renewal lease.14 The proposed renewal adjustments15 leave too much room for a disproportionate and16 unaffordable increase in rents and I must urge the17 Board to only consider the lower threshold.18 In conclusion I wish to say that my19 colleagues and I in the Council of the City of New20 York have taken measures to ensure portions of New21 York City' s affordable housing stock remains22 intact.23 This year I and my colleagues, we24 have sponsored two local laws that encourage25 owners of Mitchell-Lama housing to stay in the
2 program and continue to provide affordable housing3 to all New Yorkers.4 I and the Speaker have also5 supported the renter's rebate program that would6 have provided lower income renters with additional7 financial assistance.8 In May of this year I held a town9 hall meeting with Speaker Quinn and resident of10 the Lefrak community.	At this meeting I heard11 from concerned renters who feared being unable to12 afford their rent and being forced to leave their13 community.14 The Rent Guidelines Board must make15 sure that the members of our communities are not16 forced out because of high rents and the lack of17 affordable housing.18 This is an opportunity for the Rent19 Guidelines Board to make a positive impact on the20 communities of New York City.21 I ask that lease renewal adjustments22 not exceed the minimum proposed increase and the23 Board take into consideration deteriorating stock24 of affordable housing in New York City when making25 their final decisions.
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3 You said you had two other points;4 you want to make those points?5 (Applause.)6	COUNCIL MEMBER SEARS:	Yes.7 What I want to do, there are two8 things: I heard the word voucher mentioned. The9 fact that you have to take into consideration that10 the vouchers are not being accepted by landlords.11 And I won't go into the reasons why. The Federal12 Government has also reduced their vouchers. New13 York City still has a bank, but there are no new14 vouchers coming down the pike.15 We had been very negligent in this16 City and I speak that as an elected official17 representing the entire City and the 25th18 District.	We have been very negligent in19 providing affordable housing . It has been very20 slow.21 We have Mitchell-Lamas as a very22 good example of what's happening. When they were23 built, they were built with a reason of affordable24 housing and to maintain that status as affordable25 housing.
2 The Mitchell- Lamas, you read in the3 paper, are now looking to go on the open market.4 And remember, when that happens, we lose people5 who can stay in those apartments and pay the rent.6 So we are actually having people to be displaced.7 And what is really very sad is that there's no8 place to put them because there is no affordable9 housing that is available throughout the City.10 Now - -11 (Applause.)12 COUNCIL MEMBER SEARS:	Now, what do13 we do about that?	We all recognize - - and believe14 me, we do in the Council.	I serve on the Finance15 Committee. I'm on budget negotiating and numbers16 and the cost of things are not unknown to me.17 Good landlords - - landlords do have18 their increases. There is no question about it.19 And we have many good landlords and those20 landlords are very respectful of their tenants and21 they are very respectful of the rents that they22 charge.23 We have some very unfortunate24 landlords. And those landlords, quite frankly,25 don't care about the tenants.	And it means that
2 it is the Board' s responsibility, as difficult as3 it may be, to weed those landlords.4 Another issue that needs to be5 addressed is the MCI, the Major Capital6 improvements.7 Every time somebody gets new windows8 in a building - I've had that in some of those9 large complexes in my district - the cost of those10 windows never gets off their rent roll, ever,11 ever.12 (Applause.)13 COUNCIL MEMBER SEARS:	Now - - and14 believe me, I'm not here to grandstand, I'm just15 quoting you some facts.16 If those MCis were to be placed17 appropriately, meaning as the cost of windows, as18 an example, when it was paid for or taken off19 those rent rolls, perhaps a small increase would20 be more acceptable .	But what happens is they're21 not.	They go on forever.22 Now what happens?	Those windows23 don't last forever, all right. So they're paying24 for windows.	And if they have the good fortune to25 have longevity and live in those buildings for 20ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167521 Fifth Avenue, 17th floor, New York, New York  10175
1	1592 more years, they go through some other capital3 MCis.	It's not only that, it's a refrigerator.4 It's all of the appliances that come into those5 apartments.6 And I know that may be a state issue7 but it's of major concern. Because when I replace8 windows, I pay that bill and it's finished. I'm9	not paying it for ten or fifteen more years. Once10 the cost is over it's finished. That is not true11 with tenants. They have that MCI forever. That is12 a big problem. A big problem.13 (Applause.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 COUNCIL MEMBER SEARS:	Thank you16 very much.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you. We18 appreciate for your balanced testimony.19 COUNCIL MEMBER SEARS:	Thank you20 very much.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The most22 balanced we've heard today, I must say.23 Thank you.24 (Audience participation.)25 COUNCIL MEMBER SEARS:	Thank you.
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Alvin Doyle;3 Followed by Jennifer Ariata.4 Mr. Doyle are you - -5 Juan Martinez, the interpreter, Mr.6 Martinez needs an interpreter, okay.7 Mr. Doyle?8 MR. ALVIN DOYLE:	Yes.9 Yes, sir.	My name is Al Doyle .	I10 am the President of the Peter Cooper Village11 Stuyvesant Town Tenants Association.12 (Applause.)13 MR. ALVIN DOYLE:	And I'm a14 lifelong resident of Stuyvesant Town.15 I couldn't make last Tuesday' s16 meeting	'cause I had to work late so I came out17 here tonight.18 For many years Stuyvesant Town and19 Peter Cooper was the model of affordable, middle20 class housing in New York City. However, over the21 past fifteen years residents of Stuyvesant Town22 and Peter Cooper Village have been subject to23 numerous Major Capital Improvement rent increases.24 Our former owner, Met Life, has25 spent close to $200 million on property10 
1	1612 improvements for which we received permanent rent3 increases.	These rent increases are in addition4 to our normal lease renewal rent increases.5 In November 2006, Stuyvesant Town6 and Peter Cooper Village were sold for $5.47 billion. Since the sale was completed we have8 noticed some disturbing developments. Hundreds of9 our rent stabilized neighbors have received10 notices of non-renewals when it comes time to11 renew their leases.12 We understand the landlord' s desire13 to remove illegal tenants. However, this practice14 of sending these letters to a broad selection of15 legal rent stabilized tenants is disconcerting.16 Residents must spend time to answer a baseless17 allegation and in some cases, tenants are required18 to hire an attorney to protect their right.19 We are also seeing a noticeable20 turnover of the market rate apartments. In all 11021 buildings of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper22 Village, we see new tenants move in only to move23 out when faced with a lease renewal rate somewhere24 between 20 and 30 percent of their market rate25 rent.
1	1622 Deborah Van Amerongen, the3 Commissioner of the New York State Division of4 Housing and Community Renewal, told the New York5 State Senate Committee on Housing Construction and6 Community Development that the future of New York7 State and the future of affordable housing are8 inextricably linked.9 Commissioner Van Amerongen also10 testified that New York State has a Governor who11 understands that in order for New York to remain12 competitive and retain its unique economic and13 ethnic diversity, we must create and preserve14 affordable housing for low and moderate income15 families, seniors and the disabled.16 I think everyone will agree with the17 Commissioner and therefore, I respectfully ask for18 zero rent increases for this year.19 Thank you.20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 Jennifer Ariata?	Are you still23 here?	Jennifer?	She was actually the first24 person who was not signed up before.25 So Mr. Williams jumped ahead of her2

1	1642	Good evening.	My name is Helen Cech3 and I am a rent stabilized tenant living in4 Queens .5 Iwas born and raised in New York6 City . Went to school here. Worked here, basically7 lived here all my life .8 Working families like my parents,9 myself and many others have built this City into10 what it is today but now are in danger of being11 priced out of their apartments and made to feel12 unwelcome in their homes in their own City.13 I don't want to move out of my14 neighborhood as a result of unaffordable rent15 increases .	Iam now on a fixed income with a cost16 of living raise in the two percent area while17 landlords are asking for raises and increases to18 rents in the five to seven percent range is hardly19 an equitable arrangement .20 Landlords cite the increase in the21 cost of heating fuel as a valid reason for large22 increases in rents.	However, I believe that the23 last five to ten years of unseasonably warm24 winters has more likely left them with a surplus25 in their heating budgets .ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212- 840- 1167521 Fifth Avenue, 17th floor, New York, New York  10175
2 (Applause.)3 MS. HELEN CECH:	Tenants on the4 other hand have not received any rebates. The only5 proof to the contrary would be in their books,6 which landlords refuse to open for Rent Guidelines7 Board or public scrutiny. Gee, I wonder why.8 (Applause.)9 MS. HELEN CECH:	A recent news10 story - - a recent news story reported the death of11 a mother and her young child when a fire broke out12 in an illegal apartment. Why do families live in13 places like that?	Because there are not enough14 affordable apartments otherwise.15 If tenants get no relief from the16 burden of so many large rent hikes, I believe we17 will see a horrific increase in these types of18 incidents. I personally know of two cases where19 couples have left New York either to start a20 family or to be able to save enough to send their21 children to college mostly due to the high rental22 costs.23 Assistance programs such as Medicaid24 and food stamps, with which I am personally25 familiar, are predicated on maintaining a home. If
2 I can no longer afford to pay my rent, I will lose3 my doctors, my medicine and my food.4 I am asking the Rent Guidelines5 Board to vote on a zero percent increase so that6 my next apartment won' t be a cardboard box under a7 bridge thereby worsening the homeless problem.8 I thank you for your attention and9 please don't raise my rents.10 (Audience participation .)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question .13 MS. HELEN CECH:	If you do, if you14 do choose to raise my rent, I have to give you my15 keys now because I will not afford	be able to16 afford to stay in the City.17 Thank you.18 (Handing.)19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Adriene, do you21 have some questions?22 MS.

2MS. HELEN CECH:I live in3Sunnyside.4MS. HOLDER:And how long have you5	lived in Sunnyside?6 MS. HELEN CECH:	Over 27 years .7 MS. HOLDER:	And have you lived in8 your particular unit for that period of time?9 MS. HELEN CECH:	In this particular10 unit I've lived for 19 years.	And I've lived in11 the previous unit for - - in the same building12 complex, Phipps Houses.	I've lived there an13 additional eight years.14 MS . HOLDER:	Could you   tell me15 approximately, if you know, what the range of16 rents are in your building.17 MS. HELEN CECH:	Most of the rent18 controlled people have either passed away or been19 put into rehabilitation centers or nursing homes.20 There are a number of rent stabilized families in21 households.	The exact percentages I don't know.22 But they are systemically trying by neglecting23 repairs, forcing MCI increases, they're24 systemically trying to eliminate the rent25 stabilized base and go on the market rate and
  2 increase the rents.3 Plus, once the rents go into the4 market rate, nobody' s looking over their5 shoulders.	I have tried to get my sink fixed the6 entire 19 years I've lived in this apartment.7 They' ll snake it out two more days, bubbles coming8 up the sink again. I can hardly use my kitchen at9 all and this is how I'm forced to live. It's10 disgraceful.11 MS. HOLDER:	And would you mind12 telling us how much your rent is.	You don't have13 to if you're not comfortable with it.14 MS . HELEN CECH:	My share of the15 rent, I had to bring in someone	my share of the16 rent - -17 MS. HOLDER:	You have a roommate is18 what you're saying?19 MS. HELEN CECH:	Yes. I had to have20 a roommate 'cause I cannot afford it. It's more21 than my income would be.22 My rent, my portion of the rent is 23	over - - is $518.10.24 MS . HOLDER:	And how much is the25 registered rent in the apartment?ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC. , 212-840-1167521 Fifth Avenue, 17th floor, New York, New York  10175

HELEN CECH:	No.	It has14 recently turned to a corporation and their main15 concern is the bottom line.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So Phipps Houses17 sold the development; is that what you're  saying?18 MS. HELEN CECH:	No.	Once Mr.19 Phipps passed away, the  corporation20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, that was a21 hundred years ago.2 2	MS.

1	1702	MS . HELEN CECH:	when they3 they just decided to give the control over to the4 corporation and now it's bottom line dollar bills .5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay .	Thank6 you.7 (Applause.)8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Maria Ocasio, is9	that you, Maria? Hold on second .10	Romeo Ymalay, are you here?	Yes .11	Followed by Dorothy Williams .12 Go ahead .13 MS . MARIA OCASIO:	Good afternoon .14 My name is Maria Ocasio . And I'm a15 housing coordinator for a nonprofit community16 organization, Woodside On the Move here in Queens,17 coming here to talk about in representation of my18 tenants .19 We serve a lot of area here in20 Queens, Sunnyside, Woodside and part of Jackson21 Heights.	I have seen a lot of senior tenants come22 to my office complaining because the owner is23 increasing the rent with MCis.	There 's a lot of24 MCis that is happening and is been going on.25 Some of them have SCRIE and for that12 
2 part it's okay.	But some of them don't qualify3 and it's very hard for them to pay all those4 increases and besides that, to still to live and5 try to have a good quality of life.	It's not also6 that.7 I have a tenant that he was living8 with his uncle for 11 years. He's uncle move out9 to Columbia and because he' s already a senior and10 he wants to stay there.	Because it was his uncle,11 he wasn 't able to have succession rights so the12 owner evict him to court and a $700 rent monthly13 payment was increased to $2,050 .	Now the14 apartment is deregulated.	He doesn' t have nowhere15 to live.16 Like three days ago another lady17 came to my office.	She's a senior and she's18 living from SSI.	She's renting a bedroom because19 she cannot afford a rent payment for an apartment.20 And right now she has to move out because of the21 son of the primary tenant will move into the22 apartment and she doesn' t have anyplace to stay.23 How can I help them if there is no24 apartment outside for her that she can afford. And25 it's something that happen everyday in my office .2 
2 Some tenants receive a Section 83 voucher and which allow them to have an apartment4 for $950. There's no $950 bedroom apartment5 outside even for one person. So the six-month6 period that they have to find an apartment pass by7 and they lose the voucher. I have seen a lot of8 cases like that.9 This situation has to stop because I10 have seen a lot of people that like right now the11 lady that came three days ago, she's going to be12 on the street. She going to be on the street. I13 have no way to help her find an apartment and to14 even help her to get any subsidy for her to pay15 the rent .16 That' s what I have to say.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 Appreciate it.19 (Audience participation.)20 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have a22 question.23 MS . HOLDER:	Thank you for coming24 out this evening.	Appreciate your testimony.25 MS . MARIA OCASIO:	You're welcome.2 
2	MS. HOLDER:	You named the3 neighborhoods that you work in, Woodside.4 MS. MARIA OCASIO:	Sunnyside and5 Jackson Height.6 MS . HOLDER :	Right.7 When you look at the apartments in8 that neighborhood, when you think about if your9 the people who come into your office are being10 displaced and they're still trying to stay in11 those neighborhoods where they may have doctors or12 where their children go to school or where they13 have family and community ties, what are the14 apartments going for when they find themselves15 having to look again for housing in those16 neighborhoods?17 MS. MARIA OCASIO:	What they are18 looking for?19 MS. HOLDER:	You know, how much20 are the apartments renting for when people find21 themselves in the situation of having to look in22 those neighborhoods for apartments.23 MS . MARIA OCASIO :	There' s no24 apartment for them.25 MS. HOLDER :	What are the rents inROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC. , 212-840-1167521 Fifth Avenue, 17th floor, New York, New York  10175
2	those neighborhoods?3		MS. MARIA OCASIO:	The rent?	Well, 4	$1,081, $1,200, $1,500.	It's not going lower than5 that .6 MS . HOLDER:	Are those are for7 one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three - -8	MS. MARIA OCASIO:	One-bedroom9	apartment.10 MS . HOLDER :	One-bedroom11 apartments?12 MS. MARIA OCASIO :	Uh-huh.13 MS . HOLDER:	And where do you live?14 MS. MARIA OCASIO :	In Woodside .15 MS . HOLDER:	And are you a rent16 stabilized tenant?17 MS. MARIA OCASIO:	I have to rent a18 studio apartment in a private house because I19 cannot afford a rent stabilized  apartment.20 When I was looking for an apartment,21 the cheapest rent I found is $1,100 . I don't22 receive that monthly, even that monthly income  to23 pay that rent so I have to rent a small studio24 apartment which my rent is  $900 .	That 's it .25 That's all I can pay .
2	MS. HOLDER:	Thank you so much for3 your testimony this evening.4 MS . MARIA OCASIO :	You're welcome.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .6 (Applause.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Romeo Ymalay,8 representing Senator Duane .	Is that you, Romeo?9 Dorothy Williams; and10 I think I saw Council Member Jackson11 come in? Yes? You'll be third.12 Go ahead.13 MR . ROMEO YMALAY :	Hi .14 Good evening.	My name's Romeo15 Ymalay. I'm a legislative aid for Senator Tom16 Duane and I will be reading his testimony for the17 record.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay .19 MR . ROMEO YMALAY:	My name is Thomas20 K. Duane and I represent New York State' s 29th21 Senatorial District, which includes the Upper West22 Side, Hell's Kitchen, Greenwich Village, Chelsea,23 the East Side, Stuyvesant Town, Peter Cooper24 Village and Waterside Plaza.25 This mixed-income district is8 
2 composed largely of tenants, thousands of them3 rent stabilized, many of whom already allocate too4 high a percentage of their incomes to pay their5 rent.6 New York continues to be in a7 housing crisis with the affordable housing stock8 in our City rapidly dwindling.	According to the9 Rent Guidelines Board report entitled, "Changes to10 the Rent Stabilized Housing Stock in New York City11 in 2006, " there was a decrease of 6,02212 rent-stabilized apartments throughout the five13 boroughs.14 At the same time, the most recent15 New York City Department of Housing Preservation16 and Development Housing and Vacancy Survey found17 that the median income for rent stabilized18 households in New York City is $32,000 .	That's a19 reduction in real dollars of 5.6 percent since the20 last survey.	On the other hand, the median rent21 for a rent-stabilized apartment is $844, an22 increase of 8.2 percent over three years ago.23 Even worse, 28.8 percent of New York24 City' s households are now paying more than 5025 percent of their income for gross rent .
2 Meanwhile, the RGB's own studies3 show that landlords continue to make profits.4 Furthermore, landlords have greatly benefited from5 the State's vacancy decontrol law so they can now6 charge "sky's the limit'' rents on thousands of7 deregulated apartments.8 The Division of Housing and9 Community Renewal rent registration records10 indicate 9,983 units were deregulated in 200611 because of the decontrol law, an increase of eight12 percent from 9,272 in 2005.	And loopholes in13 State law, including allowances for phony14 demolitions and owner occupancy scams, permit15 landlords to empty buildings of rent regulated16 tenants whose former homes become fair game for17 exorbitant, non-regulated rents.18 Given these facts, it is absurd that19 the Board is even considering passing additional20 financial burdens onto tenants.	This year' s21 proposed rent increase of two to 4.5 percent for22 one-year and four to 7.5 percent for two-year23 leases would be an unfair and unnecessary hardship24 to many tenants still reeling from last year' s25 increases.2 
2 The tenants have invested their3 lives in our City and have improved our4 neighborhoods.	The Board should be proactive in5 preserving New York City' s affordable housing so6 that poor and middle class working people can7 continue to live - - to live here.8 Towards that end, I strongly urge9 you to impose an immediate freeze on rents for all10 apartments, lofts, hotels - -11 (Audience participation.)12 MR. ROMEO YMALAY:	- - rooming13 houses, single room occupancy buildings and14 lodging houses.15 The Board is meant to decide on rent16 increases based on the relative cost of17 maintaining and financing buildings, the available18 housing supply as defined by the vacancy rate, and19 the cost of living . If the Board bases its20 decision on these standards, rents should not be21 raised this year.22 If the Board votes to raise rents,23 the only reason would be to increase landlord24 profits, and doing so would effectively serve to25 further destabilize New York City's affordable2 
2 housing stock.3 Just to end, the importance of this4 vote cannot be overstated. The only acceptable5 outcome of this Board's vote is no rent increases.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you. Thank7 you.8 (Applause.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Dorothy10 Williams?	Dorothy, are you here?	Yes.	Is that11 you coming down?	Dorothy?12 (No response.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No.14 Council Member Jackson.15 COUNCIL MEMBER JACKSON:	Thank you.16 (Applause.)17 COUNCIL MEMBER JACKSON:	Good18 evening, Board members and let me thank you for19 the opportunity to come and testify out here in20 the great borough of Queens. I live in the great21 borough of Manhattan.22 I missed the opportunity when you23 were in Manhattan because I was involved in budget24 negotiations but I did not want to miss the25 opportunity to come before you before the final
2 vote .3 So I'm here today to try to give a4 little testimony on behalf of the 163,0005 constituents that I represent in Northern6 Manhattan .	So thank you for the opportunity.7 My name is Robert Jackson and I am8 the Chair of the New York City Council' s Education9 Committee and I also sit on the Housing &10 Buildings Committee.	And I represent the 7th11 Council District in Manhattan.	My District12 includes neighborhoods such as West Harlem,13 Morningside Heights, Hamilton Heights, Sugar Hill14 Washington Heights and Inwood.15 And every year I make it a point to16 come to the Rent Guidelines Board and speak on17 behalf of my constituents and the many people who18 depend on this Board to make even-handed decisions19 about a very important matter - their rent.20 And now the interesting thing about21 my district is that because it encompasses such a22 long stretch - from 123rd Street in Morningside23 Heights, all the north to the end of Manhattan,24 approximately 218th Street - it includes a variety25 of housing stock .2 
1	1812	I have market rate co-ops and3 condos.	I have private houses and I have HDFC4 co-ops. But the vast majority of the approximately5 160,000 people I represent are renters, and most6 of whom fall under the authority of this Board7 here.	And not only that, but you have to8 understand that the majority of the people that I9 represent, the average family earns only - - under10 $34,000 a year, the average family.11 And because I deal with such a12 variety of housing, I know that it can be a tricky13 subject to run a building "in the black. "	And my14 HDFC co-ops struggle to balance the books and keep15 maintenance charges down .16 So when landlords argue for17 increases based on costs, there is a certain logic18 to that appeal .	For example, I am aware that this19 winter the cost of home heating oil was at an all20 time high.	I also am aware that the costs have21 and will be "passed on to the tenants " by the new22 York City Rent Guidelines Board which allows23 landlords who can certify that they are24 "maintaining essential services" to make separate25 rent increase adjustments based on the yearlyROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC. , 212- 840- 1167521 Fifth Avenue, 17th floor, New York, New York  10175
2 prices up or down of fuel oil. And as a person3 that drives, you know what it is as far as the4 gas. Gas is just going up and up and up.5 But we must set some strong6 requirements for landlords to collect the7 guideline increases.	And it would be to prohibit8 landlords from collecting the guideline increases9 if there are five or more hazardous violations of10 record per unit.11 (Audience participation.)12 COUNCIL MEMBER JACKSON:	Landlords13 should not be permitted to increase rents without14 providing services or making repairs .15 No. 2, the proviso to bar collection16 of rent increases where owners have not registered17 all of the rent stabilized apartments with the New18 York state Division of Housing & Community19 Renewal.20 (Audience participation.)21 COUNCIL MEMBER JACKSON:	And as22 you know, that is required by law.	Landlords may23 not bypass rent regulations.	They are subject to24 the same enforcement of standards as tenants.25 The absence of such stringent proofROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212- 840-1167521 Fifth Avenue, 17th floor, New York, New York  10175
2 means more uncertainty for the constituents of my3 district and renters throughout New York City.4 It is way past time that DHCR, the Department of5 the Division of Housing and Community Renewal,6 to set some rules that govern rent increase7	applications.	No more blanket rent increases.8 Let individual landlords make their own cases for9 needs-based increases and state their10 justifications one by one.11 Let these "needs" stand the test of12 transparency.	And I've heard before many tenants13 and advocates say, open the books and let it be14 transparent.15 (Audience participation.)16 COUNCIL MEMBER JACKSON:	Mr. Chair,17 and members of the Board, the bottom line, as18 someone that has been in the city Council going on19 my 6th year, I'm in my last term of office, and20 the number one issue that effects the people that21 come into my two community offices	and one is22 on 144th Street and Convent Avenue and another23 community office is at 183rd and Fort Washington24 Avenue, the number one issue is housing25 complaints.8 
2 And I hear on a continuous basis how3 many of my constituents cannot afford the4 increases that are happening and they are being5 forced out of the community. I heard that on a6 continuous basis as their representative.7 So tonight I urge the Board to adopt8 no increase.9 (Audience participation.)10 COUNCIL MEMBER JACKSON:	Or if, in11 fact, this Board is going to recommend or adopt an12 increase, let it be at the low end of the proposed13 increases knowing that if you go to the high end,14 many of the people in here and many of the people15 that I represent will be forced out of their homes16 and then where are they going to go?17 And I don't want any landlords or18 owners to not be able to run their buildings in19 the red.	That should not happen also. But then20 transparency is extremely important.21 So I urge the Board to protect22 affordable housing by ensuring that regulations23 are applied and enforced and I would recommend no24 increase, or if any, at the low end of what is25 being recommended .2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3 COUNCIL MEMBER JACKSON:	Thank you4	very much.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 (Audience participation.)7 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have a9	question.	Council Member, question.10	Yes.11	MS . HOLDER:	Thank you for coming12 out to Queens, Councilman.13 COUNCIL MEMBER JACKSON:	Thank14 you. Queens is a beautiful borough.15 MS. HOLDER:	It is a beautiful16 borough.17 And thank you for your testimony and18 thank you for your service and your position with19 the City Council as well as a community leader .20 The Board has also had before it21 some proposals or the idea, the concept to22 actually look at the work that we do here not as23 being a one- size-fit all approach .	But we've had24 a proposal forwarded to us that says that if25 landlords actually own a building where there are12 
2 unregulated or market rent units, as well as3 regulated units, that perhaps in some cases, some4 of those landlords, depending on the mix, should5 not be entitled to increases .6 And how do you feel about that and7 the Board' s role in looking at the stock?8	COUNCIL MEMBER JACKSON:	Well, I9 don't - - I would say that clearly - to go back to10 the rent regulated tenant - they need to be11 protected as per the law .	And as far as if - - I12 believe that there is a certain amount of tenants13 that are decontrolled, apartments that are14 decontrolled, at a certain level the landlord is I15 guess charging whatever they deem appropriate, you16 know, above the decontrol that is $2,000 or more.17 And at a certain level it should be where if18 there' s a certain percentage of units in their19 building, maybe they should not have to charge any20 increase.21 So I don't know what that actual22 figure is, but I think that considering the fact23 that when they're decontrolled, landlords can24 charge whatever they want. At a certain level -25 maybe it's 50 percent of the units or maybe less.9 
2 I really haven' t determined that - they should not3 be able to charge any increase on the rent4 regulated tenants.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6	(Applause.)7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One more8	question.9	MS. CRUZ:	Would your viewpoint10 change if you were advised that Corporation11 Counsel has already given an opinion that, in12 fact, that is not within the scope of our13 authority to make those sorts of distinctions?14 COUNCIL MEMBER JACKSON:	Well , one15 thing is within the scope of your authority and as16 far as you may not be able to act, but you can17 surely recommend.	And recommendations sometimes18 are accepted even though you may not have the19 authority to make a decision.20 And so you do have landlords that21 come here and testify just like you have tenants.22 And so when you make a recommendation, hopefully23 some landlords will listen to the recommendations .24 And so I know that you may not be25 able to act legally within that authority. But one10 
2 thing is acting legally and another thing is to3 strongly recommend.4 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.5 COUNCIL MEMBER JACKSON:	You're6	welcome.7	MS. HOLDER:	Although for the8 record, I mean there' s differing opinions about9 that and the Board has some information on it.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good.11 COUNCIL MEMBER JACKSON:	And I'm12 not - -13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Our counsel is14 corporation Counsel though.15 COUNCIL MEMBER JACKSON:	Yes. And16 I'm not - - and I know that - - let me just - - I'm17 sorry.18 I know that Corp. Counsel gives19 opinions and all it is an opinion.	And unless20 there is actual law, court precedent that21 determines the actual law, it's Corp Counsel' s22 opinion.	And quite frankly, Corp. Counsel has23 given many opinions in which their opinion was not24 taken and/or determined that it was not the best25 opinion with respects to depending on what side of
2	the situation you were on.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That' s4 absolutely correct.5 Thank you.6 COUNCIL MEMBER JACKSON:	Thank you.7 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.8 (Applause.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker10 is Janet Henne;11 Followed by Maria Hincappy;12 Followed by Tom Church.13 Janet Henne, are you here?	Yes? No?14 Janet, you coming?	Yes, I see you.15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Maria Hincappy,17 are you here?18 MS. MARIA HINCAPPY:	Yes.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Tom Church?20 Okay.

1	1902 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good idea .3 (Audience participation.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Pull the mike5 down, please.	Great. Thank you, Janet.6 MS. JANET HENNE:	You're welcome.7 I believe this must be my seventh8 year of testifying and I've been trying to think9 about what I've accomplished.10 You are no longer insulting me,11 thank you, but you're insulting everybody else or12 many other people .13 And what you've accomplished, as far14 as I'm concerned, is making the City into a no15 neighborhood city. Our neighborhoods are gone. And16 that' s all the boroughs. We have very few left17 even in Queens.	You' re pushing out teachers,18 Policemen and Firemen, nurses and everybody else.19 And I'm sorry. And anyone else who works for an20 honest living.21 I know you're looking down your22 noses at everyone. This is why I didn't even want23 to stand up because you make me feel you're24 looking down on all of us and that's not very25 classy.
2	(Applause.)3 MS. JANET HENNE:	I've even heard4 you - - I consider that no class .	And class has5 nothing to do with how much money or how much6 education you have.	You either have it or you7 don't have it.8 And to me this is an economic9 apartheid and causing a brain drain. And you're10 taking no responsibility here.	I've been sitting11 here again and it's the government's fault. It's12 the Mayor' s fault. It's Albany's fault. It's13 everybody' s fault, but yet you make a decision and14 take no responsibility for it.15 (Applause.)16 MS. JANET HENNE:	And as I say,17 this is a brain drain.18 As an example, I had neighbors who19 have two babies and discovered led paint in their20 apartment .	They fought for almost a year to have21 it corrected and ended up going back to Israel22 making the choice of the danger of bombs and no23 led or living - - having their children grow up in24 led.25 My landlord is still fighting, still
2 refuses to give admission to HPD to remove the3 led.	And on top of it, he has moved another4 family in there with a child. This is all right.5 He deserves more money.	Of course, he deserves6 more money so he could buy - - he has billions to7 buy Mitchell-Lama. Let's help him.8 So now HPD has to go and sue him.9	Good, we should pay for that too.10 (Applause.)11 MS. JANET HENNE:	Glad you all12 agree.13 We know it's the people, the City of14 the small landlords or anyone else you feel are15 beneath you.	It's everyone.	So I also consider16 this economic apartheid .	And I really don't know17 who I'm fighting.	Are you talking care of18 developers?	Are you - - I don't think you're19 taking care of even the landlords.	Small20 landlords are not being taken care of either.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you wrap22 up, please.23 MS . JANET HENNE:	That's it. I24 would just love to have you tell me who I am25 who we are fighting?	Who are you taking care of?

I live inROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC. , 212- 840-1167521 Fifth Avenue, 17th floor, New York, New York  10175
2 East New York in Brooklyn.3 I just found out tonight that4 landlord's increases are due to the fact that5 they're paying for fuel costs.	Some of them - -6 most of the increases are due to the fact that7 they're paying for fuel costs.8 While I'm not paying for my9 landlord's fuel cost. I live in a development that10 has 181 rental units in East New York. It was11 developed by the Arc Companies. And I've been12 trying to find out who was the person that allowed13 them to usurp law that rent stabilized tenants are14 paying for their own heat.	This is the only15 building that they have built in New York City16 that I know of where tenants are paying the fuel17 cost. We are absorbing the landlord' s rent - - I18 mean heat.19 Not only am I paying for heat, I'm20 paying for electricity. I'm paying for hot water.21 And now I also have to pay for cable in order to22 watch a television program because they have the23 monopoly and they have designed our apartments so24 that we don't get proper reception.25 Since I've been living there for the2 
2 past five years, there have been leaks on the3 roof. This is a brand new building in East New4 York. Leaks in a roof in a five - - five to six5 year old development . Mold and mildew . Rats,6 roaches, et cetera.7	I've been to my local councilman who8	is Councilman Barron.	I've been to Senator John9	Sampson.	I've been talking with Congressman Ed10 Town' s office. And to date they have not been able11 to do anything in reference to this landlord.12 An increase for this landlord and13 we're paying all his bills. How? We don't14 understand that. I have started a tenants15 association where this landlord has walked around16 door to door knocking on doors telling people that17 it's illegal to join the tenants association. This18 is the only way we' re going to be able to get19 things done. And they have blocked that.20 We' re asking that this particular21 landlord be exempt from any - - building anything22 else in East New York because they do not maintain23 their property.	They allow it to decay as they24 did in Long Island where they have their property25 management office. And nobody even wants them over
2 there. So they come to East New York where3 everybody's poor and take advantage of all the4 poor people.5 My building is a - - usually the6 majority are single parent households. And we7 can't afford it.	I'm disabled.	I have two8 children, school age and I'm suffering right now.9	I'm paying now for heating bills that I've10 incurred during the wintertime.11 And I would like for this Board to12 vote no increase for all these negligent13 landlords.14 Also - -15 (Audience participation.)16 MS. JOYCE BRAYBOY:	- - this landlord17 has over 200 violations on record within a18 six-month period of time and somehow they19 mysteriousl y disappeared. Where did they go? They20 didn't do the work on the property. They didn't21 repair any apartments. They only repairing the22 exterior.	The stuff is inside that is falling23 apart. The apartments are falling apart and24 they're only five years old.25 We need to vote no increase.	You10 
2 need to vote no increase.3 (Applause.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question,7	question.8	MS. HOLDER:	Thank you for your9 testimony this evening. I really appreciate you10 coming out to Queens.11 MS. JOYCE BRAYBOY:	Thank you.12 MS. HOLDER:	Have long have you13 lived in East New York?14 MS. JOYCE BRAYBOY:	I've been15 living in this development for five years, almost16 six now.17 MS. HOLDER:	And do you mind18 telling us - - you said that the development has19 181 units and you're only responsible for paying20 your own energy costs?21 MS. JOYCE BRAYBOY:	Every single22 apartment is responsible for them paying for it.23 MS. HOLDER:	Do you feel24 comfortable, could you tell us how much you pay in25 rent?
2	MS. JOYCE BRAYBOY:	Right now I'm3 paying $615.	That's because I went to DHCR and4 they gave - - because they didn't register my5 apartment, I got a rent reduction.	Also it's not6 registered.	And they overcharged me for rent  at7 the same time.	So they had to reduce to the - -8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Was this done9 under a program if it's only five years old in10 East New York? Is there11 MS. JOYCE BRAYBOY:	No. The program12 that they're under is 421-a.	And they didn't put13 a dime out of their pocket.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Just 421. It was15 a private development.16 MS. JOYCE BRAYBOY:	Private17 development.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The only thing19 you got was 421-a.20 MS. JOYCE BRAYBOY:	Right.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And what was the22 market rent before DHCR reduce  it?23 MS. JOYCE BRAYBOY:	I have no idea.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.25 MS. ADAMS:	Question.9 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.3 MS . ADAMS:	Have you reported them4	to anyone other than DHCR?5	MS. JOYCE BRAYBOY:	I reported it6 to every agency, HPD, everyone, the Department of7 Buildings.	I've even sent a letter to  Betsy8 Gotbaum' s office. I've sent a letter to Tito9 Hernandez.	Everybody that I could send a letter10 to, HDC.11 MS . ADAMS:	Have you gotten12 responses from any of them?13 MS. JOYCE BRAYBOY:	Excuse me?14 MS.

Could you just describe, you pay23 for your own heat and hot water?24 MS . JOYCE BRAYBOY:	Yes .25 MR. LANGUEDOC :	Is that on a gas
2	bill, an electric bill?3	MS. JOYCE BRAYBOY:	It's a gas and4	an electric bill.5	MR. LANGUEDOC:	And how much - -6	would you mind telling us how much7	MS. JOYCE BRAYBOY:	It can be8 anywhere from $200 to $300 during the winter9 months for utilities 'cause in order to use - -10 Another thing I wanted to mention,11 in order to use your heat, in order to turn on12 your heat, you have to be hooked up to the13 electric. So God forbid if I can't pay my electric14 bill, my heat will not be working.15 MS. ADAMS:	You have electric16 heat?17 MS. JOYCE BRAYBOY:	I have gas and18 electric.	The unit is run by electricity.	In19 order to turn the gas on you have to turn on by20electricity.So you have to maintain both bills.21MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.

REGINALD WILLIAMS:	I want to11 say good evening to members of the Board.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, Mr.13 Williams.14 MR . REGINALD WILLIAMS:	And good15 evening to everyone in attendance.16 My name is Reginald Williams and I'm17 here representing Councilman Eric Goia.18 Tonight - -19 (Applause.)20 MR. REGINALD WILLIAMS:	And tonight21 I will be reading his testimony.22 Members of the Rent Guideline Board,23 thank you for the opportunity to offer my24 statement here today.25 As we can see tonight based on the
2 testimony only, New York City is currently facing3 an affordable housing crisis.	At a time when our4 economy is generally strong, there is no excuse5 for the fact that New Yorkers who are working6 harder than ever - holding down one, two, even7 three jobs - are nevertheless unable to afford a8 decent apartment for themselves and their9 families.10 In 1970, the average tenant11 household paid 20 percent of its income in rent in12 New York City. In 2005, that figure was 36.713 percent.	Over 26 percent of all tenant households14 dedicate over half of their income just to pay the15 rent. Meanwhile, the cost of living keeps going up16 and wages do not keep pace.17 This situation is unacceptable and18 seriously threatens the future of our City .	There19 are simply not enough affordable housing in the20 City, and every time we hike up rents, we' re left21 with even less.	We cannot stand idly by as the22 gap between rent and income continues to grow.23 Our middle and lower income New24 Yorkers cannot afford to live here and we will25 start to lose our workforce and our middle class
2 tax base and we will jeopardize our character and3 tradition as a City with room for all people from4 all backgrounds seeking a better life for5 themselves and their kids .6 This affordable housing crisis is7 everybody' s issue - all New Yorkers have a stake8 in how we solve this problem, whether they own or9 rent, pay market rates or even rent-controlled10 apartments . Indeed, those who live in New York' s11 one million rent-regulated apartments are a12 reflection of the City as a whole :	Two-thirds of13 tenants in rent regulated apartments live outside14 of Manhattan.	More than 60 percent have a15 minority head of household, and a quarter have a16 head of household who is 55 or older.17 It is essential that the Rent18 Guidelines Board acknowledge the affordable19 housing crisis when deciding whether the rents of20 a million in our City will go up again, and if so,21 by how much.22 I don't think anyone is saying that23 New York' s landlords don't have the right to make24 a profit on their property.	They are important25 members of our community and we must work with2 
2 them to guarantee New Yorkers an adequate supply3 of safe, affordable housing.	But the decisions4 this body makes on rent hikes, in part, determines5 whether millions of New Yorkers will be able to6 keep a roof over their heads.7 The Board has a responsibility to8 take the needs of New York's millions of9 hard- working tenants into account.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you wrap up,11 please.12 MR. REGINALD WILLIAMS:	But keeping13 rents in check is just one component of a solution14 in the crisis of affordable housing.	Another is15 the need to return Home Rule over rent and16 eviction proceedings to New York City.17 I, and many of my colleagues have18 spoken out many times about the need to the City19 for the City to have control of its tenant laws20 to ensure that they reflect the needs and21 priorities of New York City residents.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you wrap23 up, please.24 MR.

2 Our residents deserve to have the3 laws that govern their housing made by4 representatives who are accountable to them. I5 urge the Rent Guideline Board to join us in6 fighting for Home Rule.7 Finally, if we are to provide people8 with adequate, safe, clean housing, we will have9 to address not only our rent regulation system,10 but also the insufficient supply of quality11 housing available in the City.	We must work hard12 together to reclaim the waterfront, build over13 unused railroads, and think creatively about our14 potential housing sites.15 We must also use creative zoning and16 land use tools such as inclusionary zoning to17 increase the stock of affordable housing. The18 long- term health of our economy, as well as the19 very character of our City, depends on it.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 MR. REGINALD WILLIAMS:	Thank you.22 (Applause.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Anna Sarswela?24 Anna, are you here, Sarswela? Yes? No.25 (No response.)2

ANDERSON FILS-AIME:	Yes.9 (Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN:	Okay.	Followed by John11 Thevdos.12 MR. ANDERSON FILS-AIME:	Oh, I'm13 up.14 Good evening, Rent Guidelines Board.15 Thank you for coming to the wonderful borough of16 Queens which I live in.	I'm a resident of17 Richmond Hill.18 My name is Anderson Fils-Aime. I'm19 the Community Organizing Program Manager for the20 Pratt Area Community Council in Brooklyn.21 I don't know, maybe I should be on22 the owner side because my Executive Director, Deb23 Howard told me that PAC develops and manages rent24 regulated housing. And we have 517 units that we25 manage.
2 And when I asked her when preparing3 my testimony, she says no. As a policy we always4 ask for the lowest guidelines possible.	Yes, it5 challenges us to make repairs when the rents are6 low. Rent regulated housing is the most affordable7 housing stock in the City.8 What you see out here are the9 communities of New York. Don't judge them by their10 neighborhoods. Neighborhoods is geography.11 (Applause.)12 MR. ANDERSON FILS-AIME:	Long13 Island City is a geographical connotation.14 Richmond Hill, East New York, Harlem, that' s just15 geography.	This is community. And what makes this16 a community is that folks are able to put roots17 down.	And when the rents keep going up and up and18 up, there is no way for the folks that make up19 community to stabilize themselves.20 My father emigrated to this county21 with my mother from the great county of Haiti in22 1964. And they got an apartment in Bushwick, a23 rent controlled unit. With that stability in his24 housing, he was able to get a job, a union job,25 longshoreman. So he had stability in housing,
2 stability in employment . And with those two things3 he punched our ticket to the middle class.4 Please give these folks - - a lot of5 them aren't here. Why? They're working two and6 three jobs to pay the rent.7 (Applause.)8	MR. ANDERSON FILS-AIME :	Give these9 folks a chance that, my father was able to give me10 and my brother, by being courageous. There's a lot11 of lawyers sitting on this Board.	Be courageous,12 right.	Slavery, used to be the law of the land.13 Women couldn't vote, used to be the law of the14 land.15 (Applause.)16 MR. ANDERSON FILS-AIME:	Don't give17 us this nonsense about oh, what the law says. We18 need you to challenge the law.	This is a direct19 request of the public members. Challenge the law,20 be courageous, do what's right.21 (Applause.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 MS . HOLDER:	I actually have a24 question.	I'm sorry.	I have a question .25 MR . ANDERSON FILS-AIME:	Yes, Ms.
2	Holder.3	MS. HOLDER:	Thank you for coming4	out.5	MR . ANDERSON FILS-AIME :	Oh, any6 time .	Any time you're around, definitely.	Thank7 you for your committed service serving the Rent8 Guidelines Board.9 Myself on behalf of all the tenants10 in new York City thank you for your dedication and11 commitment.12 (Applause.)13 MS. HOLDER:	Well, thank you.	So14 nice to meet you .15 Thinking about the properties that16 you all do manage at Pratt Area and, you know,17 based upon that experience, how is it that you all18 are able to maintain your housing?19 MR. ANDERSON FILS-AIME:	We get a20 tremendous amount of hope from the City.	There's21 a lot of capital, a lot of groups who do financing22 for affordable housing.	And, you know, I don't23 know how Deb does it. She' s there from 8:00 in the24 morning till 1:00 in the morning constantly25 putting grants in, putting proposals in, getting
2 the various paperwork done so that we can get the3 money in to keep those properties affordable,4 properties where maintenance men live, where5 school bus drivers live, where the folks who work6 in the grocery store live.7 I mean there's a constant talk about8 the firemen, the nurses and the police and they9 provide essential services. And I think that some10 people think, well, that person is expendable,11 this person' s expendable. Those folks are12 contributing to the society.	We're the engine13 that makes this City run, right?14 (Applause.)15 MR. ANDERSON FILS-AIME:	The City16 - - the City controls the engine of the state. And17 Governor Cuomo one time said he actually believes18 it's the engine that makes this county run. Where19 are those folks going to live?	If they don't have20 housing, if they can't have stability - - you know,21 I hear the Mayor talk about education.22 If you move into a community and23 you're not going to be able to put your roots24 down, you don't stay.	And as one person said,25 that' s where it leads to brain drain.
2	But to get back to your point3 though, to your question, Ms. Holder.	There' s a4 lot of money there. I hear what the landlords say.5 The small owners. I've been doing this work for6 seven years. I've talked to some of my colleagues7 who have been doing this work for 40 years.8 They've never seen a landlord submit9 an application to DHCR requesting hardship.	Which10 would say, hey, the rents that are here I can't11 maintain my building. Go back and adjust the12 rents. Never. Never.	They have the MCis. They13 have the individual apartment increases and they14 have a lot of great programs, a lot of them15 sitting right there at the HPD website.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you so much.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And Deb has19 been here in the past and testified on some of the20 panels on operations.21 MR. ANDERSON FILS-AIME:	One22 quick point.23 I know some folks have said about24 the keys. Are you - - you guys are the key to the25 solution. You're the key to the solution.3 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3 (Applause.)4	MS . HOLDER :	Thank you.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	John Thevdos;6 Followed by Ricardo Gotia;7 Followed by Bill Henning.8	Go ahead, Mr. Thevdos.9	MR . JOHN THEVDOS :	Yes .	Good10 evening.11 My name is John Thevdos . I'm a12 landlord. I didn't buy Stuyvesant Town. I don't13 own 181 units like the woman was saying .	I own a14 six-family building, a seven-family and an15 eight-family .16 Just like this guy before me was17 saying about nurses, firefighters and engineers,18 I'm coming here from work also .	I don't drive a19 Rolls Royce .	I don't have a Mercedes Benz . I work20 just like everybody else, okay . So landlords need21 help too.	It's not a one-sided scale .22 The heating - - the heating bill23 keeps going up every single year and it doesn't go24 up by two percent or three percent .25 A VOICE:	Apply for hardship .
2	MR. JOHN THEVDOS:	I applied for3 hardship.	Let me speak.4 And I didn't get the hardship, okay.5 So what I ended up doing was I ended up putting6 individual heating units in everybody' s apartment7 and let everyone pay the heat. What's a guy8 supposed to do when your heating bill is like9 $8,000 a month.	And in one of my other buildings10 it's $17,000 for the whole winter. That' s like a11 car. Every single year that's a brand new car.12 So I just pass it along to the13 tenant.	And if the tenant argues, I lower it by14 $50. That' s the only thing I could do. Water keeps15 going up. Taxes keep going up. I used to take16 Section 8.	The process takes so long to get a17 tenant approved.18 But Section 8 used to pay the19 holding fee from the time you find an applicant20 until the time they sign the lease.	Bloomberg cut21 that out.	There's no holding fees now.	So if you22 want to take Section 8, you have to wait a month23 and get jerked around until you finally get24 everything signed. So you lose a month' s rent.25 So I stopped taking Section 8. SoROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167
2 all these people who are blaming landlords really3 ought to see the other side of the story because4 there' s legitimacy. Landlords have hardships also.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where's your6	building?7 MR. JOHN THEVDOS:	In Brooklyn.8 MS. HOLDER:	Where?9 MR. JOHN THEVDOS:	Ironically around10 Pratt area and in Bedford Stuyvesant also.11 MS. HOLDER:	And those are three12 buildings?13 MR. JOHN THEVDOS:	Right.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Go15 ahead. Are you done or?16 MR. JOHN THEVDOS:	Yeah.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 Any questions?19 MS. HOLDER:	Oh, I have - -20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Questions.21 There' s some questions.22 Go ahead, Steve.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No.	Go ahead,24 Adriene.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider.10 
2	MR. SCHLEIDER :	Go ahead, Adriene.3	Go ahead. You started.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead,5	Adriene .6	MS . HOLDER :	Okay .	So you said7	you own a six, a seven and an eight-family?8 MR. JOHN THEVDOS:	Right.9 MS. HOLDER :	And how long have you10	owned those buildings?11	MR. JOHN THEVDOS:	Several years.12 Ten, five, five, four, three. It varies.13 MS. HOLDER:	And all of your units14 are rent regulated?15 MR. JOHN THEVDOS :	Yeah .16 MS . HOLDER:	Do you participate in17 any type of cooperatives or anything for your18 energy?	Are there any types of things that you've19 been able to do with other landlords or with other20 groups?21 MR . JOHN THEVDOS:	No. I've tried .22 I've tried. And I've spoken to other landlords and23 they said just put individual heating units and24 let the tenant pay the heat.	And if I get a25 tenant who, you know, who I feel qualifies but
2 they complain about the heat, I just lower  the3 rent $50 before I let them in.4 I mean there 's nothing you can do . I5 get a bill from KeySpan for $7,000.	What are you6 supposed to do?7 MS . HOLDER:	And how long have8 your tenants been in the units?9	MR . JOHN THEVDOS :	Well, I bought10 some of the buildings only a few years ago so a11 lot of them were in it before I bought  it.12 But when I bought them, I used to13 take Section 8 because the rent is guaranteed so14 while I'm working like all these other folks, I15 don't have to worry about my rent . But Bloomberg16 cut out all the holding fees so you have to sit17 and wait a month, a month and half with no rent18 because Bloomberg cut that  out.19 So what is the landlord' s incentive20 to take Section 8 when you have to hold onto a21 apartment for one or two months without getting22 any rent? God forbid there' s a problem with your23 check, there goes another month .24 MS . HOLDER :	So all the units are25 rent regulated.
2	MR. JOHN THEVDOS:	Yes.3	MS. HOLDER:	And what are the4	ranges of rents and how much are your apartments?5	MR. JOHN THEVDOS:	They' ll all6	one-bedroom .	They range from $800 to $1,100.7 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.	Thank you.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .9 Mr. Schleider, Steve.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So on the Section11 8, it's not a bias towards the tenancy, it's a12 bias towards the system; is that correct?13 MR. JOHN THEVDOS:	Right.	I love14 Section 8.	The rent is guaranteed.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.16 (Applause.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank18 you.19 Ricardo Gotla, are you here?20 MR. RICARDO GOTLA:	Here.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Great.22 Bill Henning?2 3	A VOICE:	He left.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	He left.25 Followed by Maggie Silver .
2 MS. MAGGIE SILVER:	Here.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Followed4	by Ramona Santana who's going to need an5 interpreter, right?	Yes.6 Mr. Gotla.7 MR. RICARDO GOTLA:	Thank you for8 this opportunity to testify today before this9 influential and important Board .10 My name is Ricardo Gotla and I hold11 the position of Housing Organizer for New York12 City Council member Annabel Palma of the Southeast13 Bronx.14 I am responsible for all community15 and constituent housing cases.	This includes, but16 is not limited to, organizing Mitchell-Lama17 tenants, eviction prevention, landlord and tenant18 disputes, building repairs, anti-abandonment,19 assisting Section 8 tenants, neighborhood20 rezonings, building complaints and so on.21 As a result of my work I have my2 2	finger on the pulse of my community' s housing23 issues.24 As recently as seven years ago, only25 a clairvoyant could have foreseen the housing boon
2 that the Southeast Bronx is currently undergoing.3 Today it is obvious.4 While landlords and property owners5 benefit from our housing boom, the large majority6 of my constituents suffer from it.	Everyday I7 carry the burden of telling apartment seekers that8 their income will not afford them even the9 smallest studio.10 As unbearable yet equally as11 frequent, I bring the harsh reality to many12 renters that sooner rather than later, they will13 be forced to a find a family member or a friend to14 move in with because they cannot afford their most15 recent rental increase. These are the fortunate16 ones for many have no one to turn to.17 These constituents are not low- lives18 or people who don't want to work. On the contrary,19 they're mothers and fathers working one and20 sometimes two jobs. They make too much to qualify21 for government assistance, yet enough to afford22 the basic cost of living.23 They're the disabled or the elderly24 on fixed incomes; they're longtime residents of a25 building whose landlord decides to make lavish
1	2222 MCis; they're the working poor and immigrants;3 they're widowed grandmothers and grandfathers.4 The reality is that a majority of5 those I serve are average citizens with average6 incomes faced with average challenges who simply7 cannot afford to pay sky-high rents created by a8 hyper-hot housing market.9 Of all the complaints I've listened10 to during my tenure, I have yet to see a landlord11 walk into or call my office claiming that they are12 not making sufficient profit.	On the contrary,13 their economic status makes them of the most14 powerful lobbying groups in the State.15 If current political and economic16 and social realities make it impossible to avoid17 rent increases, then I urge you to harness your18 powers to assure that tenants' apartments are free19 of major violations . I urge you to adopt the20 suggested provisos.21 Every landlord I have dealt with has22 the capital to make building repairs. The only23 reason that these repairs are not made is the lack24 of proper enforcement.	I see it everyday .	HPD25 hasn' t developed a policy with enough teeth to
2 force irresponsible landlords to live up to their3 end of the bargain.4 By adopting the suggested provisos,5 you will have taken a step in the right direction6 for all effected parties. You' ll empower New York7 City by creating an effective means of encouraging8 landlords to make needed repairs; you'll protect9 and improve the quality of life for tenants and10 you'll allow landlords the increases they seek.11 And finally, believe it or not, you will even12 placate some housing advocates.13 Again, thank you for your time.	I14 look forward to and I'm optimistic about your15 final decision.16 (Audience participation.)17 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Thank you, Mr.18 Gotla.19 Any questions?20 (No response.)21 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Our next speaker is22 Maggie Silver.23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Our next speaker25 is Maggie Silver and she'll be followed by Ramona
1	2242 Santana .3 (Applause.)4 MS . MAGGIE SILVER :	Good evening,5 ladies and gentlemen of the Board tonight.6 Everybody look good.	I hope tonight7 something will be done nice for everyone in this8 beautiful place in the name of the Lord.9 Okay. My name is Maggie Silver . You10 know my name already.	They said it twice, all11	right . Let's talk about this issue. It's very12 important to talk about this.13 Remember, there 's two kinds of14 people now around you, New York and everywhere,15 rich and poor .	And here we are with the poor16 people hanging out tonight.	Yes or not? Yeah!17 (Applause.)18 MS . MAGGIE SILVER :	Yeah .	See, see .19 Now, this is - - this is what is20 important here .	We're discussing the things about21 raising the rent for the poor, right? Because22 we' re poor people. Some people don't even have23 enough income to come .	Sometimes they have a24 small check coming every month. It still doesn' t25 cover sometimes for the rent .
2 But the landlord want to increase3 the rent for the poor people, see? How are they4 going to pay all this rent? They have a family.5 They collect $800, $900 for a month when the6 landlord - - you have the note under the door. The7 note says $795 for the rent. You don't laugh in8 there, you starting crying because he don't9 collect the money you have to pay your rent.10 You got to pay telephone, gas and11 electric on top of the rent. And that' s not enough12 money, you know, because you have a family. How13 are you going to produce something for food for14 your family? Not enough.15 And it's a shame that we have to16 come here to say those things. It's a shame,17 believe me.	New York City is the most beautiful18 city of the world and we know that, right? We know19 that .20 (Audience participation.)21 MS. MAGGIE SILVER :	And we have to22 come in here and beg and beg and beg.	And mainly23 for your people, I like all of you.	I respect24 you, and respect you, ladies and gentlemen. But25 have a little bit more conscious that we are here
2 for some purpose doing something that really need3 to be done.4 And stop raising the rent. The5 landlord must not raise the rent for people who6 doesn't have enough income.	Come on.7 (Audience participation.)8	MS. MAGGIE SILVER:	That's too9 much.	That' s too much, okay.	Someone have to be10 here.	Someone must have a conscience that not11 everybody has money. Not everybody work and make12 good salary. You know that by numbers.13 I'm a member of CASA. I'm working14 for the South Bronx and north Bronx. All over15 Grand Concourse. You should see that. Most of the16 people in there, tenants, they really want to go17 play with the landlords, yes. But the landlord18 doesn't have no conscience.	They still raising19 the rent for them.	And that' s the reason.20 The reason sometimes they don't do21 the repairs. They don't correct the violations but22 they still raising the rent for the poor people.23 And that' s very bad, believe me. It's very bad.24 Now, tonight, I have a group of25 people coming from Casa, from some apartment in
2 the Bronx. And all of us we have a key which we're3 going to leave it here for you and see if this key4 open a little bit your conscience and hearing you5 have.	Corne here with the poor people of the South6 and north Bronx.	And come down everybody and put7 your key over there please. Please, everybody.8 (Audience participation.)9	MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Thank you, Ms.10 Silver.11 MS. MAGGIE SILVER:	I really12 appreciate if you people - - I appreciate if you13 people tonight, all right, think about this issue.14 It's very serious. We dealing with poor people. We15 don't dealing with everybody who has money, all16 right. And here is not - - you don't see here in17 this place, you don't see Mr. Trump. Let' s see Mr.18 Trump in there, right.	Because he' s has money,19 he's not here.20 I didn' t hear him dealing with the21 poor community of the Bronx and that's what we're22 here for.	I appreciate that you take this serious23 and lot of respect and think about it.24 Thank you very much.25 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Ms. Silver, thank
2	you.3	MS . MAGGIE SILVER:	For every one4 of you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank5 you.6 (Audience participation .)7 MS. HOLDER:	Question.8 MR . MCLAUGHLIN:	Question, yes.9 MR . LANGUEDOC:	Ma' am, thank you10 very much.11 Could you just tell us how much are12 the rents going for in your neighborhood nowadays?13 MS. MAGGIE SILVER:	In my14 neighborhood some of the - - we have a lot of15 stabilized rent because as you know	because16 you're not young anymore. You are over 50. And I'm17 over 35. I just playing, you know that.18 But let me tell you something .	Our19 parents, our relatives, our friends work since20 1946, '52 collecting a little money for salary21 every week. And you know they don't pay so much,22 right? That's people have apartments in the Grand23 Concourse which is considered now a stabilized24 rent .	They not paying as much .	But when the25 landlords realize it, they go over and they scare
  2 the tenants and that' s what they doing, you know3 what I mean, to raise the rent of the tenant  who4 don't know what to do anymore.5 These people they don't much  about6 reading and writing and you know what.7 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Well, if somebody8 is looking for a place in your neighborhood, how9 much would it be?10 MS. MAGGIE SILVER:	In my11 neighborhood - - what was that?12 MR. LANGUEDOC:	If someone's13 looking for a place to rent, a rent stabilized14 apartment - -15 MS. MAGGIE SILVER:	Right.16 MR. LANGUEDOC:	In your17 neighborhood, how much would the rent  be?18 MS. MAGGIE SILVER:	The rent19 probably they charge sometimes for a studio 100 - - 20	$1,100, excuse and $950.21 MR . LANGUEDOC:	And how much for a22 two-bedroom apartment?23 MS. MAGGIE SILVER:	Two-bedroom,24 easy, $1,250.	And not only that, most of  the25 landlords want those apartments stabilized,  clean.
2 Like moving people out, let them move out of the3 neighborhood. Because they want to fix it and rent 4	it for $3,000 and $4,000.5 And I'm telling you now because the6 Yankee Stadium is coming along and everybody going7 to live in the Grand Concourse, don't you know.8 The Grand Concourse and the Bronx it's just like9 Hollywood. Don't you know that. They going to look10 like that pretty soon. And they going to start11 running the people from there. I'm not planning to12 move.	I'm going to stay in there for good,13 believe me.14 Thank you very much.	Goodnight.15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 MS.

She23 would like to find out about that.24 She says in the building that she25 lives in it has 600 violation and nobody has come
2 to fix it.	And she's trying to say do you think3 that the landlord should get an increase in rent4 with these 600 violations that he has.5 She would like one of the Board6 members to answer her question.7 (Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you .9 (Audience participation.)10 MS.

I know Ron and I are familiar15 with the conditions in the Bronx. I think that16 some Board members went last year .17 It does not surprise people such as18 Ron and myself who - - do you need to translate?19 Ron Languedoc and myself being20 tenant members have seen the conditions not only21 in the Bronx, but throughout the City .	And I22 think that - - and I think it is a concern that we23 have that I believe others on this Board share24 that there are landlords who are not making25 repairs, but continue to take increases on the
2 apartments.	And I hope that this year that  this3 Board is able to address that concern which should4 be a part of our deliberations.5 MS. RAMONA SANTANA :	Thank you.6 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you .7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I have a question. I8 have a question, please.9 How many apartments are in your10 building complex?11	MS. RAMONA SANTANA:	Sixteen.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Sixteen and you13 have 600 violations?14 MS. RAMONA SANTANA:	Yes.15 MR . SCHLEIDER:	In that case I'll16 answer very simple, yes and no.17 (Audience participation.)18 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Yes to the first19 question.	No to the second question.20 MS. RAMONA SANTANA:	She says all21 sixteen apartments has violations.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes, but you said23 600 violations. That' s what I heard.24 THE INTERPRETER:	Yes, she said 60025 violations.
2	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right, on sixteen3	apartments.4	THE INTERPRETER:	Sixteen5	apartments.6	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right. So I'm7 answering your questions.	You asked two8 questions:	I am familiar with the conditions?	I9 said yes.	For 600 violations on sixteen units do10 I think that landlord should get the increases, I11 said no.	Yes and no .12 (Audience participation.)13 THE INTERPRETER:	Thank you. Thank14 you.15 MS. ADAMS:	I have a question.16 Yes, I am familiar with the housing17 conditions.	And my question would be to whom were18 the 600 violations reported to?19 MS. RAMONA SANTANA:	(In Spanish.20 Answer was not translated.)21 Reportamos HPD y tambien reportamos22 DHCR.23 MS. ADAMS:	And you got no24 response .25 MS. RAMONA SANTANA:	(Through
2 interpreter.)3 They had two fires.4 MS. ADAMS:	I couldn' t hear you.5 MS. RAMONA SANTANA:	They had two6 fires and HPD and the other company is still - -7 you know, they still working on it.8	MS. ADAMS:	And when was it9	reported?10 MS. RAMONA SANTANA:	September the11 27, 2005 was the first fire.	June 10, 2006 was12 the next fire.13 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you .14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 Thank you.16 MS. RAMONA SANTANA:	Thank you.17 (Applause.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.20 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.21 (Audience participation.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jeanette Gomez.23 Is that you, Jeanette?24 MS. JEANETTE GOMEZ:	Yes.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Followed by10 
2	Tanya Williams .	Are you here?3	MS. TANYA WILLIAMS:	Yes.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Rebecca5 Myers, are you here?6 A VOICE:	Debra?7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Debra, I'm8	sorry.	Debra Myers. You' re right.9	Go ahead. Jeanette.10 MS. JEANETTE GOMEZ :	Yes. Good11 afternoon.12 We're here basically to say the same13 thing.	We keep saying it. I think we - - you know,14 we're wasting our time here, everyone speaking15 about the same thing how the Bronx is being16 demolished. Our apartments - - New York City17 apartments are not worth the money they cost. You18 go to other states you're paying $500 for a19 two-bedroom, even $700. Why so high?20 The painting, the painting, the21 repairs.	They're so cheap the way that landlords22 are doing things. It's not quality paint. It's not23 quality work.	The apartments are not worth24 nothing if you ask me, okay? The apartments they25 want $1,100 for a two-bedroom? That' s ridiculous.10 
2 You go to a state, you get garbage disposals, you3 get dishwasher.	Nothing. These apartments are not4 worth the money . People, you shouldn't be paying5 this amount of money. It's not worth it.6 The paints are very bad. The repairs7 it's not quality stuff. You' s people live in good8 quality places. You should know. Inspectors should9	be out there opening their eyes, look at these10 jobs they way it's very low, low jobs.11 People be living with rats, holes,12 roaches and you're getting $1,000 for an13 apartment, one apartment?	Multiply that by 100.14 That' s a lot of money you's are getting. I don't15 believe they should even get $500 for these16 apartments.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 (Applause.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Tanya Williams;20 Followed by Debra Meyers;21 Followed by Jeff Richberg.	Yes, is22 that the right name?23 Tanya.24 MS. TANYA WILLIAMS:	Hello.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hi.
2	MS. TANYA WILLIAMS:	I want to thank3 you all for being here and thank everyone for4 being here too .5 I'm representing Tremont Towers in6 the Bronx. I just want to let you about the7 conditions in my apartment where I'm living.8	MS. ADAMS:	I'm sorry. Who were you9	representing?10 MS . TANYA WILLIAMS:	Tremont Towers11 in the Bronx .12 The conditions in my apartment are13 horrendous.	The elevator has been broken for over14 two years.	We're about eight flights up and you15 have old women, disabled people have to walk up16 stairs? People should not live like this .17 In this America it's supposed to be18 the greatest country in the	the greatest nation19 in the world .	New York, we run United States but20 yet people are living in these substandard21 stations . This is disgraceful.22 When you walk into the front of my23 building, the paint is falling off the walls .24 They're things everywhere . You can't have people25 live like this . The windows are broken. I heard10 
2 how other people are talking about how when you3 fix the windows every time your bill comes around4 they keep on charging for it. That' s ridiculous.5 That' s like paying your college tuition and that's6 like paying off your college loans for the rest of7 your life.8 I'm in college right . I'm not trying9 pay my college loans for the rest of my like.10 Like you guys have the power and you11 guys really have the power to fix the situation .12 So I think you guys all really need to do this13 because you should not be able to sleep at night14 knowing that at the end of the day you go home and15 you're living somewhere nice.	And at the end of16 the day, these people they're not. But don't they17 deserve everything that you deserve? You guys have18 the power. Fix it.19 (Applause.)20 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.21 Thank you for your testimony22 tonight.	I really appreciate it. It's nice23 meeting you.24 Can you tell me with the Tremont25 Towers, how many units are there?
2	MS. TANYA WILLIAMS:	I would say3 there about, okay, maybe eight floors and then4 maybe about twelve apartments on each floor. So5 twelve times eight.6 MS. HOLDER:	And in those units7 they're all rent regulated?8 MS. TANYA WILLIAMS:	Yes.9 MS. HOLDER:	Right.10 And you say that there's a lot of11 conditions.	Do you how many violations there are12 at Tremont Towers?13 MS. TANYA WILLIAMS:	I don't - - I14 can - - I'm not sure.	But I know one lady that15 lives on the fifth floor. There' s a hole in her16 bathroom and she can see all the way down to the17 second floor through that hole.18 MS. HOLDER:	And has the landlord19 been taking increases on the apartment?20 MS. TANYA WILLIAMS:	Yes, he has.21 MS. HOLDER:	And do you know how22 much the rents are in the building?23 MS. TANYA WILLIAMS:	I know that the24 rents, I would say that they vary from maybe about25 five hundred and something to about a
2	thousand-two.3	MS. HOLDER:	And would you mind4	telling us what your rent is?5		MS. TANYA WILLIAMS:	My rent is 6	about $890.7	MS. HOLDER:	And how large is your8	apartment? Is it a one-bedroom?9	MS. TANYA WILLIAMS:	Yeah.10 MS. HOLDER:	And how long have you11 been there?12 MS. TANYA WILLIAMS:	I've been there13 - - well, it's my mother's apartment so yeah, I've14 only been there a couple of years. I would say15 she's been there maybe about fifteen years.16 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.	Thank you so17 much for your testimony.18 MS. TANYA WILLIAMS:	You're19 welcome.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 (Audience participation.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Debra?23 Jeff Richberg is next after Debra24 and Fay Swavy I think.25 Go ahead.10 
2 MS. DEBRA MEYERS:	Good evening.3 My name is Debra Meyers and I live4 on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx.	And I'm here5 representing the people in my community who live6 on the Grand Concourse. I am with the Casa group.7 I am also the President of 1560 Grand Concourse8 Tenants Association.9 And I can tell you a few reasons why10 tonight that we really cannot afford the rent11 increase. And we - - you have seen a number of12 violations that we have brought the pictures13 before you.14 On the Grand Concourse there are15 horrendous conditions, not so much in my building16 because we work with our landlord and he has made17 all of the	he has corrected all of the18 violations in my building. That's because we have19 developed a working relationship.20 But I'm here to represent the other21 members of my community. The rents are so high now22 that parents must choose whether they can educate23 their children, send their children to college or24 do we have to continue to pay the high rents. I25 have to decide everyday when I have to pay my
2 rent, pay my Con Edison, when I need to take my3 children somewhere, I have to budget my money .4 There's many times that I cannot take my children5 just on a subway ride because I have to pay the6 high Metro Card that we use .7 And I'm just saying to the Board8 tonight a lot of our people are living in poverty9 in that community .	The rents continue to go up10 but the salaries are not going up and I wish that11 you would reconsider increasing the rents for the12 people in my community.13 Thank you.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 MS. HOLDER:	Question .16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Question . Question.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.18 Questions.	Ma' am, Debra.19 MS . DEBRA MEYERS :	Yes.20 MS . HOLDER:	How many units in21 your building?22 MS. DEBRA MEYERS:	I have - - I23 live in a building with 114 units .	But I only24 I just want you to know this, we 're a very25 proactive community.2 
2	As you know, the Yankee Stadium is3	going up in our community.	I don't just come and4 complain. I sit there and I plant flowers in the5 front of my building. We work and we do security6 details in our building. I go down with this group7 and we organize other tenants associations to8 help.9 We don't want to move from our10 community so we're proactive in trying to keep our11 buildings neat, secure. We don't have drug dealers12 in our building because we work with the tenants13 and this is what we're doing.	A lot of things you14 think the landlords are doing it, no, the tenants15 are cleaning the building. The tenants are16 planting the flowers.17 (Applause.)18 MS. DEBRA MEYERS:	The tenants are19 providing security. The tenants are making their20 own repairs, all right.	We are paying to redo and21 remodel our own apartments, not the landlords. So22 when you see the beautiful buildings as you ride23 up the Concourse24 I also am the secretary of the25 Friends of Parks Council.	We go and we fight for
2	the monies for our parks, all right. Right now3 Council Woman Maria Baez has put a half a million4 dollars into the Mount Eden Malls and Claremont5 Park just so our community can become a better6 place for us to live in.7 We have planters on the Grand8 Concourse.	We make sure that our Parks Department9 plant flowers in those flower planters on the10 Grand Concourse. So we're not here coming to yell11 and complain.	We want to live in a better12 environment in our community and we are out there13 making it happen as volunteers.	We don't get paid14 for this.15 So when you come into those16 neighborhoods in the South Bronx now, it is we,17 the tenants, and the residents who are doing the18 work and that' s why the landlords do not need the19 increase because we are doing their jobs for them.20 (Audience participation.)21 MS. HOLDER:	Wait, wait.22 Thank you.	And I would venture to23 say that you are the ones who are making the24 neighborhoods better, making New York City better25 and so I appreciate that.3 
2 MS . DEBRA MEYERS:	Thank you.3 MS. HOLDER:	So in the units,4 though where you live, where you have your tenants5 association, in those units, you're saying that6 the conditions of the apartments are fairly7 decent?8	MS. DEBRA MEYERS:	The reason why9 the conditions are fairly - - the violations,10 because I go down to the Buildings Department, me11 and my association and we pull up every12 violations.	When the landlord took over the13 building, the new management company, we invited14 him.15 MS. HOLDER:	When was that?16 MS. DEBRA MEYERS:	That was about17 five years ago. But I will tell you we pulled up18 every violation for our building. We gave him19 we invited him to our meeting, our tenants20 association meeting and we handed him all of the21 violations.2 2	MS. HOLDER:	And how many were23 there at that time?24 MS. DEBRA MEYERS:	At that time25 there was about 32 violations on the building.
1	2492 Okay.	But we told him we were not there to be3 combative with him.	We wanted to work together4 because I live in a beautiful building, all right.5 MS. HOLDER:	And were there6 serious violations in the building?7 MS. DEBRA MEYERS:	They were serious8 enough that we could have filed some lawsuits and9 that's what we told him that if he didn't make the10 repairs, we know how to get a lawyer and to file a11 lawsuit. We' re not going to tolerate peeling12 paint. We' re not going to tolerate led, you know,13 led in our apartments. So our landlord worked with14 us.15 And what he did though was we did16 receive an MCI increase because he repaired the17 roof.	He replaced all the gas lines, new plumbing18 throughout the entire building. He put up - - he19 painted the fire escapes. He also put new doors in20 the front and we also we got a new intercom21 system.22 MS. HOLDER:	And how much do the23 rents go for in your building?24 MS. DEBRA MEYERS:	Right now for a25 two-bedroom it's about $1,250. And for a studio or2 
1	2502 one-bedroom apartment it's $950 to $1,000.3 But we're not leaving our building.4 There's a lot of people who have been living in5 that building for over 30 years.	But what I feels6 bad about is the tenants, the senior citizens who7 are living on that fixed income.8 And when you're living on a fixed9 income, their money is going to rent and to the10 Con Edison. And they have their dietary, the food,11 the nutrition it goes down because they have to12 eat lower grades of food or they're not getting13 the nutritional foods that they really need and14 they're not able to go and travel and go to the15 places that they want to because they can't afford16 the cab fare. And many of them cannot travel on17 the buses and the subways.18 So it's really - - what you don't see19 is the internal situations that this happens, what20 is happening.	When the rents go higher, parents21 can no longer travel on the trains with their22 children because it just cost too much. It's just23 costing too much.24 A lot of our children don't want to25 go to school and we have a dropout rate. Even the2 
2 young elementary schoolchildren don 't want to go3 to school because they don't want to wear certain4 clothes or certain sneakers . But we can't afford5 to buy them those - - this type of sneakers and6 clothing that they went .7 So when you see the rents go up, the8 education is going down in the community . The9 education is going down all of the time.10 (Applause.)11 MS. DEBRA MEYERS:	My son is12 supposed to be in college right now but he needed13 to go to work because he needed to get something,14 you know, taken care of .	So rather than him going15 right away to college, he had to miss a year . But16 it's all well and good because I've told him, you17 know what, you're going to college anyhow. Doesn't18 matter to me .19 You know, we'll sacrifice but that20 priority is education because I will never want21 him to beg and come up here and say, oh, I don 't22 want this rent increase. I want him to have the23 knowledge and the education that he needs to move24 forward with his life.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you .
2MS. HOLDER:	Thank so much.3(Applause.)4CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jeff Richberg .5MS. PRISCILLA HENNIGAN:	Good6evening.7I'm speaking for Jeff because right8now he' snot9CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Excuse me, who10are you?11MS . PRISCILLA HENNIGAN:	For Jeff,12 Jeffrey.	Because right now he's feeling sick.13 My name is Priscilla Hennigan.	And14 I live in New Settlement Apartments which is a15 beautiful place.16 I live in this facility and everyday17 when I walk, I go to the Concourse and I'm saying18 my gosh, how did these building get like this . Not19 only that, my development responds to this.	We20 have our stuff and everything . Nobody' s paying us21 nothing for doing.22 And what I appreciate about, we have23 a school group there .	We also have what they call24 an after school program. We also have what they25 call a college after school where one of my kids12 
2 right now is in college. My daughter - - my3 daughter she's getting her Master's and I don't4 have a dime. And what I'm saying to you, I5 appreciate living in the New Settlement for the6 simple reason I do not pay that much rent because7 I'm on Section 8 but I'm thinking about other8 people.9 I want - - I was like maybe the fifth10 person in New Settlement Apartments. We have 1411 units. So I'm looking around.	I'm an older woman12 now, and I'm looking around in the streets and13 stuff.	My gosh, I told the kids, I told the14 parents, send your kids to New Settlement, to the15 after school program. But some of them don't want16 to go. It's a very good program.17 As you see, we have many people here18 today. And I'm saying to you I have been in some19 of these people houses and I couldn't believe it .20 And I used to be a little tough thing.	I said my21 Lord, if I was living like that, them landlords22 wouldn't even walk through the streets because I23 would try to get them.24 How could you live in an apartment25 paying all this rent for a one-bedroom, almost
2 $1,000 with the walls cracking down.	Mices and3 roaches, drug dealers in the hallway. We went into4 the building. We talked to the landlord. Right now5 that landlord is fixing up this building. He has6 so many violations that we fought for that. And7 we' re saying, why are you paying that much rent?8 (Applause.)9	MS. PRISCILLA HENNIGAN:	And they10 like, I don't know. And the whole thing about it,11 we have a lot of immigrants and they afraid. The12 landlords threatens them and they scared to come13 out because we' re there to help them. And we will14 get on those landlords.	We have conferences with15 landlords.16 And as the landlord say, oh, when we17 call the police and stuff. We have constantly call18 the 44th Precinct. We try to work with the people.19 We' re not taking nothing from the people. And I20 don't think these landlords should take any money21 from these people who have four, five kids and22 they paying $1,000 for a roach-infested place and23 a building falling down and the kids can't go in24 'cause the drug dealers are telling them you25 better not say nothing .10 
2 What kind of message is that. Take3 over your building. I took over my building. We4 have no trouble in New Settlement, none5 whatsoever . 'Cause everybody out of them 146 buildings everybody in there we tell him you're7 not smoking there, you're not doing this there.8 And I tell you what, they will get put out if we9 catch them.10 (Applause.)11 MS. PRISCILLA HENNIGAN:	And we' re12 not getting paid for none of this .	And I'm saying13 to you, please, you need to go to the Bronx and14 see it. If I go up the corner, I'm like how could15 these people live.	How could you live in the16 conditions like this. You must come out and fight17 for what you want. And I believe a lot of people18 is afraid. Because if they say anything, they19 might get hurt and things like. But I tell him20 don't be afraid of nobody, you know.21 The landlords in the Bronx do harass22 some of the tenants and that's wrong. And he tells23 them they have to pay $1,000 for an apartment, a24 one-bed apartment. If you look at those pictures,25 it's that same building. These people are paying a
1	2562 lot of money and I do not like it. You see. And3 we're going to fight until we can't fight no more .4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5	MS . PRISCILLA HENNIGAN :	And that's6 what we' re about .7 Thank you very much.8 (Applause.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you.10 Let the record reflect New11 Settlement Housing, you heard the lady, is a great12 place to live. I'm on the Board of directors of13 THE Settlement Housing Fund which owns that place.14 MS. PRISCILLA HENNIGAN:	So you know15 we're doing good.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	So I'm not that17 bad, huh?18 MS . PRISCILLA HENNIGAN :	No, you19 know you not that bad.	Matter of fact, we have a20 park in the school now. We got a tiny top park and21 right now we're getting another park at 64 so22 you're not that bad.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	I know all about24 it. Thank you .25 (Laughter.)
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I would also3 point out, just to be clear, there is absolutely4 no debt on that. The buildings were rehabbed with5 city direct grants.6 MS. PRISCILLA HENNIGAN:	Thank you .7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You know,8	there' s a lot of money .9	MS . PRISCILLA HENNIGAN:	Right . And10	I've been there 18 years now .11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That's a great12 project.	We' re trying to build you that swimming13 pool.14 MS . PRISCILLA HENNIGAN:	Oh, thank15 you.	You will?	We need it.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No, no not in17 the apartment, but in the new high school.18 MS . PRISCILLA HENNIGAN:	I know .19 Thank you .20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You're welcome .21 MS . PRISCILLA HENNIGAN :	And the22 new high school we have.	Thank you.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 MS. HOLDER :	Thank you. And it would25 be great if we
1	2582	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	See, I'm not3 that bad. I want to humanize myself a little here.4 (Laughter.)5	MS. HOLDER:	Is that what you're6	doing?7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It didn't work8	though. Sorry.9	MS. FAY SWAVY:	Hi.10	My name is Fay Swavy.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Fay Swavy. Thank12 you.	Go ahead.13 MS. FAY SWAVY:	Yes.14 I live at 1405 College Avenue.15 MR. LANGUEDOC:	What is your name?16 What is your name?17 MS. FAY SWAVY:	Fay Swavy.18 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Oh, okay.	Hello.19 MS. FAY SWAVY:	S-w-a-v-y.20 And I think the rents should be21 lower and we should not be paying all these22 landlords the rent and nobody else. Because the23 landlords and the super, you never see it. It's24 illegal drugs in there. I don't care what anybody25 say. And my mother has been there for the longest.
2 I've been there between 24 and 34 years. And I3 think the rents and the whoever' s putting the rent4 up and whatever have you, need to put it down.5 Casa, we are ready.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7	MR. LANGUEDOC:	Ma'am, could I ask8 you a question, please?9 In the building where you live, how10 many units are there?11	MS . FAY SWAVY :	It's six floor on12 each side.13 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And how many per14 floor?15 MS. FAY SWAVY:	I can't really16 remember how many on each floor .	But it's very,17 you know, it's just - - I just don't even want - - I18 don't know .19 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay.20 MS. FAY SWAVY:	It's just21 ridiculous.22 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And what are the23 conditions in the building?24 MS. FAY SWAVY:	Like I just mention25 it, the elevators sometimes have not even been12 
2 working and there sick people, very, very sick3 people in there.4 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Right.5	MS. FAY SWAVY:	They can't hardly6 walk. Some people can't even walk.	And then like7 I said, illegal things in there. And half of the8 apartment haven' t even been painted.9 My mother apartment haven' t even10 been painted in a long time. I mean I don't know.11 It's just too high and it needs to go down.12 And like I said, Casa, we're ready.13 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Ma' am, are they all14 rent regulated apartments?15 MS. FAY SWAVY:	Excuse me?16 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Are they all rent17 regulated apartments?18 MS. FAY SWAVY:	No.	Because it's19 not all rent related apartment. I been there 24 to20 34 years with my morn. I'm 52 right now, okay.21 Thank you.22 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you very23 much.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Linda Stewart.25 Linda Stewart, are you here? Great.
2 Followed by Channa Camins, Camins3 are you here?4 MS. CHANNA CAMINS:	Yeah, I'm here .5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Followed by6 Elizabeth Gardner.7 Linda, go ahead.8	MS. LINDA STEWART:	Good evening,9 everyone and thank you for giving me the10 opportunity to speak.11	My name is Linda Stewart and I live12 on the Grand Concourse.13 We got a new manager, new owner of14 the building approximately three years. Right now15 we have about 890 violations.	We have been able16 to get the manager to work with us being that we17 had to take them to court.18 The conditions in the apartments are19 pretty bad. It's really sad that you have to take20 someone to court to get them to do something. Our21 rents are running very high. There' s 16822 apartments in the building, okay. The rents are23 running anywhere from $750 to $1,200, $1,300,24 $1,400 for a two-bedroom apartments.25 I really urge the committee to12 
2 really think about doing no - - zero for the next3 rent increase.4 Thank you .5	MR. LANGUEDOC:	How long have you6	lived there?7	MS. LINDA STEWART:	I've lived there8 - - I was born in the Bronx 55 years ago . I left9 New York City for ten years . New York is my home.10 I came back . I've been living there for 24 years11 now, okay .	This is my home. I don't want to12 leave.13 I recently retired in September . But14 the way that things are going, I'm going to have15 to uproot and go somewhere else because the rent16 is just too high.17 I have two sons, 29 and 26. My18 26-year- old had to come back home to live because19 his rent had sky-high'd to $1,050 because of an20 MCI, And as we know, when the MCI is paid off, it21 never goes back down.22 Their MCI was $80 a month which is a23 lot . But then he had an increase in his rent also .24 So he had to come back home. You have adult25 children living with their parents because they
1	2632	cannot even afford to pay the rents today.3	As we know, the employment pay scale4 is low in some instances.	Coming out of college5 they're going to make $27,500. That's the maximum6 they're going to make when they come out of7 college and they cannot afford to pay over $1,0008 a month for rent.9	MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.	Thank10 you very much .11 MS . LINDA STEWART:	Thank you .12 (Applause.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Channa Camins;14 Elizabeth Gardner;15 Followed by Jeanie Dubnau.16 Go ahead.17 MS. CHANNA CAMINS:	Hi.18 My name Channa Camins and I'm a19 tenant of a rent stabilized apartment in Brooklyn.20 I live in a two-bedroom apartment with one other21 person and we each pay half the rent.22 My half of the rent alone is 5023 percent of my monthly take-home pay . And I make24 more than most people here probably and I don't25 have any kids to support.10 
2 I've seen the rental history of my3 apartment. In fact, I have it with me . And I can4 testify that the rent of the apartment has doubled5 in the course of a six-year period as the result6 of four vacancy increases and a few regulated7 increases which you guys passed.8 I want to know what type of9 investment is it the norm to double your profits10 in that amount of time without putting anything11 back into the building?12 The vacancy increases and the13 increase, the regular increases that you pass are,14 in effect, driving the cost - - driving up the cost15 of housing in neighborhoods across the City .16 You' re not maintaining affordable housing for the17 City, you're driving up the market rate.18 I mean if my apartment - - here we19 go.	By allowing a landlord to increase the rent20 20 percent just because the apartment changes21 hands and he slaps up a $30 coat of paint and then22 coupling that with a six to seven percent23 increase, you are making rent stabilized housing a24 completely ineffective method of maintaining25 affordable housing .
1	2652	(Applause.)3	MS. CHANNA CAMINS:	In addition, you4 are effectively putting people out of their homes,5 including potentially myself and I'm not the worst6 off of them.7 Look, I don't live on the Upper West8 Side.	I don't even live in the swankiest9 neighborhood in Brooklyn.	My building is located10 next to the entrance to the Prospect Expressway. I11 got - - you know, this is not exactly the most12 prime location.13 But my landlord can legally charge14 over 20 - - legally, over $2,200 a month in rent15 for a two-bedroom apartment. We pay in total for16 the whole apartment a preferential rent of $1,85017 a month.	In 2001 the legal regulated rent of the18 apartment was only $1,200. So I'm saying from 200119 to currently the rent went from $1,200 a month to20 over $2,200 a month .21 In 2000, the rent was $500 a month.22 So somehow he was able to increase the rent from23 $500 to $1,200 in the course of one year - - in one24 year . And then after that every year since then he25 has gotten either a 20 percent increase or a six
2 percent increase or a seven percent increase3 depending on what rates you set .4 There are no changes in this5 apartment building that warrant those kinds of6 increases.	I work in a nonprofit organization.7 When I moved into the apartment building, I was8 making $35,000 a year . This month I changed jobs.9 I'm now making $42,000 a year. And the rent is10 still going to be almost 50 percent of my income11 because you're going to raise the rent again. And12 you've raised it since I moved in.13 Now, there are teachers and - - we14 already talked about working people in this City15 with college degrees.	And you're still raising16 the rents.	Now, if my apartment in Brooklyn costs17 over $2,200 a month to rent a two-bedroom, I might18 as well own an apartment building in a co-op.	But19 frankly, my salary doesn' t allow me to accumulate20 the kind of money that it cost to put a down21 payment on an apartment.22 The whole point of affordable23 housing is to maintain, you know, a housing stock24 that people who fill these City jobs, these, you25 know - - people who are public employees, people
2 who work for regular incomes across the City who3 are average people can afford to stay in.4 Otherwise, there's no community base. I mean if5 you want it to be a transient community of just6 students and really wealthy people who work in the7 private sector, than that's fine. But then your8 city is not a city for all people. It's a city9 exclusively for the rich.10 (Applause.)11 MS. CHANNA CAMINS:	That' s what I12 want to tell you.13 I know that my neighbor upstairs14 just moved into an apartment.	An old woman moved15 out of her apartment. She had been in there for16 years. Her rent was probably something around17 $900 . He made some changes in the apartment and18 now the rent is up to $1,500.19 But if you keep steadily increasing,20 passing these increases, that apartment is going21 to be unaffordable for any working person in no22 time at all. And frankly, it's unaffordable23 already.	But this is the situation in New York24 City.	If you want to live in New York City, you25 have to agree to devote most of your income down
1	2682 the tubes, frankly.	I have no equity in my3 building. It's not like I get anything out of4 giving my hard earned money over to my landlord5 every month.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7	MR. LANGUEDOC:	Question.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.9 MS. CHANNA CAMINS:	Yes.10	(Applause.)11	MR. LANGUEDOC:	Is the situation12 you're describing repeated in your neighborhood,13 to your knowledge?14 MS. CHANNA CAMINS:	Yeah.	This is15 common.	Look, I searched for an apartment in New16 York City for months before I found one, okay.17 It's not easy to move back to New York. I left for18 college. I came back.	It took a long time to find19 an apartment.	And frankly, I had to settle on an20 apartment that was much more than I would ever21 want to devote, you know, of my monthly income to22 an apartment.23 You know, I can't live alone. If I24 lived in a one-bedroom apartment, I'd be paying25 $1,100 a month of rent. At the moment I pay half
2 of what is $1,850 a month, $925 a month. If it3 goes up anymore, I don' t know what - - where are4 you supposed to find a one-bedroom apartment for5 that amount of money in New York, in the five6 boroughs? I just don't understand where we're7 expected to live.8 I can't buy a house on Long Island.9 I can't move to New Jersey. It's not going to10 happen. I work in Manhattan. I work for a11 nonprofit and that' s my living and that' s the12 living of a lot of people in New York City.13 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Well, I want to14 thank you for coming. And I, for one, find your15 testimony to be very eloquent.16 (Applause.)17 MS. CHANNA CAMINS:	If I had18 children, I'd be out on the street. You know, I19 live month to month. My rent is - - I live - - my20 cost of living is high enough with student loans,21 with healthcare, with all of the costs of living22 that are skyrocketing in this country that if I23 were to miss one month of rent - - one month of24 income, I'd be out on the street. The landlord25 could easily evict me. You know, that's the
1	2702 situation people are in there and they're much3 worse off than me .4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you .5 (Applause.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Elizabeth7 Gardner;8 Jeanie Dubnau;9 Then Milagros Lopez .10 MS. ELIZABETH GARDNER :	Good11 evening.12 My name is Elizabeth Gardner. And I13 handed the lady at the front this huge document .14 I'm going to be testifying about an MCI that we15 were hit with .16 Hello .	My name is Liz Gardner and17 I'm a member of the Van Buren Hall Tenants'18 Association in Sunnyside.19 I live in a rent stabilized studio20 in one of 14 buildings sold by Bassuk Brothers21 this year for $118 million.22 You, of the Rent Guidelines Board23 are among the most powerful people in the five24 boroughs because no one else can take away 5025 percent of my annual raise in the blink of an eye,
2 but you can.3 I have lived in the City for over 204 years. I'm 47 years old and just five years ago, I5 could finally afford to live without a roommate.6 It took me until I was 42 years old to live7 without a roommate.8 In those five years my rent has9 risen by $113 per month. Like many, I simply can't10 afford two-year leases - the increases are too11 high.12 I am a legal secretary on Park13 Avenue. On June 1st I received my annual raise and14 it was just shy of four percent. In New York,15 that' s considered an excellent raise for legal16 secretaries.	Net, my raise comes to $115 per17 month. Of my monthly take- home, 20 percent goes to18 medical expenses. That's $600.	Twenty percent19 goes to student loans, both undergraduate and20 graduate from Columbia University here, another21 $600 a month. And I have to keep paying that for22 seven more years.23 Twenty- seven percent of my take- home24 already goes solely to rent and that does not25 include electricity, gas, telephone or air
1	2722 conditioning.	Last year, for the fifth time since3 1980, my landlord applied for a Major Capital4 Improvement increase.	If the Division of Housing5 and Community Renewal grants it, my rent will go6 up six percent and I will also have to pay the MCI7 increase retroactive to October 2006.8 Now, I do not have enough time to9 tell you about everything on my landlord' s10 application that was suspicious.	But the bills he11 submitted to DHCR and HPD did not match. He12 claimed the roof somehow "grew" by 800 square feet13 since 2001.14 (Laughter.)15 MS. ELIZABETH GARDNER:	Yes.16 He told the Department of Buildings17 that the work would cost over a million dollars in18 order to inflate the cost of the permit by more19 than double. And he claimed that he spent more20 than $3,000 on a roof railing that never existed21 and still doesn't .	My landlord lied about all of22 these things.23 May I have just another minute.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. Go25 ahead.
2	MS . ELIZABETH GARDNER:	My landlord3 lied about all of these things to raise our rents4 to make the building more attractive to potential5 buyers .6 Sorry.	And when our building7 organized to fight this MCI increase, the owner8 and superintendents started to harass us. We have9 never had any tenants association in our building10 and it was built in 1937. But this MCI increase11 did it for us. People were sick .12 Now, if you, of the Rent Guidelines13 Board, vote in a seven percent increase, you will14 reach right into my wallet and take half my net15 raise and hand it to this guy. And if the Division16 of Housing and Community Renewal somehow approves17 this MCI increase, my raise will be completely18 gone except for $2.91 a month. And my rent will go19 up in just one year the same amount that is has20 gone up in the last five.21 There is virtually no law to prevent22 landlords from gouging tenants on Major Capital23 improvements.	And since DHCR, HPD and the DOB do24 not communicate with each other or crosscheck25 these applications, fraud is very easy .3 
2 Since the landlords do not have to3 take bids, they spend as much as possible and even4 that isn't quite enough - like ours, they pad the5 bills .	The only recourse we have is to use our6 savings to hire private lawyers and engineers and7 the average tenant simply cannot afford to hire8 these professionals.9 And I want to tell you - -10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap11 up.12 MS. ELIZABETH GARDNER:	Okay.13 So tonight I am pleading with you to14 consider the impact your increases have on tenants15 fighting MCR increases and to consider what it16 feels like to be without heat, hot water, or17 overrun with vermin and be forced to pay your18 increase, though you have asked time and again for19 repairs and services.20 Let there be a moratorium on21 increases for landlords with violations.22 (Audience participation.)23 MS. ELIZABETH GARDNER:	And so I24 ask you to tread softly because you tread on my25 raise .2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3 (Applause.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jeanie Dubnau.5 MS. HOLDER :	Wait a minute . Sorry.6	Can we have a question? I'm sorry,  Jeanie.7	MR. LANGUEDOC:	Could you just tell8	us how much rent you're paying, if you don't mind.9	MS . ELIZABETH GARDNER:	I pay10	$821.09 for a studio .11	MS . HOLDER:	How long have you12 lived there?13 MS. ELIZABETH GARDNER :	I've lived14 there five years.	When I first moved in, it was 15	$708 .16 MS. HOLDER:	And how many units are17 in the building?18 MS. ELIZABETH GARDNER :19 Fifty-seven - - fifty-eight, including me .20 MS . HOLDER:	And are all the units21 rent regulated?22 MS . ELIZABETH GARDNER:	There are23 about three rent controlled left.	There are two24 vacant and everybody else is rent stabilized .25 MS . HOLDER:	And do you know what16 
2	the other rents are, what the range is?3	MS. ELIZABETH GARDNER:	Actually,4 I'm the former president and tenant' s5 representative of the Van Buren Hall Tenant' s6 Association so actually I'm very familiar with7 that.8 The highest that I've seen is about9 $1,500 for a one-bedroom.	That is a preferential10 rent .11 MS. HOLDER:	That's a preferential12 rent?13 MS. ELIZABETH GARDNER:	Preferential14 rent. He has several units in the building under15 preferential rents. What he did was - -16 MS. HOLDER:	And you're in17 Sunnyside, Queens?18 MS. ELIZABETH GARDNER:	I am.19 He moves in his relatives, keeps20 them in there for a little while and then he puts21 the building under - - the apartment under the22 status of preferential rent, okay.	And then the23 next person can only have a one-year lease and24 then he will put a 20, 30, 40 percent increase on25 that lease.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC. , 212-840-1167521 Fifth Avenue, 17th floor, New York, New York  10175
2	I know one gentleman who's a working3 artist. He has two units in the building. His rent4 when he moved in, preferential rent was like5 $1,010 for a one-bedroom . He wants to raise that6 man' s rent to $1,500. Preferential rent.7 So if the Rent Guidelines Board does8 not take into consideration how many of the rent9	regulated units are under preferential rents, I10 mean preferential rents you're already out of11 service.	You are deregulated essentially because12 the landlord raises the rent, 20, 30, 40, 5013 percent. I mean your Rent Guidelines Board don't14 apply to these things, these units that are15 preferential rent.16 And the other thing is these MCI17 increases18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is this a hotel?19 MS . ELIZABETH GARDNER:	No.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	This is under21 hotel stabilization?22 MS. ELIZABETH GARDNER:	No, it's23 not.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Why is it called25 the Van Buren Hotel?10 
2	MS. ELIZABETH GARDNER:	It's not.3	It's called Van Buren Hall.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hall. Okay.5	Sorry.6 MS. ELIZABETH GARDNER:	That's okay.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank you.8 MS. ELIZABETH GARDNER:	Thank you.9 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.10 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you very11 much.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jeanie Dubnau;15 Followed by Milagros Lopez.	Are you16 here? Yes. Okay.17 Followed by Kennedy Rivera.18 Ms. Dubnau.19 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	Yes.20 My name is Jeanie Dubnau.	I'm from21 RENA, Riverside/Edgecombe  Neighborhood Association22 from Washington Heights in Manhattan.23 And I'm here because basically I24 want to ask a question of you. And that is, the25 question is, here we're sitting and we're  watchingROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC. , 212-840-1167521 Fifth Avenue, 17th floor, New York, New York  10175
2 and we' re looking at a power play between a very3 powerless group, which is the majority, and the4 powerful group, which is the minority. The5 powerful group is real estate.6 Real estate in New York City, I7 think none of you would disagree with, is one of8 the most powerful forces in the City of New York.9 I'm sure that all the tenants would agree and I10 think the landlords would agree and I think the11 public members would agree.12 So isn't it strange then that the13 power over the lives of people is in the hands of14 eleven people here who have more power than our15 own City Council that we vote for. The City16 Council doesn' t have the power you do.17 (Applause.)18 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	And they're19 our representatives.	There is nothing more20 enraging, I have to say, than to sit here and we21 all, I think, feel that outrage in a sense of22 having to plead with people who are not even23 elected by us.	You are all appointed by Mayor24 Bloomberg.25 (Applause.)2 
2	MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	And actually3 he' s the silent enemy here in my eyes.	He doesn't4 appear. He's not here. Where is Mayor Bloomberg?5 Mayor Bloomberg appoints you and then he hides, he6 sits there, oh, this is all very democratic.7 You folks, who are the Board, the8 RGB, with five public members who are supposed to9 represent the public.	And you are empowered.10 Our tenant reps, they're only two of11 them. No matter how they vote won' t make any12 difference whatsoever.	Two landlords, that makes13 it very fair. Is this fair?	Do we call this fair?14 (Audience participation.)15 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	This happens16 every single year.17 Now, I just - - I will not repeat the18 eloquent testimony that we've heard today that19 we've heard every year, about how affordable20 housing is being lost in the City of New York. I21 won't repeat any of that.22 I just want to know one question,23 another question. What ever happened to the law in24 New York City and our lawyer here - I don't know25 if any of the other of you are lawyers, but Ms.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167
2 Holder knows - there is a law in the City of  New3 York which is the so-called Hardship Law. If a4 landlord is not making six percent profit	and5 by the way, what other business enterprise is6 guaranteed a six percent profit by the  government?7 But that's true here. Real estate is  guaranteed.8 So the landlords, we heard one9 little landlord here say that he applied for  a10 hardship increase and he wasn' t granted it and he11 was crying to the Rent Guidelines Board.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you wrap up,13 please.14 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	No.	I'm not15 quite finished.16 Now, in Northern17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Finish.18 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	No.	I'm not19 finished yet.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. You' re over21 the time.22(Audience participation.)23MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	In Northern24Manhattan- -25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You're over the
2	time.3	MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	On Northern4 Manhattan, to make it even worse, to add insult to5 injury, we've got Columbia University taking over6 the entire neighborhood.	They have now spent - -7 they want 35 acres of land, public land between8 125th and 135th Street. They have spent one and a9 half million dollars on what? Lobbying. Only10 lobbying.11 The total expansion is going to cost12 $7 billion. There's some countries that are13 running on less than $7 billion. But Columbia14 University is spending $7 billion of probably -15 and I don't have the figures in my head - but it16 must be public money on this instead of what the17 people of Northern Manhattan need which is18 housing, schools and a decent place to live.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	So I'm appealing21 to, again, to the public members to look into your22 hearts and say is this fair, is this right that we23 have this power over a million families in the24 City of New York. Will we do the right thing this25 year.4 
1	2832	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3 Thank you.4 MS . HOLDER :	I have a question.5	(Audience participation .)6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question .7 Ms. Holder.8 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.9	Thank you for coming down and coming10 out to Queens tonight to give us your testimony.11 Could you tell me what actually has12 been happening, through your involvement in13 Manhattan, what' s been happening with the rents14 and what' s going on with the housing stock?15 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	In Northern16 Manhattan I'm most familiar with Washington17 Heights where now the rents are going for about18 $1,000 for a studio. About $2,000 for a19 two-bedroom and God knows what for a three-bedroom20 if they even exist.	There are some, of course, in21 our neighborhood.22 People are being harassed to the23 point that I know of two - - just recently two24 elderly ladies came to RENA and they told me and,25 in fact, I confirmed this by speaking to theirROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC. , 212-840-1167
2 landlord, that he has been asking them to move out3 and go to a senior citizen home because he' s4 emptying the building.	This is on 152nd Street5 and Broadway, because he wants to repair it and he6 wants to then, once they 1  re out, they will never7 get back in.8 So I informed that landlord that9 they had the right to stay, in which, of course,10 they do.	However, they were not sleeping. One11 lady is 82 years old. The other lady was 81 years12 old. They were not sleeping and their children,13 that they really did have to move out. This is14 just an example of the tip of the iceberg of the15 kind of harassment that' s going on right now in16 Washington Heights.17 I1 m sure you 1 ve all seen The New18 York Times real estate section which shows the hot19 market in how have you ever thought of living in20 Washington Heights, which was considered once the21 druggy neighborhood, crime-infested. Oh, now it's22 fancy. They call it Hudson Heights now.23 So this is where the real estate24 market is going and folks, just as the previous25 speaker had said, the RGB is part of the problem,2 
2 the part of driving up our rents so that we can 't3 live in New York City anymore.4 Please, stop being part of the5 problem .	Please, do the right thing .6	MS . HOLDER:	Jeanie, one other7 question.8 When you said that with the seniors9 who came to you all for assistance and that the10 landlord was talking about he wanted to do these11 renovations or and wanted to relocate them, when12 you said that they weren't going to get back,13 explain to us exactly what you're saying.14 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU :	The landlord15 actually asked - - the landlord is banking on the16 idea that they will be too scared and that their17 children will find them another place to live and18 that their children will allow - - will just take19 them in.20 Some of the senior citizens are21 living in two-bedroom apartments which could be a22 really nice profit for the landlord. They're23 paying I think - - they are subsidized these24 ladies .	I think one of them has Section 8 and the25 other one is on SCRIE.
1	2862 So the rent is - - although the3 landlord is getting plenty of money, what they are4 paying is not that high.	However, once he5 renovates them and puts a little new stove in6 there, of course, he' s going to charge much, much7 more.8 MS.

I lived there for over 22 years.5 I first moved - - when I first moved into that6 building, it was a nice, decent building. Now I7 have a new landlord that has now owned that8 building now going on two years. That is not the9 case now . Now I've been calling or sending him10 letters regarding repairs. It's all I'm sending11 somebody, I'm sending somebody.12 I've also contacted HPD several13 times and gotten the complaint through the mail14 but haven' t gotten no response. The only positive15 thing that' s been lately and because he got a16 grant, is that there' s been led removal in the17 building. That's about the only thing.18 Other than that, there' s a security19 issue in the building .	The front door lobby is20 not secure. Someone not too long ago was followed21 in by somebody and at gunpoint was held up.22 You know how scary that is. I live23 in that apartment that I live in right now by24 myself . Occasionally my daughter comes from25 college, which right now she is college.
1	2882 The other conditions I have in my3 apartment, just two weeks ago I had a flooding4 situation in the living room. I called him. I5	called	I had to call the Fire Department. They6 had to come in, break a hole in - - you know what7 that is, you coming home from a hard day' s work8 and you see water floating down in your living9 room when you're trying to relax.10 In the meantime I've been11 emphasizing to him about this condition, this12 conditions in the bathroom. There' s conditions in13 my kitchen and the bedrooms. The only thing that14 just got done just yesterday is just the led15 removal.16 Please, please I just want quality17 of life.	Like, as hard as I work I like to come18 home and relax and I know I work hard. And I know19 in my job if you're going to get a raise, an20 increase, you have to work hard. So in the same21 sense I think these landlords should work hard in22 improving the conditions of our apartment if they23 want an increase.24 (Applause.)25 MS. MILAGROS LOPEZ :	So in thisROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC. , 212-840-1167521 Fifth Avenue, 17th floor, New York, New York 10175
2	year I would like for us to not - - for a freeze,3 please.4 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Question.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.6 MR. LANGUEDOC:	In the past two7 years since this new landlord took over, have you8 had to pay a rent increase?9	MS. MILAGROS LOPEZ:	Yes. Yes.10 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And how many units11 are in the building?12 MS. MILAGROS LOPEZ:	There's two13 buildings connected so altogether over 40 units?14 But he also owns another third building. But15 there' s two buildings. There' s one adjacent to the16 other.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	When you say new18 landlord, this is a new guy bought it?19 MS. MILAGROS LOPEZ:	Right, right.20 Because the previous landlord, I mean I know him21 forever.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So - -23 MR. LANGUEDOC:	So what do you24 attribute - - if I may.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.
2	MR. LANGUEDOC:	I'm sorry.3 What do you attribute the change to?4 You said things weren' t so bad before with the5 other landlord . Now, even though you're having to6 pay a rent increase, things are worse; is that7 right?8	MS. MILAGROS LOPEZ:	Yeah, things9	are worse.10 Like I said, having this situation11 with the bedrooms.	When I used to talk to the old12 landlord with situations like the bathroom, he13 would come and send somebody.	There used to be14 super. Now we don't have a super.15 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Why do you think16 that things have gotten worse?	Even though people17 are paying more money, things are worse, why?18 What' s your theory?19 MS. MILAGROS LOPEZ:	Why?	My20 personal opinion?21 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Yes.22 MS. MILAGROS LOPEZ:	'Cause he' s a23 cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap. He just gets24 these people that he gets off the street.	No25 kidding. There's a homeless shelter just down the
2 block from where I'm at. He gets them to clean the3 front of the building. You know, that' s like4 really ghetto, you know. And I don't want to be5 living in a ghetto.	That' s not the way it was6 when I was living there.7 And, you know, I work hard. I work8 for Health Plus which is an HMO and we care about9 people' s lives and quality of life. Why is it that10 now I've got to be also be, you know, subjected to11 this kind of situation when I work. I worked and12 I pay my rent so why can't - - my issues can't be13 addressed and taken care of.14 MR . LANGUEDOC:	I appreciate you15 coming. Thank you.16 MS. MILAGROS LOPEZ:	Okay. Thank17 you.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Kennedy Rivera.21 MR. KENNEDY RIVERA:	Hello. My22 name is Kennedy Rivera.23 I work for the Bushwick Housing24 Independence Project.25 A VOICE:	Can' t hear.
2	MR. KENNEDY RIVERA:	What's that?3 I work for the Bushwick Housing Independence4 Project.5 And our organization goes to court6 everyday to try to help families preserve their7 apartments.	And we work with them on a daily8 basis to try to help them keep their apartments.9 We have about a few buildings in10 Bushwick, 920 Bushwick Avenue, 1075 Green, 94611 Bushwick Avenue, and 1298 De Kalb Avenue that are12 managed by Bushwick House, LLC.13 And they don't make any repairs .14 All they want to do is push the tenants out and15 they want to increase the rents and bring in new16 people and uproot the old tenants that are living17 there. So basically what they're doing is pushing18 everyone out .19 And the tenants that used to live20 there can't live there anymore. And this is not21 fair to the community to uproot the families and22 just push them, you know, wherever they want to23 push them .24 And we just need a moratorium on the25 increase of the rents .	We need to stop these
2 rents because the families are suffering. They're3 being uprooted and they're being pushed wherever4 people want to push them. We have to stop this.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 MR. KENNEDY RIVERA:	And that' s all7 I have to say.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Estelle Ortiz?11 Estelle Ortiz, is that you?12 Followed by Lydia Hernandez; and13 Then Delia Mogrovejo.14 Go ahead.15 MS. ESTELLE ORTIZ:	Hi. I'm Ester16 Ortiz and I live at 946 Bushwick Avenue in17 Brooklyn.18 946 Bushwick Avenue is a big19 building with 63 apartments. I have lived there20 for nine years with my daughter and grandson. My21 daughter is a cancer survivor on chemotherapy22 indefinitely.	My grandson was born there.	He is23 eight years old.24 I work two jobs. I'm an Emergency25 Medical Technician and I work per diem at St.
2 John's Hospital.	On the weekends I work at a3 catering hall. I also SRO for an ambulance corp.4 This September I'll be going to medical school.5 But last year I made $19,000 and I struggled to6 pay the rent. And how did I manage? I had to take7 a loan which I'm still paying and I'll probably be8 paying for a few years.9 But today I'm here to protest the10 rent increase. I do not believe that the rents11 should be raised because the apartments at 94612 Bushwick Avenue are in need of multiple repairs.13 There' s no security in the building and the14 building is kept filthy. Those conditions are15 unacceptable.16 It has always been like that. The17 building was pretty decent when I moved in and the18 rent was affordable. I used to get good heat and19 hot water.	Things have changed drastically since20 the new landlord has taken over. That's two years21 ago this new landlord took over the building.22 The landlord has ignored the23 tenant' s complaints causing some of the tenants to24 move out in frustration.	The tenants' complaints25 are so many, it calls for a complete renovation of
2 all the apartments.	Their complaints are of3 leaking ceilings, old damaged front doors, rusty4 kitchen sinks, cabinets, mold and mildew on the5 walls. The mold and mildew was so bad the rooms6 were pitch black. When I inhaled deeply, my chest7 hurts.8 Peeling paint, damaged windows,9 roaches and mice, inadequate heat and hot water.10 The landlord complains that their fuel - - they11 have to pay for the fuel. I don't get good heat in12 the apartment. I don't know what they doing with13 the fuel.14 Another thing is security.	The15 building is a private building and there' s always16 someone in the building that doesn' t live there17 like homeless and young people hanging out in the18 stairwell smoking marijuana, people having a19 barbecue on the rooftop, Jehovah Witness going20 from door to door.	Even a stray dog that urinated21 and defecated in the hallway.22 All that traffic has the building23 very filthy. The floors in the building are24 streaked with sticky substance. There's debris,25 dead mice and beer bottles left on the floor. Even
2 the super, when he mops the hallways, he mops it3 with a dirty mop leaving a foul odor in the air.4 There are lights that are blown out5 in the hallway, leaks in the hallway ceiling,6 peeling paint, broken mailboxes. The elevator is7 graffitied up, dirty and frequently out of8 service. The front door of the building is damaged9	and gets stuck making it hard to open the door.10 Also the front of the building needs11 to be cleaned. The landlord has renovated over 1212 apartments but the tenants have moved out because13 the landlord neglected to repair the conditions.14 That is evidence that the apartments needs to be15 repaired.16 As for security, the roof needs a17 sensor to prevent people to go up to the roof.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap19 up.20 MS. ESTELLE ORTIZ:	I'm asking,21 please, freeze the rents.22 (Audience participation.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Question.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.
2 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Quick question.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question. Ms.4 Ortiz, a question. Right here.5 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Since the6 conditions have deteriorated, have you had to pay7 a rent increase?8 MS. ESTELLE ORTIZ:	Yes.9 MR. LANGUEDOC:	How much is10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is that the same11 building - -12 MS. ESTELLE ORTIZ:	The reason - -13 MR . LANGUEDOC:	No. She was 920.14 You have the same landlord as Ms.15 Lopez.16 MS. ESTELLE ORTIZ:	Yes.17 MR. LANGUEDOC:	But a different18 building.19 MS. ESTELLE ORTIZ:	And the reason20 for that, the landlord is more interested in21 renovating the apartments and increasing the22 rents.	So the people that are not getting the23 service, they' ll move out. And he's been24 converting the apartments.	A one-bedroom25 apartment is now a two-bedroom apartment. The
2 living room is now a kitchenette. And the kitchen3 is now a bedroom. And that's $1,400. I pay $7274 and $737 and that's really hard for me.5	MR. LANGUEDOC:	What do you have, a6 one-bedroom?7 MS. ESTELLE ORTIZ:	A one-bedroom8 apartment.9 When I move out, that will be10 converted into a two-bedroom apartment.11	MS. HOLDER:	And how long have you12 been there?13 MS. ESTELLE ORTIZ:	Nine years.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Lydia Hernandez;18 Follow by Delia Mogrovejo;19 Followed by Doris Pena.20 Go ahead.21 MS. LYDIA HERNANDEZ:	Hello. My22 name is Lydia Hernandez.23 I live at 1113 Willoughby for eleven24 years.25 There's no landlord at all. The
2	building is abandoned. I have my apartment all3 destroyed. There's cockroaches and rats and4 everything and I'm very sick of that because I've5 been there for 11 years and they haven' t done6 nothing for me.7 And then I broke my leg because the8 stairs was broken and I lost my job because I9 can't work no more.	I live on disability. It's10 not fair because I was working for nine years and11 now I can't work at all.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	If there's no13 landlord, do you pay rent?	Who' s collecting14 rent?15 MS. LYDIA HERNANDEZ:	Not right16 now, no, because we don't know who to pay the rent17 to.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.

My name is Delia Mogrovejo.15 She lives at 46 Wyckoff Avenue in Brooklyn.16 And I'm here to ask you in the name17 of the community and myself that there be  no18 increase in the rents.	The conditions in our19 apartments are very bad. Three apartments are full20 of roaches and other vermin and in the wintertime21 we don't have heat and hot water.22 And I'm speaking not just for  myself23 but for my neighbors as well.

So14 does the Bushwick Housing Independence Project,15 okay.16 I remember having to grow up in17 these conditions and these are not apartments18 where children are supposed to be raised, okay.19 Senior citizens can't live in these conditions.20 The rent increase is just preposterous. It's21 ridiculous.22 Like, some of these apartments that23 you've seen in those apartments I visited24 personally. I took some of those pictures, okay.25 The showers are falling apart, okay. The ceilings
2	are caving in. The floors are deteriorated.3	There is one tenant.	Her name is4 Ms. Jackson. I know her. She cannot return to her5 apartment and she is homebound. She is living in a6 nursing home because her apartment is infested7 with bedbugs, okay. There are crooked stairs.8 People could easily fall. I tripped like and I'm9 young. Come on.10 When - - my question is when will11 landlords stop being greedy?	When will rent12 increases stop?	Okay. Is it when a rusty pipe13 finally falls on somebody and critically injures14 them.	Like, the landlords should be paying the15 tenants to live in these conditions.16 I actually - -17 (Audience participation.)18 MS. ERICA COCA:	I mean I don't19 know anyone personally, but i totally hold the20 Rent Guidelines Board responsible for this crisis.21 And I just want to say, my question22 is, when - - not even when, what kind of guilt are23 you going to feel when you're putting men, women,24 children, entire families on the streets because25 they no long can support the rent.

2 Mr. Schaeffer;3 And then we'll take that gentleman4 who raised his hand.5 Mr. Baylis.6 MR. DAGAN BAYLIS:	All right.7 Thank you very much. Good evening.8	My name is Dagan Baylis.	I'm a9 social worker and a tenant organizer with10 Neighbors Helping Neighbors in Sunset Park,11 Brooklyn.	And I just want to make a few comments.12 One is that I meet with people13 daily. I visit them in their homes, in their14 buildings. I go to the Housing Court with them. I15 have a pretty good sense of what' s going on in the16 community as far tenants.17 The Section 8 standard is supposed18 to be 30 percent of income for rent. And I see a19 lot of people that are paying closer to 80 or in20 excess. It's amazing how people are able to21 stretch a dollar.22 And the subsidies that are23 available, PREPS (phonetic) has a sunset.	It24 lasts about five years.	SCRIE frequently, by the25 time people have weathered rent increases, rent9 
2 stabilized increases to get there, they're already3 way beyond an affordable margin.	HSP is phased4 out for people that are coming out of shelters. It5 doesn' t exist anymore. I just called today.6 Public assistance is inadequate.7 Section 8, as we know, is closed.	So what are8 people supposed to do? People are in dire9 circumstances. They have to choose between paying10 for medicine, school expenses, food, basic11 utilities. It's a hard calculation for people.12 And people who are in extreme13 hardship forces them into a situation of super14 high occupancy, homelessness or skipping on15 essentials.	And we balance this against landlords16 for whom, you know, the rent increases or small17 adjustments in their profit margin. There was a18 gentleman speaking before about his hardships.19 My opinion is that, you know, if20 these people can't afford to run their business,21 then why don't they invest in something else? I22 mean you work for Goldman Sachs. I mean why don't23 they buy mutual funds?24 You know, nobody' s telling them to25 be a landlord and so that' s basically what I want
2 to say. I think that maybe the landlords need a3 little bit of fiscal discipline and maybe we can4 work things out.5 Thank you very much.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7	(Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schaeffer.9 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Question.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.	Question,11 Mr Baylis. Mr. Baylis, there's a question.12 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Could you just tell13 us what are you seeing in rents for new14 apartments, new rent stabilized apartments in15 Sunset Park?16 MR. DAGAN BAYLIS:	Well, that's a17 big part of this issue is that if people are18 priced out of their apartments, their landlords19 say if you don't like it, just get out and leave.20 If they complain about conditions, get out and21 leave. This is the standard phraseology that22 they're using.23 And there are not apartments that24 are within the price ranges set for these25 subsidies.	You know, PREPS, the ceiling for a
 2 family of four is something like $950. I don't see3 any apartments that are renting for that much and,4 you know, and we have people that are looking to5 try and rent a room and their family is too big6 and they can maybe pay $600 and there's nothing7 for that price.8 Frequently the landlords that are9 renovating apartments and renting them are looking10 to bring in people from Park Slope and other areas11 or white people from Oklahoma or wherever they're12 coming from. And they're looking for $1,500 for a13 two-bedroom or more. There's very little under 14	$1,000.15 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And this is Sunset16 Park, right, which is traditionally a neighborhood17 for working class, low to middle income - -18 MR. DAGAN BAYLIS:	Sunset Park.19 That 1  s correct, that' s correct . Not for long.20 MR . LANGUEDOC:	Right. Okay.21 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.22 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schaeffer,25 go ahead.15 
1	3122	MR. KENNY SCHAEFFER:	Thank you.3 Yes.4 My name is Kenny Schaeffer.	I'm a5 rent stabilized tenant.6 I lived in my present apartment for7 15 years. The rent is now $1,466. It's practically8 doubled in the time I've been there. It's solely9 due to Rent Guidelines Board increases. I've been10 raising my four daughters there.11 I'm the Vice Chair of the12 Metropolitan Council on Housing. And most relevant13 to tonights meeting, I'm a Legal Aid housing14 attorney here in Queens where 47.6 percent of15 housing is rent regulated.16 There are 195,000 rent stabilized17 apartments that are at risk and I can tell you18 that my clients are really suffering.19 Many of them live in very bad20 conditions. Half of them have mice and mold and21 other conditions and they're really struggling to22 pay the rents. And I want to address the five23 public members tonight.24 As you know, because of the lack of25 New York City Home Rule, you're the only New York
2 City representatives that can do anything about3 the housing affordability crisis. And I understand4 that most of you come from the business and5 finance world. You' re not really representative of6 a two and a half million rent stabilized New7 Yorkers with a median income of $32,000.8 You don't personally experience the9 crushing affordability crisis that is typical for10 New Yorkers.	But like members of the New York11 City Police department and the New York City Fire12 Department, you may not live in our communities13 but you've accepted a solemn responsibility to14 protect us.15 And when New York City passed the16 Rent Stabilization Law in 1969, it recognized and17 de cleared a "grave emergency."	And it created18 the Rent Stabilization Law and the Rent Guidelines19 Board "to prevent oppressive, unwarranted and20 abnormal increases in rent - - to prevent actions21 of unjust, unreasonable and oppressive rents and22 rental agreements which produce serious threats to23 the public health, safety and general welfare. "24 And yet I've heard the Rent25 Guidelines Board members say year after year that
1	3142 you're not a welfare agency. But you are. You were3 created to protect the general welfare.4 And by saying that you're not a5 welfare agency - - I've seen Rent Guidelines Board6 members year after year turn a blind eye and a7 deaf ear and close their hearts to the suffering8 that you hear about and say there' s nothing we can9 do but raise rents year after year after year. And10 guess what, the crisis and the homeless crisis11 have gotten steadily worse since the Rent12 Guidelines Board was created.13 And I've heard it said that well,14 the housing affordability crisis only effects the15 lowest quintile, the lowest one-fifth of the16 population, only 500,000 men, women and children17 who are suffering unbearably as we sit and stand18 here tonight, but that' s actually not the case.19 The median burden for all rent20 stabilized tenants has now risen above 30 percent21 which is the federal hardship level. More than22 half, more than a million people are experiencing23 housing hardship. There is a grave emergency.24 And if you look at - - if you want to25 look at how middle income people are doing, you
2 just have to look at the selective findings of the3 2005 Housing and Vacancy survey which is available4 on the Rent Guidelines Board website.	And if you5 compare the pre-1947 rent stabilized stock to the6 post-1947 rent stabilized stock, you get a sense7 of how middle income tenants are doing. Because8 people in the pre- '47 stock, the rents are lower,9 the incomes are lower. People in the post- '4710 stock, the rents are higher and the incomes are11 higher.12 And what you see if you look at13 Table 12 is that median rents rose from 2004 to14 2005 in the pre-47' s by 4.4 percent to $810. But15 in the post- '47s by 6.8 percent to $899.16 If you look at Table 9, you'll see17 that the median income in the pre-47' s went down18 5.6 percent but the median income in the post-47's19 went down by a whopping 11 percent.20 And if you look at Table 15, you'll21 see that both groups are now paying more than 3022 percent of their income thanks in large part to23 the compounded, unwarranted and oppressive rent24 increases that have been passed year after year by25 the Rent Guidelines Board.2

Profits are skyrocketing.8 Please do your job and protect us.9	(Audience participation.)10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11	We have a question from Ms. Holder.12 MS. HOLDER:	I'm sorry.	I didn't13 tell you, Chair, Kenny Schaeffer does work for the14 Legal Aid in our Queens office. And I've known15 Kenny and known of Kenny even before I went to law16 school.17 Thank you for coming out tonight.18 MR. KENNY SCHAEFFER:	Pleasure.19 MS. HOLDER:	I appreciate it.20 When you think about the years that21 you've been doing this work and with your work on22 Met Council and you see the increases that this23 Board has given, can you tell me the impact you24 think that's had on the outer boroughs as well as25 Manhattan.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840- 1167521 Fifth Avenue, 17th floor, New York, New York  10175
1	3172	MR. KENNY SCHAEFFER:	Yes. 3 I was actually surprised 'cause I4 worked in Manhattan until coming to queens about a5 year and a half ago.	And, you know, I think that6 ten years ago in Queens there were apartments7 renting for $700, $800. My clients now when they8 have to move - because there' s a lot of 9 unregulated housing - can't find things for less 10	than $1,200, $1,300, $1,500.11 I know in the Bronx, I know in12 Harlem where I worked before, I know in places all13 over Brooklyn they're just isn't affordable14 housing that could be found.15 MS. HOLDER:	And this Board also16 in the last couple of years has actually gone away17 from what typically was seen between the one and18 two-year renewals as two-point spreads to now19 three-points spreads .20 Can you address how that has an21 impact on tenants in New York City.2 2	MR. KENNY SCHAEFFER:	Yes.23 I know when the spread was lower,24 people would like to sign a two-year renewal just25 for the stability.	People who haven' t gone to law
2 school and don't know their rights are afraid that3 if they don't sign a two-year lease, they might be4 subjected to eviction before that. They just like5 the security and the predictability of knowing6 what the rent is going to be.7 And it's cheaper that way then to8 have to do it twice and get it compounded . But9 when the spread is higher, people can't afford it.10 And I myself sometimes have been in that situation11 as a rent stabilized tenant, not afford to take a12 two-year renewal and have to take a one-year and13 then get it compounded by taking another renewal14 the following year.	So it's inflating rents.15 MS. HOLDER:	And this Board16 continues to grapple and, of course, I know that17 you're familiar with some proposed provisos that18 we've submitted and Corp. Counsel has had an19 opinion about and the Legal Aid Society has an20 opinion, and I hope there can be more21 conversation.22 But looking through all your years23 of what the Rent Guidelines Board has done with24 hotels with apartments, resolutions that this25 Board has actually proposed - and I know you've
2 been here for most of it through the years - what3 is it that you think that this Board should look4 at in terms of moving away from the5 one- size-fits-all approach?6 MR . KENNY SCHAEFFER:	Well, I think7 that you should adopt some of the provisos that8 have been suggested, including not allowing9 increases to owners that have five more hazardous10 violations per unit; not allowing increases to11 owners who have not registered all of the rent12 regulated units in the building; not allowing13 increases when owners have 20 percent or more14 deregulated units in their building because that15 will - - that will provide appropriate relief in16 those cases.17 And, you know, very often the point18 of legislation is not to punish, but to create an19 incentive for people to do the right thing .20 Owners, if they're not getting rent increases,21 will make those repairs. They'll register those22 buildings. And it will - - yeah, I believe it's23 legal and I believe it will be beneficial to adopt24 those provisos .25 MS. HOLDER:	Is there anything else
2	you think this Board can or should do?3	MR. KENNY SCHAEFFER:	Just, again,4 take another look at Section 26.501 of the Rent5 Stabilization Law, the law that created the Rent6 Guidelines Board.	When they talk about what the7 purpose of the Rent Stabilization Law is, is what8 you're supposed to be protecting people from.9 It's true that Section 510 says you10 have to look at all sorts of figures and you have11 to look at everything. But the purpose of the Rent12 Stabilization Law is to protect the public from13 rents they can't afford.14 When more than half of the two and a15 half million people living in rent stabilized16 apartments are at the federal hardship level, you17 know, just take a fresh look at it.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you so much.20 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.21 (Applause.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sir, make sure23 you give us your name.24 MR. VASHAWN WRIGHT:	Hello.	Good25 evening.
2 My name is Vashawn Wright. I am a3 longtime resident of New York City, I would say of4 New York since 1974 except for four years of my5 life when I moved out.6 My parents worked here. My father7 worked for the Transit Authority for over 208 years.9 I'm basically here tonight to find10 out what this Board stands for because like many11 things that are going on right now, you know, the12 truth is being seen.	But we, as the public, are13 being given a venue to speak and ask questions.14 My basic question is, what does this15 Board stand for?	When you have examples year16 after year - because this is not the first year -17 of conditions being supported by landlords where18 children are living in inhumane situations,19 inhospitable, and being forced by whatever means20 the landlords have at their beckon call, whether21 it be Police or whatever other sort of authority22 that they use, to keep them there and to force23 them into paying all kinds of monies and jacking24 up rents.25 And the way things are going in this
2 City it seems like everything is being gentrified,3 everything.	Native New Yorkers will become a4 thing of the past.	Working class people in5 certain sections, I guess whatever the hidden6 agendas are, are laid out for certain groups of7 people to stay here.	But for the most part, it8 seems like the rich are beginning to pick out9 their spots and cultivate.10 My basic question is, what does this11 Board stand for if not for those who it was set up12 for?	Because the rich don't really need a meeting13 like this. The poor people do. And I want to know14 a simple answer, what do you stand for? Because15 other than saying no more rent increases, you16 really are supporting the rich.17 And it just comes out.	But we go18 through this elaborate thing of having a certain19 amount of time for people to come out and speak20 their piece, to show the symbolic gestures of what21 this Board can prevent or what it will allow to22 happen.23 And I am a person who is sensible24 and is willing to listen and not judge a person on25 face value, but see what they say. See what theyROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167521 Fifth Avenue, 17th floor, New York, New York 10175
2 represent and see what they stand for, and then I3 either support or get support from the.4 What I'm trying to find out is what5 does this Board stand for.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 (Applause.)8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there anybody9	else in the audience that wishes to speak?10 (No response.)11 MR. VASHAWN WRIGHT:	You're not12 going to answer the question?	Some people are13 left out.	You didn't answer the question. I just14 want to know, will you answer my question? What do15 you stand for?	Is it for the almighty dollar or 1617 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	If anybody18 not seeing anybody, this meeting' s adjourned.19 The next meeting - -20 MS. ADAMS:	No, no.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oh. Go ahead.22 MS. ANNE BOREL:	Well, I had23 forgotten to say something.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Did you speak25 before?ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167521 Fifth Avenue, 17th floor, New York, New York  10175

ANNE BOREL:	Well, i was6 writing something to submit it thinking I could7 submit it before you - - but then I thought since8 you just said is there anybody else, I thought9 maybe I'd just read it. It's just going to take10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Go ahead.11 Read it.12 MS. ANNE BOREL:	One thing I wanted13 to say - -14 MS. HOLDER:	State your name again,15 please.16 MS. ANNE BOREL:	Oh, Anne Borel.17 And I had read a statement. And I do18 want to just throw this in, although I don't know,19 someone said it's not that relevant.20 Just that the developer that bought21 our buildings, he' s taking away all the22 preferential rents so that your rent goes up $30023 or $400 a month in addition to your increase. I24 did want to mention that.25 But the statement I was going to say
1	3252 it was more general.	But let me read it.3 In addition to my oral testimony I4 would like to add that there is currently taking5 place in Harlem and Hamilton Heights, a deliberate6 change in complexion of the community which puts7 money in the pocket of the developer .8 The very last property that is9 affordable in the hands of a few developers who10 are trying to	the very last property that is11 affordable is in the hands of a few developers who12 manipulate the system for their benefit.13 Landlords are given tax breaks when14 they purchase buildings in low rent areas and they15 simultaneously get grants from DHCR to make16 improvements.17 DHCR and HPD do not have cross18 referencing so that developers can provide19 inconsistent and/or false information to one or20 the other or both agencies and thus double dip.21 The result is the displacement of22 thousands of New York City families. I can't read23 it. But anyway, that was the point .24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We appreciate25 it .	Thank you .

ADAMS:	I just have one thing,7	Mr. Chairman.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.9 MS . ADAMS:	One of the things that10 we had said before was that the Board would not11 take time discussing matters12 A VOICE:	Use the mike.13 MS. ADAMS:	- - that were not14 approved by Corporation Counsel.	One of the15 things that' s resonated with me is the16 one- size-fits- all kind of approach that we've17 taken.18 And I would just like for our staff19 to raise that question with Corporation Counsel.20 And if it does make sense, let's spend some time21 talking about it.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What question?23 MS . ADAMS:	The business of24 whether or not we can come up with a25 recommendation that has to do with the larger
1	3272 developments as opposed to say those of 50 units3 or less.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The question is5	whether we can make a distinction6 MS. ADAMS:	Exactly.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	by size.8 MS. ADAMS:	Exactly.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. We' ll ask10 that question. That' s not - - fine. Whether a11 guideline, either way, higher, lower, for making a12 distinction between buildings under 50, under 10,13 under 2, whatever.14 MS. ADAMS:	Yes.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We'll ask that16 question.17 MS. HOLDER:	We should be able to do18 that.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That' s fine.20 MS.
