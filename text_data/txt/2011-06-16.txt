I wanted to let people know, don’t be nervous.             I will read you something off the DHCR Web site.                  Tenants who reside in apartments that are rent controlled or rent stabilized shouldbe aware that the laws affecting these unitsexpired at 12:01 a.m. on June 16th. Governor Cuomo is committed to renewing and strengthening these laws and is working with legislative leaders to doso.During this time when the rentlaws have expired, tenants who believe they are  victims of harassment may contact Housing Community Renewal at their toll free number which is855-391-4526.             Tenants will also be able to send in complaints via e-mail usingrentlaws2011@nyshcr@org. Tenants may also contact the Office of the Attorney General.             Tenants with specific issues may contact HCR with their questions.It is expected that the lapse ofthe rent laws will be temporary.

And I’d like to welcome you to the first of two public hearings of the New York City Rent Guidelines Board concerning the proposed guidelines which were adopted by this board on May 3rd.             The second and final public hearing to comment on the proposed rentaladjustments will be held on Monday, June 20th at 10:00 a.m. at the Great Hall at Cooper Union, 7 East 7th Street in Manhattan.             You can pre-register to speak by calling the Rent Guidelines Board offices at212-385-2934. Pre-registration ends on June 17th at 1:00 p.m.             A couple of announcements before we get started.                  I would like to advise everyone, I know people are probably aware that the RentROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556123456789101112131415161718192021222324258the best thing to do is to stay informed.Rent stabilization –- rentstabilized tenants should have a lease or renewal lease currently in effect.  The terms of your lease, including the rent, remain unchanged until the expiration of your lease.             We will also be putting updates, as they are available, on our Web site which is housing.nyc.com.A few more announcements.                  The final vote on the rent guidelines will be held at Cooper Union on Monday, June 27th starting at 5:30 p.m.Board members, in your foldersyou will find a memo from RGB staff and drafts of both the hotel and apartment explanatory statements and findings will be distributed to board memberson Monday.             Before we begin our hearing, I would like to give you some of the rules andparameters for those who are testifying before the board.You will note the clock; eachspeaker will have three minutes from the time hisROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

If there are a large number of people who show up, right now it’s not a problem, we may reduce the allotted speaking time.I will try to call several namesin advance so you have an idea when you will be speaking.If you have materials todistribute to the board, you should give them to the sign-in table staff. You may also choose to distribute these materials yourself to the board member –- to the board members.            The clock will beep once when you have 30 seconds left. Try to bring your remarks to a close.If there are questions posed toyou by board members, you will be given additional time to respond.            So with that in mind, we will start our hearing.The first speaker, WilliamStanford, who will be followed by James Anderson, who will be followed by James Jones.Mr. Stanford.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242511right. Look, we asked questions tonight and you’re not used to holding the mike, thanks to you.My first question was, is thereany particular reason why you don’t hold a public hearing in Staten Island in the last five years?And my second question is, isthere any particular reason why you changed your public meeting site? For a long time your public meetings were held at 22 Reade Street. You changed the site to 1 Centre Street, why, I don’t know.There is chaos in that building.            Any particular reason why? I’m just kind of curious.            CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: Just wanted to have a change of venue.            MR. STANFORD:  I’m not buying that. I’m not. 22 Reade Street was easy to deal with, 22 Reade Street was easy to deal with, 1 Centre Street is harder to deal with, if you don’talready know. You know, and this is supposed to be a New York City Rent Guidelines Board but Staten Island is part of this region and you avoided it outright in the last five years which doesn’t make any sense.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242510MR. STANFORD:  That’s Mr. X toyou. But that’s another story.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:   Mr. X. I’msorry.            MR. STANFORD:   Yeah.  I got a question for you.  Is there any particular reason why you would never held a public hearing in Staten Island in the last five years? You never had onein Staten Island. You have one in every borough except Staten Island. Is there any particular reason why you didn’t have one there?A VOICE: (Inaudible.)MR. STANFORD:  I didn’t hearthat.            I’m just kind of curious, any particular reason why you didn’t hold a public hearing in Staten Island in the last five years?            Also, another question, the public meetings were held at 1 Centre Street for a long time. You changed –- no, they were held at 22 Reade Street.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: Speak into themike.MR. STANFORD: Oh, okay. AllROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242512            Over the years, you made your decisions but you never focus on those who live in shelters like myself. Why? Do you have something against us? You have no comment. I see. It’s like I’m dealing with the MTA here. Dealing with the Rent Guidelines Board is like dealing with the MTA board, only they're ten times more comical.            I want to say one thing. You need to get it together or throw in the towel like the Golden Boy Oscar (phonetic) what he did for"boxing" back in Madison Square Garden many years ago. Because yous getting outrageous. You really are. You getting outrageous with your rules, your decisions, time, your time changing frame, you address changing frame.            I don’t find that amusing. I really don’t. That’s it for now. But like I say,you need to get it together or throw in the towel like the Golden Boy Scarlett (phonetic) because you’re really getting on my nerves. It’s like dealing with you is like dealing with the MTA.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:  Thank you.Mr. Anderson.MR.

That is the problem that is going on.            The problems definitely go up for everybody, tax, fuel, insurance, everything. I hear of this kind of two people, they declare that expenses are to manage the building, zero. They are liars. They are Mrs. And Mr. Zero.Anyway. And nobody don’t takecare for us. I don’t blame you because you probably will vote for it. The Chairman declared three tofive dollars for -- five percent for one year or six to nine for two years. Looks correct.            But how many homeless to take care of –- they don’t care. The small City Planning, only criminals, stole that money and somethingwrong and hearing, they cannot do nothing about it.            City Council also must be try something to do for real estate but they don’t care.

Because you –- you appointed of Mayor.That’s all to make this legal and nice. Anybody who compensates you and don’t understand lease, they just blame you out. Don’t be scared. Don’t–- don’t hesitate.So City Councils, they not herefor us but because they busy to decided for how much rise them salary and decide ten percent, maybe more for rise them salary, commissioner salary.Even the Mayor makes Mayor receive $225, second salary in the United States after the president.And second one after the president is the vice president, Speaker of the House and a few others, not the Mayor, but this will be the time, so justbe serious, don’t be scared and make right decision.I appreciate that you corrected meif I talk something wrong, except these two people who are Mr. And Mrs. Zero, both wrong, they say about real estate.

We’ve been getting increases in taxes. We’ve also beengetting some increases in insurance.So, basically, the operatingexpenses of our buildings are not keeping up with the increases that we’re getting from the board.             We’re also having problems with the –- from the general comment –- because sometimes our tenants are moving in additional family members in with them because they’re suffering from the general economy, but also, it runs up my costs as well because that, again,involves more water and heat and, you know, the other expenses that -– that we’re running into.             So we would ask the board to really, basically, align the cost increases thatyou have with the cost increases that you have forROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242518             MR.

And the same thing with taxes as well. It just follows the City budget and the increases that we get as landlords are not keeping up with the rate of increase that we, in order to keep our buildings operated in a safe condition.Thank you.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:   Thank you.Yes, Ms. Adams.             MS.

HOLDER:  Okay.MR. FENTON: Thank you. CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:  Thank you.Eduardo Sanchez.             MR. SANCHEZ: Hello. My name is Eduardo Sanchez and I live in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.I am also a social worker in ahomeless shelter named Valley Lodge. I am here as an advocate for the homeless and a tenant.             And thank you for the opportunity to testify at this very important hearing.             Within my borough there are thousands of rent stabilized units which are constantly at risk of being lost.  Citywide, according to the Rent Guidelines Board, more than 18,000 units of affordable housing have been lost in 2009 alone and 3,000 of those units were in Brooklyn.             And since 1984, Brooklyn has lost 10,000 units of affordable housing. And many of these individuals have lived in these units, likeour shelter residents, lived in these neighborhoods through the good and bad times.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

We’re seeingmore and more of what we term the economic homeless coming into the shelter system.  People that hadjobs and paid rent but because of the economy cannot keep pace.             Many of our folks are on fixed incomes and cannot afford to pay what is deemed affordable housing rents.  And acknowledging theawful economy, the City actually slashed the number of affordable units they hoped to create byone-third from 92,000 to 63,000.             We say if the City can’t assure us that it will build the housing we need, then it makes the case that we need to preserve every single affordable housing unit currently in place. We say there is no time like today to freeze rents.             Our clients at Valley Lodge also  made the point that rent de-stabilization will only result in more homelessness and a greater cost tothe City to build more homeless shelters. And the creation of more homeless shelters only perpetuates problems and does not create solutions.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242531(No response.)             CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: Thomas Diana, who will followed by Clara Perez-Joseph, who will be followed by Ruben Santiago.             MR. DIANA: Hi. I was hoping that this year you would gain some inspiration from watching Judge Judy instead of dreaming up all goofy math to create financial tragedy.             You can’t just keep giving landlords percentage increases which, at best,equal half the actual cost increases and force us to pile on the increases to tenants who aren’t paying their fair share.             You can’t just ignore tens of thousands of dollars in real annual expenses and losses at your bureaucratic convenience to claim we’re making big profits.  You have to listen to what the wise guys say, not what they want you to hear.             Tenants sort of proclaim they are paying half of their income for rent. Yet they can’t explain why they’re not filling out a simple two-page SCRIE application.  Their actual rent inreal money is always a riddle, divided by a mysteryROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242530The recession continues to hithard and if you don’t freeze rents, these increases will continue to affect vulnerable individuals,even more so at a time with rising unemployment and a growing number of individuals in housing who are facing eviction.             The now defunct Advantage Program may result in an additional 15,000 individuals losing their apartments. Many of our clients and friends live in fear of harassment and sometimes experience it directly when de-stabilizing apartments and schools in our -- are at the heart of what makes New York City home, its tenants.It is pretty clear that those atthe bottom of the City’s economy will be hit the hardest if the economy does not get better.Therefore, I ask the Rent Guidelines Board to freeze rents now in order to provide some relief. We need affordable housing in this City. Please save it.Thank you, again.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:   Thank you.(Applause.)CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:  Questions?ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242532income, multiplied by "it’s none of your business."             The New York City Budget Office estimates that only 40 percent of those supposedly eligible tenants actually bother to fill out aSCRIE application. That’s about 75,000 tenants remaining.So why can’t I give away theseSCRIE applications? Apparently no one lives in the 90,000 apartments which rent for under $300 a month. Several hundred thousand grace us with their presence at apartments rented for less than your own cost calculations or the SCRIE threshold.             Just read the newspapers. Read a little between the lines.  7,000 single adultsfreeloaders in taxpayer supported apartments –- you have four bedrooms. Okay? Another 9,000 that have two bedrooms per resident.  That’s several times more than the people that doubled up.             When you bother to ask the tenants what two and three jobs they’re working, it’s also-- always seems to be these part-time jobs. They’re pet mind readers, unemployed models, writers, you know, we gotta get a real job here.In 22 years I’ve never askedROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

It always has been because the tenants crashed and burned with drugs, alcohol and useless lovers. My last tenant/model was asked to leave because she was too special to get a realjob. So the homeless princess is now living with friends and I got screwed for $7,000 in –- in rent.Another one moved in and she quither job the day she moved in.  So –- then she went on a rent strike. What you really need to do is implement a standard $50 low rent adjustment which is tied directly to the SCRIE and DRIE. Okay?  And this way destitute seniors would not have to pay a dime in increases and then calculate the lower percentage increases for the tenants that arereally paying their fair share.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:   Wrap it up.MR.

And I don’t understand why we always begin –- it seems that we begin the first question with, how much the rent increase should be as opposed to whether we need a rent increase at all.             And I think the Rent Guidelines Board was here to mull over the first –- that question, do we need one at all more than weresupposed to mull over how much that increase should be. And we always seem to jump to the second one, and I found that very disappointing.            Perhaps this year at some point we can really do that investigation.  And I know, it was RSA that said that maybe we should open thetenants' books to see if they make enough money to be here. Perhaps we could do that also open the landlord’s books to see if they deserve any rentROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242551are leaving New York City because they cannot afford to live here. The landlords, however, are making money.All I’m saying, let us discussthis issue of whether we deserve one. Should there be a rent increase?  I’m begging the public  members. I understand they already did their –-  their range, but we should really, really consider rethinking these things because these guys and the landlords –- I’m sorry, the tenants lose every single year.And I know the action may be amind made up of we're going to do an increase. But the public members, again, I’m begging you to consider this a time to define yourself as public members, to really look out for the public not the landlords.  We know they’ve been taken care of.They're been taken care of if you look at our reports. It is the tenants who are not.So I’m begging you to redefinethis Rent Guidelines Board as something real and not just a sham that does the same thing year in and year out.Thank you.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242550increases at all. Maybe that’s something that we can talk about.            As the public members, I’m begging the public members to really define themselves here and really be public members. For many years, you voted on with landlords and I understand why the landlords are here. I understand what it is they’re supposed to be doing. But the public member, I really believe, is supposed to be the ones   thatmull it over.             And we ask this question and we always say, if we could meet somewhere in the middle, then we’ve done a good job. Which is not the case because every year tenants are the ones that fail. Because every year they get an increase regardless of what’s going on.The past two years, all reportsshow that owners have actually begun to do well.Is this the intrigue we have to make to make sure they make a certain amount of money or they have to reach this level? Tenants are the ones that are suffering so who’s assisting them? There’s nowhere else that is assisting them or can assist them.People, according to the Census,ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242552(Applause.)CHAIRMAN DE CHANCE:  Thank you.Ms. Holder.Mr. Cheigh.            MR.

And I go, you know, I’ve been doing this for, I guess, over two years.  So it’s still the same thing, peoplewho cannot afford –- and the people who live there are not paying rent regulated or rent controlled apartments because they have a lot of money.They’re paying that because they can’t afford to pay more money.             And if they have no money, I’m  sure they would love to live in better conditioned buildings.

CRUZ: No. I was –- based on your personal observations and your personalROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242554             MS. CRUZ: And would you say that the rents in those –- in those small homes are comparable to the rent regulated homes?             MR. WILLIAMS:  I would –- I mean, it depends whether you’re talking about that, youknow, I think the rent regulated apartments provide affordability that the non-regulated ones don’t.But I will tell you that in my apartments, I haven’t raised the rent in quite some time. Because, they said to me they can’t pay it actually.MS. CRUZ:	Right.COUNCILMAN WILLIAMS:  So if I wasa different type of owner, I might try to kick them out and get someone else in, but I chose not to do that because of the line of work that I do.             MS. CRUZ: Right. Of course. But even if you were –- even if the owner wasn’t a public servant as you are, –-COUNCILMAN WILLIAMS:   And even ifI wasn’t, just so you know.             MS.

How do you afford being a landlord with the escalating costs; you said you haven’t raised the rent?COUNCILMAN WILLIAMS:  Yeah.  I’m–- sometimes it’s difficult but I guess it’s alsoyou try to gauge, you know, making money versusROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

And I think not destroying someone’s life is more important.            You can make some money. So my –- my theory is always I don’t want owners not to make any money. I just don’t want them to make it offthe backs of people who can’t afford to pay more. And I think, if I’m understanding the question, I think that in the past two years in particular, you’ll see that owners are making money. And, regardless of whether owners are or aren’t making money, there’s always a rent increase.Because a few years ago there-- the claim was that they needed a rent increase because oil prices were going to skyrocket. Oil prices didn't skyrocket the way they thought it was and we still get an increase.            MS. HOLDER: So how long have you been a landlord?COUNCILMAN WILLIAMS: Since I was28. I’m going on 35, so five –- five or six years, something like that.            MS. HOLDER: Okay. And so when you think about what’s going on in yourROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242559MS.

HOLDER:   And when we talk about the conditions, and you were talking about there’s a lot of conditions and you think that some of your constituents may even want to move where there’s better, why are –- why aren’t the conditions being addressed in these apartments?            COUNCILMAN WILLIAMS: Personally, again, I think, it’s a matter of how much money the landlord wants to make.  So in the –- in the issue of Flatbush Gardens, I believe that the plan there when they purchased it was to get the tenants out and deregulate the apartments illegally so they could hike it back up.            So the concern wasn’t there to keep –- the concern was not to keep up thebuilding, the concern was to make as much money as possible. So I don’t think the interest is in that because I, you know, personally, I wouldn’tseparate out big landlords and small landlords. I know you can’t.And I have, and people may findROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242558neighborhood, what are you –- what are you seeing in terms of turnover and gentrification and rent levels?COUNCILMAN WILLIAMS: Thegentrification has happened in some parts. In most of my neighborhood it hasn’t been gentrified yet. It’s coming down that way. It’s –- it’s in Fort Greene, Bed Sty, and I know it will be coming here soon.In certain areas of my district,the unregulated rents have started to go up and, you know, paying for smaller sizes or rooms, it has all started to go up. And, you know, the rent regulated apartments are what people can afford to live, which is one of the reasons Flatbush Gardens will do anything they can to actually try to get people out of the rent regulated apartments so they can hike the –- they can spike the rent back up.            MS. HOLDER: And what are the rent ranges in Flatbush Gardens?COUNCILMAN WILLIAMS: I wouldguess maybe $900 range for maybe a studio or one bedroom, up to about maybe twelvish, thirteen-ish, somewhere around there.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242560this hard to believe, but when I was with -- at the Flatbush Development Corporation, I know the difference between a bad landlord and a good landlord. And I have helped landlords who were having bad tenants, remove that tenant. I’ve shown them how to do that because I’m a fair person.But what I found more often isthat a bad landlord, who affects many, many, many tenants and many times they have the money, they just won’t make the repairs in an effort to move them out and an effort to do some MCIs or 140 prepared so they can get that –- that dollar amount up. Try as far –- as much as they can to get to maybe the $2,000 and remove it.And not just for the rent –- orthe rent protection –- the rent regulations you give us, but also the protections that we give it are not in –- on regular apartments.            MS. HOLDER: But why is it hard for tenants to get the conditions taken care of then?COUNCILMAN WILLIAMS: Well,unfortunately, there’s no –- there’s no teeth in the laws to force the landlords to fix it. So youROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

You do all the things you can but then a lot of times they don’t pay and there’s not a lot of teeth.             If you had Home Rule actually in the City Council, I think we’d do a lot to try to fix that.  Unfortunately, we can’t.

SCHLEIDER:  No, no, you just said you gave HPD through a very narrow slice in the regulations, you found some leeway to be able to do this individual lien sale.  So what I’m hearing is that that was always available to you, you just didn’t think of it before this.COUNCILMAN WILLIAMS:   So if Ihave a bulls eye in front of me and it’s completely clear, I can hit it quicker.  If it’s filled with  puzzles and little things that are blocking, Ican’t hit it.MR. SCHLEIDER:  But -–             MR. WILLIAMS: Excuse me. Let me finish. The lack of home rule makes that bulls eye clouded, makes things in front of it so you have to try to work around it.             MR. SCHLEIDER: So it took you this long, basically, to find your way through to it.  That’s all I’m trying to –- I’m not taking your --ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242562don’t get that.COUNCILMAN WILLIAMS:  So I do a –-I have a lot of conversations with HPD and we’re happy with the new commissioner that’s there. I think they do –- a lot of times they do what they can do up until what the law allows. If we had more flexibility in what we can do, we would push.                 We just –- we actually did just change a law, the City Council did.  Because we don’t have home rule, we have to find very slim areas where we can. So we changed the law for HPD so that they can do standalone lien sales on buildings. And that was something that we thought was innovative and, hopefully, it will work. Upuntil then, we couldn’t do standalone lien sales on people who were not making repairs. Hopefully, that would be something that would work.             If we had home rule, I think it  would open up the world of things that we can to add teeth to it.             MR. SCHLEIDER: When you say up until "then," you mean up until you decided to think about how implement the law to do this. So it wasn’t that you didn’t have the opportunity toROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242564             COUNCILMAN WILLIAMS: However you want to put it.  The fact of the matter is, if youhave home rule, you can do a lot more than that. And you know that.MR. SCHLEIDER:  I know that.That’s not my question.COUNCILMAN WILLIAMS:  Exactly.You know that.             MR. SCHLEIDER:  My question was, all right, and I don’t know if it bears repeating, but I’ll repeat. My question was that this opportunity was always available to you if you had the clarity to –- to seize it.  So just thatluckily now you found your way to this but it wasn’t –- it wasn’t anything impeding you to come to this.  It’s just that you didn’t come to itprior.             COUNCILMAN WILLIAMS: The premise of your question is what the problem is.  There are a lot of opportunities there in all of our livesthat we may not have thought about and we have to figure out ways how to deal with them.MR. SCHLEIDER:  Well, Iunderstand.  I just –-ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

I’m just saying, just because you’ve just discovered something doesn’t mean you weren’t putting everything you could to try to figure out how to do that thing. That’s just what I’m   saying.So there are opportunities abound. MR. SCHLEIDER: Um-hum.MR. WILLIAMS:  All I’m saying is,if you have home rule, those opportunities would open up so much clearer but because it isn’t, it takes a long time to try to figure those opportunities.   I’m happy we finally figured it  out.MR. SCHLEIDER:  So am I.COUNCILMAN WILLIAMS:   And I’mhoping we get some more. But I think home rule would make it so much easier for us to get bad actors to task. And you know that.

Yes, SCRIE is  available, DRIE is available, if you know about them.   A lot of seniors and a lot of  disabledpeople don’t know about them.            Then they have to find a way to get to someone that can help them fill the application out.

How much do you charge for an apartment?COUNCILMAN WILLIAMS:  Well, like Isaid, I separate out small –- I personally separate small homeowners who usually have different –- who I think are actually are closer to the   tenants'issues than the large landlords. So I usually separate that out.A VOICE:  Well, how much do youcharge?COUNCILMAN WILLIAMS:  I can talkto you after.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:  Let’s not –-Tom, let’s not take our time –-             The council member does not have to take questions from the audience right now.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242568information mill.            So, you know, if there was automatic subsidies, I think that would be evenbetter. If you –- if you were above a certain age, you automatically got it. I think that would be better than having to proactively go after   it.             But other than that, there isn’t very much subsidies available. So actually affordable housing’s a problem. Usually whenpeople come to me with affordable housing issues, I’m usually very honest with them and very blunt. There’s not, probably not much that I can do for you because affordable housing is not there and because we don’t have home rule, there’s not much that I can do about it except to steer you,hopefully, to some people that have some apartments that are open.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: Thank you.

I’m a renter in Manhattan.I –- I’m a video editor and withthe tough economic times, I used to have a steady job, a decent source of income and now with the economy down, the video editing jobs have just plummeted so I don’t make nearly as much as I used to.             Anyway, my apartment is, the rent is like $1,985 a month.

I think he managed to destabilize half.And then the whole thing atStuyvesant Town happened and our building is a J51–- has a J51 so I’m not entirely sure on the laws, but I believe then all the places he deregulated are now back under rent stabilization. But they’re still pretty high.

I’ve had to take on several other jobs, none of which put me near my previous salary.             Many of my neighbors and local residents have also had to deal with being unemployed or having their work hours cut, in addition to the myriad of other issues that the economic recession has brought us, including, but not limited to, higher costs of food, electricityand transportation.             Over the last decade many of my neighbors were forced to move because of the high cost of rents. In Community Board 1, rents for tenants have risen astronomically, especially since the 2005 Greenpoint/Williamsburg Waterfront Rezoning.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242583New York City one of the most diverse places in the world have to suffer because of the ultra rich and big real estate interests want to becomes wealthier?             I’ve seen many tax abated properties in the neighborhood, empty lots being built. And in any –- and, again, those are tax abatements so why are they not being –- they’re going to be profiting and they’re profiting off these high rents, so why are they not being penalized?             In ending, I again, recommend that the Rent Guidelines Board freeze the rent increase for all tenants and that you also add no fuel surcharge.Thank you.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:   Thank you.(Applause.)             CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: Can I ask you, what is –- how big is your apartment and what is your rent?MR. DURAN:  My rent is $1,000.And it is a two-bedroom apartment.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:   Two bedroom?ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242582                 The same situation is being played out in all areas of the City as there have beenover 100 zonings in the last decade.I live in a four-unit rentstabilized building and we were negatively affected by the supplemental rent increase that happened not long ago.             Several neighbors already pay more than 30 percent of their income towards rent and because they are on strict budgets such as Disability or are retired, any increase would prevent them from having their basic needs met, such as buying prescription medicine or paying for food.             Not only will this increase be disastrous for many long time residents, it is also completely unnecessary. According to your own statistics, in Brooklyn from ‘08 to ‘09, the median operating income for owners in Brooklyn increased by over 20 percent.             So I leave you with these questions. Why are we not asking those large profiteers to handle their fair share of theburden?

Yeah, that one.The one that had the supplemental one, yes.             And, again, that happened two months after I lost my job because of the recession.  I did not lose my job because of anymalfeasance on my part. It was strictly a budgetary decision that the Department of Ed cut jobs. So I lost my job because of nothing that I had anything to do with and then two months later I was awarded an increase in my rent. If you could say that’s an award.(Laughter.)CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:   Questions?ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

Thankyou.(Applause.)CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:  Mr. Athineos,followed by Gabriela Amari, followed by Burchell Marcus.            MR. ATHINEOS: Good evening, members of the Rent Guidelines Board.            As many of you know, my name is Christopher Athineos and I’m a small property owner from Brooklyn, working with my family, operating several properties here in Brooklyn.            And I come here each year and point out how difficult it is to continue operating rental housing in Brooklyn. This year is no different.            Despite doing a lot of the work ourselves, for which we don’t ever even get paid, we still cannot keep pace with the ever increased need to address long term maintenance issues.The PIOC is so outdated I don’teven see any way that this formula can even comeROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242587before I even apply to the DOT for an application to do the job. Then I have to hire a contractor to do the job. This all costs money. This is not reflected anywhere in the PIOC.            The new tenant, who had just moved in several months ago, broke a windowpane on our landmark door.  The cost just to replace one pane of glass was $400.  I couldn’t believe it myself when I got the bill.  This isn’t reflected anywhere in the PIOC.            Since the tenant refused to pay the bill, I had to pay it. When a tenant vacated their apartment, we found termites in the first floor apartment. All of the floors had to be torn up as well as all the plaster walls had to be tornout to replace the wooden studs in the walls. The sub floor of the floor and the oak flooring, aswell as all the baseboard molding, not to mention the cost of exterminating. I don’t see where this is in the PIOC.            What about the tenant who flushes her cat litter down the toilet and then calls me to tell me that her toilet is clogged?(Laughter.)ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242586close to calculating the increase in costs an owner faces, not to mention the increased frequency of those costs.The basket is so outdated it doesnot begin to address issues like the huge magnolia tree in the rear of my brownstone which hasn’t been pruned in many years. The neighbors in the rear of my building are demanding that I prune it because it has become a safety issue. I’d love to prunethis tree, but the cost for someone to do this is$950.            It’s much more pressing to attend to the plumbing and electrical needs rather than the tree in the yard.I have a sidewalk that theinsurance company has given me 30 days to repair four flags of the sidewalk which are cracked.These are hairline cracks. They’re not raised or depressed. They don’t pose any hazard, yet the insurance company is threatening for me to either repair it and replace those flags or cancel my insurance policy.Being in a Landmark District, Ihave to get a permit from the Landmarks CommissionROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242588            MR. ATHINEOS: Then there’s the tenant who decides to defrost her turkey on Thanksgiving morning in the sink by constantly running the hot water.            The board has taken steps in the past to level the playing field by passing a longevity increase for those tenants paying under$1,000. This is the fair thing to do.  Honestly, there are tenants who are paying stabilized rents which are at market. And many that we know that there are many that are below market.So I would recommend that the–- that you consider a rent increase of six percent for a one-year lease or a minimum rent increase of$60, whichever is greater, or a ten percent increase for a two-year renewal or $100, whichever is greater.Thank you.

And that’s –- that’s the thing, like some people say, oh, 40 percent’sderegulated, so you can make up your money there, you know. But it’s just unfair that why should the deregulated tenants have to bear the burden for the regulated tenants when they have the ability topay.            You know, I get –- I get that all of the time, a little friction between neighbors.You know, oh, I heard my neighbor’s paying $500 andROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

When they did the January inspection, they wrote a violation. I’m like, how could this be? It’s brand new. I mean –- yeah, but they find any little thing.

ATHENIOS:   And I take that,you know, people –- sometimes people say, well, you bought the building, you knew what you were getting into.  You know, if you don’t like it, sell, moveout. But that’s kind of missing the point.             MR. SCHLEIDER: You can say that about anything in life.             MR.

And they don’t even pay like half of the expenses that we pay like real estate taxesROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425108Independence of the Disabled is a not-for-profit, community-based, consumer-directed center, which advocates on behalf of the community of people with disabilities and provides services to promote independence and community participation.             Rent stabilization laws are extremely important, as we all know, to those inthe disabled and senior communities, as well as a general body of low income New Yorkers.1.4 million families in ourcommunity live in rent stabilized apartments, many on fixed budgets and depend on disability rent increase exemption and senior citizen rent increase exemption, which is only for seniors over 65 and for disabled.  And there is a cap, okay, on how much income they can have per year. So that very severely limits the amount of people who are eligible. Okay?Without rent stabilization lawsbeing extended, which currently they are not, and hopefully that will change very soon, these two programs will be moot. Okay?             The figure of 1.4 million families, the operative word being families,ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

So you –- basically, the figurecomes out to roughly 4.5 million people who depend on rent stabilization laws, most of which are lower income people, okay, and seniors and persons with disabilities who all go into that general category.Where am I?  Okay.  With therecent encouragement from Mayor Bloomberg’s office, stating that he thinks the extra funding given to shelter programs has increased the homeless population in shelters, as if people are justgiving up their homes and actually opting for a shelter, the rent stabilization laws are facing huge increase in rent increase percentages is greatly alarming.             The cap for deregulation of rent stabilized apartments increased –- should be increased in favor of tenants because the number is archaic. $2,000 is the deregulation limit. That’s been that way for how many years, 30, 40 years? It’s no longer a large amount of money. Okay.It needs to be increased in favorof the tenants. It truly does. I really hope thatROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425111into our –- our organization and says, I have SSI, where’s the affordable housing?     Affordable.Affordable is a relative term. It depends on who’s saying it.  Okay?            From a landlord’s perspective, affordable is middle to upper income levels where a person on SSI gets $761 maximum per month. They come to us with unrealistic expectations because they’re scared. I need an apartment. I’d like  toget a one bedroom. You have $761 a month. Okay? Sorry.   You might find an SRO room, but lately   those are not available either. Okay.             So that’s one of the main problems that we have is affordability.             The other thing is seniors who are in that gap, they’re not quite eligible, according to their age. Okay? So they don’t fit the SCRIE guideline.Persons with disabilities oftenthey come in, they’ve heard about DRIE, so we do –- we do the application with them. We help them through the process. We also do that with senior citizens. We are available –- but those programs need to be more promoted and put out there for theROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425110you will take these recommendations into consideration.            I thank you so much in advance for your consideration.Thank you.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:   Thank you.(Applause.)CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: Questions?

AMARI: The most common that I see is a, let’s say, an example, a consumer comesROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425112public to know that they are available.            But, basically, a lot of people in rent stabilized buildings come to us. This is thesecond largest problem that we see. That they are being harassed, hassled by landlords. There’s not–- repairs are not being done and that’s usually deliberate because they want these tenants out. Okay.             They don’t want to deal with programs, source of income discrimination, disability discrimination, senior citizen discrimination. We get a lot of this coming through our doors. And, frankly, for communities like mine, affordability in this City is dwindling fast. We need a break. We have a fixed budget. Okay.It’s extremely difficult. Andmany people with disabilities do work. I work part time. That’s all I can manage to do with my disability. And it helps. I’m one of the fortunate people who has a personal subsidy from my family to help me pay the rent. But before that, I went into the hospital because I didn’t have heat for a whole winter in 2000 when it was below freezing, I wentROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

A lot of these people are on their own and have no support.             MS. HOLDER: And when you look at SCRIE and DRIE, what is the income eligibility for those programs?             MS.

And if you make even a dollar over that, you’re not eligible. So it kind of keeps –- people are afraid to go to work. Everyone, oh, get a job, get a job. Well, with the type of job we can get, if anybody willhire us, because even though there’s not supposed to be discrimination, there is for the disabled community and working and employment.It –- we wouldn’t be able to paythe rent, you know, and we’re scared to go to work because it will go over the DRIE guideline and then we lose our DRIE.

And I’ve been struggling to make ends meet these last 12 months.I’ve made numerous repairs andROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425118780,000 vacant apartments that NYCHA is warehousing. We need to look into that and find a way to force NYCHA to make those apartments available for people             Low income families should be low income.  Right.  The landlords don’t need no more–- no more rent, rent increase right now.(Applause.)             MR. MARCUS: It’s too much hardship on people.I want to thank you for listeningto me.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:   Thank you, Mr.Marcus.Thank you.Let me just take a break right now–- not a break. I just want to read something and it’s a statement from the Mayor, and since we’re up here appointed by him, concerning the state law affecting the rent stabilized apartments.             While the expiration of these laws creates unnecessary uncertainty, tenants should not experience any impact while their current leasesare in effect.  The expiration of these laws doesROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425120improvements to the building. I have a very good relationship with my tenants. I’m always reachable and I always address all of my tenants concerns as soon as possible.             This year my property taxes increased by ten percent. And I’m sure that, you know, next year will bring more of the same.             My water and sewer bill has gone up as well. In addition to these fixed costs, unexpected costs come up all the time.  Forexample, my boiler broke down this winter and we had to install a brand new one.  I had to spend tens of thousands of dollars to put in a newboiler.I also would like to replace abroken sidewalk but I can’t because I simply do not generate enough income to cover the cost.             I cannot continue to improve the quality of my building without a fair Guideline increase this year. I realize that this is a tough economy but it affects everyone. It affects me as well as my tenants.             It isn’t fair for me to bear the burden of increasing taxes and operating costsROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

Those units don’t even cover their operating costs even though we have the incredible task of coming up with a one-size-fits allguideline to a problem that is hardly one size.                 Two years ago you took a step in the right direction to creating some form of limited equity in the system. Bringing the rentadjustment helped me meet my operating costs that continue to rise.I ask that you consider putting ina $60 minimum increase for a one-year lease and a$100 minimum increase for a two-year lease for apartments that are renting for less than $1,000 a month.            These are tough times for everyone but if more owners are driven out of the business, there will be a serious deterioration of community and affordable housing stock in New York City.            I thank you again for the opportunity to present my case and I urge you to consider a fair guideline this year.Thank you.

Mitaynes Marcela, to be followed by Elvira Rojas, to be followed by Joycelyn Mingbess.             MS. MITAYNES:  Hello.  Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you.             My name is Marcela Mitaynes and I’m a resident of Sunset Park. I’ve been living there since I was five. I’m now 36 years old.In 2008 I came before the boardand asked for a zero percent increase.   Obviously,   it went ignored. A lot has changed since then. At that time my building got a new owner, Jack Awella (phonetic), who began baseless lawsuits andROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425127            The low income tenants are the ones that suffer.  Out of a building of 30, within  six months in 2008, this one landlord was able to displace almost half and we are still struggling to fight and protect the few that we need.             There are various programs available to those landlords to help the operatingcosts. Some of that were mentioned were SCRIE andDRIE. There’s also a Weatherization program that a landlord can get a brand new boiler, brand new windows and energy efficient appliances.            The MCIs that they talk about, it’s one way the landlords can get their moneyback, but nobody mentions that they are a permanent increase.   So after a couple of years the  tenantspaid off whatever it is, the improvement that they got, the landlord is still collecting  thatincrease.            I ask not just for me, but for my community, a zero increase. We cannot afford anything else.In 2008, I was displaced out of my$625 two-bedroom apartment. I moved two blocks down. I am now paying $1,760. I am a communityROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425126harassment of long term tenants. I was one of his long term tenants.I was paying $624 for atwo-bedroom apartment that I grew up in and I should have been able to pass down to my daughter. His purpose for buying the building was clear. His business plan was to kick the long term   tenantsout, fix the apartments, and raise all the rents.             I lost my two-bedroom apartment due to the harassment. I currently work for Neighbors Helping Neighbors as a tenant advocateand I use my experience to help my community and I advocate for the tenants in the community.             This same landlord now owns ten buildings in Sunset Park. These landlords and large companies such as The Dermott Company, purchase buildings considering them as underdeveloped assets.            Year after year I hear landlords complaining about operating costs. Prior to the purchase, they do get the opportunity to look at the rent rolls, to look at the leases, to know who’s living there, how long they’ve been living there and what they’re paying.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425128worker.

I’m very disappointed to see there isn’t a lot of people, but I can understand how they have lost faith in the system.We’ve come here year after year asking for the same thing.            If any time is a time to give us a zero increase, it’s now.Thank you.

I was living at that time with my husband and my daughter and apparently I was a threat to the landlord because of my low income. Instead of trying to get in touch with my other tenants and organizing and that just made me a larger target.             To this day, even as I’m working for a community organization, I must be very careful when I’m helping the tenants in my old building or in my community.

We’re talking about a couple of years later and the building that I livedin, I think, maybe three of my old tenants are still there.             But the three that were there are there because we were able to get to them in time to help them fight. But it’s also made them a very clear target for him.             MS. HOLDER: And how much are those apartments renting for now?             MS.

HOLDER:  And as an organizerand doing some of the work you do, do you see a lot of units in disrepair and, if so, what is it thattenants can do to try to get conditions addressed in their units?MS. MITAYNES:  It’s verydifficult. We’ve done everything from call 311 to complain to Housing Court but, I mean, in Housing Court all we get is a stipulation where thelandlord says that he will fix what he’s supposed to fix on a certain day. But the day comes and goes and nothing happens. These landlords get fines after fines from HPD but they still don’t get the repairs needed.             MS.

My name isElvira Rojas.             My method of thinking is, if they continue to raise our rents, many of us are going to suffer many consequences. Our wages are not enough.  A lot of tenants are suffering fromunemployment. We have to put up with harassment and apartments in disrepair and threats from landlords.Due to lack of his own lack of doing repairs, he sent me to court. As landlords they don’t see what losses we go through. By going to court we’relosing time away from work and thus wages. Some of us risk losing our jobs for not going to work,despite going through these types of harassments sometimes when we deal with the fire in the building. Then our minds and our homes are more complicated as tenants.I ask that there be no increasesto the rent. And the landlords stop the harassment.I don’t just say it for myself but I say it forother people who find themselves in more critical situations in all types of aspects.Thank you.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:   Thank you.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425135THE INTERPRETER: Yes.MS.

We can’t go for that.             I think, Mr. Cuomo, as I wrote him many letters and will continue writing, I’m very much disappointed in the decision.Thank you. (Applause.)             MS.

But if you should see the situation now, it’s very forceful. It’s very forceful. And there areshelters where people just go in when, 8:00 in the morning because I was at one before I am where I am now.             When you wake up in the morning, you have to be out. And I was with this chair and I wasn’t even in this position because I was 40 plus.  I was actually I’m really sick and you cannot going back until 5:00 in the afternoon.I’m on a low income like manyothers in the shelter and on the streets. We could afford to pay 30 percent of a salary, even if they got to push your hand in, I’d be comfortable and it would cost the government less.So whoever’s concerned, I’mbegging not on my behalf alone, but we as citizens of America, especially as it work hard because it’sthe people that work hard and the income people, we are the sufferers. We cannot pay their increase because they not send –- their increases is going now.

The shelters are basically, from what I see, a regulated jail. You can’t stay there. You got to be outside. That’s ridiculous.  However, let me get back to us.             Without no increases in two years, the rent just over doubled through the building of 320 apartments.  The rents going up.  The foodsgoing up. The job salaries aren’t moving and we’re catching pure D, down on the bottom. Okay.             Instead of zero increases, I think we should go for a 20 percent across the boarddecrease so people can be able to get on their feet and do what they have to do.             Our building is having renovations right now and the renovations are shoddy at best. Everybody in the City, even the rich need some help, but the lower income families need more help to get on their feet, to get where they’re goingand get there in a manner that is respectful, with dignity and the like.And that’s basically all I need tosay.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425144MCI increase?

Everything in the supermarket; I’ve been to the grocery this morning. Two years ago I went to BJ’s and I picked up two bottles of orange juice for $6.50.  This morning I picked them up for$8.50.             Gratiane Eugene has lost her job four years ago.  I worked at the New York StockROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

I have worked hard and I’ve paid my taxes. Unfortunately, when I got raped, I had to stop working because I ended up in the hospital.             I have 27 credits and every time I go to apply for Social Security disability, I’vebeen turned away, because I don’t have 28 credits to receive Social Security Disability.             I have $15,000 saved so I planned on opening a little cleaning service.Unfortunately, I failed with a contract.  I didn’t get a contract of $125,000.  So I lost my $15,000and I had to clean S & J Cleaning Services, which S and J stands for Sarah and Jeremiah. That was a little girl that I lost on Eastern Parkway Service Road, June 20, 2004.  She got hit by an SUV.Please forgive me for that.My light bill is now $140 a month.I had to cut my cable.

So I have phone. I have gas.  I have lights.  My rent is$1,350. I no longer have a job.

It’s right on the corner of Troy and East End Parkway Service Road.             My question today is, for the past 13 years I have lived there, I have had sevendifferent rent receipts with seven different names on it. My rent went from $800 from August 5th, 1999, to $1,319 current today.My building has a lot ofviolations. A lot of repairs needs to be done.

So I’m asking the Rent Guidelines Board to please take this into consideration.             One lady spoke about a 20 percent rent decrease. I would go for a 30 percent rent decrease on my rent right now.             Thank you very much and have a blessed and wonderful evening.MR. MC LAUGHLIN: All right. Thank you.Any questions?MR.

And I know a lot of tenants that would love to spend $300,000 on anything. I would really –- I know that there are tenants out there that –- that do have needs andpay a very low rent, but those are really few and far between.The vast majority of tenants thatI see coming through our door in my office, we have a little in-take form that we have them fill outand on the second page of the in-take form, there’s a place where they can circle, you know, above or below how much they make, nearly, you know, 98.5 percent of the time, tenants circle that below$23,000 range.             A ten percent increase, which was suggested earlier for a two-year lease, and where is that money coming from? Nobody’s making any more than they were last year or the year before that or the year before that.We are a service-based economy, asROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425154I’m a tenant organizer with Pratt Area Community Council.             PAC is a 47-year old community based organization committed to building and preserving affordable housing in Central Brooklyn.I really just wanted to say that–- to start off it’s the RGB’s responsibility to establish fair rent adjustments for rent stabilized units. And I urge you, when you’re determining what you think would be fair this year, to keep in mind the hardship that rent stabilized tenants are facing.             Our economy is still in a severe recession which continues to have dire consequences for the City’s low wage and working households.Even when you’re in, you know, in economic boom, for the City’s nearing the poor and near poor tenant households, the economic good times really weren’t so good.Their standard of living declinedand that’s why you’re seeing an increase in housing hardships from being behind in rent payments to having utilities to cut off, to double up with one another, to staying in homeless shelters, as weROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425156you well know, and there are no manufacturing jobs around here anymore, or very few. People have two and three and four different, you know, types of, you know 7 and 8, $9 an hour jobs to hold things down and even that, you know, even in those instances they simply can’t.             So I’m, again, urging the board for a zero –- zero increase this year.Thanks.

I had to give up half of this couch,  the dinette set, to move into a room. I had been working for 20 years for the City. This is justridiculous that I had to move because my rent went from $1,198 to $1,431 from the last time I signed my lease in December until March.At my godmother’s funeral, I justasked a friend who’s a doctor who owns a brownstone could I move –- did he rent rooms and he does. But it’s so bad that his nephew had to move back home.   So it’s about five of us in a brownstone.             Now I can’t afford any other rent increases. The tenants that I left –- my cousin still resides in the building. She cannot afford the increases. She’s a retired teacher and minister. She’s in her 80's.

We havemaybe three security guards to seven buildings. So there’s a lot of crime in the buildings. They don’t care.  All they care about is as long as they get their rent.             And I don’t think they should be allowed to get a rent increase. I can understand that the landlords would like to have –- to make money on their property, but how do you makeproperty –- how you make money when you don’t care about your buildings? You don’t make the proper repairs.

My landlord did minimal work required to bring the place up to Code, work that he was legally required to do anyway, doubling the rent in the process. But it was still affordable.We were both happy with the deal.In the decades since then, I havemade considerable improvements at my own expense, including installing basic equipment such askitchen cabinets.             My building is approximately 37 units, of which perhaps ten remain rent stabilized.

I’m active in my community with my block association, communitygarden, you know, I watched my neighbors’ kids grow up from toddlers to college students.             Even when I arrived in New York in the early ‘80's, rents were unaffordable for struggling young people. And obtaining my rent stabilized lease was a Godsend and remains theROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425172talking, let’s not talk about rooms, let’s talk about square footage. The largest apartment in this building is 500, maybe 550 square feet. And the average rent on that apartment is $2,700 a month. That’s revenue of $32,000 yearly on a single unit. That’s $1,000 more than the median household income in the United States, not bad.             The building also includes a very profitable ground-floor commercial space. The argument that landlords are struggling to keep up with increased operating expenses just doesn’t hold up. RGB’S own statistics show that profits are increasing faster than expenses.Because of the increases imposedby RGB throughout the years and through the miracle of compound interest, my rent is now 50 percent higher than when I first signed my lease.I strongly support the previousother tenants, like me, who live in buildings where 80 percent of the units are at market rate, should receive no increases whatsoever.             And I also strongly support the recommendation that the board abolish the proposed fuel surcharge. I have no control over myROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

I never got an abatement for saving the landlord money on heat.Once more, my landlordconsistently neglects basic upkeep.

You guys have done a very good job.             However, we cannot understand why, when costs are going up by an inflationary amount, rents don’t go up by that inflationary amount?Because this gives an advantage to those who have regulated rentals and we don’t.             This means that the landlords transfer the rent burdens to us. This means that our rents go up faster than inflation while somepeople who happen to have gotten lucky or inherited a rent regulated rental, get a special deal ofperhaps 80 percent of the inflationary increase.We find nothing in the law thatsays that the Rent Guidelines Board is supposed to protect tenants from inflation. We find a law that says it’s supposed to protect them from rent gouging, but not inflation.             Secondly, in the spirit of the proposed fuel increase, we feel that a per room surcharge that raises the same revenue amount,which would probably be about $5 per room, would be much more fair to all of the tenants in New York, because the bigger apartments use more fuel.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

My landlord has insulated the place. Turned the heat off when he doesn’t think people are around, put in low –- super high efficiency light bulbs. There’s nothing left togive.            And, then finally, we support the full PIOC increase so that everyone in New York would be on the same footing and so we’ll have housing equality in New York City.Thank you.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:  Thank you.Where have you been?MR.

CHEIGH: I mean, if you had the option to be in a stabilized unit, would you find that as a great benefit to you?            MR. BRONNER: I actually prefer dealing with a private landlord where we negotiate at arm’s length because that way I can do things like –- first of all, I was unemployed for six months this year.  I just got a job a few weeks ago. I lost my job around January 1st.            And I’d rather have an arrangement where I can make my own bargain with the landlord rather than have one imposed by you guys each year.            MR. CHEIGH: I know. I think everyone would say, if it was –- if there was an equal footing where tenants could bargain with landlords, I think, you know, I guess I’m not asking a question anymore, I guess I’m stating a comment, so.            MR.

CHEIGH:   Okay.  And do you feel that your rent increases because expenses go up or because the landlord could charge you whatever he can?            MR. BRONNER: I actually know my landlord’s financials pretty well since he lives downstairs and it’s because his taxes have been going up at an incredible rate, as well as the water bill –- also, oil prices mostly, as well.            MR. CHEIGH:   But if you could –- if there was someone –- I’m meaning, I’m just saying as a hypothetical landlord who could getmarket rate rent, that’s, you know, high enough –- if there’s someone willing to pay higher rent, a building owner should be able to –-            MR. BRONNER: Yeah, I mean, to a certain extent not every landlord is out to maximize the dollar value of the rental. He livesdownstairs and I think he’d have rather have a good tenant who pays on time every month and doesn’t annoy him.MR. CHEIGH:  Um-hum.MR.

Good  evening.My name is Rolando Guzman. I’m a community organizer with St. Nick’s Alliance in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. We are a community organization that provides housing counseling to residents from North Brooklyn.            And I’m here to ask you to get a freeze in the rent increases for this year. I don’tthink like somebody who spoke before, but many of these landlords is just a reward for their negligence.And I have a couple of buildingsthat just want to show you, to put up picture. Our community is being displaced almost every day. OurROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

And I just want to give you the example of one of these, for example.This is a six-family building.Everyone is a rent stabilized tenant. The building overall has over 150 violations. At least 80 of those are C-violations.  So it’s very much like over 20 violations per apartment.I’m worried about the property.They put a hefty mortgage, you know, I’m sure they’ll be an expectation to make a big profit.And the first thing that this new owner did isknock on everyone’s door and just ask when are you moving out.  Not to say when I’m fixing it, not to say anything else, but when are you moving out.             The tenants have spent almost the whole winter without oil so the whole fee sounds kind of ridiculous for them actually. Overall, IROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425183testimony I gave in prior years as a tenant leader of the Van Buren Hall Tenants Association.             I do not want to be here today because I honestly do not believe what I do will have any impact, even if I did want to be here, I certainly would need more than three minutes.             Everything across the globe knows that this is the worst economy since the Great Depression, yet you and this board have proposed the highest rent increases on the majority of New York City’s lower and lower middle class in 21 years.  That’s according to your own documents.             Not since 1990 has the board proposed increases as high as 5.5 percent and 9 percent, not since 1990.             These numbers are cumulative and unrealistic. Do any of you who are not tenant members have firsthand experience of the impact your actions have on us?  All of whom –- all of whom are people much more vulnerable than any of you.  I ask because you are obviously not gettingit.             Since 2008 and even a bit before, we have been plagued by unemployment,ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425182just want to emphasize that. I think some of these landlords are not seeing us –- providing us housing, they see it as a big way to make an extrabuck and these kind of increases that you guys have proposing, is an insult for the majority of New Yorkers.             I think is enough is enough and we’re asking for a rent freeze for this year.Thank you very much.

A comptroller over 45 who hasn’t worked full time in three years. These are educated people with master’s degrees.             One of the most knowledgeable legal secretaries I have ever known in over 20 years in the business has been out of full-time work for over three years. She cannot afford her medication.  The money goes to her rent.             In my 59-unit building alone, over the last two years, three individuals were evicted because they could no longer afford the rent. Noone in the building can even remember when the last eviction was prior to that.             My neighborhood has over ten empty shops and stores. A couple of those have remained dormant for years because the owners are just so greedy that they would rather the stores be empty than lower the rent.I was a patron of those stores.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

It couldn’t be, except perhaps, to those infected by a greed so powerful, that they are scornful of us, we who put food on their tables and send their children to college and fatten their retirement accounts while we struggle by the skin of our teeth.            So the proposed rent increases for this year are shameful.

We stuck it out and remained because rent regulation kept our apartments affordable.            When regulated apartments did become vacant, usually due to the death or disability of long term tenants, landlords guttedthem and then rented the renovated units at amounts many times higher than the old regulated rent.  But for the most part, the condition of the regulated apartments has stayed the same, the square footage, the same number of closets, the same stoves, the same sinks and the same old bathtubs.            The recent decision regarding Order No. 4 – 40, gives landlords permission to exact additional increases, not just the usualincrease, but additional dollar amounts on top of the increases that would usually have.

I live on the upper west side.            When I moved into my studio apartment on the upper west side 37 year ago, the area was considered a rough neighborhood. It still had the unappealing aura of Needle Park.            It was 1974 and prostitutes were still hanging out on Broadway, just below 72ndStreet. My apartment was burglarized by a guy who swung in from the fire escape six floors up. Twoof my neighbors were robbed at knife point in the vestibule of the building in broad daylight and twice I was held up on Columbus Avenue, all this within two blocks of Lincoln Center.            But it was the best apartment I could afford and it still is. Yes, the area improved over the years. High rise luxurybuildings with sky high rents went up. Mom and Pop stores were forced out by higher and higher rents.Older buildings were torn down or went co-op.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425188very people who’s stability helped make these neighborhoods desirable places to live. It istruly outrageous that long term tenants are forced to pay even more rent as punishment for failing to move, failing to move in a City that has virtually no other affordable housing.            And why $1,000 a month? There doesn’t seem to be any particular reason for that limit.  Why not a higher amount?  And now the board can jack up that additional amount every year and get away with it. Where does it end?Hundreds of thousands ofaffordable apartments have been lost to the private market due the greediness of predatory developers and landlords. It is one more example of how far reaching is the unfair power of their collective resources.Yet another unconscionable assaulton legal and working class tenants in New York City and increasing the unaffordable City for anyone earning less than a six-figure income, an income that hardly buys a family a middle class life.            Here in New York City, one of the most expensive cities in the world, middle classROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

I’m not going to go into this thing about greed. I think sometimes I’m just asgreedy as some landlords. They want everything and not have to pay for it.             But the fact is that there that needs to be a process by which the imperfect process of estimating costs, of escalating taxesand the uncertainties of owning a building and then projecting that onto these politically engaged conversations of about what rent increases should be, needs to be looked back at and an adjustment made.             And I don’t know if it’s $100 for an apartment over $1,000, or 80 bucks for an apartment or 60, but the surcharge on these ridiculously low rents that would help landlordsmake up for the or alleviate the need for landlords to charge ridiculously high rents for incoming residents, legal residents, immigrants, people that come here from other parts of the country, it’s not too much ask.We're laying off teachers.

I never wasable to come to one of these meetings because I had to go from one job to the next.  I had –- I’ve had54 roommates in my life.  And I live across thehall from someone who had a three-bedroom apartment and lived it in by themselves and paid for with apart-time job.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425192cutting back subway service and people are paying$400 and $500 a month to live in some of the best parts of town in very large apartments, getting the same services as people who are paying $1,800 for a studio.             So I guess comments are directed mostly to public members. There’s a whole host of New Yorkers out there other than just the rent regulated tenants and the owners who own those buildings, the ones whose taxes or whose rents are a function of taxes. Thirty to 35 percent of rent goes to taxes in a building that doesn’t have any abatements in place.And if you’re paying $2,000 –-$1,800 for a studio, $600 a month in taxes to make up for the fact that another building that barelyhas a rent roll and so barely pays any taxes.             There needs to be a movement towards equality in the rents that are being put out there.  And that’s all I have to say.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:   Thank you, Mr.Clark.Brian, you have a question?MR.

I don’t have a problem with it, you know. I go to a restaurant and whatever the price is, that’s what I pay. If I don’t like it, I go somewhere else.

And I got it with a job that paid $30,000 a year.MR.

And, again, I would say that if it weren’t for the fact that the politicians balance their budgets on the backs of their multi-housing family, multi-family housing sector, I mean, the tax differential between rental housing and single-family housing is obnoxious.             And if the rates on taxes overall were lower, maybe some landlords would be ordevelopers would want to develop some things that didn't require them to be, get a 421A or whatever  it takes it to hand out money.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425194places for long term tenure, you know, over long periods of time without rents that could be increased because the market could say there’s –- what the market could bear it.             You know, you’re the second person who has come to say that, you know, you’re paying for the fact that other tenants are paying a low  rent.
