P R O C E E D I N G    SCHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Good morning,I' m Jonathan Kimmel, Chairman of
6 the New York City Rent  Guidelines Board.	I' d like7 to call this meeting to  order.8 We' ll start by taking attendance.9 Ms. Adams.10 MS. ADAMS:	Here.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Adams is12 present.13 Mr. Cheigh.14 MR. CHEIGH:	Yes.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Cheigh is16 present.17 Ms. Cruz.18 MS. CRUZ:	Present.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz is20 present.21 Ms. Holder.22 MS. HOLDER:	Present.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Holder is24 present.25 Ms. Moore.6 
2( No response.)3CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Let the record4show Ms. Mooreison her way, we hope.5Mr. Scheinberg.6MR. SCHEINBERG:	Here.7CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Scheinberg8is present.9Mr. Schleider.
101112	is present.131415161718	we get started.19
MR. SCHLEIDER:	Here.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. SchleiderMr. Wenk.MR. WENK:	Mr. Wenk is present. The Chair is present.We have a quorum.A couple of announcements beforeI' d like to welcome you to this
20 public hearing of the New York City Rent  Guidelines21 Board.	This is the second and final of two  public22 hearings for comments regarding the proposed23 guidelines which were adopted by this Board on  May24 1 st.25 The final vote on adjustments to20 
2 rent stabilized renewal leases will be held  here,3 in the Great Hall at Cooper Union, this  Thursday,4 June 21 st starting at 5 : 30 .5 To board members, please note the6 drafts of both the hotel and apartment  Explanatory7 Statements were sent to you on Friday and copies  of8 these documents are in your folders  today.9 Once again, we request your10 comments on, or suggested additions to,  the11 statements no later than June 20 th.12 Before we begin our hearing,  I13 would like to go over a few of the rules for   those14 who are testifying before the board  today:15 Each speaker will have three16 minutes to give his or  her testimony.	In the event17 that large numbers of people wish to speak,  the18 Chair reserves the right to reduce the  allotted19 speaking time.20 I will try to call several  names21 in advance.	If your name is called, it' s advisable22 that you move to the front row towards  the23 microphone.	If you have materials to distribute  to24 the board, including copies of your remarks,  you25 should give them in at the sign- in table to the2 
2 staff who will take them there.3 Hopefully -- we may have  some4 trouble with the clock today but if it  works5 properly, the clock will beep once when you have  306 seconds left.	When your time is up, I will  be7 asking you to bring your remarks to a  close.8 So please be mindful, this is9 going to be a  long day.	Please be mindful of your10 time to speak.11 We' ll start with our first12 speaker, Anita Romm.13 Anita will be followed by  Robert14 Rosenberg;15 Who will be followed by  William16 Stanford;17 Anita.18 MS. ROMM:	Oh --19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Careful.	You' re20 dragging your bag.21 MS. ROMM:	-- yeah, my bag.22 Good morning.	My name is Anita23 Romm.	I am the song writer for  Metropolitan24 Council on Housing.25 I have read your reports and  gone2 
2 to your meetings and have come to the  conclusion3 that a rent freeze is what we  need.4 Over the years you have voted  for5 humongous rent increases which negatively impacted6 on peoples' disposable income which means they' re7 able to spend less on goods and services which  has8 led to business failure, loss of job and  economic9 disaster.10 While the average percentage of11 income spent on rent is about 35 percent,  many12 people are spending well over half their income  on13 rent.	They have to choose between rent,  medicine14 and food.15 I also found out that  net16 operating income of landlords seems to have gone  up17 and that rent stabilized buildings are a  really18 good investment.	I am concerned that if rents  are19 allowed to increase, many units will go out of  rent20 regulation and people could be evicted for  any21 silly reason.22 Do you really want to  destabilize23 our fair City by displacing millions of  people?24 Please, save an endangered species; rent  stabilized25 tenants and give us a rent freeze.

CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,( Applause.)MS. HOLDER:	Anita.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Anita, just a
8 second.	Questions.9 MS. HOLDER:	Yeah, I have a10 question.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Holder.12 MS. HOLDER:	Anita, where do you13 live?14 MS. ROMM:	Riverdale.15 MS. HOLDER:	In which kind of16 housing? Which -- which sort of housing do you  live17 in?18 MS. ROMM:	Well, I' m a rent19 stabilized tenant in a building that' s gone co- op.20 MS. HOLDER:	And how long have you21 been there?22 MS. ROMM:	Thirty- six years.23 MS. HOLDER:	And do you mind24 telling us - you don' t have to - but do you  mind25 telling us how much your rent  is?8 

23	$ 1 , 600 .45	you have?678	Anita.910111213	the board.14
MS. ROMM:	It' s a little overMS. HOLDER:	And how many rooms doMS. ROMM:	I have three bedrooms. MS. HOLDER		Okay.	Thank you,CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.Robert Rosenberg.MR. ROSENBERG:	Thank you.Good morning, honorable members ofWhatever increase that you decide
15 will not really be enough to cover a lot of   the16 injustices in this rent regulated system.	Some of17 the injustices that I' m referring to, succession,18 where people are allowed to remain in  their19 apartment forever paying sub- market rents into20 perpetuity.	And it' s like winning the lottery for21 life at the owner' s expense.22 I' ll just give you one example.	I23 have a four- bedroom apartment.	The gentleman who24 was there is not there any longer.	He deserved the25 services.	He always got them no matter what  his15 
2 rent is.	He has four kids, two of them working  for3 the Transit Authority and that four- bedroom on Park4 Avenue in the Bronx is up to around $ 300  something5 dollars.6 I have a lot of  similar7 situations.	And we have squatter' s rights.8 Tenants take over apartment illegally and  owners9 must pursue expensive litigation to remove  them.10 We have a court system that is geared  towards11 providing show cause after show cause causing  heavy12 losses and it' s not really fair to the owners.13 The City is governed by  super14 agencies that are writing violations, summonses  and15 forcing us through all the regulations  and16 agencies, 80 percent of the time filling  out17 paperwork rather than taking care of our  tenants,18 which I do anyway.19 So affordable housing has been my20 whole life' s career.	Every apartment that I  have21 has been renovated.	Every building I have has  been22 completely renovated.	I have not one rent  near23 $ 2 , 000 .	I have a lot of apartments, none  near24 $ 2 , 000 .	I have hundreds of apartments below $ 750 .25 And that' s what it cost,2 
2 approximately, to run an apartment in this  system,3 $ 700 , $ 750 and we need to maintain our properties,4 provide good maintenance, pay our bills and  these5 are impossible with these low below market  rents.6 So what I' m recommending is that7 we need a low rent supplement. I recommend  for8 apartments below $ 750 , $ 100 increase.	It' s9 important and it' s fair.	I' m not talking about the10 guideline.	I' m talking about the supplement for11 way below market rents.12 Thank you very much.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you very14 much.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Question.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for your18 testimony today.19 You mentioned litigation expenses20 and we understand that we' ve had testimony to that21 before but we' d like to know what type of  expenses22 and time, energy and effort you expend on  mandates23 that come down from the Council, come down from  the24 City, come down from the State, that require you  to25 -- to do work within the buildings and around  the2 
2 buildings that you really can' t extract a rent3 increase for, at least not under the  current4 systems?5 MR. ROSENBERG:	Well, there' s6 always some mandate, energy mandates or  mandates7 for filing for oil, different mandates where  we8 have to register our apartments based on the  energy9 we used.	There is all sorts of paperwork that  I10 don' t see how a small owner can follow the  mandates11 that come down.	We' re cross checked by so many12 different agencies.	They have benchmarking.	They13 have many, many different categories with  the14 Section 8 that we have to have a department set   up15 for each of the various mandates and agencies  that16 are required because they are so  paperwork17 intensive to respond to and it' s very difficult.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	We' ve had some19 testimony about the benchmarking.	Is this20 something that you do personally or do you  have21 your management company do it or  --22 MR. ROSENBERG:	We do it in house.23 We -- we get the reports.	We get the reports24 available that are on the Internet, whether it' s25 Con Edison but it' s a major project.	Just like2 
2 fuel adjustments is a  major project.	That' s why a3 lot of people don' t even go for increases on  rent4 control but the work can be done in house if   you5 have properly trained staff to do it or you can   go6 out and give it to an agency and have them do   it7 for you at a cost.	We do everything ourselves.8 It' s a tremendous project but we do it in  house.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	About10 how much time, energy and effort does your  staff11 expend on a say, a per building, to comply with   the12 benchmark?13 MR. ROSENBERG:	An awful lot of14 time.	I couldn' t give you specifically exactly how15 long but everybody is busy doing those types  of16 mandates.	It' s a major project.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	So18 this is -- this is in lieu of attending to   other19 tasks that -- that your staff would do to  maintain20 the building?21 MR. ROSENBERG:	Correct.22 Correct.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.24 MR. ROSENBERG:	Thank you.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Adams.2 
2 MS. ADAMS:	Yes.	How long have3 you been an owner of stabilized  apartments?4 MR. ROSENBERG:	A long time.5 Let' s say back into the ' 60 ' s.6 MS. ADAMS:	In the ' 60 ' s?7 MR. ROSENBERG:	Yes. I went back8 to Hortense Gable as the Commissioner.	I went back9 to Charlie Merdler.	I was way back when.	I know I10 look much younger but --11 ( Laughter.)12 MR. ROSENBERG:	-- I' ve -- I' ve13 been in there since the ' 60 ' s.14 MS. ADAMS:	And what' s the most15 recent year that you bought a  building?16 MR. ROSENBERG:	That would be17 about five, six, seven years ago.18 MS. ADAMS:	And what has the19 change in mandates been since the time you  bought20 the most recent one until now?21 MR. ROSENBERG:	Well, there' s a22 lot more agencies to answer to.	There' s a lot more23 -- it' s just a lot more paperwork intensive with  --24 with dealing with what is the DHCR, the  Department25 of Health, HPD, the Building Department.	Section 82 
2 has got an awful lot of paperwork with  their3 inspections.	It' s -- it' s really across the board4 amount of paperwork that we have to respond  to.5 MS. ADAMS:	Was the amount of6 paperwork seven years ago considered doable?7 MR. ROSENBERG:	No.	It' s -- it' s8 gotten much more paperwork intensive now.9 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Brian.11 MR. CHEIGH:	Hi.	Thank you for12 your testimony.13 I just wanted to ask where  --14 where are your buildings located?15 MR. ROSENBERG:	In the Bronx.16 MR. CHEIGH:	But what part of the17 Bronx, what neighborhoods?18 MR. ROSENBERG:	Pretty much Grand19 Concourse East, South, North.	Everyplace except20 Riverdale.21 MR. CHEIGH:	And how many22 buildings and units does your company  own?23 MR. ROSENBERG:	I have about 4524 buildings, close to 3 , 000 apartments.25 MS. HOLDER:	I' m sorry, close2 

2	to --345
MS. HOLDER:	Units? MR. ROSENBERG:	Units.MS. HOLDER:	Okay.	I' m sorry.
6 I' m just having trouble with the --7 MR. ROSENBERG:	Oh, okay.8 MS. HOLDER:	-- the microphone.9 You' re kind of close.	Okay.10 MR. CHEIGH:	And what is the --11 how many buildings do you have that are over 50 , 00012 square -- that' s the benchmarking, how many13 buildings do you have that you have to  benchmark?14 So those are the 50 -- the buildings that  are15 50 , 000 square feet or larger?16 MR. ROSENBERG:	Yeah, I think, we17 benchmark every building.18 MR. CHEIGH:	So all your buildings19 are over 50 units or  so?20 MR. ROSENBERG:	That' s correct.21 MR. CHEIGH:	Okay.	And now you22 talk about how, you know, benchmarking is a  big23 burden for your staff and, you know, I know  other24 companies that have secured benchmarking services25 for, you know, less than $ 300 .6 
2 But the benchmarking is supposed3 to assist you in seeing how much your energy  usage4 is across your portfolio so that you could  see5 whether -- which buildings are performing better  or6 worse than others.7 MR. ROSENBERG:	Well, every8 building that I have is computerized.	We used to9 have the old fashioned heat timers.	Now we have10 computerized systems that allow us to see if  a11 building is running efficiently or not.	We' re12 budgeted every month.	We' re constantly monitoring13 it so we' re -- I' m enough of a -- of a  professional14 manager that we look after our properties and  see15 if it' s necessary that the system has to be16 replaced, we replace it.17 I' ve done every program the City18 has to offer.	Putting the money back into the19 property through various loans, be the 8 A loan20 program, the Article 8 A loan program.	So I' ve done21 every single building is upgraded.	But if it' s not22 running efficiently, we pick it up.	I really don' t23 need benchmarking or something to tell me when  I24 look and see every day how much it' s running,  if25 it' s over running and if people are getting proper2 

2	heat.3
I think I had maybe one  breakdown
4 this year out of 50 buildings.	So we' re right on5 top of it.6 MR. CHEIGH:	But that' s great.7 MR. ROSENBERG:	But benchmarking8 is just some extra thing that we have  to do.	It9 does not help us.10 MR. CHEIGH:	Okay.	I mean, it11 does help the City to understand if you' re running12 your buildings efficiently, --13 MR. ROSENBERG:	Right.14 MR. CHEIGH:	-- they could see15 how badly run other buildings are and get a   sense16 of, you know, it' s a -- it helps.17 MR. ROSENBERG:	It' s an18 accumulation of everything.	I' m not singling out19 benchmark.	I' m just singling out we have an awful20 lot of authorities to answer to and you have to   be21 very well prepared with staff to be able to  handle22 that.23 MR. CHEIGH:	Okay.24 MR. ROSENBERG:	I' m just25 complaining about the rents, the very low  rents4 
2 that with all of these extras, it' s hard to  keep3 up.	The very below market rents is what I' m  here4 for.5 MR. CHEIGH:	And what --6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m sorry, are7 you done, Brian?8 MR. CHEIGH:	Just one more9 question.10 And one of the -- one of  the11 stats that we got from this year' s research from12 the RPIE, the income and expense report, show  that13 rent stabilized buildings in the Bronx had some  of14 the highest NOI gains in the last two  years.15 Some Community Boards had net16 operating incomes of 81 percent increases in  the17 borough.	And this was not just one  Community18 Board, it was fairly consistent that a lot of   the19 Community Boards had pretty high NOIs.20 And across the City, the Income21 and Expense report showed that 2009 and 2010  the22 expense increases were . 9 percent, . 1 percent, very23 low -- very low expense increases.24 Have you been -- you know, this  is25 what the landlord filed data shows and for  your2 
2 borough it seems like it' s doing pretty well.3 MR. ROSENBERG:	The rents have4 gone up higher than I could have imagined  across5 the board in general but, basically, it' s only to6 keep pace with the escalating costs of  water,7 double digit water now is just almost $ 1 , 000 an8 apartment per year.	When I started back in  the9 business, it was $ 9 , 000 for a 90 - family house.	Now10 you' re talking $ 100 , 000 .	So the price of water  is11 crazy high.	It' s now one of the major line items.12 And your real estate taxes as13 well.	If the rents that have been increased  so14 steady were without the high cost of water and  all15 its mandates and costs in there, and if the  City16 would give a break to property owners that  have17 stabilized and affordable housing, we would be  able18 to do much better.19 So all those high increases  that20 you hear are really just keeping up, if that,  with21 expenses.22 MR. CHEIGH:	Thank you.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Steve.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.2 
2 Just a follow up on that  last3 point.	I know my colleague mentioned that the  NOI4 increased dramatically in the Bronx.	I believe our5 report shows about 27 percent but that' s from such6 a low number that maybe it works out to $ 50 a  unit7 on average.	Whereas, expenses start at a  much8 higher number and although they only went up  229 percent, right, starting from a higher number  they10 went up almost $ 100 .11 So, I guess, this underscores  what12 you just said about the -- the expenses just  barely13 keeping up with the rate of NOI  increases.14 MR. ROSENBERG:	It' s a fact.	I15 am fortunate enough to have a large portfolio  of16 properties but there are many, many of  our17 properties that actually lose money.	It' s not that18 -- that they' re all doing well.	I have some that19 stand on their own and the ones that get a   surplus20 cover the ones that are, actually, losing  money.21 Because I have buildings with such a large  of22 amount of low rents, I' m talking about below market23 rents that it' s impossible to make ends meet.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And you,25 obviously, have a large staff servicing the 45  to2 
2 50 buildings that you have.3 MR. ROSENBERG:	Correct.4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Just your5 opinion, if a landlord had maybe two or  three6 buildings and had all these unfunded mandates  that7 you have to deal with, how -- how do they make   do?8 MR. ROSENBERG:	They don' t.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Brian.11 MR. CHEIGH:	In regards -- I' m12 sorry, I just have a couple more  questions.13 And you talked about your incomes14 and expenses and, you know, how you have  buildings15 that are supplementing.	So you do have buildings16 that are doing very well?17 MR. ROSENBERG:	I have buildings18 that are turning a profit, yes, I  do.19 MR. CHEIGH:	Right.	And you do20 take advantage of tax abatements, the Article 8 A21 program, which provided very low  interest22 financing?23 MR. ROSENBERG:	I do, whenever I24 can.25 MR. CHEIGH:	Right.	And those2 

2	properties -- 3
MR. ROSENBERG:	There is not
 4 enough cash flow in a property to do your own   major5 capital improvements without the help of a  City6 agency giving you either the one percent or  three7 percent loan, no properties would be  improved.8 It' s impossible, out of the question.9 MR. CHEIGH:	Right.	But those10 projects -- those programs also extend  rent11 stabilization requirements.12 MR. ROSENBERG:	Extend them?13 MR. CHEIGH:	Through regulatory14 agreements or tax abatements that you agree to  and15 in return you have to extend the  rent16 stabilization.17 MR. ROSENBERG:	Well, you have no18 choice.	I' m in rent stabilization whether I do an19 8 A loan or not. I' m not getting out of rent20 stabilizing and I' m not getting out from high rent21 -- high rents either.	I have nothing close to 22	$ 2 , 000 .23 MR. CHEIGH:	But, I mean, you do24 have buildings in the Bronx in some areas that  are25 very low income --23 
2 MR. ROSENBERG:	Absolutely.3 MR. CHEIGH:	-- and where the4 market rate rents are probably less than --  maybe5 just less than $ 1 , 000 for one bedrooms.6 MR. ROSENBERG:	Yes.	We have7 areas that market rent is below $ 1 , 000 for that.8 And we have a lot of tenants if they can' t  afford9 it and they get subsidized.	They get Section 8 and10 we welcome Section 8 or any subsidy program  for11 decent tenants and we give them decent  service.12 MR. CHEIGH:	Okay.13 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.14 So I just want to make sure  I15 understand what it is that you' re asking for us  to16 do.	We have so many people who come up to    us and17 -- on the tenant side, especially, who tell  us18 about all of the wranglings they have with  trying19 to get subsidies, all the issues that they  have20 with trying to make sure that New York City  remains21 affordable for them to live here and raise  their22 families.23 And then so many of my  colleagues24 on this board say that' s not for the Rent25 Guidelines Board to have to really  consider2 
2 seriously that it is, you know, an issue of  income.3 There' s issues of lack of subsidy that we have  to4 hold the legislators responsible.5 So using that same belief and6 philosophy about how it is that we should go  about7 doing our work, because I' ve always argued that8 we' re part of the problem as well as part  of,9 perhaps, a solution.	I hear what you' re saying10 about agencies.	I hear what you' re saying about11 oversight.	I know that some of the people who  do12 what you do, talk about taxes and increased  burdens13 that you all have in trying to make your  business14 of providing housing not only one that' s profitable15 but even just sustainable.	And I hear all of  that.16 But, again, I guess, I would  ask17 what some of my colleagues say, why isn' t this  an18 issue for the City Council?	Why isn' t this an19 issue for the State?	Maybe there are ways that we20 can try to work together.	I' m always about trying21 to problem solve.22 I understand about water taxes.	I23 understand -- I understand about all those  things.24 I have a foreclosure practice.	We -- we understand25 what it is that owners face. But at the same   time,2 
2 what is it you want this board to do? And I   would3 want, for whatever you say, to, perhaps,  afforded4 the same weight as what it is that tenants  would5 like to have this board do?	Could you tell me?6 MR. ROSENBERG:	Yes, I can.	I' m7 not here to question your percentage of  increase8 that you give.	I think you weigh enough  various9 agencies and you go over enough data to come  up10 with a reasonable protecting owners and  tenants.11 I' m not questioning that.	I think you put in  an12 honest effort to give an increase based on  the13 expenses.	No problem with that.14 And also about agencies of  people15 that can' t afford it.	We have a tenant relations16 department in our office and I have a legal  person.17 His name is Keith.	He meets with everybody.	It' s18 rare that somebody does not get a subsidy  from19 someplace when they need it.20 Before anybody who can' t pay the21 rent, we try to get them hooked up with an   agency22 and we are 99 percent successful in getting  people.23 We don' t want to put them out.	We want to collect24 the rent and we want to give -- so there are   places25 to subsidize tenants.	In my office as well  are2 
2 geared up to show people where they can get  it.3 What the unfair part that I' m here4 to question what you could do, which you could  do5 which I' m requesting, is the way below market6 rents.	I have rents at $ 200 , $ 300 , $ 400 .	I7 probably have 500 below $ 700 and that' s not fair8 and you can' t make ends meet.9 So I' m asking for a supplement,10 which you have done in the past, which you can  do.11 I think the percentage -- you' ve done enough12 history.	I can' t tell you what to do about the13 percentage.	You' ll give a fair percentage.	I' m14 looking for a supplement for very low  rents.15 MS. HOLDER:	And with the number16 of units you have, you don' t think that --  that17 that evens out for you and with the turnover  that18 you have --19 MR. ROSENBERG:	The buildings20 that lose money do not  even out.	They lose money21 and they' re -- and it' s just not fair.22 MS. HOLDER:	But you have -- you23 have some turnover in your buildings as  well?24 MR. ROSENBERG:	Right.	But not25 the ones that are that low.	They say the same2 
2 because succession -- someone moves in --  and3 nobody' s giving away $ 400 a four- bedroom apartment.4 It' s not psychologically possible to give that5 apartment away.	You will call family.	You' ll get6 married.	You' ll have a kid just to protect that 7	$ 400 .8 MS. HOLDER:	And so the tenants9 that you rent to you' re saying --10 MR. ROSENBERG:	I would have a  kid11 to stay in a $ 400 apartment at my  age.12 ( Laughter.)13 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.	That' s --14 that' s well understood.15 MR. ROSENBERG:	That might be out16 of line but I' m just telling you.17 MS. HOLDER:	Well, you know,18 that' s -- that' s fine.19 But, I guess, I' m just trying to20 figure out, you know, being someone who' s dealt21 with real estate since the ' 60 ' s here in New York22 City it, you know, it' s not your position at  all23 rent stabilized tenants are entitled to  subsidies;24 are you?	Because I sure wish I could have had  one25 when I was in law school, in a rent   stabilized8 

2	apartment.3
Is it your position that they' re
4 all entitled to subsidies?	I didn' t see those --5 MR. ROSENBERG: I' m not challenging6 entitled at all.	I' m living under a system that7 is.	Well, it' s political the system, I don' t8 really know.	Is it political?	I' m not sure.9 Okay.	In any case, we' re living under the system.10 All my tenants get protected no matter what  they11 pay.	It' s just not fair to keep someone in  an12 apartment way below market rent that earns so  much13 more.14 My books are open for the  RPIEs,15 for everything. The tenants' books are not open  and16 there' s plenty of places or they can afford, you17 know, I want to push up those way below  market18 rents for some sense of  fairness.19 MS. HOLDER:	So did you -- did20 you have any tenants in your apartment that  were21 part of the Advantage Program?22 MR. ROSENBERG:	What' s the23 Advantage Program?24 MS. HOLDER:	The Advantage25 Program for individuals and families that  were4 
 2 formerly homeless in the City.3 MR. ROSENBERG:	Oh, I -- I' ve4 been involved in many --5 MS. HOLDER:	Because that6 program' s over.	I was wondering if you  accepted7 tenants under that program.8 MR. ROSENBERG:	You know, I' m not9 exactly sure how much we did but we' ve had  programs10 that they' ve gone in and then they' ve gone out but 11	--12 MS. HOLDER:	Because what we' re13 finding is that a lot of the tenants that  were14 eligible for those types of subsidies, we  brought15 the case and we' ve, ultimately, you know, we' re16 waiting for a decision from the Court of  Appeals17 but, as you know, a lot of folks graduate out   of18 that program.	I was wondering what kind  of19 subsidies you were able to find for them because  we20 haven' t been able to find any -- at the Legal  Aid21 Society.22 MR. ROSENBERG:	I' m not really23 sure what programs -- like I said, we do -- we do   a24 number of them; some of them good, some of  them25 bad.	Some I find that you try to help out and    take12 
 2 some underprivileged people or people with  problems3 and it didn' t work out and the tenants in  the4 building are up in arms that if I rented  that5 particular group, they' re going to go on a  rent6 strike.7 So I have a  delicate balance.	I8 want to keep everybody happy and make sure they  get9 good services.	But, also, I' m looking for quality10 tenants and a lot of agencies have done it and   some11 are not delivering it.12 MS. HOLDER:	So how many13 subsidized tenants or units do you  have?14 MR. ROSENBERG:	How many people15 are subsidized?16 MS. HOLDER:	Yeah, out of the 17	3 , 000 units.18 MR. ROSENBERG:	I probably have,19 maybe, 1 , 000 Section 8 , which is a subsidy.20 MS. HOLDER:	I' m familiar with21 that.	Yeah.22 And what is the balance?	The23 balance of your folks, how are they staying  in24 their apartments?	They' re just -- you' re saying25 they work?18 
2 MR. ROSENBERG:	A lot of the3 Section 8 people work.	Yes.4 MS. HOLDER:	Right.	And the5 other 2 , 000 , how are they paying their rent?6 MR. ROSENBERG:	I' m not sure7 about the percentages but some of them pay  it8 weekly, w- e- e- k- l- y or some of them pay it weakly, 9	w- e- a- k- l- y.10 ( Laughter.)11 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.	And so what' s12 the --13 MR. ROSENBERG:	But we make14 attempts to help people get their rent  paid.15 MS. HOLDER:	And that' s h- e- l- p;16 right?17 MR. ROSENBERG:	That' s right.18 MS. HOLDER:	That' s great.19 What' s the highest rent that you20 have?21 MR. ROSENBERG:	Probably $ 1 , 70022 something in a four bedroom, probably, with  two23 bathrooms or someplace.	I have nothing near24 $ 2 , 000 .	I' m not going for any decontrol.	I' m25 staying in the system.10 

2345	Schleider.67	follow up.8
MS. HOLDER:	Okay.	Thank you. MR. SCHLEIDER:		Mr. Chair.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes, Mr.MR. SCHLEIDER:	Just one lastMs. Holder, and I' m going to quote
9 this as best as I can, landlords are in   the10 business of providing housing.	So when a comment' s11 made to you that well, don' t your profitable12 buildings cover your loss buildings; how does  that13 strike you as -- as being in -- consistent  with14 landlords being the business of providing  housing?15 MR. ROSENBERG:	It is a business.16 It' s a business for profit and it' s a business for17 providing.	It' s up to the individual.	Most18 tenants are very, very good and most owners  are19 good.	There' s good and bad in both.	I happen to20 love my properties.	My money will not go into  the21 profit.	It will make a courtyard with trees  and22 planter boxes.	If I have a building and I' m  not23 happy the way it looks, I  fix it.	And I feel much24 better about that.25 So I' m in the business and I' m9 
2 happier when my tenants are happy. When they  call3 and say, Mr. Rosenberg, I have to move, I want   a4 larger apartment in one of your buildings, I know  I5 did well.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.8 Rosenberg.9 Let' s try and move this along.10 ( Applause.)11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Stanford.12 For the record, let me  mention13 that Ms. Moore is here.	We have a full board  in14 attendance.15 Thank you.16 Mr. Stanford.17 MR. STANFORD:	Just for the18 record, whatever decision you make on  Thursday,19 won' t affect me.	Why?	I' m on Section 8 .	I have a20 non- portable Section 8 voucher.	I' m only required21 to pay $ 200 rent.	That' s why I said whatever22 decisions you make on Thursday won' t affect me.23 Yeah, I' m on Section 8 .	No thanks24 to any of you or no thanks to you, I should   say.25 Okay.	Now I got some concerns2 
2 here.	Okay.	In the last -- selfish.	Okay.	This3 is what I say, you' re selfish.	Okay.4 John, what you did to Magrita  last5 Wednesday was inexcusable.	You should have given6 here a chance to testify. You  didn' t.	I' m7 surprised she didn' t slap you.	That' s another8 story.	Okay.9 I have some other concerns  here.10 Okay.	Over the years here -- everywhere, 1  Center11 Street, 22 Reade Street, refreshments are given  to12 you, the board members and employees.	They weren' t13 given to us.	Is there any reason you can' t give us14 refreshments?	Why you treating us like --  like15 children?	Why you treating us like we' re in16 kindergarten?	We' re not in kindergarten.17 And another thing I don' t18 appreciate is, what -- what' s with the owner19 members mistreating the tenant members?	That what20 I saw in the last  six years.	You know, it' s one21 thing if you disagree, it' s another thing if you22 disagree with them -- it' s another thing if you' re23 disrespectful to them.24 And that' s what I' ve seen in the25 last six years.	The owner members constantly bash2 
2 the tenant members, particularly, the longest3 tenant member.	There' s no excuse for that abuse.4 I said that before.	You should show some respect.5 And if you can' t be respectful, then you shouldn' t6 be here.	You should stay home and be a  housewife.7 All you have to do is put on an apron and a    dress8 or a mini skirt and if we can' t find one your  size,9 we' ll get a tape measure and measure around your10 waist and see what your size is.	Okay.11 And another thing, I should say  I12 have a non- portable Section 8 voucher.	Okay.	Any13 of you help me get a portable Section 8 voucher   so14 that I can live where I wish to live here in   New15 York City -- in the New York  City region?	I don' t16 want to deal with Cablevision.	I' d rather deal17 with Warner Cable -- Time Warner  Cable.18 No -- no response?	Okay.	As19 usual, no response.	Can' t answer a simple20 question.21 I -- I' ve asked one question22 twice.	Is there any particular reason why  you23 never held a public hearing in  Staten Island?	And24 I finally got the answer.	Oh, there isn' t that25 much happening -- nothing happen at Staten  Island.2 
2 That' s what you told me.3 Staten Island is a New  York4 borough.	You should hold public hearings  there.5 Okay.	Treat Staten Island -- you' re treating6 Staten Island like a  forgotten borough.	It' s still7 the forgotten borough because you don' t want to be8 bothered.	There' s no excuse for that.	There' s no9 reason why you can' t hold public hearings in Staten10 Island.	Okay.11 As I said, you know, there' s no12 reason why you can' t be respectful to each other.13 There' s no reason why you can' t offer us14 refreshments.	They' re constantly given to you.15 They' re not given to us.	There' s no excuse for16 that.	If you can jack up the rent prices, you  can17 give us refreshments.	That' s the least you can do.18 You don' t have to be so damn cheap.	Okay.	Your19 budget isn' t that low.20 And you increase -- you  increase21 the rents.	You tell us we should pay more  yet22 we' re still living in buildings --23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Draw to a24 close, Mr. Stanford, please.25 MR. STANFORD:	-- where buildings,2 
2 apartments and rooms that are in bad  condition.3 Okay.	We complain to HPD and God knows who  else.4 We don' t get a response.	There' s no excuse.5 And you' re not -- you' re not6 acknowledging that.	You' re not acknowledging what7 we go through when it comes to living in  buildings,8 apartments, rooms that are in bad  condition.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Stanford,10 your time is up.11 Thank you.12 Zachary Kerr;13 Who will be followed by  Larry14 Wood;15 Who will be followed by  James16 Anderson.17 Mr. Kerr.18 MR. KERR:	Good morning.19 I want to thank you all for  giving20 me an opportunity to speak  today.21 I am a president of a real  estate22 company that owns and manages approximately 1 , 00023 rent stabilized apartments all concentrated in24 Brooklyn.25 Over the last couple of  years2 
2 we' ve seen our expenses increase at3 disproportionate rates compared to previous years.4 Real estate taxes, for example, represent close  to5 30 percent of our total expense.	City- related fees6 and expenses, including water charges,7 administrative- related fees, violations that may be8 issued whether they' re merited or not, the cost9 associated with those have increased, all  represent10 another 10 percent, easily.11 And that' s -- that' s before so12 we' re at a number that' s 40 percent of total13 expenses, that' s before we get to the general14 operating expenses to maintain the building,  employ15 the employees and make sure that the tenants  have16 what I would consider quality housing.17 Now we own and manage  properties18 that we built.	Every single property that we  own,19 we built.	The first one was constructed in the  mid20 ' 40 ' s, the last one, most recently, in 2010 .	And21 I' d like to think that, across all of those22 properties, we do give the best possible service  we23 can because they' re homes and I take that into24 account.25 I' m asking the panel today to take2 
2 into account the increased costs associated  with3 operating housing today.	There' s 17 properties4 that we own, some of them don' t make money so  we5 have to take funds from other properties that  do6 make a profit to subsidize the ones that don' t.7 Now if I were in a position  where8 I didn' t have those properties, I couldn' t afford9 to continue to keep the property and that  would10 affect the tenants.	In most cases there' s11 financing on the property.	If for some reason I12 lost it, the bank would come in, they wouldn' t  get13 the same type of service, the same type of  quality14 housing that I provide.15 So I just want you all to  take16 into consideration that the expenses  have17 increased.	I realize that the one expense  this18 year that was less than what I expected was  fuel,19 but that was Mother Nature' s doing so I can  thank20 somebody else for that.21 You were very good to us  last22 year.	I do appreciate that.	But I want you to23 take into consideration again this year that we  do24 have a lot of expenses that are coming  up.25 Turnover vacancy was affected by the changes up  in2 
2 Albany over the summer and I just want you to   be3 fair because all we' re trying to do is provide  good4 housing, a place that people can call a home and   be5 proud to live in and a building that I can,   also,6 be proud to call my  own.7 Thank you.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.9 Any questions?10 Mr. Schleider.11 Followed by Mr. Adams.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.13 Across your portfolio, you said14 you have about 1 , 000 apartments, about how many15 buildings does that represent?16 MR. KERR:	Seventeen.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And you have a18 fairly large organization to help you manage  these19 55 or 60 buildings or  so?20 MR. KERR:	Yes.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	And22 -- I' m sorry -- you have 17 buildings but -- it' s23 about 55 to 60 units per  building?24 MR. KERR:	Yeah, the average25 building -- they' re all elevator buildings.	The2 
2 average building' s approximately 80 units.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yeah.	All right.4 So your mandates and your benchmarking is  pretty5 much across your portfolio?6 MR. KERR:	Yes.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.8 How' s that been handled?	Any difficulties with9 that?10 MR. KERR:	It hasn' t been11 difficult.	It does take additional resources.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.13 MR. KERR:	Which there' s an14 increase in labor, obviously, associated with  that.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.16 MR. KERR:	But as far as17 measuring and documenting the information, we  --18 it' s something that we' ve been doing for countless19 years.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	So --21 so this is an add on in terms of the   administrative22 expenses you have?23 MR. KERR:	It is.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And it' s not25 really benefiting you because you' ve been2 
2 monitoring your energy uses for quite some  time.3 MR. KERR:	Yes.4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.5 MR. KERR:	Yes.	We haven' t6 noticed any benefit to it whatsoever as far as,  you7 know, the whole concept of it.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right.	Now as9 out of your 1 , 000 , what would you say your average10 rent would be?11 MR. KERR:	I would say the12 average rent is probably $ 900 a month.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	Any14 deregulated units in your portfolio?15 MR. KERR:	They' re all rent16 stabilized.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All rent18 stabilized.	All right.	Great.19 What would you say is your  average20 cost per unit?21 MR. KERR:	Our average cost?	It22 depends on the building.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	The24 reason I' m asking is because, you know, we have  an25 average cost per building from the reports that  the2 
2 staff prepares for us.3 MR. KERR:	Sure.4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But I -- I can' t5 believe that all the costs are baked in  that6 actually are incurred, like these unfunded  mandates7 for benchmarking and such.	Not enough is really8 captured.9 MR. KERR:	It' s not.	You' re10 absolutely right.	You take into account, you  know,11 you were talking about Section 8 before, the  cost12 associated with maintaining and managing Section  813 is a much higher cost as -- there' s an  unknown14 component associated with it that you can' t see.15 People think that the City just sends in a   rent16 payment on behalf of the tenant but it' s not  really17 a well executed process.	The City is very18 disorganized in the way that it  handles it.	So in19 many cases you can spend hours each week  just20 trying to recover rent that' s due to you that' s21 eventually going to be paid  --22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	And23 that friction --24 MR. KERR:	-- but falls in25 arrears.2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right.	And that3 friction costs you money not only in time,  energy4 and effort that you expend but, also, in  the5 opportunity loss.6 MR. KERR:	Yeah.	Yeah,7 absolutely.	There' s no question.8 Our -- over the last couple  of9 years our collection rate has decreased.	We used10 to be able to collect about 96 percent of our   rent.11 We do a very good job screening our residents  and12 we have great residents.	But that number has --13 has decreased to about 86 percent and a  large14 percentage of the arrears is -- is Section  815 related money that' s not in dispute, it' s --16 they' re just slow to getting around to play it.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So this chronic18 lateness has -- has its own set of costs  and19 expenses.20 MR. KERR:	There' s no question.21 If you don' t have the income you need on a  monthly22 basis to support the expenses of the building,  you23 can' t pay your bills.	If you can' t pay your bills,24 you' re not going to get the services you need in25 order to be able to provide the service that  you2 
 2 need for your tenants.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	So if4 we have an average rent of about $ 900 and you' ve5 increased your collection loss rate by another  106 percent, you don' t have to have much more than,  I7 guess, a fifth grade education to figure out  what8 your extra load is on that  cost.9 Thanks.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Adams.11 MS. ADAMS:	Yes.	Did I12 understand you correctly with the last  building13 that you bought was in 2010 , a couple of years  ago?14 MR. KERR:	Built.	Built.15 MS. ADAMS:	Built.	And the one16 before that?17 MR. KERR:	The one before that 18	was 2005 .19 MS. ADAMS:	Okay.	So you' ve been20 increasing the number of buildings over time and  --21 MR. KERR:	Yes.22 MR. ADAMS:	-- these hardships23 have not been such that you would not engage  in24 additional buying of properties?25 MR. KERR:	It' s a good question.19 
2 I purchased property up in the northern section  of3 the Bronx eight years ago and four years later  I4 sold it because within that time period I couldn' t5 -- I couldn' t break even on the property.	It was6 too costly to manage and to  maintain.7 It depends on the property.	It' s8 hard to buy property unless you' re well funded.9 And in many cases -- and I say that because  there' s10 a lot of unknown quantities with  property.11 MS. ADAMS:	Sure.12 MR. KERR:	So the City13 regulations, you know, the State -- there' s all14 sorts of mandates that you have to -- you have   to15 meet in order to properly run  the building.	In16 some cases, if the previous owners haven' t taken17 care of their responsibilities and as an owner  that18 owns the property, I want to be responsible for   it19 but the expenses could be so great you can' t,20 necessarily afford to do it.21 That' s what took place with this22 particular building.	So it has dissuaded me,  I23 guess, in some respects, you know, with a ground  up24 building and new construction you know exactly  what25 you' re getting.	There' s also government programs2 
2 in place to help you subsidize the cost  associated3 with it.4 MS. ADAMS:	Right.5 MR. KERR:	You know, the 421 A tax6 abatement program, it' s a great program.	It7 certainly has a dramatic impact on, you know,  your8 ability to offer new quality housing as opposed  to9 not having a program.10 MS. ADAMS:	But there are a11 number of things that you take into account  before12 you decide to buy a  property.13 MR. KERR:	Oh, of course.14 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Holder.16 MS. HOLDER:	Thanks for your17 testimony today.18 Just on one point, I agree  with19 you, Section 8 and the way in which it' s20 administered through the New York City  Housing21 Authority -- and also some of the Section 8   that22 actually comes through HPD, it can be  extremely23 frustrating. And we had began some  discussions.24 And this is kind of a place  where25 as tenant advocates, the Legal Aid Society  and2 
2 landlords actually come together and agree. But I' m3 sure you' re familiar or maybe you' ve heard through4 some of your organizations, the Legal Aid  Society5 is trying to address a lot of these issues  and6 we' ve brought cases against Section 8 because it' s7 a real hardship for you and we want you to be   able,8 as other landlords, to be able to get the  subsidies9 that they' ve signed up to do.10 Section 8 is a wonderful  program11 when it works properly but it' s an extreme12 hardship, as you can imagine, for your clients  who13 find themselves in Housing Court and  facing14 eviction unnecessarily because of the  bureaucratic15 delay and the fact that they don' t have proper16 technology that seem to think that -- that' s all17 right.	And so that' s a real hardship.18 And so that' s where we, actually,19 could work together to agree and be, again, part  of20 a solution and we' re trying really hard to do  that.21 So I appreciate your testimony22 today.23 Thank you.24 MR. KERR:	I -- I am aware  of25 what you' re talking about and you have made2 
2 strides.	I do want to thank you for all the  effort3 that you' ve put in as well.4 Section 8 is -- they' re making an5 effort.	There' s no question.	There' s no question6 and it is a great program if executed  properly.7 MS. HOLDER:	Right.	And we' re8 together on that.	We have a lot of folks from  the9 organizations that support us in our litigation  so10 we appreciate that.11 MR. KERR:	Thank you.	Thank you12 everybody.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Kerr, any14 of your tenants getting a preferential  rent?15 MR. KERR:	Yes, absolutely.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	About how many?17 MR. KERR:	I don' t have the18 number offhand but I would say -- I would say  it' s19 probably 50 percent.	And the reason they' re20 getting a preferential rent is because many of  the21 tenants had a hardship in 2007 and 2008  and22 couldn' t afford to pay the rent.	So as opposed to23 increasing it each year, we may give them a   one24 year increase for two years and so on and so   forth.25 At some point, the market2 
2 increased at a much faster rate than we felt  was3 right to increase their rent to bring it back  to4 the legal rent so they maintained the  preferential5 rent.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.7 MR. CHEIGH:	I' m sorry -- just to8 follow -- so you do have, you kind of do a   self9 stabilization based on tenants who may try  to10 request some hardship consideration?11 MR. KERR:	In the buildings where12 we can afford it, we  are fair.	We' re very fair.13 If somebody has difficulty, they' re a good tenant14 and they' ve demonstrated an ability to be able to15 be a good resident, I would do whatever I   possibly16 could to see them stay,  within reason.	You know,17 it' s their home.	I don' t want to displace them.18 But if you' re asking me whether or19 not I' d subsidize 100 percent of somebody' s rent, I20 couldn' t afford to do that.21 MR. CHEIGH:	It' s just a huge22 number to hear that 50 percent of the -- of   your23 population gets maybe, I mean, that' s an estimate24 so you' re not sure about it.25 MR. KERR:	It' s an estimate.2 
2 It' s an estimate.	It' s not all from -- from3 subsidies.	Some of it might be, you know, we' ve4 performed renovations in an apartment upon  turnover5 and the new legal rent was beyond what we  could6 collect on renting the apartment.7 MR. CHEIGH:	And are most of your8 preferential rents concentrated in certain9 neighborhoods versus others?10 MR. KERR:	All of our properties11 are in south Brooklyn so they' re all in the  same12 vicinity.13 MR. CHEIGH:	Okay.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.15 MR. KERR:	Thank you.	I16 appreciate everybody' s time.17 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I appreciate19 your coming in.20 MR. KERR:	And I trust -- I  trust21this year is going to be -- it' s going to  bea good22year.23MS. HOLDER:	That dependson who24you' re talking to.25( Laughter.)
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Larry Wood.3 Welcome back, Larry.4 MR. WOOD:	Hello, once again.5 It struck me, the last two  owners6 that said you were very good to us last year   and7 they got income higher than they expected so  I8 guess you guys have been doing well for  getting9 those rents up for the last couple of years in   some10 eyes.11 I do want to thank you.	I thank12 you every year for your service.13 I know this is a difficult job  and14 there will be a lot of emotional  testimony15 throughout the day and, certainly, we' ll have a lot16 of theater on Thursday but you do really have  to17 deliberate and consider a lot of  stuff.18 I really want to start by  thanking19 Betty, I know you voted in the preliminary for  a20 zero guideline for the SROs and stuck with that.  I21 think you appreciate what this industry is  about22 and that these buildings are very profitable.  I23 know you visited SROs.	They' re in the community in24 which you live and I understand -- you  also25 understand the difficulty about enforcing provisos.2 
2 So thank you for voting for  zero3 and I hope you can stick it through through  the4 process.5 Ron, you didn' t vote for zero.6 You didn' t vote for the high guideline and you7 didn' t vote for the ones for in between so I wasn' t8 sure where you were at.	You have voted for zero in9 the past based on our testimony and the  information10 we' ve given you.	So I' m hoping you' re thinking11 about a very low guideline.12 And I want to make the  argument13 that if you' re looking at a low guideline but  with14 a very high proviso, you might as well go  straight15 zero across the board.16 And the same with David  and17 Courtney; David, you have voted in the past  for18 zero based on the information we' ve been able to19 document and provide and I really hope you  consider20 it again.21 Courtney, you haven' t voted zero22 before but I understand you are really looking  at23 the data.	You' re independent minded and, you know,24 and I hope it can convince you that it is the   right25 thing in the context for SROs.2 
2 And the same with Jonathan, I  know3 you' ve really looked at the provisos as a  tool.4 You' ve been to some SROs.	I know you understand5 the industry and I hope we can convince you  that,6 again, it' s the right thing to do is get a -- to  do7 a zero across the board.8 And even Steven and Magda, you9 voted for guidelines, you know, that are high  in10 our mind but you' ve also supported the concept of11 provisos which has been interesting.	I know you12 don' t want it to go near provisos when it comes  to13 apartment buildings and making some differentiation14 there but, I believe, you realize the only way  to15 get something beyond zero is if it was  conditioned16 with a proviso.17 So, at least, I want to thank  you18 for recognizing there are circumstances where19 owners really don' t warrant an increase, at least,20 in this industry among the SROs.21 So as my prefix there is a  new22 memo you had just got last week, it' s based on  201123 registration data and, I think, it really does  bear24 out the argument we' ve made in the past that this25 is a very profitable industry.	They get a lot of2 
2 revenue from non- stabilized units and you could3 really -- they could afford a zero percent  increase4 and it wouldn' t dramatically affect the industry.5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Larry, you6 spent so much time thanking us.7 MR. WOODS:	Well, there' s a8 purpose.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Go ahead.	We' ll10 give you a little leeway.	Okay.11 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.12 So you -- you passed out this  memo13 that was circulated.	Have you had time to look  at14 it and -- and what do you think about this   memo?15 MR. WOODS:	I' ll -- I' ll make it16 quick on the memos.17 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.18 MR. WOODS:	The memo is a  follow19 up on the two prior memos based on  200620 registration data and 2008 registration data.21 What' s interesting about this is we' ve lost 5 , 00022 units.	The light -- the registration in 2008  we23 had over 22 , 000 units, 22 , 827 in 472 buildings.24 For a variety of reasons, we also have  47225 buildings registered but only 17 , 000 units are2 
2 registered as stabilized.3 So 5 , 000 units have disappeared4 for some reason.	We' ve always said that we don' t5 believe the DHCR registrations are fully  accurate.6 So there' s a lot of units missing.7 But despite that, the number of8 exempt units have gone up.	They had gone from 249 to 26 and that was at  31 percent.	So even though10 it' s a -- it' s a smaller universe of units11 registered, the amount exempt has gone up. And  I12 think, that really bears out our own  observations13 that more and more units over time,  through14 attrition, whether it' s, you know, harassment or15 just naturally tenants pass away or move out,  the16 number of units exempt or vacant have gone  up.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Larry, you' re18 going to have to --19 MR. WOODS:	Yeah, it was really20 hard to figure out --21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	-- just to be22 fair.23 MR. WOODS:	-- the mean and median24 rents but if you look at those charts, they' re25 really -- they' re really off the hook.	The mean2 
2 and median rents for Manhattan, the mean rents  or3 the legal rent, $ 2 , 315 .	You' re talking about in4 SRO units.	In Manhattan, the SRO units are  cheaper5 to run on a square foot basis because you  have6 shared bathrooms, shared kitchens.	They' re more7 profitable on a square foot  basis.8 You just look at these rents.9 Even the actual rents collected or the  preferential10 rents, they are sky high.	And I don' t know how11 they even got this high when you have had  zero12 increases or increases with provisos. The data  from13 those prior memos also show that somewhere  between14 the majority and the vast majority of  buildings15 would not qualify for a guideline because of  these16 provisos.17 So I would argue, you know,  going18 up to 90 percent means that fewer buildings  would19 qualify.	We' re talking about the vast majority of20 SRO buildings would not qualify  for guideline.	So21 I would argue zero would be the fairest  thing,22 particularly, because how hard it is to enforce  for23 those rent remaining buildings that might,  indeed,24 qualify for an increase.25 MS. HOLDER:	So thank you.2 
2 And I do appreciate, also,  the3 staff getting this together so quickly and I  forgot4 to thank you all for that.	It was really great.5 But looking -- so looking at  this6 and looking at what' s going on in legal services7 and looking at what' s going on with -- with the8 number of housing applicants and organizers  that9 we' re able to work with on the issues of people  who10 live in SROs and other types of hotels and  rooming11 houses, what -- what is the burden for --  for12 enforcement?13 I knew 20 years ago that it  was14 very difficult to -- to advocate for this  housing15 stock.	What' s going on now?	Because I know16 there' s been a lot of attrition, if not, even17 layoffs in a lot of the  different programs.	How --18 how difficult is enforcement?19 MR. WOODS:	Well, here' s the term20 -- staffing -- there' s only two organizers up at21 the Law Project now and there were five, you  know,22 years ago and less attorneys.	That' s one thing --23 just being able to get access to get  help.24 But the enforcement we found  in25 many buildings where you have -- where it' s day  and2 
2 night. You have 20 percent of the building is  still3 stabilized, the rest is tourism or special needs  or4 whatever the case may be.	But that' s easy.	The5 landlord' s not going to try to insist on an6 increase.7 But when you get closer to  the8 borderlines of, you know, is it 20  percent9 deregulated? Is it 30 percent?	It' s very hard for10 the tenants to know how many of the neighbors  are11 still in the building and then it' s just a  long12 process of trying to educate people about  what13 their rights are and then how to enforce  them.14 It' s very expensive and time15 consuming to go to landlord/ tenant court.	You16 withhold your rent and the courts are  very17 reluctant to look at the DHCR data and they can' t18 sort it out.	They prefer you to go to DHCR,  file19 an overcharge complaint and that can drag on  for20 years.	A lot of tenants don' t even want to21 struggle with that process, especially if it  means22 confronting their landlord and it' s not always a23 pleasant experience.24 So for that reason we,  certainly,25 would prefer a proviso if there was going to be   an2 
2 increase. And we' ll do our best to try to  enforce3 it.	But, I think, because so many   buildings4 shouldn' t qualify anyway, I -- that' s really why we5 say across the board we should have a  zero6 guideline.7 These are very profitable8 buildings. We don' t need to break our backs to  try9 to extend an increase for some limited small  number10 of buildings in this -- in this  area.11 MS. HOLDER:	Thanks.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Adams.13 MS. ADAMS:	Yes.14 What is your recommendation for15 the other units that we make pronouncements  on?16 MR. WOODS:	Say it again?	What17 is the --18 MS. ADAMS:	What is your19 recommendation for an increase or not an  increase20 for --21 MR. WOODS:	Well, I' d say based22 on these rents that I' m seeing, you know, assuming23 these are -- are valid, these are extremely  high24 rents and these are very profitable buildings.	I25 would argue zero guideline for this  year.2 
2 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.4 ( Applause.)5 MR. WOODS:	Thank you.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	James Anderson.7 MR. ANDERSON:	Hello.	I respect8 you because you appointed from the Mayor,  Mayor9 elected illegally and -- anyway, I just  surprised10 that in this corner two people don' t know the  tax,11 can never be down.	Never.12 City, state and federal office13 fill up with lazy people and bosses of this  lazy14 people receive big salaries.	So why they stay here15 is not -- not normal.16 And fuel oil can never come  down.17 It come a little down.	Next time much more coming18 up.	That will be forever this problem, all   the19 time.20 I appreciate that you take21 seriously increasing the rent that' s held two,22 three, four percent.	That' s small help and not big23 help.	Big help would be the landlord is real  --24 real serious and repair all the time -- have  major25 capital improvement, something else and have  normal2 
2 tenant who do not make violation in the  apartment3 and pay in the time first -- some  pay later.	It' s4 all right.	They pay later.	But still wants to be5 paid off.6 So we cannot expect that  nothing7 -- politicians because they' re lazy and different8 and people, all of them, no one of them ever   helped9 with a tenant or with the  landlords.10 Mayor is the richest bum.	He only11 make money in stockmarket.	Five days give it12 interview to the TV, then another two days  to13 election in Bahama.14 City Councils can never do  this.15 Albany now the small city with big criminals --  too16 many criminals.	And majority of them lawyer/ liars.17 So in this situation left  between18 landlord and tenant they understand each  other,19 respect and everybody take care what his  duty.20 Seriously and that will be much  more nice.	Another21 can never help nothing --  definitely.22 Affordable house they stop and I23 never see at 1970 .	Maybe before that they stop.24 How get to make affordable house?	They have 4525 commissioners.	We don' t need 45 commissioners,2 
2 much too much this department.	And there is3 689 , 000 -- about seven- and- a- half time more than4 the biggest salary of big -- of small employee  of5 the City.6 So finish and this way -- and  I7 want to apologize that I ask you to ask   me8 questions.	Don' t ask me questions.	Relax there.9 You receive good payment.	Take it easy and never10 be busy and feel better all the time because it' s11 very hot.12 My statement or story what I13 bring, I believe, that they are hard and nobody  --14 just these two people who present last citizens  and15 they look at their last citizen -- let them ask   me16 questions and declare that I  lie.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Anderson,18 wrap it up, please.19 MR. ANDERSON:	So that mean this20 -- I reject a lot  of people.	I appreciate that you21 reject me and even try to make me admit I' m  more22 glad.23 Have a nice night.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25 You too.2 
2 Joyce Goodman, representing3 Assemblymember Daniel O' Donnell;4 Who will be followed by  Roger5 Melzer.6 MS. GOODMAN:	Good morning.7 My name is Danielle O' Donnell and8 I' m a member of the New York State Assembly, 69 th9 District, representing residents of Manhattan10 Valley, Morningside Heights, the upper west side  of11 Manhattan and southern Harlem.12 Thank you for the opportunity  to13 discuss rent adjustments for renewal leases  for14 rent stabilized apartments.15 The proposed rent increases, if16 passed, will be an economic burden to thousands  of17 families and individual renters who reside in  my18 district and throughout the City  at large.	The19 main purpose of rent regulation is to  protect20 tenants during an emergency housing shortage  from21 rent increases that would constitute a  hardship.22 The function of the Rent23 Guidelines Board when authorizing rent increases24 every year is to strike a balance  between25 maintaining affordable housing for tenants and2 
2 allowing landlords to maintain services and make  a3 reasonable profit.4 For too long, however, the City5 has failed to grasp who our renters are and  what6 incomes they have.	The result is that more7 families are finding it increasingly difficult  to8 afford their rents.	Once forced out of their9 apartments there are fewer and fewer  affordable10 housing options for low and middle income  New11 Yorkers.12 In my community office, the  crisis13 comes to life on a  regular basis.	We see many14 forced to choose between paying the rent and  paying15 for other necessities such as basic dental  care.16 We see those who are chronically late with  paying17 their rent because they have no savings and rely  on18 the arrival of their Social Security check  before19 paying the rent.20 We see those living on21 unemployment insurance needing to partition their22 one- bedroom apartments to make space for roommates23 in order to pay the  rent.24 We help our constituents complete25 applications for SCRIE or DRIE, only to  realize2 
2 that even with a subsidy they have to pay well   over3 50 percent of their income to rent.	We see many4 families with children unable to find any  housing5 anywhere after living in a City shelter for 11  or6 12 months.7 We see a constant flow of  people8 looking for rental assistance to  avoid9 homelessness, most of whom are working full  time10 but cannot afford their rents.	The reality is it11 doesn' t have to be this way.	The rent burden does12 not have to be so large a portion of incomes   in13 order for landlords to realize reasonable  profits.14 We know what affordable housing15 means to people and to communities.	Affordable16 housing helps to build more stable  communities,17 relieves stress within families and enables  people18 to eat healthier, become better educated and  save19 for life' s inevitable emergencies.20 I am adamantly opposed to  yet21 another rent increase which will further  burden22 thousands of New Yorkers who are already  struggling23 to make ends meet.24 Thank you.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.2 

2345	testimony.67
MS. GOODMAN:	Thank you. CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Adams.MS. ADAMS:	Thank you for yourMS. GOODMAN:	Sure.MS. ADAMS:	You mentioned the
8 incredible number of complaints that come into  your9 office because people are trying to find  affordable10 housing and we' re accustomed to the testimony11 before here. Can you share with us the  other12 efforts that she' s been involved with --13 MS. GOODMAN:	He.14 MS. ADAMS:	He.	I' m sorry.15 MS. GOODMAN:	That' s okay.16 MS. ADAMS:	That he' s been17 involved that would increase the number  of18 affordable units, other than what you  testified19 initially?20 MS. GOODMAN:	You mean21 legislation?22 MS. ADAMS:	Yes.23 MS. GOODMAN:	Well, one of the24 pieces of legislation he -- he sponsored was  to25 affect MCIs so that it wouldn' t be an increase,  a8 
2 permanent rent increase.	I mean, you asked me  that3 question last year but -- so that' s still --4 MS. ADAMS:	I ask most elected5 representatives that question.6 MS. GOODMAN:	So that' s a big7 piece of -- of what we -- of how to address   this.8 Because we see a lot of problems with major  capital9 improvement rent increases.	It puts much too much10 burden on tenants to figure out how to contest  an11 MCI.	Every MCI really requires a lawyer to   look12 over all the -- the application to see if  it' s13 accurate and there' s a lot of abuses that  are14 uncovered.	Really only what the organization  of15 tenants and the hiring of  an attorney.	So that' s a16 major problem, the MCI.17 And just about every unit in  our18 district that becomes vacant becomes  destabilized.19 I' ve -- I rarely see a new tenant regulated in  our20 -- throughout our district.	So that' s a --21 MS. ADAMS:	We don' t have a22 question about the fact that there is  a problem.	I23 was just wondering what other efforts  --24 MS. GOODMAN:	So the MCI is a  big25 -- is an example.	That' s not the end I work on.	I2 
2 work with tenants every day to try to find  rent3 subsidies for them.	The legislative piece is --  is4 left up to our legislative director.	So I' ll come5 better prepared next year with exactly all  the6 legislation that was proposed.7 If you have any questions about8 who' s coming into our office, the rent burden they9 find, I' d be glad to --10 MS. ADAMS:	No, I' m not so11 interested in people that come into your  office.12 We know that.13 MS. GOODMAN:	Okay.14 MS. ADAMS:	The other efforts15 you' re involved with.16 MS. GOODMAN:	Okay.17 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.18 MS. GOODMAN:	You' re welcome.19 Any other questions?20 ( No response.)21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	No.	Thank you.22 MS. GOODMAN:	Thank you.23 ( Applause.)24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Roger Melzer.25 Okay, Mr. Melzer.2 
2 MR. MELZER:	Yes.	I' ve given you3 a handout.	The first is a picture of the  building4 that I own which was built in  1927 .	It' s 85 years5 old.	I' ve owned since 1985 .	The second page is  a6 photo of it in its present state in Brooklyn  and,7 also, the hallways.8 This building has served about9 four generations of tenants and with adequate  rent10 increases in the future, hopefully, it can  serve11 another four generations of tenants.	It was here12 before I was born and it will probably be  here13 after I' m gone.14 It was stated on the -- on  the15 next page, an analysis, it was stated at the  May16 1 st hearing that rents had gone up in stabilized17 units by 5 . 5 percent or $ 2 , 200 per year per tenant.18 And I just have to take exception  to that.	I' ve19 never seen anything like that.	If you do the math20 on that, it -- it would indicate that an  average21 rent was $ 3 , 200 per month for a stabilized tenant22 which is physically or economically  impossible.23 But I wanted to then go to  the24 next page which is my analysis of  cumulative25 monthly rent increases for some of the  apartments2 
2 in my building over the last  11 years.	Tenants A,3 B and C are rent  stabilized tenants.	Tenant D is a4 rent controlled tenant.5 And the primary point I wish  to6 make is that the average stabilized rent  increases7 over 11 years has been about 3 percent and by   the8 more exacting rent control formulas administered  by9 the State, they' ve been 5 . 5 percent.10 So the magnitude of the  increases11 under rent control have been more in line with  what12 an owner needs to keep up with  cost increases.	The13 cumulative monthly increases on the  stabilized14 units of less than $ 200 over 11 years is  just15 minimal and inadequate.16 Finally, my last handout is17 something from a non- profit organization in18 Brooklyn in a local paper where they were  offering19 one- bedroom apartments for $ 925 a month for20 relatively low income tenants.	And what I' m asking21 today is that for those low rent apartments in  the22 rent stabilized inventory, that we also be given  a23 fixed dollar amount in this guideline to  come24 closer to the rent control increases over the  last25 11 years.2 
2 I would recommend for stabilized3 apartments under $ 900 , an increase of $ 50 fixed for4 a one year and $ 100 fixed for two- year rents and5 guidelines applying to rents above the $ 900 per6 month level.7 That concludes my comments.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.9 Melzer.10 MS. CRUZ:	I have a question.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz.12 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Melzer, thank you13 very much for these -- for  the submission.	It' s14 very, very interesting, especially to see, in  fact,15 how very minimal your increases have -- have  gone16 up on two model -- two sample  tenants.17 Can you talk a little bit  about18 your costs in maintaining these buildings,  more19 specifically, the fuel expenses?20 MR. MELZER:	Yes, my building is21 heated with No. 2 oil and I invested in a new   fuel22 computer two years ago. I didn' t apply for an  MCI.23 It was about $ 3 , 500 expense but I want to make the24 point that even though we had a mild winter,  the25 cost of fuel skyrocketed in my  building.2 
2 In the prior year that the  Rent3 Guidelines Board measures for cost years from  April4 of 2010 to April 2011 , I had about 12 , 500 gallons5 of fuel and spent $ 30 , 000 .	This most recent year,6 my gallonage was 10 , 800 down about 1 , 600 gallons7 but my cost went up by $ 8 , 000 .8 So even though we had a lot  milder9 winter, the price per gallon went up from $ 2 . 43 to10 $ 3 . 53 a gallon and I actually spent $ 8 , 000 more in11 this milder year than I did the prior year  because12 of the fuel spike in  prices.13 MS. CRUZ:	How are you going to14 fund the necessary conversion to your -- to  your15 heating system in order to comply with the  law?16 MR. MELZER:	This is No. 2 oil  so17 I don' t have to fund -- make any conversions.	It' s18 an old boiler.	Fifty years old, actually, it  used19 to be a coal boiler.	Eventually I will probably20 rip the whole thing out and -- and go to   natural21 gas but I haven' t contacted the gas company because22 it' s not been a priority at this point just  dealing23 with other matters in this building.24 But I had a -- I had an   estimate25 ten years ago for a new boiler that was $ 30 , 000 .2 
2 So I' m sure this new estimate in this day and  age3 will be 50 , 60 or $ 70 , 000 .	I have no idea.4 MS. CRUZ:	That' s in order to5 convert to gas.6 MR. MELZER:	From oil, yes.7 MS. CRUZ:	From oil and replace8 your heating system.9 MR. MELZER:	Right.	It' s a steam10 heating system.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Any others?12 Mr. Schleider.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Melzer, thank14 you.15 How many units in the building?16 MR. MELZER:	Twenty- seven.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And, I apologize18 if you mentioned this before, but what' s your19 average rent in the building?20 MR. MELZER:	Well, the unit does21 have decontrolled units.	The average rent is22 probably in the $ 1 , 500 - $ 1 , 600 a month range.	And23 the examples I gave are apartments that I   feel24 should be brought up to a higher standard or   a25 higher level of rent.2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	And in3 your fuel increased $ 8 , 000 just this past year --4 MR. MELZER:	Yes.5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- even though6 your consumption went down.	It' s almost $ 300 a7 unit just -- just with using  less oil.	So you feel8 that the low rent supplement is a  necessary9 component of your operating costs --10 MR. MELZER:	Yes.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- because the12 units that are below, I believe you said,  what?13	$ 900 ?14 MR. MELZER:	It was slightly15 helpful what, three and four years ago under  the16 orders 40 and 41 in terms of, you know, a lump   sum17 increase which just affected the tenants that  were18 well under -- paying well under the operating  costs19 of the building and tenants that had rents  above20 whatever your cutoffs were, did not have  that.21 They just paid the percentage increases.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	Thank you.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Holder.24 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.25 Could you tell me how many  units14 

2	you have, again?34
MR. MELZER:	I said 27 .MS. HOLDER:	Twenty- seven units.
5 And what' s the address of your building?6 MR. MELZER:	I don' t think I have7 to give you the address.	I don' t need that kind 8	of --9 MS. HOLDER:	I' m sorry.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You don' t have11 to.12 MR. MELZER:	I don' t have to give13 the address.	It' s in Brooklyn.14 MS. HOLDER:	It' s in Greenpoint.15 MR. MELZER:	I didn' t say -- no,16 it' s not in Greenpoint.17 MS. HOLDER:	Oh.	Where is it?18 MR. MELZER:	In Brooklyn.19 MS. HOLDER:	You can' t give the20 neighborhood?21 MR. MELZER:	It' s in the Windsor22 Terrace neighborhood.23 MS. HOLDER:	Windsor Terrace24 neighborhood.25 And how long have your tenants9 
2 been in place?	What' s the -- what the range of3 tenure?4 MR. MELZER:	The range is somebody5 that moved in -- people who were in place when   I6 bought the building in 1985 to people that moved  in7 last summer.8 MS. HOLDER:	And how much do new9 tenants pay for one, two, three  years?10 MR. MELZER:	The rents of the last11 two tenants that moved in were $ 1 , 750 and $ 1 , 800 .12 MS. HOLDER:	And how large were13 those apartments?14 MR. MELZER:	One bedroom15 apartments.16 MS. HOLDER:	And did you say that17 you -- you' ve been able to get some MCIs?18 MR. MELZER:	I didn' t say I had19 -- I' ve had MCIs when I put new windows in 25  years20 ago and a new roof maybe 20 years ago, 15   years21 ago.	I don' t remember exactly.	But that was  a22 minimal amount for each -- in each  case.23 MS. HOLDER:	Are you still24 applying for MCIs?25 MR. MELZER:	I haven' t applied2 

2	for MCIs recently.3
MS. HOLDER:	Anyone in your
4 building have a preferential rent?5 MR. MELZER:	I have one tenant6 with a preferential rent.7 MS. HOLDER:	And how much is that8 rent?9 MR. MELZER:	What the tenant is10 paying, I think, it' s $ 1 , 650 this year.	The legal11 rent is probably I' d say $ 1 , 775 , something like12 that.13 MS. HOLDER:	And why did you14 decide to give that tenant a preferential  rent?15 MR. MELZER:	That tenant' s been16 there 20 years and it' s just -- I felt that' s where17 the market was and I always like to be a little   bit18 under the market.	As a matter of fact, I  always19 like to be a little under the market for my   rents20 if I have the opportunity.21 MS. HOLDER:	Why is that?22 MR. MELZER: I like to -- I have  a23 good relationship with all my tenants and  they24 respect me and the job I' m doing as an owner.	You25 can see the -- the current condition of  the4 
2 building.	It' s immaculate.	As a matter of fact,3 Borough President Marty Markowitz wrote me a  note4 once, said Roger Melzer of Brooklyn' s the best5 landlord.	Whether I am or not, I don' t know.	But6 I take pride in the fact that a tenant  advocate7 recognized me as an excellent  landlord.8 MS. HOLDER:	That' s -- that' s9 wonderful.	We always -- we always hope and I  hope10 that my landlord values me as a long- time tenant.11 And it sounds like you value some of your  tenants.12 MR. MELZER:	I' ll say one other13 thing, I would not rent an apartment to a   tenant14 unless I was willing to live in  it myself.	That' s15 always been my philosophy as an owner and I   can16 tell you that any tenant -- any apartment that' s17 offered is in first rate  condition.18 MS. HOLDER:	How many rent19 controlled tenants do you have?20 MR. MELZER:	One.21 MR. CHEIGH:	Mr. Melzer --22 MS. HOLDER:	And how long has that23 tenant been in place?24 MR. MELZER:	Well, prior to my25 owning the building, I guess, prior to 1971 or  ' 742 
2 whenever that cutoff date is.3 MS. HOLDER:	But you don' t know4 exactly when?5 MR. MELZER:	No, I don' t.6 MS. HOLDER:	And how large is7 their apartment, how many bedrooms?8 MR. MELZER:	One bedroom.9 The point I was trying to  make10 before is that the process that the State  goes11 through examining all the cost -- costs that  they12 have is provided over an 11 - year period, an average13 increase of 5 . 5 percent and the board here, I14 assume, is using the same process and that has  been15 substantially under that though since the  beginning16 of this century, the year 2000 .17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Melzer.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	It seems that20 you' re able to maintain the property because you21 have a -- an average rent that appears to allow   you22 to maintain the property.23 MR. MELZER:	I' m also hands on.	I24 am the guy there every -- almost every day of   the25 week so.2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.3 MR. MELZER:	I have a skilled4 carpenter that assists me.	I have somebody else5 that helps me but I' m there.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But you' re there.7 MR. MELZER:	I' m a hands on8 owner.	Nothing' s done without my directing it.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So -- so -- so10 going back to what you said about a minute or   so11 ago, there are costs associated with owning  a12 building that our staff research doesn' t adequately13 capture.14 MR. MELZER:	Well, that' s for15 sure.	I -- I put bicycle racks in this past  --16 past year for the tenants in the courtyard  which17 are being utilized.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And your own19 labor, really, isn' t captured in this.20 MR. MELZER:	No, I mean, I' m going21 through catalogs choosing the best bike rack,  I22 think, is possible --23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right.24 MR. MELZER:	-- working out with25 my mechanic how we' re going to install them.2 
2 Meeting the truck when it brings it from  North3 Carolina to curbside and getting -- getting  the4 stuff in -- into the  building.5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Do you have a6 professional management that oversees this?7 MR. MELZER:	I am the professional8 manager.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	So if10 you had to have a professional management  company,11 like most landlords do, would you still be able  to12 maintain the quality that your tenants  appreciate13 or would it be a  challenge?14 MR. MELZER:	Well, I enjoy what15 I' m doing.	I can' t --16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I understand that.17 MR. MELZER:	-- even contemplate18 having a management company.	So I' m not quite sure19 what your question is.	I think I do a better  job20 than a professional management company because I' m21 the owner.	I have to answer for everything.	I22 write the checks for everything.	I get the bills23 for everything.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.25 Thank you.2 
2CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.3Mr. Melzer, do you have any4tenantswhoaresubsidized by SCRIE or DRIE?5MR.

Who will be followed by  AnnMR. JONES:	Keith Wright let it be
15 known that he' s the new New York State Democratic16 party leader.	I imagine some of you know  him.17 He' s the leader of the Democratic party in New  York18 State.19 He said that the negro alleged20 owner of the Rivington pocketed $ 100 million.	That21 was his -- that was the word he used, pocketed  $ 10022 million.	He made some -- the negro like donor  made23 some capital improvements but as he stepped  away24 from the building, he pocketed - pocketed, $ 10025 million.15 
2 Was this the money that the  City3 was seeking in taxes, you know, to pay the --   pay4 the police, pay the, you know, what they claim,  you5 know, that' s the money for the pay -- pay  the6 police.7 He pocketed -- Keith Wright said,8 the negro alleged owner pocketed $ 100 million.9 Chinese New York City foreclosure10 worker is not required to substantiate the truth  of11 any claim according to the Corporation Counsel,  10012 Church.	But according to Corporation Counsel,  New13 York City foreclosure liars are subject to  a14 criminal procedure.15 Why did you lie, negro?	Christ16 indicated that the guys with harems of women  were17 contributors to male homosexuality.	See the use of18 the eunuch word.	There are those who claim Ruth19 and Esther in the bible were lesbian  women.20 There was a black American  who21 indicated evidence of the Arabs being the  middle22 man, profiteers in the American  slave trade.	Is it23 just a coincidence or that Duke -- the Doris  Duke24 Foundation is the largest collection of Islamic  art25 in the world.2

Release5 criminals from jails in Europe who owed money  back6 in Europe.7 The American Indians massacred8 large colonies of caucasians early on but with  the9 invention of the Gatling gun, the tide  turned10 against the American Indians.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Jones, your12 times is up.13 Thank you.14 ( Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ann Nasary.16 Who will be followed by  Cullen17 Barrie.18 MS. NASARY:	I was a little19 confused with the previous speaker.20 All I know is as a woman of   faith,21 I' m here to speak on behalf of landlords.22 This is my first time speaking  and23 I just only wish that I would have done  this24 sooner.	But, as usual, with our busy lives,  we25 tend to forget certain important things that  we2 
2 need to take care of.	And for many years I  would3 just complain and complain, feeling that as  a4 landlord in New York City we always look like  the5 bad guys.6 And it' s always landlords versus7 tenants and from what I' ve seen in here, landlords8 are always the bad people.	We' re not bad people.9 We' re regular human beings, we work, at least I  do,10 80 hours a week and whatever I have no one gave   it11 to me.	I' ve worked very hard.12 I come from humble beginnings.	My13 mother was a single mom with  five children.	And I14 swore to my lord that I would never live the   life15 that my poor mother did in New  York City.	And I16 put myself through school and I' ve worked very hard17 to accomplish what I  have.18 I' m proud to say that I' m also a19 property owner and two of them are rent  stabilized.20 I' m also a franchisee of Dunkin21 Donuts and a Popeyes Fried Chicken.	It' s been over22 20 years, my whole life is  working.23 I' m here to say that the past six24 years I' ve struggled financially with these25 buildings.	They are either vacant or the  tenants2 
2 don' t pay rent.	And the rent stabilized tenants3 pay very little rent.	And every single day I  get4 complaints from them and as a landlord from  the5 previous speaker, I take pride in my  buildings.6 And I' m always on top of taking care of  the7 building whether it' s a toilet repair, whether it' s8 a leak in the ceiling, whether it' s a -- a  the9 paint that needs fixing.	I' m on top of taking all10 precaution with lead paint, with window  guards.11 I' m on top of everything on a daily  basis.12 If anyone calls my office  and13 files a complaint, within 48 hours it is  rectified.14 So I' m very sensitive to all tenants.	But what15 bothers my mind is the abuse of some tenants  living16 there 30 plus years, average rent $ 400 to $ 500 .17 The units I have are total 12 and the average  rent18 is about $ 500 /$ 600 .	That does not meet my  mortgage19 expenses.	That does not meet my property and  water20 tax.21 And I' ve been struggling to the22 point of almost having a nervous breakdown the  past23 five years.	Because if it wasn' t for my Dunkin24 Donuts and Popeyes, I wouldn' t be able to keep  my25 head above water with the property that I  have.2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Please wrap up.3 MS. NASARY:	Unfortunately, I had4 to sell some buildings and, as we know, it' s not  a5 seller' s market so I lost a lot of money on  that.6 I' m just pleading for the board7 to, you know, the minimal increases that we do  have8 is not enough.9 I -- I always thought that  we10 lived in a democracy.	I don' t understand how the11 government can dictate to private owners what  rent12 we should put on our private property that  we13 bought and no one gave to  us.14 Two percent and five percent15 increases is not enough.	Even if it goes up  to16 nine percent, it is not enough.	I wish if it was17 Ann' s World that I would just totally abolish rent18 stabilization.	I don' t think it' s fair to the19 landlord and, I believe, that the tenants don' t see20 us as human beings.	They think that we' re made out21 of money and that, you know, we have a money   tree22 paying all our bills.23 We don' t have a money tree.	We24 have expenses just like they do but the abuse  that25 goes on where we have to wait for a tenant to   pass2 
2 away in order to rent it at a decent price is --   is3 unacceptable.	I' ve experienced a lot of losses in4 my buildings, some of them are  mixed use.	I' ve5 been in and out of court with tenants that don' t6 pay rent and in New York City a tenant can get   away7 with not paying rent for a  year.8 I' ve lost thousands of dollars in9 rents --10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Nasary, I' m11 going to ask you to please  wrap up.	Your time is12 up.13 MS. NASARY:	Yes.	And I' ve lost14 thousands of dollars in the legal system,  in15 attorney fees which the tenants and no one can  pay16 back.17 Unfortunately, I had to put  some18 of the buildings up for sale because I was  not19 meeting my mortgage payments with the rents.	So,20 you know, I' m hoping that we can do something  to21 increase it not nine percent -- that' s not doable.22 That' s not going to help me pay my taxes or  my23 mortgage.24 And Banco Popular always asks for25 a financial statement at the end of the year  --2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Nasary, I' m3 going to cut you off  now.4 MS. NASARY:	Okay.	Thank you.5 I just want to say to please  be6 more sensitive to landlords and to increase it  a7 lot more than nine percent.8 Thank you.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Are there any10 questions?11 MS. CRUZ:	Yeah.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz.13 MS. CRUZ:	Can you tell me where14 your building is located and how many units it  has?15 MS. NASARY:	Yes, 355 Stockholm,16 six units and 349 Stockholm, which is equivalent  to17 137 Wyckoff and it' s -- it' s six apartments.18 MS. CRUZ:	And where is -- where19 is that?20 MS. NASARY:	That' s in Bushwick,21 Brooklyn.22 MS. CRUZ:	That' s in Bushwick,23 Brooklyn?24 MS. NASARY:	Brooklyn.25 MS. CRUZ:	And what is the average2 
2 rent in those buildings?3 MS. NASARY:	About $ 500 .4 MS. CRUZ:	So are you urging this5 board to implement the low rent supplement so  that6 you have a minimum rent  increase?7 MS. NASARY:	I' m -- I' m pleading8 for mercy.	I' m pleading for mercy that something9 has to change immediately with the whole  system.10 Five percent, nine percent is not  doable.11 MS. CRUZ:	Right.	But we can' t12 change the whole system.13 MS. NASARY:	Sure, we can.14 MS. CRUZ:	This board can' t.	I15 assure you, we can' t.16 MS. NASARY:	We all can if we  all17 stick together.	I feel like politicians are  not18 doing their job.19 MS. CRUZ:	But, specifically, what20 would be a minimum rent that would facilitate  you21 in --22 MS. NASARY:	$ 1 , 200 a month.23 MS. CRUZ:	And right now your24 tenants are paying --25 MS. NASARY:	$ 500 .2 
2	MS. CRUZ:	$ 500 .3 MS. NASARY:	So out of pocket I' m4 paying my mortgage.	Out of pocket I' m paying my5 heating bill.	Out of pocket I' m paying my property6 tax.7 MS. CRUZ:	Your -- your8 franchisees are trying to -- are  --9 MS. NASARY:	My franchises are10 paying a lot of the expenses from the property  and,11 unfortunately, the past six years due to  the12 economic recession, my franchisees are not doing  as13 well and I was forced to sell about six of them   to14 keep my head above water.15 So the 20 years of my hard  working16 money is going down the drain.	So I' m here17 pleading for mercy that something immediately  has18 to be changed because it' s unfair to -- to  people19 that worked hard and because they' re able to20 finally buy a piece of property in New York  City21 that is controlled by tenants that don' t care and22 don' t pay rent and all they do is complain.23 I get complaints every single  day.24 No matter how good I am, it' s not good enough.	I25 had a tenant complain the other day, sent --   called3 
2 the Housing Department for another tenant that  left3 the garbage for a day or two in the  hallways.4 That' s -- that' s very, you know, unacceptable.5 I had another tenant that you' re6 not supposed to have dogs and I' m an animal7 advocate.	I' m a member of the animal North Shore8 League.	I' m a member of the ASPCA and I' m a member9 of the Animal Humane Society.	I donate a lot  of10 money to the poor, to the widow, to the  orphans.11 I' m also part of a ministry, Ann Nasary' s Ministry,12 the past three years.13 And the tenant was crying to  me14 to, please can I keep my doggie in the  apartment.15 And I personally went to speak to the tenant  and16 due to the fact that I love dogs so much,   sometimes17 I wish humans were more like dogs - they  love18 unconditionally.19 But I -- I made an exception  to20 the rule and I said, okay, but please keep the   dog21 quiet and keep it clean.	So we came to an22 agreement.	Unfortunately, a year passed and23 another tenant had a daughter and she got  startled24 by the dog.	The dog did not touch her.	The dog25 did not do anything but she fell and  got hurt.	So2 
2 that became my problem as  well.3 So it' s every single day, you4 know, I' m walking on egg shells and that shouldn' t5 be that if you have a property in New York   City,6 you should be happy.	You should be content.	Not7 every single day wondering what' s going to break,8 what lawsuit is going against you and at the end  of9 the month, what are your losses.10 I think there' s something11 extremely wrong with the system.	New York City12 does not look out for the landlords  at all.	It' s13 always the -- the tenants are the underdog and  I14 just feel that the board and New York City has   to15 be more sensitive to landlords because we  are16 regular people that we have bills  and,17 unfortunately, the more you have, the more you  pay.18 Even if you have your own home and you have  a19 mortgage and you have bills to  pay.20 I want to thank everyone for  your21 kindness and I want to thank everyone for  your22 time.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Are there any24 other questions?25 Ms. Adams.2 
2 MS. ADAMS:	What' s the total3 number of units that you own?4 MS. NASARY:	Twelve.5 MS. ADAMS:	I' m sorry.6 MS. NASARY:	Two rent stabilized7 buildings, six units each.8 MS. ADAMS:	I' m sorry, would you9 repeat --10 MS. NASARY:	Two rent stabilized11 buildings in Brooklyn, --12 MS. ADAMS:	Uh- huh.13 MS. NASARY:	-- six units each.14 MS. ADAMS:	Okay.	Thank you.15 MR. CHEIGH:	So just -- how long16 have you owned the buildings?17 MS. NASARY:	Since 1998 .18 MR. CHEIGH:	' 98 .19 MS. NASARY:	And the other one --20 in 2000 , I believe.21 MR. CHEIGH:	And did you -- did22 you purchase it with a -- with most of the   tenants23 that are still there now?24 MS. NASARY:	One of them. It was25 four out of the six was vacant and they' ve  been2 
2 vacant -- I tried to re- model and I' m trying my3 best to even destabilize the building because  I4 can' t afford the -- the mortgage with the rent5 stabilized.6 MR. CHEIGH:	So you -- you7 purchased --8 MS. NASARY:	And the other9 building was average about $ 500 to $ 600 and a lot10 of the tenants are there 20 plus  years.11 Unfortunately, there are tenants12 that abuse the system.	I have this one lady  that13 she goes on vacation so she' s rent stabilized but14 she could afford a nice vacation every single  year15 for two or three months and while she' s on16 vacation, she rents out the  apartment.17 I have proof of such.	I sent her18 letters that she cannot rent her unit out to  other19 people during the summer while she' s on vacation.20 I have another tenant that  has21 about three generations, the same family --  over22 and over, there' s about 20 people in and out  for23 the past year.	And they, obviously, pay her rent.24 MR. CHEIGH:	Could I --25 MS. NASARY:	So these tenants are2 
2 making money out of the  apartments.3 MR. CHEIGH:	I' m sorry, ma' am,4 one question I have is  --5 MS. NASARY:	They' re making money6 out of the apartments.7 MR. CHEIGH:	I -- I do want  to8 ask the question and this is what my last  question9 is.	You know, you mentioned a couple of   times10 that you have vacancy in -- in your buildings  but11 you' re not renting your units out because you don' t12 want --13 MS. NASARY:	I' m afraid to rent it14 out because of the tenants that I' ve had in  the15 past.	I' m afraid to rent it out because the rent16 is not doable.	So I' d rather have it empty than17 have a tenant that pays $ 400 rent and gives me  all18 these headaches.	So I' m paying out of pocket for19 four of the units right now because I' m a  nervous20 wreck renting them out to these tenants that  abuse21 the system.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Four of the23 units in one of your six- unit buildings are empty?24 MS. NASARY:	Yes.25 ( Audience participation.)2

Who will be followed by  HelenWho will be followed by  RobertMR. BARRIE:	Hello.	My name is
17 Cullen Barrie but I' m here speaking on behalf of18 New York City Councilmember Jessica  Lapin.19 MS. ADAMS:	I' m sorry, would you20 repeat that, please.21 MR. BARRIE:	Yeah.	I' m speaking22 on behalf of City Councilmember, Jessica  Lapin.23 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.24 MR. BARRIE:	My name is25 Councilmember Jessica Lapin and I represent  City17 
2 Council District 5 which includes the upper  east3 side and Roosevelt Island and many residents  who4 rely on rent protections to stay in their  homes.5 Each year I stand before the  RGB6 and ask you to consider a more reasonable  approach7 to rent increases.	This year the RGB, the Rent8 Guidelines Board has proposed a hike of  between9 1 . 75 percent and 4 percent for one- year leases and10 between 3 and 3 . 5 and 6 . 75 percent for two- year11 leases.12 While costs continue to rise on13 our most basic expenses, middle class tenants  need14 the assurance that any rent increase will be  one15 they can handle.16 In 2008 , the board adopted the17 highest rent increases in 20  years.18 In 2009 , during one of the deepest19 dips in our nation' s and City' s economy, the board20 approved a rent increase of 3 percent and  621 percent.22 In 2011 , our economy continued to23 struggle.	The board increases of 3 . 75 and 7 . 25 for24 two year leases.25 Across our country and here in  New2 
2 York, the cost of food, energy and health care  have3 gone up even as our slow economy forces people  to4 do more with less. In New York City,  the5 unemployment remains uncharacteristically high,6 standing at over 9 percent.	Our economy is still7 on a fragile road to  recovery.8 Unduly raising rents on millions9 of middle class New Yorkers is not a recipe  for10 economic recovery.	Two- and- a- half- million middle11 class New Yorkers live in rent  protected12 apartments.	If we lose our middle class, our  City13 loses its economic base.14 Therefore, I urge the Rent15 Guidelines Board, as I did last year, to take  a16 more holistic view this year.	Keep these New17 Yorkers in their homes by using a fair  and18 reasonable approach.19 Thank you.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Excuse me,22 Cullen.23 MR. BARRIE:	Yes.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.2 
2 Could you describe to me what  --3 what Councilwoman Lapin means by assurance that  --4 that rents are affordable?	I' m not quite -- I' m5 not quite sure I understand what she means  by6 assurance.7 MR. BARRIE:	I think the idea8 being that -- that the board should just, on  a9 yearly basis, give people faith that the  rents10 won' t be unfairly increased to a level that  they11 can' t afford.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So how does this13 -- has Councilwoman Lapin asked for assurance  on14 anything else that affects middle class  residents15 of this City?16 MR. BARRIE:	I' m not her17 legislative director but I know that -- in  her18 capacity as chair of the Aging Committee, she  has19 been working on the SCRIE program heavily  to20 provide assurance to people that that program  will21 be managed, efficiently, fairly.	So I don' t know22 if that answers your question but  --23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No, it really24 doesn' t.	Because that' s assurance that a program25 will be handled efficiently.	But how does she2 
2 expect assurance for affordability?3 MR. BARRIE:	That I could not4 answer.	I' m sorry.5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.7 Helen Daniels.8 MS. DANIELS:	Thank you.9 That was truly, truly unexpected.10 Thank you.11 I' m Helen Daniels.	It' s been12 awhile since I' ve spoken here.	I represent an13 organization called the Black Latino  Property14 Owners Coalition.15 For many years we were regulars16 here at this hearing speaking out in public  and17 Albany and the City, fighting for the issues  of18 small property owners, minority owners but  property19 owners in general.20 However, we decided it' s time to21 get back out.	So this year we' re coming.	Again,22 we will say, property ownership,  residential23 property, rental property, this is a business  to24 those who own property.	Therefore, it needs to be25 treated as a business.2 
2 If any of you own a business,  you3 understand.	You must meet your expenses and  you4 hope to have some kind  of profit.	And that' s5 really all that property owners are  asking for.	A,6 they need to meet their -- they need to meet   their7 expenses.8 The tenants are the consumers.9 So, therefore, in a business, those who consume  as10 the business or the property that' s being -- the11 property' s that' s being bought understand that they12 must pay what needs to paid in order to gather   what13 they want, to have what they  want.14 Therefore, it is important that15 the tenants pay the bills that need to  be paid.	So16 as small property owners, there is a need for  the17 rents to be increased.	All that owners ask for  is18 fairness in this system.19 As my colleague said back here20 earlier, please, don' t put the small property owner21 out of business.	It' s unfortunate she' s having to22 have apartments vacant because that' s not what23 people want to do.	What they want to do is to  rent24 their property, provide housing, quality housing25 but, also, meet their expenses and have a  profit.2 
2 Keep in mind there are expenses3 that are passed on and some that aren' t passed  on.4 Think about what it takes to run  a building.	You5 pay taxes, water, sewer bills.	And, of course,6 there' s regular maintenance and then are any other7 expenses so far the City or the State decides  to8 put on a small property.	Such now is the oil9 conversion expenses.	Who is going to absorb  those10 expenses?11 Many small owners wanted to  be12 here today but weren' t able to be here today.	Why?13 Because they' re working a regular job to help14 support the buildings that they own that' s15 providing housing for many tenants in the City  of16 New York.17 By not providing and not  giving18 the owner the proper rents, that means -- it  could19 conceivably mean that there' s loss of housing in20 the City of New York.	Small owners do not want  to21 see that happen.	They want to be a part of  the22 solution.	So, please, help them be a part of  the23 solution by assuring they receive rents that  help24 maintain t heir buildings.25 Thank you.2

CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.Mr. Cheigh.MR. CHEIGH:	All right.	ThankCould you -- could you just  talk
7 about the -- are you a property owner  yourself?8 MS. DANIELS:	Actually, I am.	I9 mean, for you -- I am a  property owner.	My10 property is no longer in New  York City.	I chose to11 move out of the City and take my property  ownership12 elsewhere.13 But, however, I am still  very14 active in the movement in New York and have  been15 involved with this for a number of  years.16 So I do manage the -- run  the17 organization as the president and many of  the18 members not only have, of our organization,  have19 property here in the City but they also  have20 property in Westchester and in Dutchess County  as21 well.22 MR. CHEIGH:	And how many members23 do you have in your organizations?	How many24 buildings and what' s the average size of the25 buildings?7 
2 MS. DANIELS:	Well, they' re small3 buildings.	I don' t have statistics here for you4 today but I can get them for you if you would   like.5 Because we' re just re- constituting6 our organization now we have about 10 , 12  members7 that are currently involved.8 MR. CHEIGH:	And how long has the9 organization been around?10 MS. DANIELS:	We started to be11 very active in the early ' 90 s and ' 80 s when, you12 know, there was a lot of SRO issues, et  cetera.13 And then around the late ' 90 s and the early 2000 ' s,14 people just got tired.	They felt like they were15 fighting every day just with their -- just  their16 existence and we kind of  slowed down.	And then17 this year we decided it was time to come back   out18 again in the last say, six months or  so.19 MR. CHEIGH:	So it' s mostly SRO20 owners that you represent?21 MS. DANIELS:	Yes.	No, not SRO22 owners.	That' s how we started, the SRO issue.23 MR. CHEIGH:	Okay.24 MS. DANIELS:	But many of our25 members have, you know, buildings of 10 , 12 units2 
2 and some have only maybe three or four  units.3 MR. CHEIGH:	I guess one of the4 main points that the prior testimonies  regarding5 SRO units have been that is that SRO units  have6 mean and median rents that are extremely high.  And7 these are for units that are simply  providing8 bedrooms and facilities where you have  shared9 bathrooms and shared kitchens.	You don' t have your10 own, you know, bathroom and your own kitchen  but11 they' re paying pretty high rents.12 MS. DANIELS:	Well, the reality of13 it is if someone is paying a high rent, no   matter14 what the rent is, the building must  maintain15 itself.	It is a business.16 MR. CHEIGH:	That' s what we --17 MS. DANIELS:	However, let me say18 something, I will speak this way as far as   SRO19 units are concerned.	I am really sorry that in  New20 York City today we -- this is a personal  comment21 now.	Let me be clear, this is a personal   comment,22 that we still have SRO units.	I don' t think that' s23 the healthiest way to live.24 I wish we had instead of SRO  units25 we could have more studio apartments so  people2 
2 could have their own private bath and their  own3 cooking facilities.	But the reality of it that  is4 not where we are right now -- in this  environment.5 So even though SRO tenants feel6 they' re paying exorbitant rents, many owners still7 feel there is a need to have rent increases  in8 order for them to meet their daily and monthly  and9 yearly expenses.10 MR. CHEIGH: I don' t know how many11 years have gone by without any testimonies from  SRO12 owners at the actual set aside time where we  have13 very close intimate hearings with building  owners,14 tenant advocates --15 MS. DANIELS:	I can' t -- I don' t16 know.17 MR. CHEIGH:	Okay.	And it seems18 that there' s very few advocacy from the SRO owners19 and we just assumed that they must be doing  very20 well.	They must not be interested in the  very21 harsh provisos that if we -- if you use  those22 provisos in the apartment buildings, it  would23 become a huge uproar where we have provisos of  8024 percent of requirements -- 95 percent but we do  not25 hear from SRO owners.2 
2 MS. DANIELS:	What -- when your3 question was asked to me, when did we get  started,4 I stated that we got started when the SRO unit   was5 very much alive and well.	That' s when we get6 started.	I' m not saying that that is a primary7 issue for many owners today, it' s an issue for8 tenants and an issue for owners.	But that' s not9 how we -- that' s how we got started.10 So right now what we' re focusing11 on is the need to provide quality housing for  the12 tenants who are in our buildings or in  the13 buildings here in New York City.	And so what14 owners are saying for, please help us provide  the15 quality that we want to provide.	But in order to16 provide that quality, we must secure rents  that17 will enable us to do so.	And so the percentages18 that are being asked to today, will not  enable19 owners to do that.20 And what we don' t want to see are21 owners going out of business and owners keeping  --22 keeping apartments vacant because they are  afraid23 because of how the system is set up with having   to24 assume all the legal costs, the court costs and  all25 the other costs associated with property  ownership.2 
2 MR. CHEIGH:	I think in the SRO3 situation we have heard a lot about building  owners4 who keep their units vacant in order to  warehouse5 them in order to be able to sell the  property.6 MS. DANIELS:	I -- I did  not7 address SRO issues now.	If you' d like to have a8 conversation about SRO units and what' s going on9 with that, I think, we should have that for  another10 day because that' s not what I came prepared to11 speak to now and I' m sure that anyone else  here12 that I' m aware of, that I feel -- that is here  with13 me right now, came to address that unit --  that14 issue.15 So if we' d like to have a16 conversation about what' s going on with SROs in the17 City of New York, then I will be glad to engage   in18 that conversation with you at a later time when  we19 could do it either on one- on- one or another20 environment but not this one.21 MS. HOLDER:	So you no longer --  I22 just want to make sure that I  understand it.	You23 no longer advocate for maintaining SROs or  rooming24 houses in the City; is that what you' re saying?25 MS. DANIELS:	Well, I said2 
2 personally, SRO -- I' d like to see those SROs3 turned into studio apartments.	That' s what I said4 personally.	That' s a personal opinion.	It' s not a5 matter of saying this type of housing may not  be6 needed.	I don' t think it' s healthy, that' s what I7 said.8 MS. HOLDER:	How many SROs have9 you owned, previously?	I understand you' re saying10 you don' t own property in New York City anymore; is11 that correct?12 MS. DANIELS:	That' s correct.13 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.14 MS. DANIELS:	When I bought --15 that the property I bought in New York City  years16 and years ago, was an  SRO.17 MS. HOLDER:	Was that the property18 on Astor Place?19 MS. DANIELS:	Yes, it was.20 MS. HOLDER:	And you -- you sought21 to convert that as soon as you bought it;  correct?22 MS. DANIELS:	I thought it was23 rented before I bought it,  truthfully.24 MS. HOLDER:	I' m sorry.25 MS. DANIELS:	My intent at that2 
2 time was to make it a home for my family and   my3 children.	That' s why I bought the house.	It was4 not a building, it was a  house.5 MS. HOLDER:	But it was being --6 it was functioning as an  SRO.7 MS. DANIELS:	Yes, it was.8 MS. HOLDER:	How many units were9 in that SRO?10 MS. DANIELS:	How many units at11 that time?12 MS. HOLDER:	Um- hum.13 MS. DANIELS:	Nine.14 MS. HOLDER:	And then what15 happened?	How long did you keep that  SRO?16 MS. DANIELS: I guess I  stayed17 there, I don' t know, 10 or 15 years.	I don' t think18 that' s relevant but I stayed in the house about  1019 or 15 years and then I moved from the City,   sold20 the property and moved to take care of my  aging,21 elderly parents.	I don' t think it' s relevant to22 our conversation here today but, however, does  that23 answer your question?24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Correct.	Let' s25 try and keep the conversation.	You' re absolutely2 
2 right, Ms. Daniels.3 MS. DANIELS:	Thank you.4 MS. HOLDER:	So you' re here on5 behalf of your association.	You said you will6 provide us with information about the number  of7 units that the -- that your members actually  hold8 and the neighborhoods where they hold those  units9 and the average rents?10 MS. DANIELS:	Sure.	Be glad to.11 Yes, I did say that.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 MS. DANIELS:	You' re welcome.14 ( Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Robert16 Atterbury, representing Senator Tom Duane.17 MR. ATTERBURY:	Hi.	My name' s18 Robert Atterbury.	I' m here to testify on behalf of19 New York State Senator Tom Duane.20 He represents New York State' s21 29 th Senate District which would include the upper22 west side, Hells Kitchen, Greenwich Village,23 Chelsea, the East Side, Stuyvesant Town,  Peter24 Cooper Village and Waterside Plaza.25 This mixed income district is2 
2 composed largely of tenants, thousands of them  rent3 stabilized, many of whom are already allocate too  a4 high a percentage of their income towards  rent.5 Thank you for the opportunity  to6 testify.7 Given the continuing toll the8 recent economic recession has taken on the  average9 New Yorkers and the steady rent increases the  RGB10 has annually approved, the Senator is dismayed  that11 there are to be considering further rent  increases.12 While Wall Street has a  resurgence13 in corporate profits in an all time high at the   end14 of 2011 , New York' s working people who, along with15 those on fixed income, make up the majority of  rent16 regulated tenants, continue to struggle.17 Housing costs continue to be  a18 huge percentage of these tenants' income.	The19 RGB' s own 2012 income and affordability study found20 that one- third of renter households in the City,21 33 . 1 percent paid 50 percent or more in the22 household -- of their household income for  gross23 rent in 2011 .24 Under these circumstances, New25 York' s rent regulated tenants simply cannot afford2 
2 another increase.	In fact, passing additional3 financial burdens onto tenants, many of whom  are4 still reeling from prior rent increases, would  be5 unfair and an unnecessary hardship.6 It behooves the RGB to reject  rent7 increases that serve to only continue and  over8 enhance landlord profits and to  further9 de- stabilize New York City' s affordable housing10 stock.	As you' re all very much aware, New York11 continues to be in a housing crisis as  our12 affordable housing stock rapidly dwindles amidst13 the worst economic downturn since the 1930 s.14 There' s a minimum net loss of an15 estimated 6 , 096 units to the rent stabilized16 housing stock in 2011 .	Thirty- four percent more in17 2010 .	In fact, according to DHCR, rent18 registration records, 1 , 364 units were deregulated19 in 2011 under the high rent vacancy  deregulation20 provision.21 Between the years of 1994 and22 2011 , DHCR indicated that 121 , 659 units were23 deregulated due to high rent vacancy  decontrol.24 Seventy- four percent of these deregulations25 occurred in Manhattan.2 
2 Under the City- wide vacancy rate,3 has dropped to 3 . 2 percent, legally constituting a4 continued housing emergency.	Furthermore,5 loopholes in State law, including allowances  for6 phony demolitions and owner/ occupancy scams, have7 countless other units to be de- regulated without8 any records.9 Year after year, RGB' s own records10 do not support the landlord' s primary argument that11 rent increases are necessary to meet  increased12 operating costs. This year that argument  is13 particularly absurd as operating costs  have14 remained practically the same.15 Rent regulations have been16 stripped away and the landlords' profits have  been17 consistently rising in the last  ten years.	An18 audit and testament of the real numbers show  not19 only that owners can afford and will still  profit20 from rents remaining constant but, also, that  most21 rent regulated tenants cannot afford any  rent22 increases.23 I strongly urge the RGB to  impose24 a rent freeze for all rents as well as  lofts,25 hotels, rooming houses, single room occupancy2 
2 buildings and lodging houses.3 ( Applause.)4 MR. ATTERBURY:	Given the facts,5 a rent freeze is the only acceptable  outcome.6 Thank you for the opportunity  to7 testify.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.9 Mr. Schleider.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' ll let Ms.11 Adams go.12 MS. ADAMS:	Yes.	We -- your with13 which representative?14 MR. ATTERBURY:	Senator Tom Duane.15 MS. ADAMS:	Right.	What was his16 position last year when the legislation was up  for17 consideration by the State?18 MR. ATTERBURY:	You know, I don' t19 -- I know that he -- although he was pleased   that20 we made some gains on behalf of tenants and  was21 disappointed that we were not able to more  formally22 reform this current system.23 I believe he supported the --  the24 final compromise though.25 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.4 Are you a legislative aide?5 MR. ATTERBURY:	I am.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Will you --7 MR. ATTERBURY:	I can try to8 answer any questions you may have, although if  you9 want to have a detailed discussion  about10 legislation, I' m sure I can --11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.12 You mentioned the word profits a13 number of times in your prepared statement and  you14 even used the word, enhanced profits.	We don' t15 discuss profits here.	Now you were throwing a  lot16 of stats back at us that our staff  reports17 prepared.18 MR. ATTERBURY:	Um- hum.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I don' t believe20 anywhere in the staff reports the word profits  were21 -- were used.	So I' m curious as -- as to where22 that came in -- maybe as a legislative  aide.23 MR. ATTERBURY:	I believe it' s in24 reference to the net operating income.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, that' s2 

2	not -- 34	notes -- 56	wait.7
MR. ATTERBURY:	Which as RGBMR. SCHLEIDER:	-- wait, wait,MR. ATTERBURY:	-- it' s a
8 surrogate measure for profit.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yeah, well, it' s10 a surrogate but it' s not profit so.11 Anyway, now you also mentioned12 that, you know, Wall Street resurgence is  a13 solution to rent increases.	Could you explain the14 rationale for that?15 MR. ATTERBURY:	I don' t believe16 that it was meant -- that the Wall  Street17 resurgence was meant --18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, it was in19 the opening statement, you know, so.20 MR. ATTERBURY:	Certainly.	And21 as the high income earners, particularly,  in22 Manhattan, we have seen a resurgence and  a23 significant increase of the highest earners  earning24 every larger percentages of the income.	Both25 middle class and those with lower incomes have  not8 
2 seen quite the same rebound.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m -- I' m still4 -- I' m still --5 MR. ATTERBURY:	The top continues6 to move up and the bottom half continues  to7 struggle.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m still curious9 how you conflate Wall Street resurgence with  a10 solution to rent increases.11 Now just a curious point  --12 MR. ATTERBURY:	I -- I think it13 was merely meant to underscore --14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You don' t need to15 explain it now.16 MR. ATTERBURY:	-- how New York' s17 working people, those who do not have such  high18 incomes, continue to struggle even though  there19 are, by many measures, that are skewed by  increased20 profits at the upper end.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The increased22 profits are what?23 MR. ATTERBURY:	Are increased24 incomes at the upper end.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And how does that2 
2 conflate -- I' m still not sure I understand how3 Wall Street resurgence equals a solution to  rent4 increases.	I don' t understand --5 MR. ATTERBURY:	I don' t believe6 that that was the statement.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	Not8 believe it -- that' s just -- remember what you9 said.10 Thank you.11 MR. ATTERBURY:	If you' d like, I12 have submitted the written testimony.	It goes into13a significantandmore detail.14MR. SCHLEIDER:	We' ll review the15record.16Thank you.17MR.

2 MR. ANDREJCUK:	Okay.	I' m the3 manager of two properties, total of 60 units  in4 Manhattan in Washington Heights.5 Unfortunately, the rents I would6 say around 80 percent is below $ 1 , 000 so it' s very7 difficult to maintain and -- and  an operation.	I' m8 still paying oil bills from last year -- from  this9 year' s winter.	Thanks God it was very mild  winter10 and we have installed several units  controlling11 devices which telling us consumption of oil --  we12 try to minimize the use of oil to give, of   course,13 proper heat and proper temperature.14 And as you know -- everybody  knows15 that water sewage is tremendous increase.	Taxes --16 so therefore, I' m asking a few things this  Rent17 Guidelines Board to increase rent for a one- year18 lease six percent and for a two year- lease ten19 percent.	And on top of that, all rents  below20 $ 1 , 000 supplement $ 50 for one- year lease and $ 10021 for a two- year lease.22 And regardless of that, also, I' m23 suggesting to adding a one percent increase for  the24 buildings that the heating, like my building  and25 some other buildings, heating and giving water  with2

And, also, I' m asking to pass
4 through to the tenants all these costs  unfunded5 which is government mandated that landlords  have6 such a -- a heating conversion, especially the  oil,7 which has been very expensive from No. 6 to No.   28 -- 4 right now or No.  2 .	So it' s also a tremendous9 cost.10 Therefore, I' m asking you to in11 place these increases.12 Thank you.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.14 Questions?15 ( No response.)16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, sir.17 ( Applause.)18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Anne19 Cunningham.20 MS. CUNNINGHAM:	Good afternoon.21 Honorable Chair, New York City22 Rent Guidelines Board and all those present.	My23 name is Anne Cunningham.	I am the housing24 specialist for Councilmember Gale A. Brewer and  I25 have testified before this board for the past  334 

2	years.3
Today I' m testifying on behalf of
4 the Temporal Hotel tenants.	Gale will be here5 later.6 The testimony you have received7 right now contains the New York City Department  of8 Finance buildings, ECB elevator violations data  and9 a record of 189 complaints through 3 / 11 , including10 20 letters to you from statutory tenants who  reside11 at the Temporal Hotel, describing their  living12 conditions.13 I urge you to read every  letter14 before you vote.15 For the past eight years the16 Temporal operated an illegal hotel until  tourists17 vacated last month.	This 200 - unit building18 consists of 89 warehoused units, 75 hotel,  SRO19 units, 35 de- stabilized units and one exempt unit.20 In come the landlord, plans to21 change the Certificate of Occupancy from  the22 current Class A hotel to  residential.23 Unfortunately, with the recent legislation,24 provisions were not included to protect this  class25 of tenants, most of whom are either unemployed  or4 
2 under employed.	The hotel and SRO tenants are  the3 most neglected and abused tenants in the City  of4 New York.5 Such a political embarrassment,6 we don' t even know the statistics.	I strongly urge7 the Rent Guidelines Board to vote no increase  in8 this category.	Also the Temporal is eligible for9 the proviso while keeping in mind that  landlords10 are doing very well.	Since more apartments are11 de- regulated and market rents are higher than ever12 before.13 What I did not include in  the14 testimony, it was an oversight and I generally  say15 it, also, keep in mind the violations of  all16 apartments citywide.	This will tell you something.17 It will tell you that fines are not being paid  and18 violations are not -- and repairs are  not19 happening.20 Thank you, again, for the  pleasure21 of participation.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,23 Anne.24 ( Applause.)25 MS. HOLDER:	Anne.2 
 2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Holder.3 Anne.	Anne, there' s a question.4 MS. HOLDER:	Ms. Cunningham,5 thank you for your testimony.	I appreciate it.6 Just a quick question, I know  that7 you' ve been an advocate for many, many years and I8 know that you' re working with Councilwoman Brewer.9 Could you tell me or could  you10 explain to us what you' ve seen in terms of  the11 change and the type of assistance that people  have12 come to -- can you quantify or even distinguish  the13 types of services that people have been asking  you14 for?15 MS. CUNNINGHAM:	Okay.	What is16 happening, first of all, as far as the change --   in17 this one building and other buildings that I  have18 been working with, many of these units that  were19 operated by tourists and corporate people and  are20 no longer operated. They immediately are21 deregulated when that person leaves.22 SRO units in my building are going 23	for $ 1 , 800 , $ 1 , 825 , $ 2 , 200 a month.	That is24 happening.25 As far as services, what' s24 
2 happening with services I know in quite a  few3 buildings there are less services available.	For4 instance, the coin operated machines were taken  out5 of the Temporal and a lot of tenants don' t  have6 credit cards to use the new machines or  debit7 cards, to say the least.8 Garbage is no longer collected in9 this building because the Fire Department came  in10 when it was operated as a hotel and said that  it' s11 illegal to keep fire -- to keep garbage pails  by12 the elevators because there was so many,  many13 people in the building.	The building was so over14 crowded so the egress area had to be emptied so   now15 there' s no more garbage pickups.16 As far as service repairs, tenants17 were told that they must submit their repairs  by18 computer.	Most of us don' t have computers, things19 like that.	It' s not only happening in this20 building, it' s happening in other buildings too.21 But I -- I wanted to tell you  that22 the rents now are very high in these buildings  once23 the tourists leave and, also, there' s a lot of24 warehousing.25 I hope that answers your  question.2 
2 MS. HOLDER:	Have you seen an3 increase in complaints?4 MS. CUNNINGHAM:	Tenants really5 are afraid to -- to complain because as you can   see6 from the data I put here with 189 telephone  calls7 that we made to 311 , everything seems to be8 resolved.	Most unusual.	When the inspectors come,9 violations are resolved, including the elevator10 that doesn' t work which is very serious.11 Tenants are not doing the12 activism.	They did it once.	There are very few of13 them left.	A lot of them are afraid.	Many of the14 tenants that came with me throughout the years  to15 these meetings, are no longer around.	And that' s16 about what' s happening.17 We do have one harassment case  in18 this building.	There will be more, I believe.	The19 letter is -- in here about  it.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,21 Anne.22 MS. CUNNINGHAM:	You' re welcome.23 ( Applause.)24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Lars Westvind.25 MR. WESTVIND:	Hello.	My name is2 
2 Lars Westvind.	I live in Harlem on  Astor Road.	I3 was actually, a neighbor of Ms. Daniels for a   long4 time.5 I own five buildings there and  I,6 also, represent other senior citizens who  own7 similar buildings.	I personally have about 578 units, 25 of them are -- designated as SRO  units.9 My expenses have gone up10 tremendously in the last five years.	I' m certainly11 not compensated by any increases that were given  in12 the guidelines.13 The property taxes have gone up.14 My property taxes have gone up by  800 percent.	The15 water and sewer bills have gone up by 100  percent16 and fuel costs have, you know, probably, I  mean,17 have gone up tremendously as  well.18 So these increases you' re not able19 -- I' ve not been able to pass on only a fraction  of20 these increases to my tenants.	I do have good21 tenants and they are pretty happy tenants.	They22 consider me to be a good landlord and most of   them,23 practically all of them, are paying  preferential24 rents.25 Now I heard somebody talking  about2 
2 SRO units going for $ 1 , 000 or more than $ 1 , 000 .3 Well, my most expensive SRO unit is $ 785 .	Most of4 them are in the $ 500 range or $ 650 .	And I -- I5 understand that people cannot just -- I mean,  I6 would -- I cannot increase the rents by the  amount7 that my expenses have gone up.	It' s just not8 feasible.	And I can understand that.9 But I' m able to live with the10 increases that you' re giving for the rent11 stabilized units.	That' s fine.	But for the SRO12 units, you need to catch up there.	They' re -- they13 cost more to maintain.	I have to, you know,  you14 have, basically, you have bathrooms.	I have to15 have -- provide people that clean the  bathrooms,16 take care of things in a much more intensive  way17 than an apartment.18 And I -- I think it' s just -- it' s19 just not fair that you would give less of  an20 increase to an SRO unit than a rent  stabilized21 unit.22 And, I also have to say that  the23 reasons -- I heard somebody say, well, SRO  owners24 don' t come here and -- and talk to you.	The reason25 is that the rules are so difficult to comply  with.2 
2 There are so many rules about SROs that they  just3 -- most people ignore them.	They do whatever they4 have to in order to  survive.5 I would -- you know, I mean,  I6 would like to work within the guidelines but,  I7 think, the guidelines have to be  reasonable.8 And that' s all I have to say.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.10 Thank you, Mr. Westvind.11 Let me ask you a question just  to12 go over what you said at  the beginning.	You have13 five buildings --14 MR. WESTVIND:	Yes.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	-- and a total16 of 57 units?17 MR. WESTVIND:	Yes.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Twenty- five of19 which are SRO units?20 MR. WESTVIND:	Yes.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	How many of22 those buildings are SRO buildings?23 MR. WESTVIND:	Well, it' s -- it' s24 -- the buildings, you know, they were converted  to25 SROs but then the, you know, the owner was --   had2 
2 an apartment and then another apartment in  the3 building.	So they' re a mixture.4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	So without --5 MR. WESTVIND:	It' s a mix.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	So without our7 proviso, you wouldn' t have the --8 MR. WESTVIND:	They' re smaller9 buildings, you know, brownstones.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	-- you wouldn' t11 meet the 85 --12 MR. WESTVIND:	Pardon?13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Would you meet14 the 85 or 90 percent that we' ve had in the  provisos15 for the increases that we put  in?16 MR. WESTVIND:	I' m sorry, what do17 you mean by that?18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	We have had19 provisions in the past of increases for SROs  --20 MR. WESTVIND:	Yes.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	-- if there were22 80 -- ranging from prior years, 80 , 85 , 90 percent23 of those SRO units being stabilized in  the24 building.25 MR. WESTVIND:	Maybe I don' t2 
 2 understand how it works.	But what exactly do you3 mean by that?4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Well, how many5 -- how many SRO units are in your -- in a   building6 that are stabilized?	Pick a building.7 MR. WESTVIND:	Well, I don' t know8 who -- how many are stabilized.	What do -- I  mean,9 I have to register the rents with DHCR every  year.10 Right.	So the apartments, the ones that have  the11 bathrooms, I -- those are rent stabilized;  right?12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Are you registered 13	--14 MR. WESTVIND:	I mean, maybe I15 don' t understand the rules either or what the16 designations are.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You register the18 rents for each unit every year with  DHCR.19 MR. WESTVIND:	Yes.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	And in --21 okay.	So then they' re all registered.22 MS. ADAMS:	Do you know how many23 of the SROs are rent stabilized?24 MR. WESTVIND:	No, I don' t. Are25 SROs rent stabilized and what does that mean if  an14 
2 SRO is rent stabilized?3 MS. ADAMS:	That it is granted an4 increase or not every year by this  board.5 MR. WESTVIND:	I' m sorry.6 MS. ADAMS:	That it is granted an7 increase or not by this board every  year.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	If he' s9 registering at DHCR, he' s stabilized.10 MR. WESTVIND:	And who determines11 that?12 MS. ADAMS:	This board.13 MR. WESTVIND:	This board14 determines whether it' s rent stabilized or not?15 MS. SCHLEIDER:	No, no.16 MS. ADAMS:	No, no, no.17 If there is to be an increase,  --18 MR. WESTVIND:	No, but you' re19 asking me if my SRO units are rent stabilized  and20 I' m saying, I don' t know. I know I' m have to -- I' m21 registering.	They were not registered when I22 bought the buildings but when I bought  the23 buildings, I registered the rents and maybe I don' t24 even have to comply with the  SRO rules.	I don' t25 know.2 

23	you have -- 45	been.6
MR. SCHLEIDER:	Sir, the tenantsMR. WESTVIND:	Although I haveMR. SCHLEIDER:	-- all right.	The
7 tenants you have, they' re permanent tenants or --8 or you operate this as  a hotel?	They' re permanent9 tenants?10 MR. WESTVIND:	No, I have -- I11 have no hotel.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	So they' re13 permanent tenants and you register each  apartment14 each year.15 MR. WESTVIND:	Yes.16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So they' re all17 stabilized.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Then they' d all19 be stabilized.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So I don' t see21 what the confusion is.22 MR. WESTVIND:	So I --23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	They' re all24 stabilized.25 MR. WESTVIND:	Is there somebody7 
2 that I can turn to that can explain this to me   what3 I' m allowed to do and not allowed to do?4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You seem to be5 doing everything correctly, I guess.6 MR. CHEIGH:	Can I ask a  more7 basic question?8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes.	Brian.9 MR. CHEIGH:	When did you -- when10 did you purchase your properties?11 MR. WESTVIND:	Well, the first12 property I -- the house that I live in, that   I13 purchased in 1987 .	The first rental property I14 purchased in 1994 .15 MR. CHEIGH:	And what' s the most16 recent property that you purchased?17 MR. WESTVIND:	The most recent18 property -- well, I haven' t bought any recently.	I19soldsome--20MR. CHEIGH:I' m sorry, so you21said--22MR. WESTVIND:The most recent23propertythatI purchased?24MR. CHEIGH:Yeah, because you25saidyouhad five buildings.
2 MR. WESTVIND:	Yes, okay.	The3 most recent one, I think, it was in -- 2000 and   --4 2006 , around that time.5 MR. CHEIGH:	And it is a -- was  it6 a -- was it in the same vicinity of where you   --7 MR. WESTVIND:	Yes, they' re all8 in the same area.	They' re within a few blocks of9 each other.10 MR. CHEIGH:	Okay.	So these are11 all similar buildings to what you -- what you  live12 in?13 MR. WESTVIND:	Yes.	And, you14 know, I maintain them and manage them  myself.15 MR. CHEIGH:	And you collect the16 rents and --17 MR. WESTVIND:	Yes.18 MR. CHEIGH:	-- you renew the19 leases?20 MR. WESTVIND:	Yes.	I do21 everything myself.22 MR. CHEIGH:	And you said you23 sold property.	Was it in the same vicinity  as24 well?25 MR. WESTVIND:	Yes, it was.	It2 
2 was, actually, an empty building.3 MR. CHEIGH:	So these were SRO4 buildings that you just sold?5 MR. WESTVIND:	No, I have not sold6 any SRO buildings.7 MR. CHEIGH:	But you' ve purchased8 SRO buildings?9 MR. WESTVIND:	Well, I guess, I10 purchased a building -- yes, I purchased 19  West11 129 th Street is an SRO building.	I purchased that12 building in 1996 .13 MR. CHEIGH:	And do you take the14 increases that are presented by this  board?15 MR. WESTVIND:	Yes.16 MR. CHEIGH:	And do you comply17 with the provisos requiring that a  specific18 percentage of units have to be rent stabilized  for19 you to apply the increases?20 MR. WESTVIND:	I -- now that --21 now there I don' t understand exactly.	You have to22 be clearer on that one.23 For example, last year, you gave  a24 three percent increase on SROs.	But increase the25 SRO units -- now, even some of the SRO units I   give2 
2 a preferential rent as well.	But the lowest cost3 ones I increased by three  percent.4 But they are, I mean, I file  every5 year with DHCR so maybe I -- maybe it -- maybe  I' m6 not doing it right.	I' m not sure who to turn to,7 to be honest with you.8 I' m trying to do the right thing.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	It sounds like10 it.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You say since13 you' re maintaining SRO units in -- in the14 neighborhood --15 MR. WESTVIND:	Yeah.16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- and you have17 for quite some time. It sounds like you' re doing a18 wonderful job.19 MR. WESTVIND:	Okay.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Your tenants21 should be very happy.22 MR. WESTVIND:	Well, most of them23 are, practically all of them  are.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25 MR. WESTVIND:	Thank you.2 
2 ( Applause.)3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	The next4 speaker will be Roberta Arnone.5 Most likely after this speaker,6 around 12 : 30 , we' re going to take about a 20 minute7 break for the stenographer.	So it' s just --8 letting you all know.9 Thank you.10 MS. ARNONE:	Hello.	Good11 afternoon.12 I' m here as a tenant of an SRO13 hotel, coincidentally.	And setting aside the14 previous land owner who, obviously, needs  to15 consult with an attorney, I' m here to tell you  to16 please not raise the rents on hotel  residents.17 Hotel tenants have been18 constructively evicted from quiet enjoyment of19 their homes due to illegal hotel operations.	Loud20 noises on weeknights, bed bugs, prostitutes,  being21 kicked out of elevators and tenant laundry  rooms.22 Property managers put tenants last23 while accommodating the every whim of hotel  guests24 who offer cash tips.25 Many today will beg for pity  in2 
2 this troubled economy but I argue that a  capitalist3 society would punish the hotel owner who will,  in4 turn, clean house, fire the property managers  and5 hotel staff.	Hire college graduates who will make6 residents' interests a priority.7 One last remark is that my8 contention is that had the hotel staff and  property9 managers treated the residents, the permanent10 residents, properly, we wouldn' t have had the11 uproar and the removal of these quote  unquote,12 " illegal hotel units."	We would have all been13 able to work well together and the land  owners14 would have profited immensely.15 So that' s my contention to you16 all.	So, I think, that honestly in every   economy17 in every business, you fire -- you clean house  and18 you re- hire people who are more efficient and work19 better for less wage. There are a lot of  unemployed20 college graduates who would adore to have a  work21 opportunity in New York City.22 Those are my remarks.23 Thank you.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25 ( Applause.)2

We will3 stand adjourned for 20 minutes.4 We' re up on owners No. 25 , on5 tenants No. 12 will be  next.6 When we come back, the next  few7 speakers will be as follows:8 Abraham Mussafi, Faith Steinberg9 and then Tom Laskaris.10	( Recess 12 : 24 - 1 : 02 p. m)11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	We' ll go12 back into session.13 Our next speaker, Abraham Mussafi.14 Again, I' m going to remind you, if15 there' s anyone in the room who wishes to speak  and16 has not signed in in the back, please  do.17 I' m also going to, please, remind18 all speakers to try and keep your remarks to  the19 three minutes allotted time.20 Mr. Mussafi, take it away.21 We need the mike on?22 Okay.23 MR. MUSSAFI:	Hello.	Hello.	I24 lost ten seconds.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Don' t worry.11 
2 I' ll give it to you on the end.3 MR. MUSSAFI:	Okay.	Thank you.4 Okay.	I' m a small landlord and I5 don' t have to tell you like all the others,  the6 expenses is going up and we have really  more7 problem besides all the other expenses went up,  the8 taxes is really creeping behind the  mortgages.9 It' s almost going to be equal as the mortgage  is.10 We facing other problems too  which11 is really high occupancy in apartments.	It' s one12 bedroom -- there is three -- used to have  one13 person renting it, now there is three people  living14 in there. And I have a studio which has four   people15 living in there -- one room.	It' s just really too16 small studio, four people living in the  room.17 And beside that, I have two  rent18 controlled, two old ladies that one pay $ 130 and19 one pay $ 155 . I have no problem with them.	The20 only problem we have, they' re creating a lot of21 problems.	They put their laundry in the vanity  and22 they flood the water, one lady.23 The second lady, no problem.	The24 people that they come and they live in  the25 apartment, the assisted living with her, they  talk2 
2 on the phone 24 hours a day. They bring friends   to3 sleep over and they' re supposed to watch that lady.4 They leave the water running on the tap, the  water5 overflowing and flooding the whole thing.	One time6 it happened at 12 : 00 at night and one time it7 happened at 11 : 30 at night.	And the damage is8 causing by thousands of dollars.	It went down to9 the people below and pretty ruined his  computers10 and I hand them the bill and nothing is  happening.11 So I don' t understand.	There is a12 lot of stuff that you guys don' t see that  nobody13 even mentioned that before.	So, I think, that it' s14 definitely they have to really create really  more15 increase.16 I do sympathize really with  the17 tenants but the tenants should not be carried  on18 the back of the landlord.	Like if you go to  a19 supermarket because if you make -- you have  low20 income, you' re not going to get half a price  or21 you' re not going to get, you know, the big22 discount.23 The government collect money and24 support, has to support the needy, not  the25 landlord.	Because it' s a free enterprises. And2 
2 also, the insurance is going up  like crazy.	My3 life insurance be last year $ 7 , 000 .	This year is4 $ 10 , 000 .	Every day things keep going up,  water5 bills and everything else and, also, you have  high6 occupancy living in the building.7 And my building I feel like now  is8 like a hotel.	I rent to one person, before I  know9 there is three, four people living in  the10 apartment.	So how do we do it with  that?11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You have the12 extra ten seconds if you want.13 MR. MUSSAFI:	I' m done.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.15 MS. CRUZ:	One question -- just16 one --17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz.18 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.19 Of all of the expenses that you' ve20 encountered in the past year, which has been  the21 most onerous for you?22 MR. MUSSAFI:	The most what?23 MS. CRUZ:	The most difficult24 expense for you to cover.25 MR. MUSSAFI:	The -- really the2 

2	real estate taxes.3
And by the way, I' m an air
4 conditioning mechanic by profession and I do do  505 percent of the repair I do  it myself.	If I have to6 get outside people or get management to manage  my7 building, I definitely going to be way -- by   close8 to the rent.9 MS. CRUZ:	So you don' t10 participate in any program where you get a  tax11 abatement of any type?12 MR. MUSSAFI:	No, no.	I don' t do13 anything like this.	I do -- I just start it  myself14 and get the things done  by myself.	And I' m just15 workaholic, I work almost like 26 - hour day, like16 eight days a week they call it from the  song.17 That' s how I work.18 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.19 MR. MUSSAFI:	And my -- all my20 tenants they can vouch for me.	And, I think, one21 of the few landlords the tenant pull a red  carpet22 when I come to the building because I   treat23 everybody as I treat like my -- my parents or   my24 whatever, my relative.	I do everything right for25 them but it' s very hard.	It' s harder to own a4 
2 building in the City.3 MS. CRUZ:	Can you estimate of how4 high your -- what increase your real estate  taxes5 went up this past year,  roughly?6 MR. MUSSAFI:	I don' t -- I mean I7 didn' t see that but one building is pay $ 60 , 000 and8 the other building is paid $ 44 , 000 .	And it look9 like -- like it' s almost 35 percent from the  gross10 income.11 MS. CRUZ:	Um- hum.12 MR. MUSSAFI:	I think that' s a lot13 of money.14 My electric, gas and electric, I15 have gas not oil, it -- that building it' s  really16 actually was $ 20 , 000 .	I couldn' t believe it17 between gas and electric.18 We hardly use electric mainly it' s19 the hallway and the boiler but the fuel is  very20 unbelievable.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.22 MR.

2 MS. STEINBERG:	Good morning.3 Oh, it' s good afternoon.	I' m sorry.4 It' s obvious to me that there' s a5 war on the poor.	It' s obvious from the objections6 to a raise in the minimum wage from $ 7 . 25 to $ 8 . 507 an hour.	This sounds like a joke but it' s not8 funny and bears out what I' ve been saying for9 years.10 The business world wants to  pay11 their workers as little as possible and the  real12 estate industry wants to charge tenants as much  as13 possible, squeezing the poor from all  sides.14 Further, let' s humiliate them,15 fingerprinting - our Mayor' s brainstorm,16 fingerprinting the recipients of Food Stamps.	Now17 fingerprinting is an expensive process, far  more18 costly than any fraud which may occur in the  Food19 Stamp program.	I would say this is  unconscionable20 but I heard a Tea Party type using this  word21 referring to the wages -- referring to the raise  in22 wages, co- opting the word.23 So I will use some other  word,24 reprehensible, unscrupulous, unprincipled and25 inhumane to describe these parasites who feed  on2

In my reading I came across  this
4 sentence, meanness and poverty of spirit are  the5 attributes of smaller people whose inner lives  are6 stunted.	Try showing some humanity.	It can even7 feel good.	Let' s be fair which is another word the8 vultures have co- opted.9 Fair market rent.	Fair to whom?10 Freeze rents.	Zero increases and my mantra,11 housing is a basic necessity of  life.12 Thank you.13 ( Applause.)14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.15 Tom Laskaris.16 Who will be followed by  Josephine17 -- I' m sorry, Penelope Josephides;18 Who will be followed by  Martin19 Hanan.20 MR. LASKARIS:	Good afternoon.21 It' s my first time testifying in22 front of the Rent Guidelines Board.23 I would like to thank the  Rent24 Guidelines Board for this brief but  important25 opportunity to speak on this critical  day.4 
2 I' m going to stick to the script.3 My name is Thomas Laskaris. I  have4 two eight- unit apartment buildings on 104 th Street5 on the East Side. I have owned them  for6 approximately nine years.	They are very similar in7 size and layout. The square footage is  identical.8 They each have two eight one- bedroom units.9 However, there is one difference.	One is fair10 market and one is rent  stabilized.11 Prior to that I was  a tenant.	I' m12 a native New Yorker and I shared a   tenement13 one- bedroom apartment with six other people14 spanning three generations.	Our rent was $ 4815 monthly.	So if anybody should complain about16 higher rents, it is me.17 The fact that my landlord, at  one18 point in my life, kept raising my rent  annually19 compelled me to purchase my  own home.	Read my20 lips.	And this time I' m telling the truth.	I do21 not like to raise rents.	Unfortunately, my22 partners, the New York City Water Board,  the23 Department of Finance, the ECB, my oil supplier,  my24 insurance company, my bank are all knocking on  my25 door.2 
2 Being a landlord theoretically3 should be easy.	You want to collect your  rent,4 provide people with a clean, safe environment,  pay5 your bills and at the end of the month you want   to6 do it all over again.7 I can tell you my fair  market8 makes a little profit.	It has substantially rent9 -- it has been substantially renovated to the  point10 one would not recognize it and 50 percent of  my11 tenants are there since my  purchase.12 My rent stabilized is, however,13 another story.	Any improvements, and there have14 been many, a new boiler, a new roof, a new   bathroom15 in all of the apartments and a total upgrade of   an16 antiquated and unsafe electrical system have  been17 met by suspicions of my final  motive.18 Indicative of this is the  response19 I received from numerous tenants after I  finally20 got my MCI increase due to the electrical  upgrade21 when they realized their rents were,  actually,22 going to go up beyond their normal limits due  to23 the improvements.24 Approximately 40 percent of my25 rent roll comes from a community facility on  the2 
2 first floor of this building.	Honestly, I do not3 know how I would have survived if it was not   for4 the supplemental rent.	One would imagine that5 there would be a great disparity in my rent  rolls,6 with free market, of course, being the  more7 lucrative.	Ironically, they are almost the  same.8 Market conditions determine my9 rent for the fair market and I cannot charge what   I10 am legally entitled to in most of the  rent11 stabilized units due to the  neighborhood.12 Therefore, several tenants are getting preferential13 rents.14 I know, as we all know, there  are15 abusive landlords, which is why we are here  today.16 With all due respect, do not put myself and  others17 in my situation.	We need legitimate rent increases18 to conduct our affairs in a context conducive  to19 the tenant and the owners.20 Thank you.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.22 ( Applause.)23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Penelope24 Josephides.25 MS.

2	afternoon.3
I was attending the last  meeting
4 -- I' m sorry, I don' t see Magda Cruz, but I' m happy5 to see Adriene Holder.	Welcome.	We missed you.6 My issue is really for many,  many,7 many poor tenants, many, many, many that have  been8 in the middle class and are going lower and  lower9 and poorer.10 I heard an awful statistic  today11 about the wealthy getting welfare so I really don' t12 have a lot of empathy about  the landlords.	I don' t13 want to misquote this but it was something  like14 this, " An average CEO makes 380 times more than  the15 average worker."16 I' m trying to manage my life.	I' m17 on disability.	I suffered great -- major18 depression and anxiety.	Even standing here I can19 feel that I' m getting anxious.	However, it' s doing20 the right thing. It' s not the fun thing.	It' s not21 a relaxing thing for me to be here but there   are22 many, many, many tenants that are  suffering.23 There are many landlords that  are24 unhappy because they' re not making as many profits25 as they would like.	Maybe they have renovated a4 
2 building and when they did renovate that  building,3 you know what' s very unfortunate, the people that4 were there are not there any more.	They may be5 shuffled off to shelters or wherever -- or  the6 street.7 So you' re making it a bigger8 problem if you' re going to raise the rents because9 we' re -- we will not have any place to go.	So if10 you see us on the street, you know what  happened.11 Now, also, one other point. I' m a12 little bit dismayed at the attendance.	The last13 meeting there were ten -- actually, nine on  the14 board.	And approximately 20 attendees.	I found15 out how obscure it is to find out about  your16 meetings.	I called 311 .	I went through all the17 channels.	I had an operator who really didn' t18 supply efficient information and I had to drill  to19 find out how to pre- register, how short a time  to20 pre- register.21 Also, I went to the Internet  at22 the library.	I can' t afford Internet at home.	I' m23 really living like a little  mouse.24 I could endure all of this if  I25 felt safe in my home, I felt that my   neighborhood2 
 2 had some sort of quality of life.	I' m enduring the3 Second Avenue subway.	It' s a farce.4 I could also quote from Cat on  a5 Hot Tin Roof, " the smell of mendacity is very6 strong."	There' s a lot of dishonesty.7 All right, two seconds, three8 seconds.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yeah.	Please10 -- just wrap up.11 MS. JOSEPHIDES:	Wrapping it up.12 Do preserve median lower rents.13 Start building apartments, decent apartments for14 middle income and lower income.15 Thank you.16 ( Applause.)17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.18 Ms. Josephides, for future19 reference, the phone number of the Rent  Guidelines20 Board office, if you' d like to take it down is 21	212 --22 MS. JOSEPHIDES:	I' m not prepared23 with a pen so when I get  --24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Or any --25 anybody at the desk back there can give it to   you.22 
2 You can always call us directly to find out  when3 there are hearings, when the schedule is  out.4 MS. JOSEPHIDES:	I think it should5 also be publicized --6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	We do.7 MS. JOSEPHIDES:	-- it doesn' t8 mean that I have to go to the  mountain.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Again, it' s on10 our website.11 MS. JOSEPHIDES:	Or the mountain12 has to come to me.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	We do publish14 it.	We do publish it.	We give public notice  out15 in the newspapers.	It is -- it is done.	We follow16 the requirements of the law for public  notice.17 MS. JOSEPHIDES:	I' m very happy18 that you do.	Apparently, a lot of people are  not19 here.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	But you always21 can pick up the phone and call our  office.22 MS. JOSEPHIDES:	And I' m sure that23 a lot of people that have issues that would like   to24 be here that I talked to and they didn' t even  know.25 So it would be better if it  was2 
2 publicized because the omission of  tenant3 representation is really going to be a  damaging4 one.	We really need a fuller  representation.5 Thank you very kindly.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.7 Martin Hanan.8 MR. HANAN:	Good afternoon.9 I' m an owner of one multi- family10 property in Queens for the past  11 years.	I still11 have a few tenants from when I first bought  the12 building and I am on very good relations with  most13 of my tenants.14 Every year my costs increase  a15 lot.	I work hard to keep on top of things and    not16 allow the property to fall apart.	This year my --17 the water bills went up seven percent, taxes  went18 up and supplies for my building alone went up  3019 percent this year.20 We had a hurricane and my  building21 is three houses away from the ocean.	One apartment22 needed so much work on the walls, I had to   tear23 down and re- sheet rock everything.24 It' s very hard to make ends meet25 with all my bills going up.	I think an increase of2 
2 six percent for one year would be a fair  amount.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And what about4 for a two year?5 MR. HANAN:	I guess, ten percent.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.7 ( Applause.)8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Allison Tupper.9 Is Allison Tupper in the  room?10 Thank you.11 Who will be followed by Angela,  is12 it -- forgive me if I mispronounce --  Ljikovich.13 Who will be followed by  John14 Barnes.15 MS. TUPPER:	Good afternoon.16 I' m Allison Tupper.	I live in the17 West 40 ' s in a rent stabilized apartment.	Last18 January my Social Security went up about $ 50 and  my19 rent went up about $ 200 .20 If this keeps on and this is  --21 this is typical of many rent stabilized  tenants,22 especially us retired folks on fixed incomes of  --23 of the -- the Social Security goes up according  to24 -- according to -- what do you  call it?	Inflation.25 But, you know, rents have been2 
2 going up three, four, five times inflation.	It3 can' t go on or we will have no middle class in  the4 City.	I' ve heard lots of stories, not just this5 morning, lots of stories about landlords  having6 trouble.	Every time I hear the second or  third7 detail of the story, it seems to clear to me   that8 that person is in the wrong  business.9 That when -- if rents don' t --10 don' t meet the mortgage, maybe it was not a  good11 mortgage to -- not a good deal to  make.12 Thank you for your attention.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.14 ( Applause.)15 MR.

CHEIGH:	Hi, Ms. Tupper.21 Right here.22 Thank you.23 I just wanted to ask quickly,  you24 said your rent was increased by $ 200 ?25 MS. TUPPER:	Almost.2 
2 MR. CHEIGH:	And it doesn' t seem3 like it' s way -- it' s way beyond our stabilization4 increases.	Was there a reason for such a  high5 increase?6 MS. TUPPER:	I was eight percent7 of something that was close to $ 200 -- close to  8	$ 2 , 000 -- it was almost $ 200 .9	MR. CHEIGH:	So there was an eight10 percent increase?11 MS.

LJIKOVICH:	Hello.22I represent the July family,23who' vebeenproperty owners since 1974 .24A VOICE:	Speak louder.25MS. LJIKOVICH:	We' ve been
2 property owners since 1974 and in that time we' ve3 seen some up and downs with the City and prices   and4 everything all around.	Doing some research and5 trying to figure out what it is exactly that we' re6 asking for, why we' re asking for and after some7 research this is what I came up  with.8 This year is the fourth9 consecutive year taxes have rose and the  highest10 since 2008 . On average they will rise11 seven- and- a- half percent compared to12 three- and- a- half percent from last year.	Yet tax13 abatement and tax exemptions are down.14 With someone having a tax --  an15 average tax of 50 to $ 60 , 000 a year, another16 seven- and- a- half percent on top of that could be17 very high.18 With fuel costs, even though this19 year we had a very mild winter, fuel  costs20 increased 20 percent in the last year,  especially21 due to high prices in No. 2 and No. 6 fuel and   by22 2030 , we will have to no longer use No. 6  fuel.23 Especially with No. 2 and No. 6 fuel this  year,24 they were well over 20 percent up and towards  2325 percent.2 
2 Water increased this year but only3 seven- and- a- half percent.	Now it' s about $ 8 . 21 per4 100 cubic feet which ten years ago it was $ 3 . 50 .5 Insurance rose the first time  this6 year since 2008 at around two- and- a- half percent.7 Parts and supplies for materials8 to repair your apartments were up 3 . 7 percent.9 Administration costs, including10 legal fees, administration fees, management fees,11 certification fees, registration fees, are up 2 . 612 percent.13 And this is not the end.	A total14 average projected next year all around the  board15 will increase another seven percent.	With all16 these increases -- yet last year it was  estimated17 $ 17 billion the City received from property owners.18 That' s roughly around 30 percent of the annual19 revenue property owners contributed towards the20 City.21 With these surprising increases22 the property owners cannot alone take this  burden.23 Some of these increases are not including  mortgages24 and repairs and trying to convert to keep up  with25 City and State guidelines and trying to  make2 
2 greener buildings in general.	To convert to gas3 energy is a very expensive cost.	Some people don' t4 even want to attempt it.	Some property owners are5 saying they spend well over $ 1 , 000 a year for water6 costs per unit.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Please wrap up.8 MS. LJIKOVICH:	All right.	Rent9 -- I just want to bring out this rent -- rent   in10 the turn of the century, around 1999 would  average11 around $ 706 .	Now it' s a median after 13 years of12 roughly $ 1 , 050 .13 That' s all I have to say.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.15 Mr. Schleider.16 A question for you.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	About how many18 properties, how many buildings does -- does  your19 company control or manage?20 MS. LJIKOVICH:	Two.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Two.	And the22 number of units?23 MS. LJIKOVICH:	Twenty- five in one24 and about 20 in the  second.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.2

10 I' d just like to say before I start what I  wrote11 here is that I feel kind of guilty coming up   here12 voicing my lavish fixed income problems on  these13 poor landlords in their 40 and 50 buildings and  I14 might have to sell one of my franchises. I   mean,15 how do you people sleep?	Boy.16 I -- just a little thing I  wrote17 here, I just call it points of greed and points   of18 vampirism.	I mean, my problems, thank God,  are19 pretty intact in regards to my poverty  position20 because of SRO and SCRIE -- in my ' 80 s so my rent21 is held at a certain  thing.22 But I' m still living in fear23 because my landlord' s always cooking up something24 because they really don' t want to just raise they25 rent, they want me out so they can renovate and  get10 
2 that justification money.3 ( Applause.)4 MR. BARNES:	You know, so -- and5 I' ve been there for 41 years and I' ve been an6 unpaid security guard for the place.	They have7 money hungry renting habits.	They rent to anybody8 who walk up there with a week' s rent -  drug9 addicts, whatever, and I kept the place  from10 becoming a crack den.11 But then when things get money12 hungry, he sticks his head up, the  justification,13 oh, John, you can go to the men' s shelter,  you14 know, you don' t need more because we -- we  could15 get more for the rent if you weren' t in the  room16 and this, that and the  other.17 And I' m, you know, I feel like18 speaking on the behalf of others, as well  as19 myself, but like I said, I' m a little  protected20 because of SCRIE.	But I just think landlords21 should realize, you know, I mean it' s like22 landlords and lawyers are first cousins  or23 something.	It' s just that the lawyers got a little24 more scruples.25 Thank you.2

8 name is Adrian Gerstel.9 I own a six- story -- six- family10 building in Park Slope. I bought it in 1980 ,  about11 33 years ago.	I have lived in the Slope since  197312 when it was red line. And I really do feel   that13 myself and a lot of the people that I lived with   at14 that time, made the Slope what it is  today.15 We put in a lot  of work.	It was,16 as New York City was at that time, it was a   very17 dangerous area.	And we took over buildings that18 had a lot of problems and did what we could   with19 them.20 Okay.	So I have six units.	I --21 it' s a historic district block which has its own22 concerns that people don' t realize.	You are23 financially and you have financial and  restraints24 on what you can do.	It goes above and beyond what25 a regular homeowner can do as far as the  buildings,8 
2 the windows, the exterior, the interior.	It has to3 go through a review process.	Everything is looked4 over by Landmarks and it can be -- to me it' s  not5 an added plus because there are very, very  heavy6 financial impact on that.7 Okay.	So I have three tenants.8 Two of the tenants are a couple and they live   in9 about 300 square feet.	They both work.	One is an10 artist, one is a playwright.	So they work at home.11 This space is maxed out.12 Let me get -- cut very,  very13 quickly because my time is  running out.	My concern14 is about the taxes.	As it is now, we are  paying15 out $ 16 , 000 a year to make the building work,16 compensating for the rents that we get, one --  two17 tenants have been for there for  24 years.	The rent18 is very low.	Another tenant has been there for  1719 years.	Their rent is very low.20 We have had major problems, water21 problems.	The building is 132 years old.	People22 don' t realize what you factor into the leaks, the23 -- I have a tree, unfortunately, a street  tree24 outside that clogged up the roots so I had  raw25 sewage explode in the basement where I had to get   a2 
2 Hazmat cleaning crew to come in and  disinfect.3 Water -- major leaks in  the4 basement where I was up at like 2 : 00 in the morning5 vacuuming and bailing out the basement.	This is6 not what tenants see.	They don' t realize the work7 that goes in to owning a  building.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.9 Let me ask you a question,  how10 long have you owned this building?11 MS. GERSTEL:	I' ve owned it for12 33 years.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	When you14 purchased the building, was it a historic  district15 at that point?16 MS. GERSTEL:	No.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	So that was kind18 of dropped in on you?19 MS. GERSTEL:	Yes.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I see.21 Thank you.22 MS.

2 MS. WETT:	Can you hear me?3 My name is Jessica Wett and I' m4 testifying on behalf of Congressman Gerald  Nadler.5 Thank you for the opportunity  to6 speak at this public hearing before the  Rent7 Guidelines Board.8 I am here today representing  my9 constituents in the 8 th Congressional District10 which includes parts of Manhattan and  Brooklyn.11 On May 1 st, this board proposed12 increases for rent stabilized apartments of 1 . 7513 percent to 4 percent for one- year leases and 3 . 514 percent to 6 . 75 percent for two- year leases.15 I urge you not to enact  the16 proposed increases which will unnecessarily worsen17 the economic burden faced by many low or  moderate18 income tenants citywide.19 This year, as in other  years,20 rising costs of building maintenance and  operations21 is an argument in favor of  higher rents.	However,22 the disparities between projected and  actual23 expenses in recent years is significant.	Since at24 least 2008 , the price index of operating cost25 projections, which are used by the RGB to  estimate2 
2 the cost of building operations for the  upcoming3 year, have far outstripped the actual  amount4 landlords reported spending on their buildings.5 For example, the projected6 increase in operation costs for 2011 was 7 . 47 percent but data shows the landlords'  operating8 costs only rose 2 . 8 percent.9 In addition to the owners'  costs,10 the board must also consider relevant data from  the11 current and projected costs of living indices  in12 determining increases.	While the City' s economy13 has exhibited some signs of recovery, it is  clear14 that we are still in the midst of a   debilitating15 recession and tenants are still feeling  the16 effects.17 The poor economic conditions in18 recent years, including rising costs of rents  and19 increasing rent burdens, inflation and high20 citywide unemployment rents, have left the  low21 income renters in a substantially worse  position22 than before the economic downturn.23 As one indicator of these24 difficult economic times, the data from the  Housing25 and Vacancy Survey indicates that from 2005 to  20112 
2 rents have risen at a significantly faster  rate3 than household incomes.4 New York City is currently5 experiencing the highest rent burdens ever  recorded6 in the history of rent stabilization and  despite7 the rising rents, rent regulated  apartments8 continue to be the primary source for  affordable9 housing for low or moderate income  families.10 As a result, this housing stock  is11 of particular importance in light of this period  of12 recovery from a global recession and  financial13 crisis.	The proposed increases would not  only14 place an undue burden on tenants but, also,  present15 a threat to the stock of rent regulated housing  in16 the City.17 High yearly rent increases have18 contributed to the annual decrease in the number  of19 rent stabilized apartments.	In 2011 , the City20 experienced a net loss of over 6 , 000 units of rent21 regulated apartments due primarily to high  rent,22 vacancy, deregulation.	Of the total losses in  the23 stock of rent stabilized units in 2011 , 55 percent24 were located in Manhattan and 20 percent  in25 Brooklyn.2 
2 We simply cannot afford to  have3 thousands of units disappear each  year.4 On behalf of my constituents  in5 the 8 th Congressional District and rent regulated6 tenants across the City, I urge the RGB  to7 reconsider the proposed increases and exercise8 restraint during this period of economic  recovery.9 Thank you.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.11 ( Applause.)12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Loren Renz.13 Who will be followed by  Edward14 Maloney.15 MS. RENZ:	Good afternoon.	My16 name is Loren Renz.17 This year my nine- unit brownstone18 on West 80 th Street in Manhattan turns 120 .	I' ve19 owned, lived in and improved it for 33 of  those20 years.	I know what it takes to keep a small  old21 landmark property healthy.22 What' s not healthy is the growing23 disparity between very low rents of long- term24 tenants and operating expenses, especially in  high25 cost areas like mine.2 
2 This gap has widened since the3 economic downturn as the City has  relentlessly4 raised assessments, tax rates and water and  sewer5 rates on multi- family houses, while adding costly6 regulations.7 As operating costs escalate, low8 rent apartments pay a shrinking portion of  the9 bills.	Owners and unregulated tenants pay the10 difference.	These inequities must be addressed11 when you set increases.12 Consider the facts about my  house.13 Half of the eight rental apartments are  stabilized,14 including three that have been steadily occupied15 for more than 35 years.	The rents range from $ 75816 to $ 789 or less than half of market rents.17 These tenants are comfortable18 working couples with cars and weekend retreats.	It19 is unacceptable that they have this subsidy  just20 because they stay put.	Minimum flat dollar21 increases are the only way to gradually raise  low22 rents to fair levels.23 Between 2010 and 2011 , I had a24 nine percent rise in operating and  capital25 expenses.	This includes eight percent increases in2 
2 both taxes and water and sewer and an  unexpected3 $ 12 , 000 bill for pointing and waterproofing the4 facade and rear exterior and repairing damages  from5 unusually heavy rainstorms. I have submitted  bills6 documenting these increases.7 But they are just part of  the8 story.	Over the past five years my taxes  have9 increased by 46 percent and water and sewer by  4210 percent.	At the same time, income rose just  1711 percent.12 To help remedy the gap between  low13 rents and expenses, I ask you to pass increases  of14 five percent or, at least, $ 50 for a one- year15 lease, whichever is greater.	And nine percent or16 at least $ 90 for a two- year lease.	Such a formula17 allows the board to set more flexible,  equitable18 guidelines that should be used in this and  future19 years to bring reason and justice to the  rent20 regulation system.21 Thank you.22 ( Applause.)23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.24 Edward Maloney.25 MR. MALONEY:	Hello.	I' m Edward2 
2 Maloney from 215 East 80 th Street, Manhattan. I' ve3 lived in my stabilized apartment since 1979 .4 As co- chair of my tenant5 association, I' m very concerned about additional6 rent hikes and increased cost to tenants in  a7 converted condo building, which has already  earned8 our landlord many millions of dollars in  profit.9 When the agriculture industry10 wants support, subsidies in government health,  they11 trot out mom and pop farmers as poster  children.12 Everybody wants to help the  family farm.	But when13 those supports and subsidies are granted, it is  the14 huge multi- national agra corporations that rake in15 the bucks and benefit unduly.16 In the very same way, when the  New17 York real estate industry wants higher rents,  they18 focus on the mom and pop landlords, the small  guys19 who can, actually, need help  at times.	But when20 this board grants generous increases year  after21 year, it is the largest landlords with thousands  of22 apartments who benefit most, especially in23 Manhattan where rents are almost obscene and  have24 little relation to landlord costs.25 I pay more than half of  my2 
2 retirement income to the landlord for rent.	I3 recently attended a meeting of Tenants  and4 Neighbors with 42 other tenants representing  425 different buildings citywide.	Forty- one of those6 42 buildings have recently had major  capital7 improvement increases.	MCIs are permanent8 increases in rent for landlord claimed expenses  for9 repair and maintenance of their private  business10 property.11 Our own increase was for 1812 percent increase above and beyond whatever13 increases you set, compounded forever.	MCI14 increases must be approved by DHCR, a  regulatory15 office that has become captured by the industry  and16 rubber stamps MCI increases.	This serves the17 landlord interest and not the  tenants.18 We had 17 different objections  to19 our MCI.	Any one of which would have  disqualified20 it by the DHCR' s own rules and regulations but  the21 landlord got it approved anyway.	Our project for22 improvement was paid for out of the building' s23 reserve fund.	The landlord made agreements with24 his condo association not to pay them back until  he25 sold our apartments, after we' re dead and buried,2 
2 essentially.	But the DHCR approved such falsely3 claimed expenses and he got his MCI  increase.4 The DHCR made a show of  demanding5 from the landlord' s CPA statements and registered6 engineer' s reports.	These were never provided but7 the landlord got his MCI  increase.8 The point is that the real  estate9 industry and large landlords have figured a way  to10 increase rents and profits around this board.	MCIs11 are the new focus and game in rent increases  so,12 perhaps, it is the moment for this board really  to13 consider the tenant side and balance annual  rent14 increases for struggling and fixed income  City15 residents against a consistently profitable  and16 greedy industry.17 Just for once in the history  of18 this board, I urge you to vote no increase  for19 landlords who continue to be the one  percenters20 among us.	If small landlords need help, let  them21 open their books, show hardship and set  increases22 that help small landlords.23 ( Applause.)24 MR. MALONEY:	But, please, do not25 just reward a large rapacious and  parasitical2

MALONEY:	Yes, I -- yes.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	How many units11 in the building?12 MR. MALONEY:	One- hundred and13 forty- five units.	There are 38 tenants --14 stabilized --15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Stabilized16 tenants remaining?17 MR. MALONEY:	Yes.	This is one  of18 the landlord' s 60 some buildings.	He' s converted a19 dozen.	He' s made millions on our building alone.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.21 Brian.22 MR. CHEIGH:	Thanks, Ed.23 Could you -- what is the --  what24 do you do on our MCI -- what do you get when   you25 get an MCI increase?	Do you get a statement  of2 
2 the -- the repairs and then the dollar  amount?3 MR. MALONEY:	What the tenant is4 notified?5 MR. CHEIGH:	Right.6 MR. MALONEY:	The tenant -- well,7 the tenant receives notification from the DHCR  that8 the landlord has filed for an MCI increase and  then9 the landlord is supposed to follow a whole  series10 of substantiation -- those facts to  the DHCR.	Like11 showing his bills, showing that he paid  them,12 showing where the money came from and that kind  of13 thing and -- and what the project was  about.14 The tenants receive that15 notification.	Then we hired an attorney.	That --16 that has so far cost us $ 28 , 000 to fight it.17 MR. CHEIGH:	Do you have -- so  do18 you have to hire an attorney?	You can' t just --19 MR. MALONEY:	You have to.	You20 -- there' s no way of fighting it otherwise and  the21 DHCR doesn' t abide by their own rules and22 regulations.23 They don' t make the landlord24 provide proper statements.	They call for it.	The25 landlord says, oh, I can' t.	They grant it anyway.2 
2 MR. CHEIGH:	And what does hiring3 a lawyer do for you?	Does that -- do you have  to4 take like traditional action?5 MR. MALONEY:	Well, the landlord6 -- expertise in the MCI field and helped us  find7 the 17 individual complaints, each one which  should8 have disqualified the MCI.	The DHCR overlooked it9 all.10 MR. CHEIGH:	And you said it was  a11 18 percent most recently for you?12 MR. MALONEY:	It was 18 percent,13 yes.	Which you note that our neighbors, who   are14 condo owners, only pay that once.	They pay their15 share.	The tenants get it forever added to  their16 rent and compounded forever.17 MR. CHEIGH:	Thank you.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes, Mr.20 Schleider.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	How long ago did22 this building convert?23 MR. MALONEY:	This building -- the24 landlord bought the building in the mid ' 80 s, about25 ' 86 for $ 11 million and he converted it in 2000 --2 

2	or 2001 it was.3
MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	So it' s
4 been at least ten years since the  building5 converted?6 MR. MALONEY:	Yes.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right. So the8 original sponsor doesn' t have control of the9 homeowners association; is that true?10 MR. MALONEY:	The landlord sits11 on the board and works with the condo  association.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Sits on the board13 but doesn' t have control; is that correct?14 MR. MALONEY:	No, he doesn' t any15 longer have control.16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right.17 MR. MALONEY:	He had control18 during this project, however,19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So -- and how long20 ago did this project start?21 MR. MALONEY:	This project22 started -- this is a good, I' m glad you bring  this23 up.	In 2004 he filed for the MCI increase in   2006 .24 The DHCR still has it under appeal and I' m told  by25 Ms. Kruger' s office that they have cases to 20014 
2 that the DHCR has not fully decided  on.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Um- hum.	So it' s4 really a State issue that you' re having the problem5 with it.6 MR. MALONEY:	It' s appalling.7 MR.

SILBER:	Hello.	My name' s18 Jimmy Silber.	I represent SPONY, which is  the19 Small Property Owners of New York.20 What I' d like to focus on in my21 testimony is the real estate tax component of  the22 price index which is the largest expense for  any23 property owner in this City and, of course, it' s24 probably the most important aspect of this --  for25 the City to maintain its social  programs.2 
2 I own a building in  Manhattan.3 This year' s increases show that I' m spending 354 percent of all of my expenses for real  estate5 taxes.	So the City is, in effect, one- third part6 owner of my building and everyone else' s buildings.7 One- third of the increases that you set go back to8 the City to fund social programs like Medicaid  and9 health care, Fire Department, Police  Department.10 All of the social programs that11 the disadvantaged, the low income people in  this12 City rely on, are funded by real estate  taxes.13 One- third of the increase that you set here goes14 back into the City to fund  social programs.	And15 society works in that -- in that respect to  have16 social programs to help people.17 But society also must bear the18 burden of funding those programs. The burden  should19 not fall solely on the shoulders on the  individual20 man or woman who happens to own  a building.	They21 have to be shared.22 And this year the Rent Guidelines23 Board, because we have a low price index, you  have24 an opportunity to make owners whole.	This is a25 year when you can do this.	Because look at the tax2 
2 component this year. It was -- it was measured  at3 7 . 5 percent increase just for this year.	The4 expenditure weight in the price index is 28 . 335 percent.	If this board voted an increase of  just6 2 . 12 percent for a one- year lease, all you would be7 doing is making owners whole for this year in  what8 we must pay for real estate  taxes.9 I' m not talking about insurance10 costs.	I' m not talking about water and sewer11 rates.	I' m not talking about contractor services,12 fuel.	All you would be doing with a 2 . 12 percent13 increase is making owners whole for real  estate14 taxes for this year.15 Real estate taxes through the16 years have soared.	That is a constant.	They go17 up.	The City needs real estate tax money to   fund18 their programs.	Taxes go up.19 In 2003 when the price index  was20 16 . 9 percent, real estate tax component 14 . 821 percent.	What did the board give for a one- year22 lease?	Four- and- a- half percent.	2004 , the real23 estate tax component was 16 . 2 percent.	What did24 the board give for a one- year lease?25 Three- and- a- half percent.2 

23	up, please.4
CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Jimmy, wrap itMR. SILBER:	All we' re asking is
5 to make owners whole.	This is the year.	It hasn' t6 been done in past year.	The tax components have7 always been higher than the rent increases for  a8 one- year lease.	This is the year with a low  price9 index that you have the opportunity to make up  for10 that.	Make owners whole.	That' s all we ask.	Be11 fair.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 ( Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thanks, Jimmy.15 Mary Petretti.16 MS. PETRETTI:	Hi, everybody.	My17 name is Mary Petretti.	I' m a rent stabilized18 tenant and, previously, I did live in  an SRO.	I19 worked in the arts and also in finance so I' m  kind20 of on all sides of the  spectrum somewhat.	I' ve21 never owned an apartment.22 But when you' re -- the Guidelines23 Board is looking to evaluate and come to a   decision24 next week, if you would probably, hopefully,  keep25 some things in mind to discuss other  economic5 
2 effects on rents such as the percentage of  landlord3 and tenants pay out for services and their rent  --4 and the rent that we make -- that they make  in5 relation to the profit and the  income.6 So you can kind of see  what7 balance of what we' re making in our paychecks to8 what we' re paying out percentage of.	And then what9 the landlords are taking in and the percentage  of10 what the rise is.11 Luxury housing development in the12 City is financed by our tax dollars and how that' s13 also affecting the price of market rents which,  I14 think, is important.	A friend of mine and  his15 co- producer have a film called, Vanishing New York,16 which is, actually, playing on East Fourth  Street17 tonight but they' ve also been interviewed on City18 University TV and it discusses luxury housing  and19 how our taxes are paying  for that.	So you might be20 interested in.21 Also, when you guys gather to  come22 speak to us, beforehand do you speak to the  unions23 or even find out what the superintendents' pays  are24 for apartment buildings?	Because I understand25 that those haven' t gone up from my superintendents2 
2 that I' ve spoken to over the years.3 And how are our local universities4 involved in, possibly, giving you some guidance  and5 maybe even some ideas to maybe come to  your6 decisions?7 And I have a few more  topics.8 Artists upgrade a neighborhood.9 We, also, seem to displace the lower rent  tenants10 or people who can' t afford to live there which,  I11 think, is a shame and we need to kind of fix   that.12 But, also, the artists make it  a13 better neighborhood and then the people with  the14 big money come in and displace  us.15 So -- I think that' s it.	I have a16 couple of other topics but I don' t want to hold  you17 up.18 Thanks.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.20 ( Applause.)21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Rhonda22 Waggoner.23 MS.

2 Street, also known as the Dexter  House.3 I have lived there for over  304 years and I consider myself a devoted  upper5 westsider that has built and protected  my6 community.7 I like what John said about  being8 an unpaid security guard because as a mom and a   dog9 walker and a biker and a bird watcher  and10 everything else, we do have incredible eyes  and11 ears.12 Over the years I' ve actively13 contributed to the health and safety of  my14 neighborhood by attending local City Council  and15 Community Board meetings.16 Oh, boy, I' ve reached out and17 supported other local activists and politicians  and18 I volunteered in the neighborhood.	I' ve cultivated19 several gardens.	I' ve picked up trash and I' ve20 helped my neighbors out, many of them  elderly.21 And, like I said, I raised my  kid22 on the upper west side and with his dad  living23 nearby, also a westsider, our family was  involved24 in a -- a really great pre- school and two  public25 schools in the neighborhood.	He went on to2

WAGGONER:	So as a mom, a5 neighbor and a tenant, I care very deeply about  my6 home and my building and my  neighborhood.7 And so I respectfully ask you  for8 a rent freeze this year for  SROs.9 ( Applause.)10 MS. WAGGONER:	After last year' s11 three percent increase, which I think is  the12 proviso that you refer to, my landlord wasn' t13 entitled to take it but in my case has applied  it14 to my rent.15 DHCR figures show the Dexter House16 to be 59 percent occupied and not the 85 that  was17 required.	And so I' m fighting that.	I can' t18 afford another rent increase.	I live on a19 restricted budget and 30 percent of my rent goes  to20 -- I' m sorry, 30 percent of my income goes to  rent.21 Jesus, 29 seconds.	Okay.22 So I' m struggling.	I' m23 struggling. In addition, my landlord, one of  which24 in the media was reported to have been  incarcerated25 for his harassment of tenants -- the  landlords2 
2 willfully neglect our building.	They reduce3 services and they continue to deregulate  and4 warehouse units.5 My building' s 253 units.	It' s6 filled with strangers I don' t know, kids paying7 grossly inflated rents and oh, my  gosh.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Take a deep9 breath but please wrap up.10 MS. WAGGONER:	Okay.	Anyway, it' s11 also -- they' ve brought in a lot of  landlord12 employees to occupy the rooms.	They' re basically13 straw tenants.	They don' t have any voices.	The --14 ironically, I, you know, I have to complain  for15 their benefit but they' re strategically placed16 around the building and serve to intimidate  and17 harass tenants. And they are sort of a puppet,  I18 think, a device that' s used by the landlord.19 And to the best of my  knowledge,20 I' m the only permanent tenant left on my  floor.21 There are numerous repairs.	There are breaches in22 security.	There' s a failure to provide essential23 services and --24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And I will ask25 you to wrap up.2

WAGGONER:	I' m in litigation6 again, the second HP action to get them to  repair7 mold and to waterproof the exterior.	They want me8 out.	I mean, they are  very vocal.	You know, the9 manger, who commutes from New Jersey, will say,  I10 want you out.	But I do the work.	But that' s a11 very broad term.	They don' t the work.12 Okay.	So anyway, help us.

LABARGE:	Good afternoon, my16 name' s Chris Labarge.	I' m here representing City17 Councilman Rosie Mendez.	And I submitted her full18 testimony for the record.	I' m just going to19 highlight some of it.20 Within the communities of our21 district there are tens of thousands of  rent22 stabilized housing units which are at risk of  being23 lost forever, joining the ranks of the  near24 quarter- million units permanently lost since 1994 .25 At this time of continual economic2 
2 uncertainty for working class New Yorkers, I  urge3 the Rent Guidelines Board to take every measure  to4 preserve these units for our City' s low and middle5 income families.6 Statistics clearly indicate that7 the past four years have taken a far  larger8 financial toll on the pocketbooks of  regulated9 tenants than on their landlords.	Unemployment10 remains a major issue at 9 percent citywide,  wage11 rates are stagnant, job growth has  been12 inconsistent and current indicators show that13 future growth will gradual at  best.14 Furthermore, the rent burden15 citywide is 35 . 2 percent, a historical high.	And16 over one- third of rent stabilized tenants pay over17 50 percent of their income towards  rent.18 Lastly, to complete this picture,19 waiting lists for public housing stretch into  the20 hundreds of thousands and the number of  people21 staying in City shelters is at an alarming  high22 despite consistent under reporting of the  true23 scope of homelessness.24 When rents increase every year and25 wages remain flat, true affordability and  the2 
2 prospect of home occupancy hangs in the  balance.3 New York' s rental housing stock has maintained its4 value and many indicators point to sustained  future5 growth.6 Owners have consistently seen an7 operating income from their properties increase8 with longitudinal data indicating 22 . 5 percent9 growth in profits over the past two  decades.10 Vacancy remains -- vacancy rates11 remain stunningly low, less than one percent  in12 Manhattan based on my district- based observation13 and reliable broker data.14 The RGB has a responsibility  to15 set rents at a rate that take these  impactful16 variables into account and corrects the  inequality17 of current economic impacts.18 The Rent Guidelines Board19 endeavors on a number of data analyses to arrive  at20 a series of commensurate rent adjustment  numbers.21 In my view, the most equitable method used is  the22 net revenue commensurate adjustment with vacancy23 increase projection which adds a  realistic24 assumption for the impact of vacancy increases  on25 revenues.2 
2 A close commitment to this3 standard would yield a modest increase of 1 . 254 percent and 2 . 0 percent for one and two- year leases5 respectively.6 Adopting this standard would be7 reasonable and prudent given the cumulative  effect8 of the excessive increases over the past four  years9 totaling 13 . 5 percent for one- year leases and 2610 percent for two- year leases, effectively $ 2 , 200 in11 total rent for rent stabilized households.12 To close, I' d just like to say,13 every time the Rent Guidelines Board  increases14 rents, units and entire buildings move one  step15 closer to permanently exiting a system designed  to16 protect the lives and livelihoods of our  residents.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.18 Ms. Adams.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.20 MS. ADAMS:	Yes.	Would you21 repeat what you propose for the rent increases  this22 year?23 MR. LABARGE:	Sure.	There' s two24 specific proposals.	It will take about 30  seconds.25 At a bare minimum keep the  rent2 
2 increases at or below 1 . 25 percent for a one- year3 lease and 2 percent for a two- year lease.4 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.5 MR. LABARGE:	And there' s a6 second, to allow no increases whatsoever  on7 buildings that have hazardous violations or  on8 buildings where more than ten percent of the  units9 have been de- stabilized, historically.10 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you very much.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.13 All right.	What was the number of14 units lost did you say from  --15 MR. LABARGE:	Since 1994 ?16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No, just -- just17 recently.18 MR. LABARGE:	Recently?19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yeah.20 MR. LARBARGE:	Every year there21 are units lost.	Usually it' s probably anywhere22 between four and 6 , 000 per year.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	Now24 when you say lost, does that mean these units  --25 MR. LABARGE:	I mean a net loss2 
2 between the number of affordable units created  and3 the number of units that age out through  vacancy4 decontrol or other methods.5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, okay.6 Well, there' s two parts to this then.	What happens7 to those units that come out of rent  stabilization?8 Are they lost or --9 MR. LABARGE:	They' re lost in10 terms of affordable.	For purposes of this11 testimony, they' re lost --12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I see.13 MR. LABARGE:	-- in our eyes for14 purposes of affordability when they age out of  the15 system.16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	So --17 okay.	So in your eyes they' re lost in terms of18 affordability not -- that' s not necessarily true.19 MR. LABARGE:	They' re not lost as20 a housing unit, no.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.22 MR. LARBARGE:	They' re lost in23 terms of affordability.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Now if we have25 about 6 , 000 or 6 , 100 units lost, as you said, given2 
2 the housing stock, any idea how long it would  it3 take to deplete the pool of rent  stabilized4 housing?5 ( No response.)6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' ll give you the7 answer.	It' s about 165 years.	All right.8 MR. LABARGE:	Irrespective of9 that, it' s still concerning that several thousand10 units age out each year.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes and we also12 have, in fact, last year we had almost 8 , 100 units13 re- introduced in.	So, yeah things age out but  just14 -- just taking your dire numbers or  the15 presentation, it would take 165 years to  deplete16 the rent stabilized housing stock.17 Thank you.18 MR.

We don' t have -- in some of12 -- in most of them, we don' t have any  rights13 because we are SRO tenants and we are very  rich14 like the poor landlords are -- we are  not15 considered human beings because in the  building16 where I live, my neighbors and I are not   considered17 as human beings.	We are parasites.18 In my -- I hear from most of  my19 fellow -- fellow tenants from other SROS where  we20 meet once a month about the way the SRO  landlords21 go when they want to illegally evict a tenant  that22 they don' t like like they are trying to do with  me23 right now.	But you know what, they going to sit  in24 this one because I' m not going anywhere.	And the25 landlord of my building is the one that' s going  to2 
2 go and go to jail because I' m sick of the way  she3 is mistreating the elderly people.4 What goes on in my building  is5 nothing but elderly abuse.	They are very old6 people.	I' m only 77 years young and I am the  one7 that they' re really trying for them because they' re8 all afraid, even the ones that are younger than  me.9 They are afraid to speak up because they' re not10 supposed to complain and we are supposed to  do11 whatever the manager of the building order us  to12 do.13 But she is hiding from me.	She14 doesn' t want me to see her because she knows  that15 she' s going to be in trouble with the law  because16 in the -- we don' t need a rent increase.	We don' t17 need a rent increase.	It will be a crime for  the18 very rich people like me because the very  poor19 crying -- baby.	They call themselves a landlord.20 They don' t need the money.21 MR.

BENDER:	Good afternoon or10 good morning, whatever the case may  be.11 I' m Adele Bender.	I' m a member of12 my Council on Housing and the Gray Panthers and  a13 few other organizations.	I live in Queens and I' m14 not only speaking for myself but I speak  for15 community because the constant increases in  rent16 are breaking up communities.17 I have friends that have had  to18 leave the State because they cannot afford to  pay19 the constant increases and not everybody  qualifies20 for a rent freeze.	And I don' t think that this is21 a very healthy situation.	There are three very,22 very big -- big issues in this City, if not   the23 country.	It is health, housing and hunger.	The24 three Hs and they are all interrelated because  if25 you can' t pay your rent, sometimes you just can' t2 
2 eat.	And I know of situations like   that.3 Plus the fact that I -- I get  mail4 from the coalition from -- Coalition for  the5 Homeless.	The homeless shelters are bulging6 because people, because families can no longer  keep7 paying the high rents.	There are no other8 provisions made for people that cannot keep  paying9 the increases in the rent.10 So families -- sometimes elderly11 people end up in a shelter system which I just   said12 is bulging.	I think that really is a shame on  the13 -- on the City and it is a shame on the   nation.14 And I don' t like to know that my friends are  having15 to leave the City because they cannot any  longer16 afford to pay the rent.17 And as you people know, there' s18 the -- wage -- the wages are not  that great.	The19 wages are not going up.	Jobs are hard to find.20 College graduates, the young people, for  old21 people, yet the rents keep climbing and  climbing.22 And, I think, really, something has got to be  done.23 And I' m really hoping that there' s a smidgen of24 humanity in this Rent Guidelines Board to  really25 take into consideration the things that people  have2

I' ll be10 reading an excerpt of her full testimony which  has11 been submitted to the board.12 MS. ADAMS:	I' m sorry, which13 Assemblywoman are you -14 MS. DIAZ:	Deborah Glick.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Deborah Glick.16 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.17 MS. DIAZ:	I' m here to testify on18 behalf of all rent stabilized tenants in New  York19 City and, in particular, for the tenants  I20 represent in the 66 th Assembly District, which21 includes the neighborhoods of Tribeca, Soho,  the22 West Village, Greenwich Village and parts of  Union23 Square and the East Village.24 For much of the past three  years,25 New York City, like the rest of the nation,  has9 
2 experienced the worst economic recession in3 decades.	Even though the City begins to now  add4 new jobs, the unemployment rate continues to  rise,5 reaching over 9 . 6 percent in February of this year6 compared to 8 . 8 percent a year ago, according to7 the New York State Department of  Labor.8 Furthermore, the City is currently9 working on passing a budget that will result  in10 major cuts to the child care services that many  New11 Yorkers depend on in order to work.	Yet with12 seeming disregard to the reality of the  economic13 situation for millions of New Yorkers, the RGB  is14 proposing a rent increase of 1 . 75 percent to 4 . 015 percent for one- year leases and 3 . 5 percent to 6 . 6716 percent for two- year leases.17 For middle and lower income New18 Yorkers, the City' s housing market has stacked19 against them.	In contrast to the rest of  the20 country, most New Yorkers do not own their  homes21 and those who live in rent stabilized  apartments22 often fear that they may be pushed out due to   rent23 hikes they cannot afford or harassment  from24 landlords who have been eager to cash in on  the25 housing crunch at the expense of rent  stabilized2 

2	tenants.3
There' s been an increased level of
4 harassment as seen by our office over the  last5 several years despite repeated rent increases6 authorized by the RGB.7 As of April 2012 , the citywide8 rental vacancy rate was a mere 3 . 2 percent while9 the Manhattan rental vacancy rate was only 1 . 1610 percent, demonstrating that the City is facing  not11 just a housing shortage but a housing  emergency.12 Every year the RGB conducts a13 price study to determine how much landlords'  costs14 have increased and then votes on  percentage15 increases for rent stabilized leases.	The study16 this year that in the face of an economic  recession17 that has devastated many rent stabilized  tenants,18 landlords will mark the sixth straight year  that19 they have seen an increase in their net  operating20 income.21 Most New Yorkers would be very22 happy to have such a dependable increase in  their23 incomes.	Regrettably, this has not been the  case24 from this tenant.25 It is unconscionable for the  Rent4 
2 Guidelines Board to raise rents as landlords  keep3 on making profits and while tenants continue  to4 bear the consequences of the economic  collapse.5 I call on the Rent  Guidelines6 Board to do the right thing and freeze rents at   the7 current level for 2012 / 2013 so rent stabilized8 tenants can get through these difficult  economic9 times.10 Thank you.11 ( Applause.)12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 MR.

SCHLEIDER:	Deborah Glick.19 All right.	I' m curious as to why20 the percentage of home ownership or a lack  of21 percentage -- or a lack of home ownership  was22 brought up in the testimony, is that something  you23 can speak to?24 MS. DIAZ:	I think that her25 concern is for her constituents and since most  of2 
2 them don' t own their homes --3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	So4 what has Representative Glick done to promote  home5 ownership among the --6 MS. DIAZ:	I don' t think that she7 was noting the rate of home ownership in order  to8 -- not still encourage or discourage  home9 ownership, it' s just completely recognizes the10 reality where here constituents are that they  are11 tenants and many of them are rent  stabilized.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, you also13 brought that up in context that -- that New  York14 City has a higher rate of rental households  than15 the rest of the country.16 MS. DIAZ:	Um- hum.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So I' m curious as18 to why that was baked into her  presentation.19 MS. DIAZ:	I think, simply is you20 acknowledge that the reality for New Yorkers  might21 be needed --22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Is -- is her23 solution then to promote home ownership for  the24 economical disadvantaged?25 MS. DIAZ:	No.2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	It' s not?3 MS. DIAZ:	And I don' t think that4 that is what her testimony is trying to find  out.5 I think it' s just to acknowledge the reality of  the6 life of her constituents as being  renters.7 MR.

I' m18 currently living at Valley Glide Shelter  in19 Manhattan.20 I was evicted from my  rent21 controlled, three apartment on Steinway Street  in22 Astoria on November 15 th, 2011 while my Social23 Security/ Disability application was in a pending24 condition.25 I' ve since received it and I' m2 
 2 making currently $ 1 , 970 a month.	I was still3 evicted.	They didn' t care.4 When I went to the court to try  to5 fight the eviction, my neurologist gave a letter  to6 the judge that said that my disability will  be7 approved and the judge did not take that  into8 account.9 My wife and her family had been  in10 -- living the apartment since 1955 .	Now all that' s11 left of that family is one grave with the --   the12 father, mother and daughter inside.13 I' m testifying today because even14 though I have Social Security income of $ 1 , 970 a15 month, I cannot afford the current rent for  studio16 apartments in New York -- in Astoria, which are 17	$ 1 , 200 to $ 2 , 000 each month.18 After my eviction my --  my19 apartment reverted to market rent and we lost  all20 of the goods of that family.21 Please do not approve rent22 increases which would adversely affect the  elderly.23 I am one of  them.24 I have Multiple Sclerosis.	I' m25 able to walk.	Thank God.18 
2 The problems with the apartment --3 the aforementioned apartment happened about 354 years ago.	The landlord took advantage of --  of5 the wife after the husband died and gave a   rent6 increase. And -- that my hand for every year  for7 about 10 or 15 years. And it may be a Legal   Aid8 freeze but the rents -- rent has gone up from  $ 1009 a month in 1961 to $ 800 a month now.	It' s10 ridiculous.	There' s no reason to live like this.11 Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 ( Applause.)14 Mr. Schleider.15 MR.

10 associated with the Adele Shelter, Valley Lodge.	I11 was in there for several -- I was homeless  for12 several years and, eventually, I got a  senior13 apartment in which I' m residing in now.14 However, I' m -- we' ve created a15 group down at Valley Lodge called, Hand in Hand,  in16 which we try to advocate for affordable rents  and17 for -- for entitlements which I' m very proud to  be18 a part of.19 My problem now is that now --  now20 that I' ve reached the ripe old age of 39 , I' m -- I21 feel a little insecure. I have -- I have   affordable22 rent where I live right now and I love  the23 apartment, it' s wonderful.	It' s a one- bedroom in24 Harlem.	But the only problem is that I' ve seen the25 -- the government renege on so many programs that  I10 
2 really don' t feel secure.	Sometimes I wake in a3 cold sweat thinking that maybe they' re going to4 yank this program away from the  seniors.5 I' ve worked for over 50 years and6 -- and I feel -- and I believe in the   American7 dream, you know, work hard and -- and be honest  and8 decent and all that stuff but somehow or another  I9 don' t think the -- the powers to be have been  as10 faithful as I' ve been to the statement.	And for11 some reason I feel very insecure that -- that  any12 day, any year that they might pull the rug  from13 under me and I might wind up back in the   shelter14 which would be a night -- a nightmare for me in   the15 autumn of my years.16 I would love to live my years  out17 with a quality of life and -- and continue  to18 pursue that American dream of life, liberty and  the19 pursuit of happiness	But sometime I feel a  little20 doubtful of that.21 So I know that there' s a lot of22 people that sit in my shoes and, I hope, and   I23 don' t think it' s fair that -- that we should work24 all our lives and work until we' re old and gray  and25 then wind up getting the shaft as you -- as   they2

SAWYER:	Good afternoon.12 My name is Paul Sawyer and I' ll be13 reading testimony on behalf of Assemblymember  Linda14 Rosenthal.15 I' m Assemblymember Linda B.16 Rosenthal and I represent the 67 th Assembly17 District, which includes the upper west side  of18 Manhattan and parts of Clinton and Hells  Kitchen.19 As Chair of the New York  City20 Assembly' s Mitchell Lama Housing Subcommittee and a21 long- time tenant advocate, I urge the Rent22 Guidelines Board to forego imposing any  rent23 increases this year.24 New York City is in the midst  of25 an affordable housing crisis, the end of which  no2 
2 one can predict with any certainty.	In light of3 this and the fact that the City' s vacancy rate  is4 just 3 . 12 percent, the board is considering5 increasing rents on one- year leases by up to 4 . 06 percent and by up to 6 . 75 percent on two- year7 leases.8 Just one year ago, the board  hiked9 rents 3 . 75 percent on one- year leases and 7 . 2510 percent on two- year leases.	To go forward with yet11 another would serve as a clear signal that the  RGB12 is more concerned with the interests of  deep13 pocketed landlords than the interests of  this14 City' s low and middle income tenants, who the board15 should be protecting.16 My district is home to  nearly17 44 , 000 rent stabilized tenants and this board' s18 decision is the primary factor in  determining19 whether or not my constituents of nearly  one20 million tenants statewide, will be able to  remain21 in their homes.	Many of these people already22 devote more than 30 percent of their income  towards23 paying rent.24 The Rent Guidelines Board was25 founded on the mission of balancing the  financial2 
2 interests of landlords who, without an  adequate3 check, would readily charge tenants unaffordable4 market rate rents against the interest of  tenants5 who would -- could otherwise not afford to live  in6 this City.7 The Rent Guidelines -- if the  RGB8 continues to increase rents as it has done  year9 after year, it will only exacerbate an  already10 serious affordable housing crisis.	By doing so11 this board will cause many struggling tenants to  be12 forced from their homes and enable landlords  to13 remove units from rent regulation, leaving  tenants14 with one less affordable housing option.15 This board must uphold its side  of16 the bargain and protect the interest of tenants  and17 not continue on the path of increasing rents to  the18 highest proposed levels.19 Throughout this process, those20 representing the landlords have argued that  rent21 increases are necessary to keep pace with  rising22 fuel costs and that landlords depend on the  income23 generated from their buildings.24 The RGB already includes the cost25 of fuel in its rent calculations.	Using a calculus2 
2 that considers the shifting fuel prices and  the3 number of rooms in each building, 75 percent of  the4 annual fuel cost per room is passed along to  the5 tenant.	This method for incorporating fuel costs6 is equitable for tenants and landlords  alike.7 What' s more, the smaller landlords8 who serve as the public face of these  arguments,9 represent only a tiny fraction of an industry  that10 is, in actuality, dominated by wealthy  landlords11 and faceless corporations who control the  vast12 majority of properties.13 ( Applause.)14 MR. SAWYER:	Year after year,15 we' re seeing landlord profits skyrocket even as16 their tenants are twisting themselves into  knots,17 scrambling to pay all their bills.	It is18 unacceptable to consider placing the burden of  any19 increase costs onto the backs of working class  New20 Yorkers who are already paying nearly half  their21 salary towards their rent.22 In the past, the RGB has failed  to23 act as a responsible partner in our City' s24 commitment to providing affordable housing for  our25 citizenry.2 
2 The RGB has both weakened and3 dismantled the rent protections upon which our  most4 economically vulnerable citizens depend, resulting5 in a greater divide between the rich and the  poor6 and a market loss of adversity and the  character7 that have been a hallmark of this -- our City   for8 generations.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Sawyer,10 please wrap it up.11 MR. SAWYER:	I am.	Just a two12 sentences left.	Sorry about that.13 This is not the City that we  know.14 The increases under consideration by the RGB do  not15 make sense and will further enrich the  already16 wealthy landlords and corporations at the  expense17 of New York' s middle class.18 I am calling upon the RGB to  do19 the right and compassionate thing and the  only20 pragmatic course of action, to enact a rent  freeze21thisyear.22Thank you.23( Applause.)24CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25Thank you.

8 Susan Gammie.	I' m a member of Tenants and9 Neighbors, a Central Village Block Association  and10 of United Scenic Artists Local 829 .11 I also serve on Community Board12 No. 2 , Manhattan, as a public member.	I' m on the13 Landmarks and Public Aesthetics Committee, a14 commitment of about 80 hours  a year.	So I fully15 understand the time sacrifice you board  members16 make.17 I imagine that, like me,  you18 donate your time out of love for  New York.	In my19 neighborhood I' m a kind of dinosaur. I' m an artist20 in Greenwich Village where I' ve lived and raised a21 family in the same rent stabilized apartment  for22 over 30 years.23 When we moved in, our rent  was,24 actually, market value and for the first 25  years25 of our tenancy, we enjoyed a cordial  relationship8 
2 with the landlord who lived on premises and  was3 pleased to have tenants who paid on time, took  good4 care of the property and often chipped in  with5 building maintenance tasks like tending a  communal6 courtyard or cleaning out a  basement.7 Five years ago, our building was8 sold to a major realty company and we are the   only9 standing tenants remaining as the rest of  the10 formerly multiple dwelling unit undergoes  a11 three- year- and- counting renovation into a private12 residence.13 We are clearly unwelcome now  and14 have lived under siege where the  rodent15 infestations, security problems, exposure to  toxic16 materials and major interruptions in major  building17 services, culminating in no boiler heat or  cooking18 gas during the entire month of  November.19 Our quality of life has plummeted,20 our rent has increased.	Worse conditions, more21 rent.	This is reality for most stabilized  tenants.22 The fact is, is that there' s an undeclared war23 going on - owners versus regulated  tenants.24 Rather than being an entity of25 balance, the RGB seems to be a weapon in that   war,2 
2 a stealth vehicle by which the owners  are3 inevitably guaranteed an increase regarding this4 circumstance.5 Yes, property -- yes, operating6 expenses are up but so  are profits.	2012 is the7 sixth straight year that owner profits have  risen.8 This is particularly notable during an  economic9 crisis that has a negative impact on most  tenants,10 myself included.	I just lost my job of 20  years.11 The rental vacancy rate in  the12 City is at an all- time low. The market rates  are13 almost back to their all- time high.14 As a native New Yorker,  an15 increasingly endangered species, I have become --  I16 have some real concerns about where this is  all17 heading.18 Healthy communities need19 residential stability not high turnover rates.	The20 heath of the real estate industry is by no  means21 the only measure of health for the City, I ask   you22 to understand the power you wield in shaping  the23 future of the City we all  love.24 I ask you to factor in the  human25 capital.	I ask you to understand the impact  that2 
2 continuous rent increases have on the one  million3 stabilized New Yorkers during this downturn.	I ask4 you to take a long and balanced view and if it   is5 not possible to freeze the rents, to  please6 recommend the lowest possible increases.7 Thank you very much.

I18 am an organizer with Goddard Riverside SRO  Law19 Project.	I spoke to you during the  invited20 testimony that we had a few  weeks ago.	And I just21 wanted to address, just really quickly, some of  the22 points made by some of the landlord  representatives23 here today.24 We saw -- we heard landlords  talk25 about legal fees and, you know, how much those  have2 
2 increased.	Not -- perhaps not keeping in mind  the3 fact that when they do go to Housing Court,  those4 tenants -- most tenants are unrepresented and,  you5 know, have greater chance of not succeeding in  what6 the case is.7 We also heard some of the  worst8 from landlords today.	We heard landlords9 acknowledge that they' re trying to destabilize10 their buildings.	We heard landlords acknowledge11 that they' re keeping their units empty and12 nevertheless coming here to ask for rent  increases13 instead of trying to rent those units  out.14 We heard from landlords that  just15 aren' t sure how the provisos work and that --16 acknowledge that they' ve been applying apartment17 rent increases to rooming houses.	We have, you18 know, heard all kinds of things like this and  --19 and I, also, wanted to address the testimony  from20 -- I' m sorry, from --21 A VOICE:	Helen Daniels.22 MR. PARCERISAS:	Yes, Helen23 Daniels, exactly.24 Thank you.25 Talking about how SROs should not2 
2 exist in her view. And I would like to point   out3 that this is somebody who actually went to jail  and4 spent time in jail for illegally harassing  tenants5 out of the SRO building that she owned on  Astor6 Place.7 So all of this just to point  out8 to the, you know, lack of credibility, in  my9 opinion, that some of these arguments  have.10 So, you know, I think, that' s11 pretty much what I wanted to  point out.	Just to,12 you know, make a little rebuttal to some of  the13 arguments that were -- that were pointed out  today.14 As far as the provisos, I  wanted15 to insist, as I did in the invited testimony that   I16 gave, that they are very difficult to enforce  and17 because so many SRO buildings would already  not18 qualify for a proviso, I would echo what Larry  Wood19 said earlier and just really ask you not to have  an20 increase at all.21 You heard from Rhonda Waggoner at22 the Dexter House and how she' s been trying to  fight23 an illegal rent increase for months now. And  I24 would really urge you to consider this  before25 voting for any provisos.2 
2 Finally, as a rent stabilized3 apartment tenant myself, I would also ask you  to4 vote for a zero percent increase this year  for5 apartment tenants also.6 Thank you.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 ( Applause.)9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Lino Alvarez.10 A VOICE:	She' s not here.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Not here.

I' m here to testify not only for myself4 but also to speak on behalf of all those  silent5 voices who have lost their appeals due to  the6 20 - year program of what I claim is ethnic and elder7 cleansing of the community called the East  Village.8 I am a 32 - year old -- 32 - year9 resident of the East Village. And during my  tenancy10 I have known good landlords and bad landlords  as11 well as good tenants and bad  tenants.12 What constitutes a good tenant13 from a bad tenant is best left to the evaluation   on14 the individual basis and there are well  established15 means to make this determination in the New  York16 City Court system.	In my opinion, there is not  a17 strong as process for the evaluation for  landlords.18 As this committee is charged with19 determining what is a fair balance between  the20 profit margin are people who choose to invest  in21 real estate and become landlords with what  tenants22 must pay, I would like to present the  following23 suggestions:24 There are good landlords and  there25 are bad landlords but why should the bad  ones2 
2 receive the same rewards as the  good ones?	Why is3 it that in the interest of public  safety?4 Restaurants are now rated with A, B, C and D   to5 alert patrons of the number or severity of  the6 Department of Health violations that could  be7 health threatening but buildings are not rated  in8 the same way to alert residents of the  Department9 of Building or HPD violations that could be  life10 threatening?11 We' ve seen many news articles of12 firemen that go into buildings that die because  of13 illegal partitions, whether built by tenants  or14 landlords.	There is no monitoring of or no  further15 action, we just see the news reports and then  we16 don' t see the follow up.17 If landlords cannot maintain a18 better than B standing, well, I propose -- I   would19 like to challenge, actually, this committee  that20 they -- you propose that if a building  cannot21 maintain a better than B standing or to be   without22 DHCR, HPD, DOB, or any other agency  confirmed23 violations, that they not merit the rent  increase24 at all.25 If landlords or better put, real2 
2 estate investors and speculators cannot pay  to3 adequately maintain their properties, then they4 should seek other forms of investments and  not5 require that every water increase or property  tax6 be immediately handed down to the tenant in  the7 form of rent increases.8 If the City -- if the City is  in9 such need of money, why doesn' t it better enforce10 the confirmed standing Building Code  violations?11 I' ve been a tenant for 32 years in my apartment  and12 I have a 24 - year outstanding violation for a COB --13 CO -- violation for a Certificate of Occupancy  that14 I brought to the State of New York, the City of   New15 York and no action' s been taken.16 I' m sorry, I' m not able to finish17 this but you have it before you so you can read   it.18 If anyone would like a copy, I' ve got more.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.20 Ms. Adams.21 MS. ADAMS:	Yeah.	I' m intrigued22 by your suggestion that there be an A, B, C or   D23 label for landlords.24 MR. NAUKE:	Yes.25 MS. ADAMS:	Are you aware of any2 
2 other city that has done that?3 MR. NAUKE:	I' m not aware of it as4 yet but why should New York wait when there' s  a5 good suggestion here.6 MS. ADAMS:	I just -- I  was7 wondering if there was any other model  --8 MR. NAUKE:	If our mayor --9 MS. ADAMS:	-- that we could look10 to.11 Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 MR.

SUTTON:	Good afternoon,22 Chairman and the members of the  board.23 Thank you once again for  inviting24 us to speak about an impact a rent increase  would25 have on SRO tenants.2 
2 I have been living in my  building,3 an SRO occupancy building for 13 years.	I would4 like to request that the members of the  board5 decline a rent increase for 2012 through 2013 .6 Many SRO tenants, like myself, are7 struggling to find and/ or maintain jobs due to the8 bad economy.	The impact of a rent increase  will9 cause homelessness, vagrancy, hunger and mental10 instability as many tenants already find  it11 impossible to pay required rent.12 In the past 13 years, I' ve had13 five different landlords.	Having numerous14 landlords is havoc because they purchase  the15 building then use unethical and illegal tactics  to16 get rid of rent stabilized tenants then convert  the17 building illegally, as well, into market- rate18 apartments.	These tactics include ongoing severe19 harassment with each new landlord.20 I share this with the members  of21 the board because I' ve discovered this is a  common22 practice in SRO buildings and with most  SRO23 tenants.	My first two landlords and I worked  well24 together without discounts or increases in  rent.25 And they still profited.	They weren' t greedy. We2 
2 can all work together fairly.3 I also worked for a realtor  for4 over 20 years who had 43 to 45 -- 46 pieces   of5 property so I know -- and I paid  the bills.	I did6 the accounting so I know the cost and --   and7 profits.	And my -- in my neighborhood, I -- I' m  in8 an SRO in Harlem.	We all get along.	The majority9 of the people on the block own their buildings  and10 have tenants and they don' t raise their rents.	One11 woman has three buildings and she doesn' t raise her12 rents.13 Another woman inherited, who14 happened to be a friend, she inherited the  building15 loaded with tenants.	She doesn' t raise the rents.16 But yet she' s able to still maintain the17 properties.	We all take care of -- we' re mature18 adults, we don' t incur costs.	If there' s something19 wrong, we pitch in and yet the owners are  still20 profitable.21 So that' s it.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.23 In your building, how many tenants24 are there?25 MS. SUTTON:	They' ve all been2 
2 harassed out.	I' m the last one.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And the other4 units are empty or they' ve been occupied by5 tourists or --6 MS. SUTTON:	They' re empty.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I' m sorry?8 MS. SUTTON:	They' re empty.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Oh, they' re10 empty.	I' m sorry.11 MS.

I, a retired25 teacher, consider myself middle class if there  is2 
2 any such classification any more.3 My income is derived from modest4 Social Security, a very small teacher' s pension.	I5 only taught for 15 years and a widow' s  government6 pension, which practically cover my monthly  rent7 with a few disposal dollars for  utilities.8 Now this has disappeared thanks to9 the $ 85 rent increase, mandatory rent increases10 imposed by the Rent Guidelines Board.11 This is an article which goes  back12 a few years.	The Supreme Court of New York  County13 invalidated the unjust mandatory rent increases  of14 $ 40 for one- year lease renewal and $ 85 for two- year15 lease renewals.	A middle level Appellate Court  has16 affirmed this ruling.	It is possible that the17 Court of Appeals may decide to review the case  and18 could -- could decide to reverse the case --  to19 reverse the ruling of the  lower courts.	This is a20 little ambiguous.21 For now the mandatory dollar22 increase from October 1 , 2008 to September 30 th,23 2010 , are in -- effective.	I don' t know whether24 it' s a misspelling because the word is separated in25 and effective is the next word. I' d like to -- I' d2 
2 like to have -- to know the status of this   item.3 The small landlords may be  taking4 a beating.	The large -- the big landlords are  not.5 They have expensive lobbyists and politicians.6 This is an obscenity.7 Thank you.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.9 ( Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Burchell11 Marcus;12 Who will be followed by  Regina13 Karp;14 Who will be followed by  Hunter15 Johansson.16 MR. MARCUS:	Good afternoon.17 My name is Dr. Burchell  Marcus.18 I' m the Community Director for the Borough of19 Brooklyn and I advocate for the people of  Brooklyn.20 I testified last year hoping  that21 the Rent Guidelines Board would have, at least,  put22 a hold on rent increase because of the  hardship23 caused by this economy to the constituents  of24 Brooklyn.25 So far I' ve been battling at the2 
2 Community Boards all the way to Albany to try  to3 get legislation passed to put a freeze -- at   least4 a five to seven- year freeze on rents.5 Many of you doesn' t go into the6 neighborhoods as I do and speak to the people  who7 are hardly -- who are harshly punished by  the8 increases every year.9 In Brownsville, Brooklyn, in East10 New York Brooklyn, Bushwick, Brooklyn,  Carnarsie11 and parts of Crown Heights and Bedford  Stuyvesant12 are definitely way -- way below the poverty  level.13 And I don' t know if you take the poverty  level14 under consideration when you make -- whenever  you15 make the decisions, but I could see so many  people16 have vented the anger at what' s going on here.17 At one point in time, two  years18 ago, I did -- I didn' t get to speak because I  came19 a little bit late.	But I tends to believe  that20 many -- that many times the Rent Guidelines  Board21 sit and listen to everyone and do  absolutely22 nothing.	It' s about the big corporations who come23 into our communities, buying our properties  and24 claiming to the Community Board, oh, we' re going to25 make it rent affordable.2 
2 Rent affordable for who?	For the3 people with deep pockets coming in from  Manhattan4 and elsewhere who could afford the  high rent.	I' ve5 watched over and over they -- they rent  for6 apartments that I was paying -- that was paid  for7 five years ago, went from $ 700 a month for  two8 bedrooms to $ 1 , 700 a month.	Some places, including9 Bushwick, went all the way to $ 2 , 200 .	When is it10 going to stop?11 This is what they call12 gentrification.	And it must stop.	And I' m13 depending on each and every one of you here to   take14 a tour throughout these communities,  throughout15 these neighborhoods and look at the hardship  before16 you make your decisions.	We have to make sure  that17 our -- our people are being  served well.	If you18 take an oath to uphold the laws and to make   things19 balanced for the community, then I' m asking you,20 right, take a walk through the communities and  --21 and assess your judgment when you make any  increase22 for these people.23 The landlords are -- my last  point24 is that the landlords, some of them are  definitely25 struggling, yes, and they' re struggling because of2 
2 the advantage that the big corporations are  taking3 and causing the little landlords to suffer.	The4 economy is bad.	It' s not good.5 Please, take into consideration --6 don' t increase the rent.	We' re going to -- help me7 try to get legislation passed to put a freeze  on8 the rent so that when the salaries come up, we   can9 balance out before we make any further  decisions.10 Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.12 ( Applause.)13 MR.

SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for2 
2 coming back this year.3 Unfortunately, and I' m -- I hope4 you realize this, we have a one size fits  all5 problem and solution.	We can' t get as micro as --6 as maybe you' d like.7 I know that we' ve discussed this8 having some sort of means test for both  landlords9 and for tenants to see who could afford,  say10 increases, who needs increases and such.11 Just an opinion, a  personal12 opinion, maybe instead of trying to push through  a13 rent freeze legislation, you get some sort of  a14 legislation that allows us to be a little bit  more15 flexible.	Just -- just a  thought.16 MR. MARCUS:	Yes.	I just want to17 say, also, that right now Mayor Bloomberg have  been18 advocating for shelters in -- in the various  parts19 of Brooklyn.	They' re -- they' re inundated with a20 lot of shelters and each one of those  shelters,21 take in mind, they are -- the City' s paid  between22 $ 3 , 600 to 5 -- to $ 5 , 200 a month for one room to23 house families when they could be paying that  money24 to -- to over 780 , 000 empty apartments around the25 City.2 
2 Right.	It would cost -- it  would3 save the City a lot of money and no one is   looking4 into this.	We addressed that issue.	The Mayor5 tends to side stepped it so we going to go back   to6 him again to make sure that they -- they  force7 these corporations to open up those  apartments,8 right?	And make them truly affordable --9 affordable rent so that people could afford to  stay10 in them instead of paying these corporations  or11 management companies, 300 , $ 400 , 000 for a one- room12 apartment in a shelter.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yeah.	So we' ve --14 we' ve discussed that at the board also, the15 relocation of City funds like that.	But there' s16 nothing we can do about  that.17 MR. MARCUS:	Well, --18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Again, we wish19 you luck with your -- with your advocacy for  that.20 MR. MARCUS:	Well, we could do21 something about it because if we all work  together,22 if we all work together along with our  constituents23 who crying -- who crying foul because of the  high24 rents and cost of living, we could force --  the25 Mayor could force anyone to change they way  they2 
2 think so that people could live  decently.3 There' s no way -- there' s no4 reason for us to be paying these  management5 companies or corporations 300 , 400 -- $ 5 , 000 to6 house people in one room instead of putting them  in7 apartments and paying $ 1 , 000 at the most.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You' re -- you' re9 preaching to the choir here.10 Thank you.11 MR. MARCUS:	Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 ( Applause.)14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Regina Karp.15 MS. KARP:	I' m humbled to speaking16 in a hall where Abraham Lincoln  spoke.17 But let me say, I' m a retired New18 York City teacher of 25 years. I' m a  rent19 controlled tent of 43 years and raised my family  in20 the apartment that I' m in and my pension -- my  rent21 will be more than my pension  very soon.	My 25 - year22 pension, my rent will be that  amount.23 And on top of that sentiment,  I24 have to send and the fuel pass along and the  fact25 that when I put my savings in the bank, I   get2 
2 practically zero and the only thing you can do  is3 sort of have a risky place to put  your money.	And4 I' ve always felt myself to be very prudent and  live5 modestly.6 But all of my friends in  the7 building that I live in, senior citizens, now  have8 to take in boarders.	We cannot downsize.	I cannot9 -- I have a two- bedroom apartment but I can' t10 afford to downsize and my landlord won' t give me  a11 one bedroom.	He wants me out.12 So the fact is in these  years13 where Social Security wasn' t raised for several14 years, the banks are giving no interest, but  my15 landlord can get seven- and- a- half, unlike every16 single year, unlike the stabilized tenants  who17 don' t have that compounded interest and the fact18 that we' re getting nothing in the bank and the fuel19 pass along.	I will be driven out of the  City.20 The fact that I cannot no  longer21 afford to live in my apartment really keeps me  up22 at night.	My children, all of their friends  who23 went to public schools, creative people that  went24 to La Guardia High School, not one of their friends25 can afford -- the creative people can no  longer2 
2 afford to live in this City.	They are driving them3 out.4 First they moved to the  fringes.5 If they live in Manhattan, they go to Brooklyn  and6 then when they have families, they' re out.	They7 just can' t afford it.	Maybe if you' re single and8 you' re creative, you can share an apartment with9 three friends.	But if you' re married and middle10 class in this City, you can no longer live  here.11 Somebody said up at the  podium12 that, you know, oh, you know, the fact that  there13 are no more affordable apartments and 100 --  you14 know, it' ll take 100 years for us not to have15 apartments that are affordable.	Well, with16 decontrol, that' s not going -- where' s the 10017 years?	We' re not dead.	It' s got -- the vacancy18 decontrol solves that problem.19 MR.

Yes,12 rent controlled apartments do get the seven- and --13 can get as much as seven- and- a- half percent plus14 the fuel pass along.

Thank you. ( Applause.)CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Hunter
6 Johansson, for Assemblyman Richard Gottfried.7 MR. JOHANSSON:	Hello.	My name8 is Hunter Johansson and I' m here representing9 Assemblymember Richard Gottfried' s office.10 My name is Richard Gottfried.	I11 represent the 75 th Assembly District in Manhattan,12 which includes the neighborhoods of Chelsea,  Hells13 Kitchen, Midtown Park, the Upper West Side  and14 Murray Hill.15 I regret, due to the  legislative16 session in Albany, I am unable to testify today  in17 person.18 These proposed increases of 1 . 7519 to 4 percent for one year and 3 . 5 to 6 . 75 percent20 for two- year leases in rent stabilized apartments21 and lofts, aren' t justified and would make life22 harder for rent paying New Yorkers.23 I strongly oppose this year' s24 proposals and urge that the board reject  them.25 In past years, RGB justified  high6 
2 permanent increases in rent by citing  unusual3 temporary price surges reflected in the price  index4 of operating costs.	The truth is that current5 rents are already well above landlord  costs.6 Last year the board approved  a7 3 . 75 for one year and 7 . 25 for two- year leases.8 Because previous increases were much larger  than9 were warranted and the economy in New York  City10 still recovering from the nationwide recession,  the11 board should be enacting a rent freeze this  year.12 It is long past time to  abandon13 the price index.	The price index looks at14 increases and prices of items such as  fuel,15 insurance premiums, utilities and property taxes.16 But a price increase is only a spending increase  if17 the landlord continues to buy the item at the  same18 pace rather than cutting back on  services.19 Studies have shown that many20 landlords will cut back on services to save  money.21 More importantly, the price index does not  take22 into account the incomes of tenants.	And its data23 on landlord income and expenses is outdated by  the24 time the board makes its decision. Because it is  so25 one- sided, the price index isn' t capable of guiding2 
 2 our decision making fairly.3 Data from New York City  Department4 of Finance from recent rent estates  studies5 suggests that ownership of rent  stabilized6 buildings remains profitable.7 The 2012 Income and Expense study8 done by RGB shows that for the sixth  consecutive9 year, the net operating income of landlords  have10 increased.	The Rent Guidelines Board' s own report11 states that over the past seven years, 31 cents  of12 every dollar earned is -- is net operating  income13 for the owner.14 The average rent stabilized15 apartment generated $ 381 per month of net income in16 2010 .	Apartments in Manhattan are even more17 lucrative generating $ 568 per month on average in18 core Manhattan where my district is located.	This19 figure is astonishing so -- and is an astonishing 20	$ 789 .21 When you consider that a  great22 many eligible buildings in Manhattan have  been23 partially deregulated, the income generated by24 these properties must be astronomical.25 A study by State Comptroller,21 
2 Thomas Di Napoli, released in 2009 , showed that3 between 2003 and 2008 , New York City lost 170 , 5424 apartments renting for less than $ 1 , 000 .	The share5 of rental apartments that rented for less  than6 $ 1 , 000 per month declined from 62 percent in 20027 to 53 percent in 2008 .8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Please wrap up.9 MR. JOHANSSON:	Sure thing.10 The Rent Guidelines Board reports11 on -- on changes in the rent stabilized  housing12 stock shows that the City continues to lose  an13 average of 6 , 000 stabilized apartments every year,14 having lost almost an additional 19 , 000 since 200915 and over 70 , 000 in the past ten years.16 I will end with a just one  last17 paragraph.18 I am alarmed by the board' s19 apparent lack of understanding of our concern  for20 the dire straits of many rent stabilized  tenants,21 particularly in these difficult economic times.22 Tenants in rent stabilized apartments are  paying23 more and more of their income for housing.  The24 needs and concerns of tenants, especially  low25 income tenants, are fundamental to the health  of2 
2 New York' s housing market and safe affordable3 housing is the foundation of those  concerns.4 New Yorkers already pay an5 excessive and growing percentage of their  income6 for rent, much more than the rest of the  country.7 It hurts tenants and the City.8 I urge the board to vote  against9 these unjustified rent increases.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.11 MR.

With an NOI of about $ 250 a month25 per apartment in the Bronx, 31 cents of that on   a21

2 so about 40 or $ 45 , 000 a year that landlord makes.3 It' s just math.4 ( Audience participation.)5 MR. JOHANSSON:	Okay.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	From7 our reports --8 MR. JOHANSSON:	Right.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- that the10 Assemblyman seems to want to throw at us to  scold11 us --12 MR.

Please allow the others to9 speak.10 Judith Calamandre;11 Who will be followed by  Maxine12 Zeifman;13 Who will be followed by Joan  Roth.14 Again, the last -- the  current15 speaker will be Judith Calamandre;16 Followed by Maxine Zeifman;17 Who will be followed by Joan  Roth.18 Go right ahead.19 MS. CALAMANDRE:	My name is20 Judith Calamandre.	I' m a very long- time resident21 of the west side.22 I think that apart from all  kinds23 of nitty gritty things that I could say, is  that24 please consider -- remember that for the last  two25 to three years there have been no increases  in2 
2 Social Security because they -- Social  Security3 board considered there was no inflation  and,4 therefore, no necessity to do the -- what do   they5 call it, the cost of  living increase.	No.6 However, those of us in  rent7 controlled apartments every single year got8 seven- and- a- half percent increase even though there9 was no increase in Social Security benefits  because10 it was considered there was  no inflation.	How can11 the Rent Guidelines Board knowing that  even12 continual -- evidently until infinity  this13 seven- and- a- half percent every year.14 The -- it goes without saying  that15 does not include the heating -- what it is  heating16 and hot water surcharge and the $ 4 that my  mammoth17 and I dare say, wealthy landlord corporation  has18 charged now -- $ 4 to let rent controlled tenants19 know what their electricity bill is.20 So that' s my point.	Is there21 inflation now that necessitates landlords  receiving22 a seven- and- a- half percent increase every year?23 And when my rent stabilized24 apartments above me and below me with the  same25 apartment footprint receive whatever rent2 
2 stabilized people receive for a one or two- year3 lease, why is my apartment, same footprint,  worth4 seven- and- a- half percent more in the same footprint5 one above and one below?	When will rent control6 end?7 I mean, is it going to be $ 10 , 000 ?8 Can I get out of it?	I mean, my rent.	I don' t get9 any answers.	I call DHCR.	They once -- when I  had10 a complicated question, told me I had to hire   a11 lawyer.	I mean, it' s like talking to the wall.	I12 mean it just goes on  and on.	I just get the answer13 that this was to fix in the seventh -- in the  1960 s14 or ' 70 s.	I mean is this in  perpetuity?15 Why is there a DHCR?	Why -- I16 mean none of this make sense.	It sounds to me what17 I used to read about like the old Soviet  system.18 Well, this is the law.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	We don' t have an20 answer for you.21 MS. CALAMANDRE:	Well, who does?22 Who does?	Tell me.	Does rent control ever end?23 I mean, is it always going to be seven- and- a- half24 percent a year?25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	As it currently2 

2	is, yes.34
MS. CALAMANDRE:	Beg pardon? CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:		Up to that max.
5 It doesn' t have to be seven- and- a- half percent.6 MS. CALAMANDRE:	No, but it always7 is.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	That' s the max.9 MS. CALAMANDRE:	That --10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	We -- we hear11 this many times from rent controlled tenants  who12 say they wish they could come under the  stabilized13 guidelines --14 MS. CALAMANDRE:	You' re right.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	-- and the16 stabilized tenants who don' t want the guidelines.17 But, yeah, the seven- and- a- half --18 it can be very onerous.	We know that.19 MS. CALAMANDRE:	Yes.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You should catch21 up with Assemblyman Gottfried' s person.	It' s State22 legislation.	It' s not us.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, the24 legislation passed the house to have  --25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Oh, I know.5

ZEIFMAN:	Yes, but I -- I' m9 Maxine Zeifman and good afternoon.10 You do -- it does apply to  you11 because it is that same landlord who is taking  that12 rent controlled rent.	I have -- I am in a   rent13 stabilized apartment. There are only 67  apartments,14 upper east side.	There are only 11 left.15 Everything else has been bought or is at -- is   at16 market value.17 The rent controlled tenants are18 paying that same landlord -- they' re paying 50019 times what they pay.	I' m paying just under 40020 times.	I started at $ 700 , 29 -- 39 years later,21 I' m at $ 2 , 520 .	My neighbor who' s rent controlled22 in the same apartment is paying that  landlord23 $ 3 , 300 plus heat pass along.24 So those landlords, those big25 landlords are not having any problem.	They have2 
2 their whole buildings back, practically, because  I3 know from my neighbors.	I' m in the 97 th Street Y4 in a senior program.	I' m a retired psycho5 therapist, psychoanalyst.	I know how much --  how6 the middle class is struggling.7 You see this is an issue for  you8 for the welfare, the welfare, your safeguard  --9 guarders of the welfare of the City which is  a10 metropolis.	It' s a center for science.	It' s a11 center for academia.	It' s a center for -- for the12 arts; every one of the arts, dance, the  theater.13 Everything that' s here.14 You' re responsible in this time of15 recession where you have people that the  whole16 stability of the country is at risk with  this17 recession.	There are our children who are18 graduating from graduate schools in the19 international affairs, they can' t get jobs.20 The country is at risk and  housing21 as you' re here to -- to safeguard the City  and22 safeguard this country because the City is  very23 important for this country.	Europe is going into24 recession.	The Times today is saying with  this25 paralyzed Congress, we' re going to -- it' s going to2 

2	slip further.3
You' re responsible.	You' re
4 responsible for the welfare of  this City.	And5 there should be no increases.	There shouldn' t have6 been increases throughout this recession because7 the landlords are to New York what oil is to   Texas.8 They' re extraordinarily rich.9 It isn' t this complicated.	Yes,10 we have to give them the little  ones help.	The11 rest of them don' t need help.	They' re buying12 Congress.	They' re buying the New York,- our13 Senate.	Because I' ve helped elect 13 Democratic14 Senators in 2008 .	I worked 13 years to elect  them.15 Robert Beller came in with $ 50 , 00016 to the Republican Senate campaign and just  bought17 it back.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Zeifman,19 please wrap up.20 MS. ZEIFMAN:	So the whole --21 we' re dependent on you to safeguard this City and22 this country.23 ( Applause.)24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25 Joan Roth.4

And when I was young, I really thought  that11 way too.	But, you know, you just never know  that12 you may reap what you  sow.13 ( Applause.)14 MS.

I can tell18 you, I' m turning 70 and that' s a major different19 way of thinking.20 So I' m sorry that you can' t look21 at us with respect but I just want to say one   thing22 about the woman who just spoke before me  --23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I' m going to24 start -- I' m going to start your time.25 MS. ROTH:	She' s not -- okay.2 
2 She' s a great psychiatrist who did -- has so  much3 academic accomplishments and has helped so  many4 people and has changed the world and some of  these5 teachers who taught maybe you and your children  and6 you have no respect for  us.7 Because you -- what are you  going8 to do with us?	Throw us on the street.	I mean,9 where are we all going to go?	What is going to10 happen?	I myself, you got rid of half  of me.	My11 children don' t live here.	My grandchildren don' t12 live here and they' re outstanding people.13 My daughter was just honored by14 the City she lives in for helping to make it   be15 such a great city and in her speech she said,   I16 didn' t learn to be just someone who makes money,  I17 learned to be a person who cares about people  to18 help build a better civil society by my  mother.19 Okay.	And -- and she' s been20 written up a lot too.	And my granddaughters are21 graduating with honors.	But they' re not coming22 back here.	They' re not living in New York.	These23 are the -- and everybody who they went to  school24 with.	None of them live here.	None of these25 smart, fabulous young people are -- the only  people2 
2 -- young people that are here,  are rich.	This is a3 City for the rich.4 It' s a City that you came up with5 and then got rich.	So I don' t know why you' re not6 offering the next generation -- and the  other7 people, the respect -- and my situation is I --   I8 live in a rent stabilized building at 215 East  80 th9 Street, where Mr. Maloney testified, and  our10 landlord who made $ 40 million -- and the poor  thing11 and I know it' s really tragic.12 Just in our building alone, he13 does not give any services to  rental tenants.	He14 -- he' s on the board, yes, he only owns  4015 apartments.	But he' s still got the tax abatements.16 He has J 51 tax abatement from my apartment and  they17 -- and I get no  services.18 As a matter of fact, I was  begging19 him to come up and fix the water which nobody  did.20 And so I had a huge flood in my apartment and I    now21 live in my rental -- in my apartment with no   water,22 mold and my rent was increased since my  husband23 died, which was only a year ago, a year- and- a- half24 maybe, over $ 500 .	It' s going up again in February25 because of the MCIs because it' s gone up so  much2 
2 that every six months they can only increase  on3 MCIs.4 And I don' t have any -- I' m living5 like what?	Why?	Why should a person like me   --6 I' m really a person who contributed a great deal  to7 this society then and now.	Why should we have to8 listen to this gibberish and see us --  everything9 that we worked for ruined, taken away?	Have no10 home.	It' s tragic and so I don' t ask you to walk11 the neighborhoods.	I ask you to search your  souls.12 I ask you for once -- we need  --13 New York is the greatest City and you all  came14 under it.	It' s -- it was a fantastic place.	It15 was a place for civil society and for humanity  and16 for people.17 And you know what, a lot of  people18 still got rich and a lot of people  lived well.	And19 then there were people who were -- people I   know20 like in the Yiddish theater they had to live  in21 rent stabilized apartments but they gave  such22 pleasure to other people.	We wouldn' t have the23 richness.	Richness is not just in  dollars.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25 ( Applause.)2

CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	JonathanA VOICE:	Not here. CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Not here?Michael Gillette;Who will be followed by  ArleneWho will be followed by  RichardMR. GILLETTE:	Good afternoon,I' ve come down here today to
14 discuss this important matter.	I live in an15 eight- unit rent stabilized apartment building in16 Sunset Park, Brooklyn.17 I' m also a member of a certain18 community enrichment organizations in my19 neighborhood and I' m also an employee of the City20 of New York, specifically, the Health and  Hospitals21 Corporation.22 I wanted to discuss the  onerous23 impact of proposed rent increases, especially  for24 young adults like myself who are trying to  self25 finance higher education.14 
2 My building, specifically, has3 been -- had a change in ownership since 2008 and   in4 those four years, my new landlord has pursued  four5 -- three individual MCI rent increases.	The --6 these have been submitted not fraudulently,  but7 negligently because in one line item was  an8 exterior restoration.	However, the exterior is9 just as disheveled as it was before and the  work10 was done.11 Also, the MCI rent increases  have12 resulted in residual income that is extended  beyond13 the -- the expenditures that they spent on  the14 particular increases themselves or the  improvements15 thereof.16 I would also like to say that I  am17 not eligible for SCRIE or DRIE so with  limited18 resources, basically, working paycheck to paycheck,19 another rent increase is going to be  particularly20 hard for me.	I have signed a new rent -- a   new21 lease as of this August.	I' m going to be looking22 at $ 100 increase.23 As of then, I don' t really know24 where that money' s going to come from.	I' m25 thinking, am I going to have to  curtain2 
2 contributions to my 403 B or make other hardship --3 hard choices such as that just to make ends  meet.4 The landlords seem to be  doing5 well.	It seems that they' re net operating income6 has increased for the sixth  straight year.	In the7 Borough of Brooklyn, alone, average -- average  NOI8 has been a total of $ 299 per each rent  stabilized9 apartment.10 There was a rent tenant  downstairs11 who moved out because they are faced with MCI  rent12 increase which the DCHR has approved.	And there is13 a large cart outside of our building because  the14 landlord is now stripping and gutting  that15 apartment.	They stand to make a  considerable16 increase upon new tenancy.17 So with that being said, I18 strongly implore you to consider a zero  percent19 increase for rent stabilized tenants.	Please keep20 in mind working young adults who have  limited21 resources and are trying to improve their  lives22 otherwise.23 And, also, to keep in mind  that24 the sanctity of New York lies in its diversity  and25 people are being faced with being priced  out.2 
2 Thank you.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.4 ( Applause.)5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Arlene Geiger.6 MS. GEIGER:	Yeah, my name is7 Arlene Geiger.	I' m just speaking for myself8 although I' ve worked with Met Council and tenants9 and neighbors - a lot of people for many   years.10 I am a rent stabilized tenant.  I11 live on the upper west side.	My landlord is a12 very, very wealthy man who owns a number of  very13 large apartments which he didn' t work hard for.	He14 inherited.15 I lived on the upper west  side16 since 1970 , in my building since 1976 .	I' ve been a17 contributing member of the neighborhood and  the18 upper west side is the only home that I' ve  known19 all of my adult life.20 I -- I' ve been teaching at John21 Jay College.	I' m an adjunct instructor.	And for22 the last 15 years that' s been my only source  of23 income.	My -- my income, that' s my salary from24 John Jay, teaching three courses every semester  and25 one over the summer. Although considered part- time,2 
2 I teach one course less than full- time faculty.3 My increases have gone up4 considerably less than the increases from  the5 guideline -- Rent Guidelines increases and the  MCIs6 so that at this point my income, which is my   only7 source of income, is about 45 percent of my  rent.8 What I' m afraid of is, as the9 years go by, if this continues I, like friends  of10 mine, who' ve spent all of their adult life in  the11 neighborhood and they are an important part of  what12 made the upper west side what it is, will be   forced13 to, basically, live -- leave the only home  that14 they' ve known, the only neighborhood they' ve known,15 as we get older.16 So I -- I really plead with you  to17 recognize what these rent increases do along  with18 the MCIs that at this point are permanent  and19 really should not be -- what it does to   people20 who' ve made an investment, not a financial21 investment, but an investment of blood, sweat  and22 tears and commitment to our neighborhood and  the23 stability of our neighborhood and of what makes,  in24 my case, the upper west side, the upper west  side.25 And it' s really the middle -- when2 
2 I look at my building, we went -- it went   condo;3 right.	So that, actually, destabilized our4 building with lots and lots of apartments were  held5 -- that we' ve had more turnover since that than  we6 had before that because the rent stabilized  tenants7 and the rent controlled tenants in our  building8 have been the stability -- not those who are  doing9 flips and whatnot and the -- investment bankers  who10 are moving in.11 So thank you.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 ( Applause.)14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Richard Barr.15 MR. BARR:	Good afternoon.16 My name' s Richard Barr and I -- my17 rent increases are subject to the decisions of  the18 Rent Guidelines Board. And moved into the  building19 I' m in 35 years ago and my rent is  currently20 three- and- a- half times what it was then.	So it21 doesn' t seem like a 350 percent increase over 3522 years means that the landlord is not getting  his23 heat and electricity increases.	It seems like it' s24 more than keeping pace.25 I want to say that I feel that  to2 
2 have a board like this entirely appointed by  the3 Mayor, by one person, is really not  what4 representative democracy should be about.5 ( Applause.)6 MR. BARR:	In the case -- in  the7 current case, you have as the Mayor, a man  who8 feels that there' s money in the City budget to9 subsidize wealthy developers with high end10 developments, Atlantic Yards, Willets Point,  the11 tennis stadium expansion, the Highline, but doesn' t12 think there' s money in the budget to continue the13 Advantage Program keeping people out of  shelters14 and in apartments or day care and after  school15 programs for the poor so that people can work  and16 their kids can be taken care  of.17 This should be -- this  board18 should be appointed by, not just the Mayor, but  the19 City Council, by the public advocate, by  the20 Comptroller, by the Borough Presidents and then  you21 would have a variety of  opinions.22 ( Applause.)23 MR. BARR:	As it is, every year24 it' s always the same outcome no matter what the25 tenants say, no matter what they suggest, no  matter2 
2 how they implore you, entreat you, beg, it' s always3 like a certain range is always floated and it' s4 always reduced by a predictable amount so  that5 nothing that goes on here makes any  difference.6 And as a result, look -- look how few people   are7 around.	They' re just tired of getting up and8 speaking and looking out, I' m sorry to say, at  what9 looks like an oil painting.10 ( Laughter.)11 MR. BARR:	It' s the same thing12 where he appoints everybody to the panel  for13 educational policy, parents, students --  teachers14 come and they beg and they speak and the outcome  is15 always a done deal.	It' s always decided before16 anyone walks into the room.	And it' s not how it17 should be.18 Every year I -- every time I' ve19 come, I' ve said there shouldn' t be a one size fits20 all, the lobbyists always sit here, they bring  in21 the owners who have a few buildings and are  not22 making money and they' re the ones who testify.	Let23 them get the increase so that they' re not losing24 money and that they can feed their  family.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Wrap up, Mr.2

Alexandra Espinosa.24 MS. ESPINOSA:	Good afternoon,25 Chairman and members of the  board.4 
2 My name is Alexandra Espinosa and3 I work for Catholic Migration Services.	I' m an4 intern there in their immigrant advocacy  project.5 Every day I meet and work  with6 families that are barely getting by.	These people7 are New York' s working class.	I might not be8 describing everybody here but a little bit  of9 empathy and you can help see  their world.	They' re10 diligent and they fight.	They fight every day to11 keep their families together, from hunger to  keep12 them united and safe.13 The consequences of yet another14 rent increase may seem minute for the million  --15 for some here.	But for the millions of New  Yorkers16 that are in this class, the rent increases are  a17 challenge for their livelihood, their way of  life.18 Not only will many face  evictions19 and hunger but being evicted their families will  be20 torn and I ask you, how will the City handle   an21 increase in homeless families and what about  our22 seniors?23 Will there be an expansion  of24 Section 8 or of shelters?	Visualize this.	What25 would happen to these families torn by politics  and2 
2 by greed.	Here' s what I ask you today.	Heed our3 warning.	All of us.	Use just a little bit  of4 empathy and no more rent increases.5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.6 ( Applause.)7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	As of right now8 we have gone through the list  of speakers.

Let' s18 come back into session.19 We have two speakers.20 Our first speaker, honoring us21 again, Councilmember Gale Brewer.22 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	Thank you23 very much.24 I am Gale Brewer and I  represent25 the Sixth Council District and the residents of  the17 
2 upper west side and Northern Clinton.3 I thank the Chairman and the  board4 and the staff for the opportunity to testify  today5 and to voice my concern for the potential  impact6 that a rent increase would have on businesses  that7 rely on low and middle income workers as well as   on8 families and I worry about individuals on  fixed9 incomes.10 And I' m here today, like others, I11 am sure, to request that the members of the  Rent12 Guidelines Board freeze increases for all  regulated13 rental units, including Class A hotels, single  room14 occupancy buildings and the rooming houses.15 You know better than I that  the16 2011 Housing and Vacancy Survey points out that  the17 rent regulated units are the number one source  of18 housing for low income families.	About two in five19 of the City' s 1 . 1 million low income households20 will be impacted by the rent increases if they  come21 forward, voted on by the board today or this  week.22 The Housing Vacancy Survey shows23 that there are 987 , 840 rent stabilized housing24 units and a little over 38 , 000 rent controlled in25 our City.	The protection for stabilized apartments2 
2 in buildings of six or more units built  between3 1947 and the end of 1973 and those apartments  whose4 owner received tax breaks, these apartments  protect5 millions of City residents whose lives, and that  of6 their children, are significantly harmed by7 unreasonable rent increases.8 Rent control was initiated to  help9 support our returning veterans after World War  II.10 Now we are at the end of the longest period of   war11 in our nation' s history and, I believe, we have  a12 duty to preserve affordable housing for all  New13 Yorkers including the thousands of new  veterans14 returning to a dire economic  situation.15 I' m not going to talk about the16 issues that you' ve heard so many others, but just17 to point out that as we know in the last   year,18 we' ve lost over 11 , 000 units to market rate units19 -- market- rate rents.20 And I just want to talk a  little21 bit about the issue that, I think, I' ve mentioned22 several times, which is the issue of when you  have23 rent regulated in units in buildings that  already24 have co- ops, already have high rent units,25 institutions are in there, the City  sends2 
2 constituents, people who have AIDS and HIV and  have3 issues that they need to have addressed, to  the4 hotels.5 I know that over the years  the6 SROs have not gotten increases.	I hope that7 continues.	Anne Cunningham would kill me if  I8 didn' t mention that.	But the fact of the  matter9 is, that kind of proviso, I think, should  also10 exist in regular apartment buildings.11 I represent a large area.12 Manhattan is becoming, even from your  information,13 the very rich and the  very poor.	It seems to me14 that where there is a mixture of units, co- op,15 market, in some cases institutional, colleges  are16 taking some of the units, I' m hoping if it' s a17 hotel, it' s legal, who knows.	We' re trying to make18 sure it is.	These are mixed buildings.19 The rent stabilized and the rent20 controlled are in these buildings, even in  the21 brownstones.	I do not understand why those  owners22 need an increase on any measure of the  revenue.23 I just want to mention  the24 Advantage Program.	That is not your problem.	It25 didn' t start with you. But as we know, as we  speak,2 
2 there are 18 , 000 people in 6 , 000 households who3 received a rent subsidy as of February  2010 .	As we4 speak today, 500 of them, 300 of them are  children,5 are back in the shelter system.	The State did not6 and the City did not come by with their portion  of7 the rent.	I think you know the  story.8 But I mention that because here' s9 another group of people that we, as a   society,10 should be figuring out if there' s no money for11 Advantage, what can we do to make sure  these12 families are housed?	I spoke to a woman  yesterday,13 four kids. She could not -- she could pay the   rent14 but she had a bad  rent history.	And so she15 couldn' t move out to another unit because the16 Advantage portion wasn' t paid.	She paid her17 portion and she ended up in a shelter when I   spoke18 to her yesterday at 4 : 00 with the four children.19 Rent Guidelines Board sets the20 rent increases.	If you do it all, but I do  think21 that we should be considering how we can  keep22 families in the homes that they have and  rent23 control and rent stabilized didn' t start out as24 being the subsidy program for the City of New  York25 but it has ended up being a place where people   can2 
2 find affordable housing and I' m not a believer in3 means testing.4 I promise you the people who  are5 in rent regulated apartments are  not rich.	You can6 find two or three people  like that.	I know almost7 all of them in my neighborhood.	Believe me, they8 are not wealthy.9 And I know, also, that the  Furman10 Center just put out an excellent report on  property11 taxes.	We do need to look at the Class 2 s and 3 s12 and 4 s and how it impacts Class 1 s, which are the13 homeowner.	I' m a homeowner.	I know exactly how14 much I pay on my brownstone for  taxes.15 But, I also believe, again,  back16 to this issue of the rental buildings, which  are17 Class 2 , and co- ops and condos, there is such a18 mixture of the rent regulated in these  buildings19 that I do not think the numbers that you' re  given20 by the owners in terms of the revenue that  they21 need is real.22 And I just want to close  by23 saying, please make sure that the single  room24 occupancy proviso is continued.	It' s incredibly25 important.	This is a group of people, not many  in2 
2 terms of number, but they pay over their -- over  503 percent of their rent -- of their income for  rent.4 So I just want to close by  saying5 the seniors, vulnerable families and millions  of6 working and middle class New Yorkers who live  in7 rent regulated units are not strangers in  our8 midst.	They are the backbone of our  communities9 and this city.10 And, particularly, I want to  add11 the Mitchell Lamas.	It is very unfortunate that12 they were able to be bought out because I   promise13 you, those families are the backbone of  our14 communities, bar none.	Every single Mitchell Lama15 family was -- is the backbone of a community  and16 when they' re bought out it becomes a transient17 unit, students, people who are here for a  small18 period of time and then they move on and that  turns19 over and turns over and turns over.	Those units20 were not built to be luxury.	It is not community21 building or civic participation.22 So your first, in my opinion,  and23 most important agenda, should be the protection  of24 these New Yorkers and the maintenance of  policies25 that permit them to live affordably and  to2 
2 contribute to the human and creative wealth of  our3 City.	This wealth is one that the board and all  of4 us should be primarily concerned with.	For this5 reason and the many others that I' ve cited in  my6 testimony, I urge the Rent Guidelines Board to  vote7 against increasing all rents.8 Thank you very much.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,10 Councilmember.11 ( Applause.)12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Any questions?13 MS. ADAMS:	I have one.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Adams.15 Councilmember, question.16 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you very much17 for your testimony today.18 Some members on this board get19 very frustrated with elected officials, of the  ones20 who come and testify and say zero increase and  you21 don' t hear anything from them about housing until22 the following year.23 You are not one of them.	You are24 an exception and we' re aware of what you do  all25 year long.2 
2 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	Thank you.3 MS. ADAMS:	We were, also, very4 disappointed though when the legislation under5 which we operate was up for consideration in  Albany6 last year --7 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	Um- hum.8 MS. ADAMS:	-- and there is9 nothing to make us believe that any of the  real10 concerns about making this a more workable law  was11 even under consideration.	As far as I know,  two12 major changes were made and that was in  the13 household income which could go up to $ 2 , 000 --14 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	For the15 vacancy decontrol.16 MS. ADAMS:	Exactly.	But17 recommendations had been made by many with  regard18 to the appointment of the board, what its  powers19 are to be, enforcement in New York City and all   of20 that.	We heard nothing of that during  the21 discussion in Albany.22 So I' d just like to know, do you23 have any thoughts about where we might go  from24 here?	We have a situation in New York that we' re25 all concerned about.	It seems very hard to bring2 
2 us together to decide what to do  about it.	But if3 you just step back for a moment and tell us   what4 you think might work in the  longer run.	It' s not5 going to happen this year, I know.	I know it' s not6 going to happen until after the elections, but  just7 share a few of your thoughts with us,  please.8 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	I' ll try.9 I do think that the City  Council,10 no matter who' s in it, will be more responsible11 than one might think in terms of thinking about  the12 future of housing.	That' s -- I know that there' s a13 big push by owners to keep everything in Albany  so14 that the State Senate can rule on it or  not.15 I do think, however, that it' s a16 City issue.	It is very complicated housing and  it17 needs to have the kind of research that the  Rent18 Guidelines Board staff does, that the Furman  Center19 does.	I' ve read all those reports in preparation20 for today and, I think, if there was that kind   of21 guideline and guidance that first that should  go22 away and that there should be a local  decision23 making process.	It could be worked out as to  what24 that is, number one.	It is not -- it makes  no25 sense for me to have these decisions made  in2 

2	Albany.3
I can tell you from my  colleagues
4 in the Council, and it' s not going to change  that5 much, I don' t care -- it' s just the nature of the6 51 members.7 MS. ADAMS:	Right.8 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	You' ve got9 conservative.	You' ve got progressive.	You' ve got10 brilliant and you' ve got idiots.11 MS. ADAMS:	Well, that' s what we12 got.13 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	I know them14 all.	It' s not going to change.15 But the fact of the matter is  you16 have a balance, you put into it some controls as   to17 how the legislation is created, perhaps  because18 it' s such a volatile issue, but it should be  local.19 It should be in New York, number  one.20 Number two, when I  mentioned21 businesses to start off -- artists and  businesses22 are not going to have any workers coming from  the23 City of New York, particularly, from  Manhattan.24 And the artists have to be Manhattan to a   large25 extent.	You cannot have people running from  Staten4 
2 Island and Brooklyn and Westchester to be an  usher3 or to be an understudy  on Broadway.	And we' re all4 about the arts.5 So the whole issue of the  arts,6 you can' t be an artist coming into New York  City7 from Iowa and expect somebody to pay five, $ 10 , 0008 a month for an apartment.	And I do think this  --9 so that' s number one.	You absolutely, for the10 future of New York, you need affordable  housing.11 That does come in -- there isn' t12 -- you can' t do it on a means test in a way  that13 you might do it for a Section  8 situation.	It14 doesn' t lend itself to that.15 Number three, the issue of  new16 housing that' s affordable.	It has to be permanent17 because what I' m finding is -- I' ve been around for18 a long time.	I' ve been in this world since John19 Lindsey, when I worked for  John Lindsey.	All of20 the 80 / 20 ' s come due.	The stabilization doesn' t21 last so you have to figure out something that' s22 permanently affordable.23 Finally, the Community Boards, the24 parent associations, they' re all made up of people25 who can afford to live there.	And you don' t have2 
2 what Robert Putnam of the Kennedy School  calls,3 civic participation if you don' t have middle class4 families.	The whole middle class family has  to5 exist.6 So, I think, that should be  our7 priority.	So we have to back  into it.	Okay.	If8 we want middle class families.	We want seniors.9 We want artists.	We want workers making 40 or  5010 or $ 70 , 000 a year.	How do we keep them in  our11 City?	And rather we look at some other  criteria,12 we don' t look at that one.	So that' s what I would13 -- you' re looking at it backwards in my opinion.14 It' s a tense situation between15 owners and tenants is horrendous.	So the question16 is how do we bring people together but it has to   be17 done locally.	It really can' t be done in Albany.18 And, believe me, some might -- some of  my19 colleagues, now and in the future, would look  at20 this in a very realistic practical way, not  as21 people would think, just for tenants.	That' s not22 how they think, believe me.23 MS. ADAMS:	That' s very24 encouraging.25 Thank you so much.2

COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	Thank youCHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Cheigh.Mr. Schleider.MS. HOLDER:	Thank you for
7 everything you do, Councilwoman.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Oh, I' m sorry,9 Ms. Holder.10 MS. HOLDER:	Go ahead.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I' m sorry.	Mr.12 Schleider.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you,14 Councilmember.15 Just help me frame this  next16 question or two.	The City budget is how  large?17 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	Sixty- eight18 billion.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Sixty- eight20 billion.	Okay.	All right.21 I brought this up to  Scott22 Stringer a few years ago.	It seems that the23 housing crisis, especially relating to the  rent24 stabilized tenants, could be significantly abated25 if even a percent of the City budget  were7 
2 reallocated -- a percent off of each apartment,  a3 percent off of each outlay that the City  puts4 through and just put it towards rent  stabilized5 housing.	One percent of $ 68 billion is an awful6 lot of money.	It' s an awful lot of rent increase7 subsidy.	It' s an awful lot of rent subsidy.8 In fact, out of that one  percent,9 I' m sure you could find enough to fund a $ 6 million10 for your 500 families that came out of the  program11 that you referenced earlier.12 Has the Council given any thought13 to the economics of the City budget and how  to14 better reallocate resources to help the backbone  of15 society?16 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	Well,17 you' re going to laugh when you hear this.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I doubt it.19 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	No, you20 will.	I mean, it is so frustrating  for me.	We21 deal with -- I don' t know, not even a  billion22 dollars between the Council and the Mayor.	We23 spend months debating less than a billion for  after24 school, et cetera.25 I think you' ve heard the list, the2 
2 libraries, a million times in the  press.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Um- hum.4 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	The issue5 of housing is intricately tied into Albany, as  you6 know.	So if we were to take -- I think  this7 discussion would be well worth having.	One of the8 issues would be though we can' t create rent9 stabilization.	We can' t create a lot of the10 housing programs.	We can do housing abatements.11 That we can do.12 But the question is, if you' re13 going to create these programs, they are often  tied14 into Albany.15 I do think, to answer  your16 question, that if it was a New York City  decision,17 some of your suggestions might be ones that  we18 could consider.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, it seems20 that --21 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	Because22 the only way to do it is  an abatement.	In other23 words, you could -- you could do a different  kind24 of abatement.	Some of which have to go  through25 Albany and some of which we can do locally  if2 
2 they' re tied into the property tax.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	It would seem to4 me that with the collective wisdom  --5 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	Um- hum.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- and maybe you7 can laugh at that on the City Council  --8 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	No, no,9 but -- well --10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- that there11 should be a work around.12 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	No, I hear13 you.	I mean, I think, also, where would you   site14 these?	Let me -- if I was in charge, thank  God15 from your perspective, I' m not, I would make every16 owner that' s developing a building put in something17 affordable, maybe with or without the --  the18 abatement.19 I will tell you that when you' re20 marketing, I' m just -- I' m being honest with you21 now.	A lot of owners don' t want low income or   even22 middle income people in their building.	I' ve heard23 them say this.	Because it doesn' t market well.24 So we have to change the  whole25 sensitivity of how we look at  housing.2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I think if you3 speak with the developers at the 80 / 20 housing, I4 don' t think you' ll get that type of response.5 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	Correct.6 Correct.7 Although -- although having8 negotiated a lot of these deals, what developers  do9 - Trump did not, to his credit, but others do   -10 they put all the 20 percent in one section of   the11 building.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, they can' t13 do that.	They haven' t been able to do that in 2014 years.15 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	We can talk16 afterwards.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	They can keep --18 they can keep them below a certain  floor.19 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	Okay.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	In21 other words, you can' t use the top third22 necessarily.23 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	Right.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But certainly25 within the building itself and the type of  unit2 
2 itself, it is a case of  distribution.3 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	If you' re4 building a lot of buildings, you can  --5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	HFA is very6 concerned about that.7 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	Okay.8 Well, we should talk about it.	We got a building9 that that' s happening in.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well --11 COUNCILMEMBER BREWER:	But the12 point is, I think, we need to think of how   to13 integrate buildings as you suggest.	I have no14 problem using City money.	I think we have to15 figure out how it logistically works.	It' s not an16 easy agenda.17 MS. ADAMS:	Okay.	Thank you.18 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.20 ( Applause.)21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Jeff Gerstel.22 MR. GERSTEL: Hello and thank you23 for having me.24 I am a very small building  owner25 and I have to say that I do agree, in   some2 
2 respects, to the speaker before me.3 I own one building.	It' s six4 families and all of the occupants in that  building5 are artists.	They work in the theater in New  York6 City.7 My wife and I have been  residents8 of New York for most of  our lives.	I returned from9 the Navy about 35 years ago.	I became a teacher in10 New York and after moving from one -- I would   say11 difficult neighborhood to another, from one  bad12 landlord to another, in many stabilized  buildings,13 we wanted to raise a family so we chose  a14 neighborhood in Brooklyn which was a little  less15 dangerous than the one we came  from.16 We bought the building because the17 landlord was more than happy to get out of  this18 particular neighborhood and he made it possible  for19 me as a teacher to buy the  building.20 I guess I would say my main  point21 is, is that we bought this building with the  hopes22 of raising our family in it and with the hopes  of23 doing better than some of the places that we  had24 previously lived in.	We hoped to upgrade the25 building.	We hoped to make it a more  pleasant2 
2 place for all the people there to live  in.3 The problem for us has come up  is4 that, although we do get rents from  every5 apartment, the rents have not kept pace with -- I' m6 sure you' ve heard this many times, with the rise in7 expenses.8 Not only the rise in taxes and  in9 the rise in utilities, but, also, what we' ve needed10 over the years to keep a building that' s 100  years11 old viable.12 Right now, as I said, all of  our13 tenants are in the arts and our expenses,  including14 our taxes are -- much higher than the rent  roll.15 Actually, the rent roll does not even cover the  New16 York City taxes that we  have.17 So when I hear that people in  the18 arts need people -- need places to live,  viable19 places to live, I feel that we provide that  but20 that also we need an increase in order to just   keep21 our place functioning.22 I see my time is  up.23 I thank you for having me  today.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25 ( Applause.)2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Richard Thorne.3 MR. THORNE:	Thank you.4 I, as the previous speaker  just5 mentioned, I own a townhouse  in Manhattan.	It' s a6 single four- family property.	The other three7 tenants in the apartment, besides where we  live,8 are all rent stabilized.9 And my only issue is that  when10 you' re a single owner of a building that has  three11 rent stabilized tenants in it, you' re not a large12 landlord that has the ability -- you might  have13 two, three -- 400 units and maybe 10 , 15 percent  of14 them are rent controlled or rent stabilized, to  mix15 the pot and come out with a number on   average16 units.17 We don' t have that to average18 against so you really start subsidizing. And  one19 would maybe hope that while we' re looking at rent20 increases overall or not, that maybe there is a   new21 classification of owner who is struggling to  pay22 their taxes and keep the building because I' m not23 going to live in a dumpy  building.24 And then you still have the  issue25 of saying, oh, three percent or three percent  on2 
2 that $ 800 a month lease is -- is, you know, $ 24 .3 It' s not going to change anything.4 But, also, more importantly, is5 the issue that -- and this is probably out of   the6 jurisdiction of this committee, I have one  rent7 stabilized tenant who' s in real estate.	Five8 blocks away he has a two- bedroom condominium that9 he rents for $ 5 , 000 a month.	And he comes and has10 -- he' s living in the building here where his11 rent' s $ 1 , 100 a month.	So he has somebody paying12 his rent and his condo fees, paying his  mortgage13 over there and spins off enough money that he' s14 living rent free at my  cost.15 And there should be some16 consideration moving forward, but it' s not going to17 happen in this session, that the people who  really18 are in need of rent stabilized apartments and  rent19 controlled apartments should be the people who  have20 them and not people, necessarily, who have  them21 through being lucky where they were at a  certain22 point in time and what they' ve been able to  beyond23 that.24 So net, net when you look at  this25 now, maybe they' ll be a new classification of2 
2 small, single- building landlords who have under3 five units that have all rent  stabilized4 apartments.	Maybe their increase should be in  a5 situation like that, if you say this year it' s6 two- and- a- half percent overall for one- year leases7 maybe it should be three or three- and- a- half8 percent -- another point up -- and  higher.9 And the same thing is just try  to10 settle the service costs -- fuel oil now is  more11 than gasoline and, I think, it' s really ridiculous12 besides everything else.13 So that was my point and I  thank14 you for hearing me.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.16 MR. THORNE:	Thank you. Enjoy17 your day because I understand it' s probably going18 to get more heated tonight.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	What -- what20 are the rents in your building for those  three21 units?22MR. THORNE:	One is $ 1 , 123 a23month.One is $ 923 a month and one is $ 1 , 200 a24month.25CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And how big are

2	those units?3
MR. THORNE:	The units are about
4 460 square feet.	They' re one- bedroom units and,5 you know, I maintain the building in an  excellent6 manner.	I carpet the halls and everything in  the7 building is pristine because I have to live  there.8 And so it' s just -- you have no9 way to recoup.	There' s not that large pool that I10 hear about larger landlords who own most of  the11 buildings, you know, to mix the pot with 80  percent12 fair market value rents, you know, 20  percent,13 maybe rent stabilized and another 10 are  rent14 controlled.	You still mix that pot.	It still gets15 closer to the overall fair market value than we  can16 achieve.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.18 MR. THORNE:	Thank you.19 Have a good day.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ameer Dirar.21 ( Applause.)22 MR. DIRAR:	Hello.	Good23 afternoon.24 I have a brownstone in Harlem.	We25 own it, me and my  father together.	And it just4 
2 seems a little unfair that we' re looking at getting3 no rent increases where expenses and everything  is4 going up.5 I have families who live in  my6 apartment that are growing.	They started off now,7 they have three kids, God bless them.	And they8 have a sister living with them and I' m paying  for9 all that water and nothing is getting cheaper in  my10 end and I' m struggling -- I' m definitely struggling11 to pay my taxes.12 I was struggling before to pay  my13 taxes with the low rents that we had and we' re,14 actually, behind on taxes.	Where I' m in a15 situation where I' m paying -- I did my tax deal  in16 August where they offered everybody a chance to  pay17 their -- their taxes in a  fair amount.	But still,18 I' m paying my taxes.	I' m paying my water and19 nothing' s changing but -- nothing' s changing.20 And it' s just -- it hard for me --21 it' s hard for me at this point to where I' m at a22 point where I have to, actually, have to  think23 about can I afford to keep this  building.24 I have neighbors next to me who  --25 who when the tax went up $ 6 , 000 and within three2 
2 years they' re definitely looking at moving out.3 People who have been in the neighborhood for  204 years -- because they can' t cope.5 That' s all -- that' s all I have to6 say.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes, Mr.10 Schleider.11 ( Applause.)12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Dirar.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Dirar,14 there' s a question for you.15 MR. DIRAR:	Yes.16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m sorry if I17 missed this, but how many units are in  your18 building?19 MR. DIRAR:	Six.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Six.	So when the21 water and sewer rates went up double digits in  the22 past few years and the real estate taxes have  gone23 up, you say you bought this building with  your24 father?25 MR. DIRAR:	Well, my father2 
2 bought it.	I own it with my father.	My father3 bought it in 1991 , worked on it.	And by the time4 it was ready to rent out, it was like about ' 93 .5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yeah.	Right.6 So -- and now you' re starting to7 struggle really because of the  --8 MR. DIRAR:	Yeah.9 MR. SCHLEIDER: -- the municipality10 is a new partner that you weren' t planning on.11 MR. DIRAR:	I mean, the taxes are12 just -- they just keep  going up.	Like my taxes13 just went up about like over six -- almost $ 7 , 00014 this year.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Um- hum.16 MR. DIRAR:	And my fear is that  if17 this trend keeps going on, and there' s no rent18 increases or, like I said, I have like families  --19 I don' t even know.	I' m a good landlord.	I take --20 I take care of all my tenants,  you know.	I mean, I21 give them preferential rent.	I don' t even charge22 them the legal amount it is because to me  it' s23 better to have a good tenant that pays on time   --24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right.25 MR. DIRAR:	-- then charging2 
2 something they can' t afford.	But at the same time,3 something has to be fair.4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right.5 MR. DIRAR:	I' m not talking about6 like, you know, crazy amount of percentage  but7 something that' s fair.	You -- just -- just --8 because you know that little amount, that  extra9 $ 100 here, whatever.	That makes a difference.10 That really does make a difference,  especially11 living neck to neck.12 And I' ve got a family.	He' s13 recently got married and I' m trying to cover the14 whole family.	But I' m just -- it' s neck above15 water.	You know, somebody calls, says they  have16 bedbugs.	I don' t question it.	I automatically go17 take care of it.	I pay the $ 475 and guess what,18 that -- that extra $ 100 I could have got, you  know,19 that makes a difference.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Sure.21 Thank you.22 MR. DIRAR:	You' re welcome, sir.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.24 Is there anyone in the room  at25 this point who has not registered to  speak?2 
2 We' ve run through our list.	We3 will take another 20 minute break.	We' ve run out4 of speakers.5 We will be here till  registration6 closes at 6 : 00 p. m.	So come back.7	( Recess 4 : 21 - 4 : 58 p. m.)8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	Let' s9 come back into session.10 The following speaker, Sara11Valenzuela, representing Borough PresidentScott12Stringer.13MS. VALENZUELA:	Hello.My name14is Sara Valenzuela.	I am the GovernmentalAffairs15Liaison for Scott Stringer.16 Good evening, Chairman Kimmel and17 members of the Rent Guidelines Board.18 Thank you so much for  the19 opportunity to testify at this public  hearing.20 Each year as the Rent  Guidelines21 Board progresses through its annual routine,22 tenants and landlords put forth their best  effort23 to influence the five public members of the  board24 whose votes are not, in theory,  predetermined.25 This year has been no  exception.16 
2 However, there is one particular3 odious publicity campaign that merits scrutiny  in4 order to set the record straight.	By now members5 of the Rent Guidelines Board have undoubtedly  seen6 the television commercials that attempt to  portray7 the benefits of rent regulations as a perk  enjoyed8 exclusively by the constituents of  Manhattan.9 For those of you that may  have10 missed the shameful advertising campaigns which11 pits New Yorkers against fellow New Yorkers,  allow12 me to begin my testimony by debunking  the13 inaccuracies presented in these dubious  television14 ads.15 The common refrain in these16 advertisements is that rent regulations are  in17 place only to benefit wealthy Manhattan  renters,18 insinuation that those constituents are all  rich,19 are thus abusing rent regulation, is outrageous  and20 does not align with the  facts.21 According to this City' s most22 recent Housing Vacancy Survey, the median income  of23 renters in Manhattan is $ 51 , 000 per year.	One area24 in Washington Heights, identified by the U. S.25 Census Bureau as having large concentrations  of2 
2 households with incomes less than or equal to  503 percent of the HUD median family income,  registers4 a median income for rental households, of just  5	$ 23 , 000 per year.6 Moreover, 85 percent of the7 housing units in this northern Manhattan8 neighborhood are rental.	And over a quarter of9 these rental buildings are classified as  physically10 distressed.	Wealthy these Manhattanites are not.11 The overwhelming majority of12 building owners are good actors who do not  share13 the same views as those who put these  commercials14 on the air.	And no one should begrudge the  small15 business people who have made investment in  our16 City' s affordable housing stock.17 However, let' s not further toxify18 the debate about affordable housing in New  York19 City with misinformation and innuendo steeped  in20 faulty assumptions about race and class in the  five21 boroughs.22 I urge the Rent Guidelines  Board23 to reject the negative viewpoints conveyed in  these24 misguided ads.25 As Manhattan Borough President,6 
2 Scott M. Stringer, has a special responsibility  to3 defend and support the constituents of his  borough.4 But he also wants to make it clear that the  455 percent of New York City renters living in  rent6 stabilized units in all of our boroughs are  in7 desperate need of relief from the Rent  Guidelines8 Board.9 Last year the Rent Guidelines10 Board raised rents on one- year leases by 3 . 7511 percent and on two- year leases by 7 . 25 percent.12 The proposed fuel surcharge that would have  heaped13 an additional one percent increase onto tenants  and14 which would have created a new incentive to  burn15 dirty fuel oil, was rejected.16 I applaud the Rent Guidelines17 Board for protecting tenants and the  environment18 from this ill- fated fuel surcharge and I urge that19 the board reject any last minute attempts to slip  a20 new fuel surcharge into the mix as was done  four21 years ago with the eleventh hour introduction  of22 the poor tax.23 However, the Rent Guidelines Board24 must understand that given the relatively  small25 increases passed last year, have deeply  impacted2 
2 the financial well being of low and middle  income3 stabilized tenants.4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Please wrap up.5 MS. VALENZUELA:	Many of these6 tenants are already stretching their resources  to7 the breaking point, as evidenced by the 11 . 58 percent overcrowding rate in New York City' s rent9 stabilized housing stock.	And an additional 4 . 310 percent of apartments that are classified  as11 severely overcrowded.	On top of this, the  most12 reliable indicator of affordability in New  York13 City' s rental housing stock, the rent- to- income14 ratio is, also, extremely grim.15 When over 50 percent of  the16 housing -- households residing in rental  housing17 pay more than one- third of their income in gross18 rent, the highest margin since the City has  been19 tracking the statistic, it is clear to me that  we20 have a serious affordability crisis on our  hand.21 When you couple this affordability22 crisis with a stagnating unemployment rate and  the23 extremely uncertain short- term repercussions from24 the global economy that stem from the  sovereign25 debt crisis in the Euro Zone, the only  responsible2 
2 course of action for the Rent Guidelines Board  to3 take this year is to institute a one- year rent4 freeze.5 Finally, as I do every year,  as6 the Borough President, again, appeals to the  board7 to take a stance on home rule so that New York   City8 can regain control of its rent stabilization  laws.9 It makes no sense for legislators to answer  to10 constituencies detached from and unaware of  our11 housing crisis, to control our rent  laws.12 The Rent Guidelines Board should13 lead the effort to return authority over rent  and14 eviction policies to New York City.15 Thank you so much.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.17 ( Applause.)18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Marilyn Percy.19 MS. PERCY:	Good evening,20 everyone.21 My name is Marilyn Percy.	I' m a22 co- owner of a small property of six units in  Sunset23 Park, Brooklyn for 24 years.24 One of my tenants is there for  4025 year, who wife pass -- pass.	She dies two years2 
2 ago and her husband, who has Parkinson, he' s over3 80 -- 80 years old an could not walk  the4 third- floor flight steps.5 I met his 50 - year old son at the6 funeral and he decided that he was  moving in.	I7 took him to court but I lost  the case.	That' s8 number one.	Okay.9 I have another tenant that she  was10 born there 32 years ago so, as you know, they  pay11 low rent.12 I have another tenant that  moved13 there 23 years ago and every five year, I have   to14 remodel the bathroom because for some reasons,  she15 usually take the tile -- I don' t know how it  come16 out -- the tile from the wall.	Okay.17 The -- the three other tenant  that18 I have that pay decent, one of them is  a couple.	I19 rented to a couple and before I knew, there  was20 seven people there.	So don' t tell me take him to21 court, because it take money to get  a lawyer.	And22 as a small property owner I don' t have the funds  to23 go to court every time for every little  thing.24 Okay.25 Now my problem is bed bug.	My2 
2 32 - year old tenant for the last past nine months, I3 sent an exterminator and they tell her what to  do4 and, you know, the exterminator to remove the  bed5 bugs and then she goes in wash the clothing  like6 she' s told.7 So, actually, every time that they8 go they charge me $ 500 .	So I' m requesting a six9 percent for one year, at least nine percent  for10 two- year lease.	And, also, because my oil bill  is11 tremendously -- I' m asking for one year -- one12 percent increase.13 I' m thanking you for your hearing14 me.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.16 ( Applause.)17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Tom Diana.18 MR. DIANA:	Good afternoon.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Come on, Tom.20 This is going to count as part of your  time.21 MR. DIANA:	Are we ready?22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	We' re ready.23 MR. DIANA:	Okay.	Your own staff24 spends thousands of hours gathering tens  of25 thousands of pieces of information to calculate  the2 
2 bare minimum operating costs a dozen  different3 ways.4 We thank your staff for all  their5 hard work that you simply throw it all away  on6 fairy tale stories, told by the sponges paying  less7 than half the minimum calculated costs.8 A whole $ 400 in rent on time and9 tenants are doing us a  big favor.	We' ll gladly10 take $ 1 , 500 a week a month late.	There' s no profit11 in the rent from these people.	How are they paying12 our mortgages?13 Let' s talk about what they' re14 actually paying not a bunch of, you know,  ghetto15 economics.	Let' s fill out a SCRIE application.	I16 have some here.17 Has any elected official done one18 thing to significantly lower our operating  costs?19 Instead, Quinn, Williams and others are  operating20 their own housing scams.21 Did the Occupy Wall Street  clowns22 miss any work?	No.23 As a board you missed  the24 opportunity to view over 800 inspirational  segments25 of Judge Judy to learn how to get to the truth   in2 
2 the minutes.	The first question to tenants, do  you3 have a real job?	We need a score card to  keep4 track of which unemployed convict is  fathering5 which kid with what single mother and all the  goof6 ball boarders they jam into the  apartments.7 Rent strikes generally start the8 day their unemployment runs out or maybe  daddy9 needs bail money.10 They' re content being unemployed11 models, actors and assorted fairy princesses.12 Nobody wants to buy their art but it' s time for  a13 real job.14 They get more mystery diseases15 than all the science fiction movies ever  made.16 Tenants complain if you open the17 window, they' re freezing.	So they open the windows18 and then call the City to  complain.19 We should not have to sacrifice  so20 they can retire early from their  career,21 alternating between unemployment and part- time22 jobs.	Work the hours that we work and  stop23 supporting your local bartender, then we can  talk24 to you about paying the  rent.25 Maybe you saw my friend on Help  Me2 
2 Howard.	A squatter did a midnight move in,  nine3 months, not a dime in rent.	Thousands of dollars4 in damages but someone had to pay for her  SUV.5 Well, my princess, Jennifer Green,6 abandoned the job the day after she signed my  lease7 and started a six- month rent strike.	Then8 bankruptcy.9 Matt Doyle, where' s my four months10 of rent you spent on  your model?	Where are these11 costs?12 We can' t heat our buildings13 burning old newspapers or using insulating  paints.14 Global warming will not make up for years of  half15 costs rents from the freeloaders.16 So before the City Council has  all17 of you independent members fired, okay, how  about18 we do a free -- a freeloader adjustment for   the19 below cost rents.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Tom.21 MR. DIANA:	That' s it.22 ( Applause.)23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is there anybody24 in the room wishing to speak who has not  registered25 yet?2 
2 Once again, we' ve run out of3 speakers.	We will be here until 6 : 00 .4 We stand adjourned, 15 minutes, or5 until someone comes.6	( Recess 5 : 11 - 5 : 47 p. m.)7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	We can8 come back into session.	We have a few speakers.9 The next speaker will be10 Councilmember Jumaane Williams.11 COUNCILMEMBER WILLIAMS:	Good12 evening.	How are you?13 Mr. Chair, all the members, I' m14 glad to be here again.	But just like last year, I15 believe, this is pretty much pro forma and  pretty16 much a sham because we all know that the  tenants17 will get an increase.18 It always disturbs me because  we19 seem to skip over the first question is,  should20 always be whether or not we need a rent increase   to21 begin with.	But you guys always seems to jump  into22 how much that increase should be.	And I expect23 that from the tenants -- I' m sorry, I expect  that24 from the landlord but I expect that they  would25 ignore some of the facts -- what the  public7 
2 members, who I call landlord light, I  believe,3 should go into the facts and decide whether or  not4 there should be an increase to begin  with.5 As we know, the rent burden  has6 gone up to about 32 . 5 percent, over 50 percent of7 the people paying -- so over a third are   paying8 more than -- owe 50 percent of their rent --   income9 in rent.10 We know all the statistics but11 still, I' m pretty sure by the end of this, we' re12 going to vote for an  increase.13 My question last year was, I  never14 answered, which was what would the atmosphere  look15 like for tenants to get a  rent increase?	I' m still16 trying to figure that out.	I' m sure over four17 decades or five decades, there was one year at  some18 point where the atmosphere should have meant  that19 the landlords -- that the tenants should  have20 received a freeze or a decrease.	But that' s never21 come.22 So either the landlords say23 they' re not going to make money and they do make24 money or they make less money.	No matter what25 happens, we seem to get  an increase.	So that' s2 
2 very frustrating to me, that fundamental  question3 of whether or not we even need an increase  troubles4 me.5 And, I know, landlords are  making6 more money than they did in  1969 .	That' s also7 frustrating.	I know there are some landlords  who8 are suffering, particularly, the smaller  landlords.9 We are trying -- want to find  ways10 for them not to suffer, for them to be able to   keep11 their heads above water but there are a lot  of12 landlords who are making a lot of money and  for13 some reason they' re not able to bifurcate those and14 we make sure everybody makes as much money  as15 humanly possible on the backs of people who can  no16 longer afford to pay.17 So I' m going to end my testimony18 here but I' m sure you' re all pretty familiar with19 my stance and I want to make sure I give a   special20 shout out to Adriene Holder for -- for ten  years21 has done the tenant world very, very proud and  I' m22 very sorry to see you  go.23 So thank you very much.24 And are there any questions?25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.2 

2345	Councilmember.6789
Are there any questions? ( No response.)CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,We appreciate your coming in. Alan Fierstein.MR. FIERSTEIN:	Good afternoon. I' m an owner of a loft building
10 and every year you guys make a different  increase11 for lofts as opposed to the other classes  of12 buildings.13 I' m not an expert of what all the14 other classes are - class 2 , class 4 but I  always15 seem to get the short end of  the stick.	So I' ve16 got some numbers for you.17 For lofts, the last three years18 the increases were for one year:	3 percent, 2 . 2519 percent, 3 . 75 percent.20 Now I' m going to tell you my real21 estate taxes for the last three years.	Actually,22 I' m going to tell you for the last four years,  then23 you can see the percentage increase.	But I did the24 math for you.25 2009 - 2010 , my real estate taxes10 
2 were $ 37 , 146 .	The next year they were $ 44 , 991 .3 That' s 21 percent increase.	The next year,4	' 11 -' 12 , 2011 - 2012 , they were $ 52 , 728 .	That' s a 175 percent increase.6 And then this year, I just got  the7 notice today, it' s a 28 percent increase to8	$ 67 , 434 .	All right.	21 , 17 , 28 -- and then the9 other numbers were like 3 and change, 2 and  change,10 3 and change.11 One of my tenants, I have  three12 tenants.	I have a six- story -- a five- story13 walkup.	I live in the basement.	One of my14 full- floor tenants -- I have three residential15 tenants.	He pays $ 890 rent, which is good.	He can16 save money.	He bought a new car  just recently.	He17 has a house in the country in upstate New York   and18 I get $ 890 -- he' s an architect.19 So what you just heard about20 making lots of money on the backs of other  people,21 I have commercial tenants, small  commercial22 tenants.	And in their leases I put in a   three23 percent increase.	I don' t have any provisions for24 an increase of the real estate taxes to be  passed25 along or shared by any of the residential  tenants9 
2 so I' m in a pretty back situation looking forward.3 And even though I use an  attorney,4 I get usually a one percent decrease off of   the5 assessed increase -- resulting in the numbers  I6 just told you.7 Although this year we haven' t8 fought it yet so that 67 may go down to one   percent9 less than that 21 percent increase.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.11 MR. FIERSTEIN:	You' re welcome.12 MS. CRUZ:	I have a -- just  one13 question.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Just a second.15 Question, Ms. Cruz.16 MS. CRUZ:	Can you tell us, if17 you know, of your expenses for utilities and  water?18 MR. FIERSTEIN:	What they are?19 MS. CRUZ:	Yes.20 MR. FIERSTEIN:	I can only21 estimate.	The Con Ed bill, which is a  combination22 of gas and electric and it' s partly shared by  some23 of these other third- party suppliers to get the24 best deal, it' s roughly $ 600 -- $ 500 -$ 600 a month25 -- during the months that there' s no gas --2 
2 tremendous gas usage.	But this year it was  really3 well, because we didn' t have a lot of cold  winter4 days.5 But on typical years it' s usually6 about $ 1 , 000 a month.	It' s not that much.	It' s a7 small building.	It' s very well insulated.	You8 know, but I have all the other costs that you' ve9 heard probably talked about today.10 MS. CRUZ:	Um- hum.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes, Mr.14 Schleider.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Your residential16 tenants, are they full tenants or are they IMD  type17 tenants?18 MR. FIERSTEIN:	Well, I was IMD19 No. A 10003 .	I was the third person  to register.	I20 was fortunate enough to buy my building  without21 knowing about the upcoming loft law.	I bought it22 because I was a commercial tenant in the  building.23 I had a recording studio in the  top floor.	And24 that was in 1982 .25 So it was an IMD and I  legalized2 

2	it on time.34
MR. SCHLEIDER:	Um- hum.MR. FIERSTEIN:	And it was a  whole
5 lot of sad situation involved -- involving  that6 whole process 12 years ago.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right.8 MR. FIERSTEIN:	Does that answer9 your question?	These were three loft tenants.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.12 MR. FIERSTEIN:	You' re welcome.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Rosalind14 Lee- Larson.15 MS. LEE- LARSON:	Hi.	We own a16 six- family residence in Sunnyside, Queens and we17 have three long- time families that moved in 27 , 2518 and 18 years ago, respectively.	And three young19 families with a total of four children,  consisting20 of three toddlers and one.21 And we' re ordinary working small22 property owners providing decent, clean comfortable23 and family- friendly quarters for our residents with24 our limited operating rental income.25 We use No. 2 heating oil  and5 
2 although we had a mild winter this past year,  our3 fuel bill was still higher than the previous  year4 when we had a much colder winter and much  snow.5 The cost of No. 2 oil had increased, in our   case,6 by an average of 76 cents per gallon from  March7 2010 to 2011 to March 2011 to  2012 .	And that was8 high enough to more than offset the lower  heating9 consumption of March 2011 to ' 12 .10 In addition, this same No. 2  oil11 is used to heat water for growing families of  our12 residents and their children.	Couple this oil rate13 increase with the constant yearly water and  sewer14 rate increases, the next increase at 7 percent  to15 go into effect less than two weeks from today  and16 the yearly real property increases.	The next one,17 also, less than two weeks from today.	Along with18 all the other increased expenses and  unfunded19 government mandates mentioned by my fellow  small20 property owners, really puts the squeeze on  us.21 Therefore, I' m requesting the22 board to consider the fuel situation  seriously.23 No. 2 fuel oil is the most expensive, is clean   and24 it' s environmentally friendly.	And those using No.25 2 for their buildings need an additional  one2 
2percent.3Thank you.4CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:Thank you.5MS. LEE- LARSON:No questions?6CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:Our next7speaker,Ernstisit Pospischill?8MR. POSPISCHILL:Good evening.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Good evening.10 MR. POSPISCHILL:	I' m the owner of11 a small multiple dwelling, an eight- family house in12 Queens.13 My wife and I have owned  this14 building for the last 30 years and, as I said,   we15 are -- we occupy -- we are occupiers of  the16 dwelling.17 We have -- at this time, we  have18 three apartments that are paying less than $ 800 a19 month.	In the past, we had mostly rent  controlled20 apartments which have since been converted to  rent21 stabilization.22 I have to say that the majority  of23 our tenants are excellent people, hard working  and24 -- but a long time -- long- time residents.	We have25 had very few turnovers over the  years.9 
2 However, we do have two  tenants3 that are in arrears, you know, several  thousand4 dollars and our experience in appealing to --  to5 the housing courts has been -- has been of  no6 assistance to us because we -- we' ve not been  able7 to get any kind of sympathetic hearing from  the8 judges.9 The -- and the various --  as10 owners and as occupants, we are -- we do our   own11 maintenance and, therefore, are able to maintain  --12 control our costs as far as that is  concerned.13 My wife is the -- referred to  as14 Josephine the plumber.	Is -- is called in to  do15 the minor plumbing repairs that come up in  this16 kind of building.17 And by the way, our building  is18 100 years old.	It was built in 1912 so we will  be19 celebrating our -- our centennial.20 And so right now our -- the  income21 is barely sufficient to, you know, cover  our22 expenses.	The -- the increases that we' ve23 experienced in the water rates, the -- also,  the24 building is -- uses No.  2 oil.	Our property taxes25 have gone up dramatically because we are --  our2 
2 assessed value is adjusted every year in spite  of3 the fact that -- that the value is not -- has   not4 really gone up.5 So in conclusion, I  would6 respectfully request the board to consider  the7 request that increases of a minimum of five  percent8 for one year and nine percent for the two years  and9 a modest one percent fuel adjustment for those  of10 us that use No. 2  oil.11 Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 Thank you, sir.14 No questions.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Our next and, at17 this moment, last speaker, Melvin Trepper.18 MR. TREPPER:	My name is Melvin19 Trepper.20 I own a 16 - family building in21 Chelsea section of Manhattan and a 20 - family22 building in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. I' ve23 owned the Chelsea building since 1979 and  the24 Bushwick since 1989 .25 I want to start by saying that I' m2 
2 -- I have a very good relationship with all  my3 tenants -- or most of  my tenants.	I' m on a first4 name basis with about 90 to 95 percent of  them.5 I want to first just,  briefly,6 talk about rents and expenses.	I know that people7 here a lot of times focus on Manhattan and how   high8 the rents are.	And they are high, particularly, on9 a free market basis.10 But that' s not true of the other11 boroughs.	There are four other boroughs.	For12 example, my Chelsea building -- my  Bushwick13 building, the average rent is $ 871 . 50 per month.14 And that' s the average apartment is15 three- and- a- half rooms.	So I don' t think that' s16 high by anyone' s standard.17 However, when it comes to18 expenses, the expenses on a per unit basis  are19 higher in Brooklyn than they are  in Manhattan.	For20 example, the water and sewer in Brooklyn is $ 1 , 08621 per unit, per year.	In Manhattan, it' s $ 622 per22 unit, per year.	That' s a difference of 75 percent.23 With other expenses it' s not as24 great.	But there' s, typically, when it comes to25 repairs, when it comes to replacement,  maybe2 
2 insurance.	They' re also higher outside of3 Manhattan.4 So owners are getting, in  effect,5 hit both ways; lower rents and higher  expenses.6 The last thing I want to touch  on7 is that the system works to the disadvantage  of8 both tenants and landlords.	For example, if you' re9 a responsible owner and you provide heat,  you10 provide services, you -- you make replacements on  a11 timely basis, you replace a refrigerator or a   stove12 and you keep the building in good appearance,  what13 happens?	You have a low turnover rate.	And as a14 result, you have a very low -- a much lower   income15 than if you weren' t responsible.16 So what I' m asking for is that for17 long- term tenants, the people who that have been18 there for a long time, there' s some additional19 income increase for those tenants.20 Just one other example is that  in21 my Chelsea building, the tenants that have  been22 there ten years or more, it was 56 percent and   in23 the Bushwick building it' s 55 percent.	So I' m24 responsible.	I take care of the buildings and  I25 have pride in the ownership.2
