The economy reduced income for all owners over the past couple of years, the rent collection losses, rent reductions and vacancies,but we may be seeing a bit of light at the end of the tunnel as the employment picture brightens and confidence improves.             Our staff report showed changes in average monthly rents per dwelling unit rose a mere1.4 percent or about half of last year’s one-year allowable rent increase this board voted to approve.In the Bronx, this equates toabout $11 per month per apartment, hardly, an amount to cover rising operating costs.Even though Citywide rentROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242515intent is clearly not to guarantee an affordable rent for every tenant. It can’t be done. It can’t be done.(Audience participation.)             MR. SCHLEIDER: Rather, it’s to protect tenants against abnormal rent increases driven up by the chronic housing shortage, and that’s a good thing.             But consideration for abnormal cost increases must also be allowed to play and certainly last year’s increase was insufficient to play fair and share the burden.                  In explaining their votes, public members in the past have referred to the need for balancing the interests of owners and tenants. But as tenant representative David Pagan noted years ago, there is no mathematical formula to determine tenant need or affordability.(Audience participation.)MR. SCHLEIDER: There still isn’ta formula today, mathematically or otherwise, to determine tenant need or affordability. And no amount of wishful interpretation of the demographic data will provide such a formula.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242514stabilized apartment building operating income rose5.8 percent since the prior year’s report, for an average-sized 45-unit apartment building, that means the owner got less than $11,000 a year or about $20 per apartment, per month.(Audience participation.)                  MR. SCHLEIDER: That’s hardly an increase to subsidize building costs and not enough to make upgrades or emergency repairs.(Audience participation.)             MR. SCHLEIDER: Although larger building incomes may carry the impact from rent loss or individual tenants for a little while without much harm, small building owners still cannot afford to carry such a burden. And this will hurt all the tenants in the building if operations cannot be continued.(Audience participation.)             MR. SCHLEIDER: The finding of the City Council in enacting the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 and the State Legislature in adopting the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974, clearly established that fair and generally affordable rents are a primary objective of these laws. TheROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242516             On the other hand, there are formulas for determining the rent increasesrequired by property owners. And this board, for at least the fifth year in a row, has chosen almostthe lowest possible rent increase despite clear evidence that the economics of rental housing had deteriorated to the worst position recorded in the last 15 years.(Audience participation.)             MR. SCHLEIDER: The staff report focusing on the rent increase formula, noted that the rise in core expenses was 6.1 percent.(Audience participation.)                  MR. SCHLEIDER: And that next year’s core increase will be 7.4 percent. These suggest modest one and two-year guideline increases will be necessary to protect the viability of our regulated housing stock.(Audience participation.)             MR. SCHLEIDER: However, reality says the costs have risen far more, with testimony suggesting that minimum one-year renewal lease increases up to ten percent are necessary.Tenants must play fair and shareROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

The Board’s own calculations show 2011 commensurate rent increases averaging higher than last year’s increases. Landlords ask us, what can the board do to help keep our properties from ruin? And we’ve seen the staff reports that show the increases in distressed housing - and it’s frightening.(Audience participation.)             MR. SCHLEIDER: We witness the damage from inadequate rent increases as sales of rent stabilized buildings from long-term stable ownership to speculators, with no other agenda but to promote tenant attrition to achieve higher rents or to convert the properties to condos, which would permanently remove those apartments from rent regulation.             Why won’t you learn from the piecemeal resolutions of the worst of these situations and address the cause? That to continue long term stable ownership of these properties requires adequate rent increases.(Audience participation.)MR. SCHLEIDER:  This board mustROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242519             We proposed continuation of the minimum dollar increases adopted by the Rent Guidelines Board in Orders 40 and 41. This is in keeping with the board’s addressing an inequity as the costs of maintaining an apartment, providing services to its occupant are often not inproportion to historical rents.Therefore, a low or small rentonly generates a low or small rent increase, which does not come close to covering costs. The board’s remedy is obstructed by a lawsuit and fewer than half of the landlords made any collections,certainly not what this board intended.             Because of the few landlords who may not need much of an increase, are we as a board, are not going to help the vast majority oflandlords desperately needing the means to preserve their property.             Are we, as a board, just going to ignore that four out of five tenants can, and should, pay their fair share to play fair and share the burden?(Audience participation.)MR.

SCHLEIDER: Over the past few years, the board has had a significant amount of testimony on the subject of promulgating a guideline providing for a minimum dollar amount of rent adjustments and/or an adjustment tied to the length of the tenant’s tenure.             Many sets of possible adjustments were tested by the RGB staff with the results indicating that even with the low rent supplement, those low rent households still had a rent to income ratio below the citywide median rent to income ratio.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242520I call for a vote for a commensurate rentalincrease ranging from 3.25 percent to 6 percent for a one-year renewal lease, or from $42.50 to $60, whichever is greater, and a six and a half to ten percent increase on a two-year renewal lease or$60.50 to $100, whichever is greater.(Audience participation.)             MR.

CHEIGH: Mr. Chairman, Mr.Chairman, I wanted to respond to –- I want to make some comments to add to the testimony.             You know, the common argument that we hear on the board is that there’s been rising operating costs, and also that there is no formula that can capture all the expenses and all the operation and maintenance costs. However, we have data showing that, you know, there is an annual income expense statement that is presented to the board that clearly shows the position thatlandlords are in.             And the most recent filings for 2008 and 2009, if you look at the median net operating income increase for landlords, if you look again –- let me say that again, the median,outside of the core of Manhattan, the median net operating income increased by 15.5 percent. That’s the median increase -- I’m sorry. That’s the average.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242527operating, the median net operating income increases were, 22.2 percent. During the same time, unemployment rates in 2008 was 9.3 percent. 2009, unemployment rate increased 9.5 percent.And now inflation, inflation ofwages, inflation of wages in New York City. In 2008 it went down from 2007, 3.4 percent. In 2009, there was the decrease in inflationary wage rates, it was 8.4 percent for New Yorkers.If you look at the data, the datathat we have, even though, you know, we could say that there’s no formulated way we can look up this, the hard data shows that there is no fair shareright now. There is no equal burden right now. It’s primarily on the backs of tenants who are facing a significant affordability problem.(Audience participation.)MR. CHEIGH:   Now, one thing thatI have a problem with is the PIOC, the Price Index of Operating Costs. Now I, again, I was not on the board when this report was issued. I was notappointed yet and Adriene was not able to make that meeting.The PIOC recommended certainROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242526             If you look at the median, if you look at the median increase, landlords, landlords,their net operating income have increased by 22.2 percent outside of core Manhattan, 22.2 percent. If anything, the real estate industry in their own reports and filings are showing that they’re doing sufficiently to meet their income and expenses.(Audience participation.)             MR. CHEIGH: On the aspect of the viability of the housing, rental housing stock, the board gives a –- the board gives a survey that was conducted, which I wasn’t here for, because I was not appointed on time, indicates that the lending rates are the lowest in any time the last three years, and lower historically, second lowest historically for the availability of debt to cover,you know, major capital improvements or anything.The availability of financing is readily available for landlords.Lastly, in terms of fair shareburden. A fair share burden would be equitable in an economic condition where we have a fair share between landlords and tenants.I just told you what the netROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242528increases, primarily because of fuel charge increases. And granted, all costs, heating oilcosts have gone up. The PIOC reports show that 23 percent, oil costs went up 23 percent.But what is amazing is that thePIOC is only capturing fuel costs assuming that all buildings are heated by oil. Oil went up –- oilcosts have gone up, but natural gas costs have gone down significantly.  It went down –-(Audience participation.)MR. CHEIGH:  –- 5.1 percent. Sooil costs have gone up but natural gas costs have gone down 5.1 percent.And another interesting thingabout the PIOC is that the Department of Finance has, you know, modified the way that they’re assessing their the tax roles. They are not adjusting for fuel costs because they’re doingassessments based on, I guess what’s called the med cash –- I’m sorry, they’re adjusting their assessments to factor in fuel surcharges.             And, therefore, you know, we’re getting the data of assessments that are kind of a year behind, but real estate taxes will be adjustedROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

So in a sense, there is -- you know, one of the biggest complaints is that real estate taxes are the biggest burden for the landlords. Now the fuel costs are now adjusted, you know, real estate taxes will now be adjusted for fuel costs.            And the final point I want to make is that tenants have no control of how a landlord is running their building and they’re using your fuel.(Audience participation.)            MR. CHEIGH:   So there’s no control over whether the building –- the building is running efficiently, whether the building has upgraded to modern technology.            If you look at -- you know, if you look at a refrigerator that’s, you know, a current refrigerator that’s readily available, that’s EnergyStar versus a refrigerator that’s, you know, ten years old, that refrigerator is using fifty percent of the energy.            And the real estate industry, the energy experts have shown that New York CityROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242531properties distressed where expenses far outstrip income. In fact, we had properties that expenses outstrip income by a factor of three to one.            Second, in terms of the PIOC and what it does capture, yes, fuel is a separate category and gas is captured under utilities, as is steam. And if you care to look at how much the utilities have gone up, both electricity, gas and steam, I think that you will come around to thinking that, yes, these expenses have gone up.            Now in terms of fuel by itself, fuel is a significant component of the expenseprofile for these properties.  And I don’t care how many pipes you wrap or how many upgrades you do to a boiler system, it’s not going to counter a 23 or24 percent increase over last year’s price of oil. It’s just not going to do it.            So there’s still going to be an increase in operating expenses from fuel.(Audience participation.)MR.

CHEIGH: One comment I have is that the PIOC also –- the PIOC does not break down what percentage of rent stabilized buildings areoil buildings or what percentage are natural gas buildings. It is wrong to assume that just because fuel costs have increased for buildings that depend on oil, that all landlords are suffering.            Since 2005, oil costs have been rising astronomically compared to natural gas. I mean, just in the current past year, national gas costs went down five percent and oil costs went down –- went up 23 percent. Therefore, from the last six years, landlords have not been takingadvantage of the numerous number of incentives to convert to natural gas, especially for the majority of buildings that are less than 45 units, which are in the rent stabilization portfolio.            We would find out that there is –- there should be a fair share assessment of what we’re talking about when you say fuel costs. It is not just oil. It’s natural gas and natural gasROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

But not every building is in a place where gas can be delivered.             And I’m certainly sure that you’re not suggesting that landlords then convert to electric baseboard heating and just pass its cost of heating on to the tenants and let them control it, are you?(Audience participation.)             MR.

And we’ve seen real significant increases, especiallyin the last four years.            Because so much of the RGB’s attention has been historically and unjustifiably to absorb the issue of owner’s cost, far too little consideration is typically given to the economic and social straits of New York City renters.Indeed, there can be no other explanation for the unwarranted and excessive rent increases authorized by the Rent Guidelines Board in recent years.            Any balanced assessment of the economic circumstances of rent stabilized tenants who have struggled terribly during the ongoing economic downturn, as weighed against theROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

The excessive weightafforded owners' costs versus owners' incomes, and the circumstances of tenants is the absence of -- and we’ve said this year after year -- there is no single easily digestible statistic or piece of datathat describes, in however flawed a manner, the economic situation of tenants.             The RGB staff generates no index of tenant incomes or poverty or householddisplacement and instead presents an income and affordability study that catalogs a wealth of data on the economic health of tenants in the New York City economy.  And it’s real data and it’s important data that we need to consider.             Nevertheless, despite the absence of that single statistic, it is absolutelyindisputable that the overwhelming body of evidence and data show that New York City renters are struggling.The New York City economy has yetROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242543municipal shelters has reached the highest point ever.And on the owners’ side, what dowe see? Net operating income, which reflects the revenue available after payment of operating costs, that is, the money owners have for financing their buildings, making improvements and for income –- pre-income tax profit, that net NOI grew by 5.8 percent and actually, as my partner, Brian Cheigh pointed out, 15.5 percent if you look at the entire City but take out core Manhattan.             Rental income increased by 1.4 percent.

He neglected to point out that the changefrom 2009 to 2010 in average real wages by industry for New York City actually rose 3.5 percent.

But we also had a supplemental, I guess what’s called a supplemental rent increase, or what some people have also called a "poor tax" because of the particular population of tenants that it impacts, but the supplemental rent increase was also something that, as you know, and I’m onthe record, because my organization actually fought that in court.             So I understand what you’re saying and I respect what the process was last year andwhat it was as the tenant members on the board felt was necessary as to make sure that the increases weren’t going to become even higher as we went through the process that evening.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242546rents in the Bronx.

You did mention, however, excessive rent guidelines increases over the recent years.             I do remind you that last year we worked very hard to get the tenants to group over the super majority with the public members. You did vote for that. So I don’t –- I take some umbrage to the –- to your characterizing what we all did together last year as excessive.             MS. HOLDER: Okay.

I don’t necessarily always think that balancing is agood thing when people don’t come –- come to the table necessarily with the same, you know, tools to play on the field, if you will.             So, you know, there’s no real level playing field when you actually have themedian incomes of rent regulated tenants being almost half of what the median incomes are for owners. And so that’s where this whole idea of who’s supposed to the brunt of what’s going on.It’s unfair.  But it is true that to look attenants and to look at owners as being, coming forward in this process and that they should be evaluated equally and their interests balanced, doesn’t take into consideration that they’re not equals and it’s not a balanced playing field thatROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

And I think, that’s because of, you know, a lot of the subsidies that that industry has been able to take advantage of and that is what’s actually skewing what is actually this increase in real wage rates by industry.             But if you look at the real wage rates by industry, you’ll see that, you know,management of companies, financing industry, they had, you know, record, record, 15.8 and 14.1 percent gains.

HOLDER: As –- so we know that the one-size-fit all approach for determining annual rent increases don’t allow for the appropriate consideration of all relevant facts.             The New York Court of Appeals in Casado vs. Markus, a case very dear to me, held that the Rent Guidelines Board has broad powers to differentiate between different classes of apartments when issuing its rent orders.             According to the Court, the board may make distinctions amongst apartments and conditions –- and condition different increases based upon characteristics of those apartments so long as they’re not in conflict with State law.             As it is borne out in the board studies this year, the current recession has hitROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556

HOLDER: While this year’s Income Affordability Study shows that wagescontinue to fall and unemployment and housing court filings continue to rise, the Income and Expense Study shows that owners’ net operating incomes continue to grow.                  Thus, because as tenants as a group are still struggling with the effects of the recession and landlords as a group, continue to make reasonable profits, rent increases should be narrowly tailored to provide only the income necessary for owners to maintain services and should burden tenants as lightly as possible.(Audience participation.)             MS. HOLDER: As many tenants and community –- as many tenants and community groups illustrate in testimony year after year, there area number of buildings in states of severe disrepair that have undergone extensive deregulation or whose owners are non-compliant with rules and regulations yet are still granted rent increases year afterROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242555that unit, any rent increases becomes profit for the landlord. Accordingly, due to the distressed condition of most tenants' finances during this eraof high and record unemployment, rent increases for units whose current rent exceeds their monthly operating costs should be kept to a minimum.            The median Citywide operating and maintenance cost per apartment was $679 per month according to this year’s Income and Expense Study. Therefore, rent increases for apartments with legal regulated rents of $1,000 should be capped as tonot to further move income towards landlords.

Traditionally, the Rent Guidelines Board provides increases based on many factors, such as the PIOC and other –- other reasons.             The increases are generally a percentage increase. I know the Rent Guidelines Board is concerned a lot about landlords who are not in the strongest markets or landlords who are small building owners. However, when you do a percentage increase, you are providing excess profit for landlords who already have income rents.You are already providing significant, significant excess income above the cost, that you do recognize sometimes fluctuate during the economy.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242559to this.             MS.

CHEIGH: I’m very happy to respond to this.                 I can tell you the reason why this is a very important matter is because the number of units that, because of the Rent Guidelines Board increases, have been increasing as a percentage rate, the number of units that are even reasonably affordable to New Yorkers has been gradually disappearing. There’s extreme pressures for decontrol. There are –- landlords have already existing means to increase rents through MCI increases, vacancy increases, oh, in apartment improvement increases.Given –- units that are at acertain rent levels are disappearing at an amazing rate and primarily those units that are still reasonably affordable to moderate income New Yorkers are disappearing. And those who are in the communities where, you know, with one vacancy and some minor apartment upgrades, a unit that was renting for $1,000 is easily decontrolled.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242558             There should be a cap so that you are not unnecessarily profiting the landlords who already have high rents. But you’re also recognizing that there should be a percentage increase.We’re recommending $1,000primarily because the median expense for operation and maintenance is $679 a month. We’re setting this cap very high.MS. CRUZ:   Chair, since we arehere --CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:   Ms. Cruz.(Audience participation.)                 MS.

There’s strong pressures. There are landlords who could easily take –- easily get a significant more value because the sales –- the sale, if you could destabilize a unit, put that unit out on the market, it is an extremely valuable unit. There’s a lot of pressures. There’s a lot of reasons why, if you look at the appraisals, you'll always seesales comps in hot market areas that are way above any justification for the income that the unit generates.             It’s showing that there are a lot of pressures for –- there are a lot of market pressures that exist out there that are pushingrents higher and higher and therefore there should be a cap so that we could preserve the units that are stabilized. We should recognize that landlords do what they do within the powers, within the parameters of the Rent Guidelines Board to take increases, and they have been.             There are reasons why there are extremely high rents in hot market areas such as the core Manhattan.

It’s not a reflection of –- it’s a reflection of market conditions.Landlords are increasing rents.They have the means to increase the rents to meet market conditions.

Tenants and rent regulated and rent controlled housing, as well as in hotels, SROs and rooming houses, I don’t know why we’re going to talk about, as tenant reps and rent regulated housing, but, yes, we have to represent that whole universe.But what I’m telling you is thateven that universe that has extremely low income and even formerly homeless, that my organization, the Legal Aid Society represents, are seeing their rents constantly escalating and many of those rents are under $1,000.            We’re trying to say that there needs to be a cap.

And this is based on the 2008 housing vacancy survey.             I want the board to just recognize that there really isn’t this huge number of $200,$500 rents out there.

Now, there’s areas that are much lower. There’s areas much higher. But for us to say that there’s, you know, that there’s tons of $500 units, it’s simply not true.Landlords have been takingincreases. They have been taking increases, major capital improvements, vacancy increases and apartment improvements, and that’s how they’ve been increasing rents reasonably.  And even the research  by the Rent Guidelines Board in the early ‘90'sshow that there’s a reasonable rate of return for these types of improvements, MCI improvements or increases.             Landlords have the means to raise rents.

The purpose of this proviso is simply to saythat we should not be conferring upon owners who do not take –- increases to owners who do not take those increases and maintain their buildings.            This is easily a group of landlords that we don’t see come to the RentGuidelines Board hearings. They’re not folks who have come to testify before us. They’re not a group of landlords who should be protected. Why should they get increases when obviously they are not reinvesting it into the housing stock.            And our own data show that the actual number of distressed buildings has gone down. So obviously there are landlords out there who –- who are not reinvesting their income and they’re taking these increases and they’re notROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242579            MS.

It is legally flawed and it takes the board into areas that clearly is outside the scope and authority of our duties.            MS. HOLDER: I don’t think it is outside of the scope or authority, but, actually, that’s not correct. You are right, that if there are rent-impairing violations, that they’re not allowed to collect the rent. What I am saying is that they should not be permitted to take the increases during the period of renewal. That is something completely different.            MS. CRUZ: That is incorrect, Ms. Holder. They are not entitled to receive any increases when there are immediately hazardous conditions that have been found either by a court or by the rent agency, they are –-            MS.

And they’re obviously, are landlords who continue to maintain their buildings and therefore we’ve seen a decrease a number of the distressed buildings.            So I would ask that this board consider the following:            Any rent-impairing violations or hazardous or immediately hazardous violations exist in the building that have not been corrected within the required statutory time frame, should get azero increase for renewals commencing on or after October 1st, 2011 and on or before September 30th, 2012.(Audience participation.)

HOLDER: I’d like to make a motion regarding the proviso for buildings with scatter site apartments.                  Some building owners have taken advantage of the provision in the RentStabilization Law that exempts apartments from rent stabilization when they are rented to non-profit organizations in order to collect rents that wouldbe far in excess of what they could receive in a residential market.             One of the most common examples of this practice occurs when the Department of Homeless Services contracts with non-profit organizations to place homeless families in scatter site housing in rent stabilized apartments. The Department of Homeless pays approximately $3,000 per month to house these individuals which allow the landlord to charge far more for these unitsthan the residential market would bear.Accordingly, landlords who rentout their vacant units to these non-profits do not require the regular Guidelines increases in orderROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 115561234567891011121314151617181920212223242586Ms. Holder.MS.

HOLDER:  As we are well aware, the majority of SRO tenants have fixed incomes and many struggle to be able to pay both their rent and afford the basic necessities.             Conversely, hotel and lodging owners saw their industry grow last year and stilldo not depend on the comparatively small population of permanent SRO tenants to reap significantROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425119Even with a proviso in effect,hotel owners are able to reap substantial profits by renting out the remaining rooms to transient guests at their nightly rates. Where a typical SROowner may be authorized to charge $15 a night to a permanent tenant, that same owner may be charging$100 a night to non-permanent guests.             The owners are not in the business of managing low income housing. They are in the business of running hotels for transient guests paying the market rate.             Many hotels undergo massive renovations to the floors on which non-permanent hotel guests are housed to make them more attractive to visitors, deliberately denying the same improvements to tenants. Their profits are derived from renting rooms to transient guests, university and colleges in the City itself.Therefore, I have a motion. (Audience participation.)                 MS. HOLDER: The allowable level of rent adjustment over the lawful rent actually charged and paid on September 30, 2011 shall be:1.

Except for supported SROs managed by not-for-profit organizations, there is no new SRO housing coming into the market. While the number of current SROtenants shrink each year, as their numbers dwindle, the population becomes more vulnerable to the landlords’ attempts to convert this low income housing into more marketable real estate.             SRO owners are unlike other landlords in that they are permitted by law to charge whatever rate they choose to transient and non-stabilized guests of a hotel.             As set forth in the Rent Stabilization Law at Section 26-501(e), in establishing a fair rental increase for hotels, theboard must consider conditions in the market for hotel accommodations and the economics of hotel real estate.             This board is thereby specifically mandated to consider the profits and the transient occupancy rate in determining the guideline adjustment, if any.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 1155612345678910111213141516171819202122232425120hotel, zero percent.             2.

And Iwould really hope that we would not be entertaining such a range even with the proviso, because I just think it’s going to be very difficult for tenantsto enforce their rights.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:   Thank you.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 10007 626 RXR Plaza, Uniondale, New York 11556
