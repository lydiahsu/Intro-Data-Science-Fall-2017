2	P R O C E E D I N G  S34 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good morning.5 My name is Marvin Markus.  I6 would like to call this public hearing of  the7 Rent Guidelines Board to  order.8 We have a particular schedule  we9 are trying to keep to today.10 Let me just try to  reiterate11	that schedule .12 This morning will be hearing  on13 the subject of the hotels. It will be from 10:00 14	a.m. to 12:00 p.m.15 And there will be a break  from16 12:00 to about 1:15. And then we will  be17 discussing or hearing test imony on the18 apartments, from about 1:15 to 6:00  p.m.19 Then there will be another  break20 from 6:00 to 7:15. And we will reconvene at  night21 hearing again on hotels for an hour, from 7:15  to22 8:15 , and then hear on apartments from 8:15 to 23	10:00 p.m.24 The rules of speaking order  are25 available when you walk in. I think most  you24 
2hopefullywho intend to speak have gotten a  copy3of it .4And we would like to get  started5now.6And Anita Visser, who is  our7ExecutiveDirector, will call the order  of8speakers.Each speaker is entitled to  three9 minut es, not including any questions that may10 come from the Board.11 Anita.12 MS. VISSER:	First the Board.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oh, yes.14 Let 's have the Board Members introduce themselves15 starting on my right , the esteemed  - -16 MR. LUBELL:	Harold Lubell.17 Thank you. An owner' s member.18 MR. RUBENSTEIN:	David19 Rubenstein, public member.20MR.RIVERA:	Agustin Rivera,21publicmember.22MR.CARMODY:	Bart Carmody,23publicmember.24MR.STAROBIN:	Mort Starobin,25publicmember.
2 MR. PAGAN:	David Pagan, tenant3 member.4	MS. HOLDER:	Adriene Holder,5	tenant member .6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.7 With that done, we would like  to8 get started.9	MS. VISSER:	I'll call three10 names at the start and if you could get ready  to11 approach the podium .12 The first speaker will be  Bob13 Grossman, followed by Ann Cunningham and  Larry14 Wood.15 Mr. Grossman.16 MR . BOB GROSSMAN:	My name is17 Bob Grossman. I have been living in a single   room18 in an SRO hotel on the west side of Manhattan   for19 the last sixteen years.20 As recent headlines amply  show,21 business and government are becoming more  and22 more corrupt . Greed and selfishness are corroding23 our society.24 Big corporat ions bribe25 politicians with campaign money and  the10 
2 politicians then pass laws to help  those3 corporations to deceive and beat the public .4 The public' s pockets are emptied5 into corporate treasuries . The poor and near poor6 are kept miserable and in poor health  while7 corporate heads take home hundreds of millions  of8 dollars a year.9 Are you members of the Rent10 Guidelines Board going to be part of  that11 corruption?12 Are you going to take more  money13 out of the pockets of needy peopl e living in tiny14 rooms in SRO hotels just to make some  greedy15 landlords richer?16 The real issue before you  is17 common decency, honesty, kindness and fairness .18 Are you going to continue  to19 reward with increased prof its landlords who20 illegally and immorally refuse to give  their21 tenants the services and facilities they  are22 entitled to by law, who harass tenants in  order23 to get them out of their homes, who  overcharge24 for rents, who illegally convert  homes?25 My own landlord tried to  change2 
2 every one of the hundred and twenty rooms in  the3 hotel from a rent stabilized status to a  free4 market status by simply erasing figures on  the5 registration papers of the rooms and  replacing6 them with completely phoney numbers.7	Every time you raise rents in8 SRO hotels you are making more peopl e homeless9 and you are increasing despair and sickness  and10 crime in New York City.11 Especially this year when12 landlords have  actually  - -  the landlords'13 expenses have  actually decreased ,  it would  be14 vicious and totally immoral to increase rents   for15 Single Room Occupancy Hotels where in 1999  the16 median income for SRO tenants was just  under17 $7,300 a year, and forty- two percent of them were18 living below the Federal poverty l i ne .19 Thank you very much.20 (Audience participation.)21 MS. VISSER:	Ann Cunningham,22 followed by Larry Wood.23 MS. ANN CUNNINGHAM:	Good24 morning. Back again.25 My name is Ann Cunningham.  I8 
1	102 live at the Commander Hotel. I've  testified3 before the Rent Guidelines Board every year   for4 I'd say over twenty years.5 This year I have decided that  a6 picture speaks better than a thousand  words.7 That 's why we have a little artwork for you8 today.9	Before you is a  three-page10 document outlining the pervasive warehousing  of11 SRO rooms floor by floor at the Commander  Hotel.12 And here it is.13 In red are the units kept  vacant14 by my landlord 1	Zeil Feldman 1	from Property15 Markets Group. Mr. Feldman has warehoused  some  of16 these units for over five  years.17 As the chart clearly indicates 118 on some floors vacancy has reached over seventy19 percent.20 My position is that if  Mr.21 Feldman so desperat ely requires a rent  increase22 from the Commander tenants and all the  other23 buildings that he owns 1	then the Rent Guidelines24 Board should not give him one single penny   before25 he rents out the rooms and stops keeping   themROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue 1       New York1       New York 10175
2 vacant.3 Alt hough the landlord shows no4 interest in renting rooms at the Commander Hotel ,5 he does have an interest in harassing  the6 remaining tenants. In the past year at  the7 Commander Hotel the tenants have suffered on  a8 daily basis from a mysterious and  prolonged9 construct ion project. Every day for the past year10 my neighbors have choked on dust and  other11 pollutants. Excessive noise forced tenants  from12 their homes to seek a moment of relative  quiet13 anywhere that they could  find.14 The workers are really  allowed15 and are encouraged to blast their radios,  to16 smoke with chemicals and to also, which I  left17 out of the testimony, frighten the  senior18 citizens that they have to leave their  rooms.19 The elevator is frequently  taken20 out of service for the tenants to give  priority21 to construction use even though the  Commander22 Hotel has many elderly tenants in the  building.2 3	Compounding these ills, the24 floors and stairwells have become  filthy.25 Electrical  cables carrying exposed wires dangle24 
2	from ceilings.3	Security personnel are4 frequently missing away from their posts.  The5 front doors are always left  open.6 Drug dealing on the premises7 abounds. The tenants' mailbox has been broken  and8 vandalized. The house phones are  periodically9 disconnected by the  employees.10 Some nights when I return  home,11 I feel as though I live in an abandoned building .12 My neighbors and I feel  strongly13 that the warehousing of the rooms at  the14 Commander  Hotel ,  the endless and senseless15 construction and the removal of a l l  services is  a16 reason why Zeil Feldman, the Property  Markets17 Group, should not be gett ing a rent increase.18 They should not be rewarded  for19 this type of conduct .20 And I would also like to  say21 tenants should be gett ing a rent rollback this22 year.23 Thank you for the pleasure  of24 participating.25 (Audience participation. )4 
1	132 MS. VISSER:	The next speaker3 is Larry Wood , followed by Mary Osborne, Walter4 Gambin - -5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold it.6 There is a quest ion.7 Go ahead.8 Ms. Cunningham.9 MS. HOLDER:	Can you hear me? I10 don' t think my mike is working.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Can you turn12 that microphone on, please?13 MS. ANN CUNNINGHAM:	I have a14 hearing problem but if you speak loud , I probably15 could hear you.16 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.17 I just have a question.18 Can you tell me the impact  of19 the hotel occupancy tax?20 MS. ANN CUNNINGHAM:	Okay.21 Before Mayor Giuliani left22 off ice, he granted the hotel owners an occupancy23 tax of two dollars a room, that is, two  dollars24 on each room. If they are renting out two  rooms,25 a suite of rooms, they will get two dollars  for10 
1	142	each room.3	This really helps the owners of4 the boutique hotels and of the hotels . That5 occupancy tax was granted last  year.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any other7 questions?8 (No response.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 MS. VISSER:	Mr. Wood.11 MR . LARRY WOOD:	Hello. Good12 morning, Mr. Chairman and Members of the  Rent13 Guidelines Board.14 My name is Larry Wood. I work  as15 an organizer at Goddard Riverside  Community16 Center and I worked for eight years with the   SRO17 Law Project.18 I want to really thank  the19 members for choosing to serve in this process.   I20 know that it is an extraordinarily difficult  and21 you have a hard job.22 I know many people, many  tenants23 and many owners, are cynical about the  process24 and they believe the fix is in, that you  guys25 have really largely decided what you are going   to10 
1	152 decide tomorrow and that this hearing is  somewhat3 window dressing.4 But I really want to  believe5 that that 's not true, and I really believe that6 you are hear to listen, to consider the  testimony7 that is being submitted here . And I really hope8 you can prove the skeptics wrong and do the  right9 thing  in terms of what ' s required  for tenants .10 I really urge you to study  the11 submission and the testimony of the tenants  you12 hear today. They are really going to  illustrate13 to you the conditions and practices that exist   in14 the hotels of the SRO  industry.15 They are from dozens of  hotels16 and rooming houses and they represent hundreds   of17 their fellow tenants.18 And you don' t see the owners19 down here. And I think there is something to  be20 said for that .21 The big picture over the  years22 has been very depressing . In 1972 we had  165,00023 units of SRO housing. The current estimate   is24 there' s less than 35,000 left. So four- fifths of25 this housing stock has been converted  or2 
2 demolished over the years.3 It 's on its way to extinction4 and it 's such a vital foothold for low- income5 tenants to keep them out of the shelters and  keep6 them housed .7 We really have a de  facto8 vacancy  decontrol  in SROs because  they can be  - -9 the rooms can be put to so much more  lucrative10 uses.11 Rent to transients, you' ll hear12 about the tourist rentals. A number of  tenants13 will talk about that.14 The City also rents rooms,  net15 leases rooms in bulk for special  needs16 populat ions: DWAs, people with AIDS, the homeless17 families who are in the shelter system in  record18 numbers.19 And then there is the  emergency20 rentals by Red Cross, HPD, who relocate peopl e  on21 an emergency basis.22 And then on top of that there' s23 colleges - NYU, Columbia, Teacher' s Colleges.24 They are desperate for housing for their  students25 and they go out and net lease huge chunks of  the2 
2	rooms as well.3	All of these combined it is much4 more lucrative for landlords to not rent  to5 permanent	tenants anymore. It 's rare that owners6 actually are still in the business of renting  to7 permanents.8 If you look at the submission by9 Terry Poe with the SRO Law Project , he had gone10 to great lengths to canvas the hotels up and  down11 the west side around Manhattan. And  they12 demonstrate the average daily rents they get on   a13 transient basis. And so few are still in  the14 business of renting to long- term tenants.15 I really believe that the Rent16 Guidelines Board' s decision has just an absolute17 minimum  impact on the hotel industry and rooming18 houses at this point in  time.19 And  if it weren' t , the SRO20owners wouldbe down here demanding an  increase.21But they arenot.22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any23questions?·2425Mr. Pagan.MR. PAGAN:	Good morning, Mr.
2	Wood.3 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Good morning.4 MR. PAGAN:	Just a question. We5 have a rent increase but we also do have  the6 restriction proviso,  the seventy percent.7 Has this proviso been  effective?8 MR . LARRY WOOD:	You know, years9 ago I think it did have an effect. Years ago   for10 the remaining owners who were still running  the11 buildings as SROs for mainly tenants, it  made12 sense . Landlords who were warehousing,  keeping a13 substant ial number of units off the market or who14 were rent ing to transients in large numbers, we15 correctly,  I believe , argued  that  if landlords16 are making that money or choosing not to rent  up17 their building, they should not be rewarded  with18 the rent guideline or the  increase.19 And we've argued for  those20 provisions  year after year .21 But in reality in my  experience22 in working with tenants, they are so hard  to23 enforce. They are very confusing for a lot  of24 tenants to try to sort out. They don't  have25 access to the information . They don' t have access9 
2 to the building - wide registration of DHCR. They3 can't go running around and trying to count  how4 many empty rooms there  are.5 And how do they prove that  the6 landlord is renting to tourists and not  giving7 out the DHCR rider?8 It 's practically impossible for9 us  - - we tell the tenants, no, your landlord   is10 not entitled to an increase , but the burden of11 proof  is on the tenants. And  it ' s impossible.12 I know several tenants who13 refused to pay that increase and the landlord  is14 running with a balance, which eventually they  may15 go to Housing Court to fight over. And the  judges16 will look at that , and they don' t understand the17 provisions.  They'll say go to DHCR. And that18 takes years.19 So I think at this point  there20 is such a small number of landlords that  are21 entitled to the increase and you don't have  that22 option to really finetune it. It 's a one- size-23 fits- all approach.24 And since so much of  the25 industry is making so much money through  other2 
1	202 means, I don' t think we should have the3 provisions because we should have a zero  percent4 increase.5	The only thing that I believe  is6 fair is no increase across the board for SROs  and7 forget those provisos.  It 's just - - they' re very8 diff icult to enforce.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Carmody.10 MR. CARMODY:	I have a question11 regarding the 35,000 units.12 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Yes.13 MR. CARMODY:	Does that include14 all classes of hotels?15 MR. LARRY WOOD:	I believe so.16 That ' s the rooming houses  and the different17 hotels. I think about fifty percent of  rooming18 houses at this point. I would have to look in  the19 specif ic records.20 MR. CARMODY:	Those are long-21 term; none of those are being  warehoused?22 MR. LARRY WOOD:	No, no. That 's23 the total number of units according to  our24 studies. The number of occupied units  are25 actually less. That would include  transient10 
1	212 rentals in that number.3 So the permanent	tenants are4 actually much less  unfortunately.5	MR. CARMODY:	Of the 35,000,6 could you give me just an estimate percentage or7 actual number of how many have less than or   fewer8 than seventy percent permanent  tenants?9	MR. LARRY WOOD:	I believe	if10 I can refer to Terry Poe's testimony. There' s a11 chart in there.12 MR. CARMODY:	Do we have that?13 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Yes. This is - 1415 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Did you get16 your copy or - -17 MR. LARRY WOOD:	This was18 testimony provided by the SRO Law Project  during19 the expert testimony.20 And there is a chart. It 's21 called Table  I. And  I 'l l pass this around.22 It 's actually - - it was page23 eight of Terry' s submission. It said West Side24 SRO TEL Study. They list a whole number  of25 hotels, the daily transient rates that they  are15 
2 charging, the total number of units and then  an3 est imate on how many permanent tenants are left4 in these buildings.5	So this is only an est imate, but6	it 's a pretty substantial number of tenants.7	MR. CARMODY:	What is the8	number?9	MR. LARRY WOOD:	Well, hold it.10	MR.  CARMODY:	I thought  it was -1112 MR. LARRY WOOD:	No. I'm sorry.13 I don' t have a total number.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That 's all15 right .16 MR. CARMODY:	Thank you.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 MS. VISSER:	The next speaker is19 Mary Osborne.20 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Thank you.21 (Audience participation.).22 MS. VISSER:	Followed by Walt er23 Gambin and Ouno Herdell.24 MS. MARY OSBORNE:	Good morning.25 My name is Mary Osborne and I  am12 
2 a tenant at 17 West 120th Street , a single room3 in Harlem .4 I love Harlem and I desire  to5 stay in my community. Harlem is my home and  I6 refuse to be another vict im of displacement ,7 gentrif ication and landlord harassment.8 I am a permanent  rent - stabilized9 tenant and I have been harassed in the past by  my10 landlord.11 My current landlord tried to  run12 me out of my home where I lived for ten  years13 because she wanted to occupy the  building.14 Fortunately, I was able to remain in my home,  but15 that has not stopped my landlord from making  me16 feel insecure and intimidated in my own  home.17 My landlord does not deserve  a18 rent increase based on the harassment	that I have19 suffered. But if she wanted to make a profit ,  she20 could rent out the other rooms in my building  to21 permanent tenants. But she hasn' t.22 I don' t believe she intends to.23 Currently, I am the only tenant in my  building24 besides my landlord who occupies the first  floor.25 I am a tenant on a fixed  income2 
2 and my single room is affordable to me. I  am3 fortunate to be a single woman and I can  survive4 on my Social Security. But that takes a lot  of5 budgeting.6 I would not be able to afford7 market rents if I were to be displaced out of  my
8 single room.9
Unfortunately, my story is  not
10	unique. Many of my Harlem neighbors are  being11	harassed out of their homes by greedy landlords12 that seek to make a prof it out of our only  source13 of shelter.14 In fact ,  I have  accompanied many15 of my neighbors, even those who live across   the16 street from me, to Housing Court in order  to17 demand that violations be  repaired.18 It would seem that the  only19 reason landlords would need rent increases is   to20 pay for their attorneys because they  are21 certainly not putting money into making  necessary22 repairs and providing  required services in  our23 buildings.24 Many of my neighbors in  Harlem25 are the most vulnerable tenants in the City.  We12 
2 are on fixed incomes and we depend on  affordable3 housing.4	However, in Harlem rents are5 rising and rooming house tenants are being   driven6 out. Therefore, these landlords don' t need  or7 deserve increases.8	I implore you to vote on  zero9 percent	increases. It is the only fair and  just10 thing to do.11 (Audience participation.)12 MS. MARY OSBORNE:	And I thank13 you, Rent Guidelines Board, for allowing me   to14 speak here this morning.15 Thank you very much.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 (Audience participation.)18 MS. VISSER:	Walter Gambin,19 followed by Deborah Burns.20 MR. WALTER GAMBIN:	My name is21 Walt er Gambin. I live in Dexter House, 345 West22 86th Street  in Manhattan.23 Good morning.24 First let me start with  reasons25 why I want no rent  increase.9 
2 I have no steady job and not3 many temporary jobs coming over the past  three4 months, hence not much money coming  in.5 This appears to have  something6 to do with the events of last September  11th.7 Next here, reasons why  my8 landlord , I feel, does not deserve an increase.9 He' s converting rooms for10 transient use without work permits. He has  been11 getting higher rents from transients and he   is,12 to my eyes and ears, trying to get some  current13 residents out so as to have their rooms for   still14 more transients.15 All right. Now this  subject.16 Landlords and building17 management	firms are looking for fair  and18 equitable  treatment , right? Well ,  I'm  inclined to19 say, open your books, landlords, open your books.20 You' ll get fair treatment.21 I've been led to believe that  if22 a difficulty prevents you from making aa least   an23 8.5 percent prof it , you can take your books to24 the State Housing Aut hority and they will make25 adjustments towards your getting your guaranteed2 
2	8.5 percent profit.3	Now, in the course of writing4 this speech I came to this. I want to say hold   on5 here . Some part of me  - - this is a strong  word,6	please don' t take it personally	there' s some7 part of me that feels disgusted and a  little8 afraid , afraid that the Rent Guidelines Board  or9 the majority of it at  the bottomline	is not going10 to respond to the essence of my message and  the11 message  of SRO tenants here today as in many   - -12 some previous years.13 What I am inclined to believe  is14 that you want the landlords to have plenty and   to15 have more.16 The stress and difficulties  of17 many tenants trying just to have a simple  place18 to live has in the past not had high ratings   in19 the minds and feelings of many members of  the20 Rent Guidelines Board.21 And I hope that' s different this22 year.23 And I want to stand on  something24 that I said before at these meetings, that  I25 think it should be a mandatory thing  that7 
2 periodically	- twice, once a year -   that3 landlords have to open their books to  public4 scrutiny since they have such a  powerful5 influence on the lives of so many  people.6	And that 's landlords, all7 landlords, SROs, regular hotels, regular8 apartments.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10	(Audience participation.)11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Pagan.12 MR. PAGAN:	Just a quick13 question.14 From what you've said, and  when15 you look at the service that 's being delivered  to16 you and the transients, is that similar? Is   that17 service equal?18 MR. WALTER GAMBIN:	I'm sorry.19 You' re asking me from where I sit when I look  at20 the service?21 MR. PAGAN:	That you are given22 and the ones that are given to the new  transient23 tenants.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you25 gett ing the same level of service?12 
2	MR. WALTER GAMBIN :	No, we' re3 not. As a matter of fact , in my place I have  seen4 service to the regular residents go down,  less5 staff serving us, and more inconvenience, more  of6 the tenants having to take their linens,  for7 instance, to another place rather than have  it8 exchanged at their rooms.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank10	you.11	MR. WALTER GAMBIN :	Thank you.12 MS . VISSER :	The next speaker13 is Deborah Burns, Deborah Burns, followed by  Ouno14 Herdell and Nat Easton.15 MS. DEBORAH BURNS:	Dear Board16 Members:17 Our wonderful city is in need  of18 comprehensive housing, but not on the backs  of19 small property owners like myself here  in20 Manhattan.21 My property is also my home and ,22 like many brownstones  in Manhattan, had been23 converted into rooming houses during World  War24 II. These buildings with their  beautiful25 architecture and detailed workmanship  were  ripped12 
2 into pieces as the world was at that period  in3 history.4 The buildings  became  old -5 fashioned and in much need of repair. The  fact6 that they were an important part of the City' s7 history was lost in the fact that we could  move8 into new hi - rises with everything new and clean.9 Thirty- two years ago I had the10 vision to own and preserve one of these   fabulous11 old buildings as I had seen the demolition years12 before to make way for Lincoln  Center.13 With three mortgages and  one14 large personal loan I went for it. I've  spent15 over thirty years of my life and money in  this16 endeavor and I am happy to say that by the  grace17 of God have managed to slowly refurbish this  old18 gem.19 However, I still have  seven20 rooms or SROs.21 I am older and no longer in  a22 position to make the high salary I did in  the23 past . I need a fair increase to maintain this24 property.25 Now without a realistic  increase2 
2 I could lose - -  find it impossible  to maintain  my3 property. I can no longer crawl around on  my4 hands and old knees to clean public bathrooms .5 I 'm afraid now to climb a ladder to paint or to6 do a lot of the things I did until about  five7 years ago. I 'm a senior citizen and I need as8 much protection as any senior, be it tenant  or9 landlord.10 How you could arrive at  a11 decrease in our operating costs is mad  math,12 absolute fantasy . Do any of you personally know13 of one item that costs less this year than  last?14 A VOICE:	Fuel .15 MS. DEBORAH BURNS:	So we had a16 mild winter and landlords finally had a  small17 break. But name one other  thing.18 Our real estate tax is going  up19 as usual . Our water tax increase is six percent.20 Repairs on these old buildings are going  up.21 Superintendents have to make a living wage  so22 their prices are going up too . Insurance is going23 up.24 The rooms in my building  have25 everything an apartment does except a  private2 
2 bath. Rooms require as much water, gas  and3 electricity, and I pay for the  electricity.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you5	move to wrap up , please.6 MS. DEBORAH BURNS:	Pardon?7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Your three8	minut es are up.9	MS. DEBORAH BURNS:	Oh! I see.10	I'm sorry.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No. Go ahead.12 Wrap up.13 MS. DEBORAH BURNS:	If you have14 any questions.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.16 Anybody have any quest ions?17 (No response.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I take it19 from your testimony you are in favor of a  two20 percent  increase or a larger increase?21 MS. DEBORAH BURNS:	Well , two22 percent would certainly  help.23 But , you know, for a number of24 years we didn't get any increase at all  for25 rooming houses.12 
2 (Audience participat ion.)3 MS. DEBORAH BURNS:	We had no4 increase for about three years.5 So two percent will help, but6 it 's not truly enough.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any other8 quest ions?9 (No response.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11	MS. DEBORAH BURNS:	You have12 copies.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. And we14 appreciate it.15 MS. VISSER:	Ouno Herdell ,16 followed by Nat Easton, Ray  Crowder.17 Ouno Herdell.18 MR. OUNO HERDELL:	Oh, hello!19 My name is Herdell.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We can't hear21 you.22 MR. OUNO HERDELL:	Last year I23 test ified at this hearing that the landlords had24 taken bathrooms  from one side of the building,25 the second , third and fourth floors, and they12 
2 didn' t finish the job.3 I test ified to this last year,4 and now it 's another year. It 's five years and he5 still hasn' t finished the job.6 And you are giving him a  rent7 increase.8	Now, the main concern I have9 here is tourism as far as this place  is10 concerned .11 I have been hearing reports  of12 landlords charging $75 or $100 a night  for13 tourists to stay in the place where I l ive . Now,14 all one has to do is take a look, walk  through15 the neighborhood and know right away that  the16 building is not worth that kind of  money.17 Also, the current various18 landlords  - -  rather the tenant  organizations have19 records compiling landlord harassment  against20 tenants.21 And the testimony is not22 accurate over the past years and that  covers23 about twenty years. There can't possibly be  a24 rent increase unless these situations are  taken25 care of , that is, landlord harassment of tenants.9 
2 For example, I understand  that3 you are going to grant a two percent  increase  for4 the SROs. But what are you going to grant  next5 year and the year after that , because it 's on6 this basis that many of us are going to  be7 hurting.8 That 's about it.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10	Any questions?11	(No response.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,13 sir.14 (Audience participat ion.)15 MS. VISSER:	If there is any16 speaker in the hall who hasn' t registered , please17 register at the front desk if you haven't  already18 done so.19 The next speaker is Nat  Easton,20 followed by Ray Crowder and Lucy  Ledesma.21 MR. NAT EASTON:	Good morning.22 My name is Nat Easton. I  reside23 at 120 West 81st Street . I'm on the top  floor.24 Our building is classif ied as rent stabilized  and25 rent controlled. Just the top floor where  I12 
2 reside is SRO.3 And I've been there for  almost4 twenty- eight years . And almost every day I think5 about what would happen if I can't afford to  stay6 here and I lose my space, what would I do,  where7 would I go .8 I worked straight for over9 twenty- three years without hardly even missing a10 day. Because of leg probl ems I had to stop11 working  and collect  Social Security .12 And if I lose my space,  where13 would I go? I couldn' t afford, according to what14 the market rate is now, I couldn' t afford to live15 anyplace on what I'm getting on Social  Security.16 And I appeal to the Rent17 Guidelines Board to not have an increase  because18 this would be a burden on me, and I know  many19 other people suffer	would suffer the same20 thing if this would happen .21 I just - - again, I appeal  to22 protect the SRO laws and to prevent more  people23 becoming homeless because that 's what I fear.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.25 Is there any reason to believe2 
2 other than the rent increase that you are  in3 jeopardy of losing your unit?4	MR. NAT EASTON:	Yes. Because5 I'm on a fixed income and I don't have any  other6 money coming in. So I just have to rely on  what7 is coming in.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank9	you.10 Any questions, any additional11 quest ions?12 (No response.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,14 sir.15 (Audience participat ion.)16 MS. VISSER:	Ray Crowder,17 followed by Lucy Ledesma and Bill  Hunter.18 MR. RAY CROWDER:	Hi! My name19 is Ray Crowder. I live at the Devon Hotel and I 'm20 also chair of the tenants associat ion.21 The building that I live in  has22 been  using the bathrooms	- - the last speaker, a23 couple of speakers before me mentioned , that they24 have been using the bathrooms to try to get  us,25 to get  harassment .10 
2 But they continue to tell  us3 that  - - when I met with them a month ago,   they4 said that they are gett ing a cert ificate and5 everything should be fine within two or  three6 months.7 But when I talked to the  Law8 Project , it turns out they are not getting it9 because they have been using the bathrooms to  get10 people so frustrated so that when a person  comes11 to knock on their door or they send them  a12 letter, then they would be so frustrated  that13 they would agree to it to get the  bathrooms14 cleaned.15 But they haven' t fixed these16 bathrooms in five years. They need repairs.  And17 when  I spoke with the landlord , he says,  well ,18 there' s people in here paying $200.19 I said , but you also are renting20 - - you have one renting  for $700 .21 And he said, well. That 's all he22 said.23 And I feel coming here, I 've24 never come to a forum like this before  and25 never  - - everybody has a tie on except me and   a2 
2 couple of other people. Most of the people  that3 are in here are speaking. But that doesn' t mean4 that I'm discriminating against you because  I5 think you're better than me. I don' t.6	But I think you can give us  a7 better deal by  starting  - - make  sure these8 landlords realize that our reality  is - -   our9 responsibility is to speak up and say your  two10 percent is going in your pocket and not for   our11 health.12 When you have a bathroom in  need13 of repair and you are using it as blackmail , to14 blackmail us, but you are taking that and  you15 converting everything into a luxury hotel , which16 he had a couple of other buildings that  he17 already converted.18 Meanwhile I'm on a fixed  income.19 I have mental  disability  which  I'm  - - most likely20 if I wasn' t on medication, I would not be able  to21 speak here. But I am here to speak because I   feel22 the need, that everybody feels the need not to  be23 on the street , not to be abused.24 And by you increasing  every25 year, year after year after year, is not showing7 
2 compassion. This gentleman, you're irrational3 about our posit ion because your position is much4 bett er than ours. And I feel that you should  give5 us at least a fair  shot.6 (Audience participation.)7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,8	sir.9	MS. VISSER:	Lucy Ledesma,10	followed by Bill Hunter and Liz  Hernandez.11	MR. LUCY LEDESMA:	My name is12 Lucy Ledesma. I live at the Henry Hudson   Hotel.13 This has been my home for twenty years. I   depend14 on this housing because I'm a low- income,15 disabled woman.16 My landlord claims - - all  the17 landlords claim they need a rent increase   because18 they don' t make enough profit from the rent we19 pay.20 But my landlord, Ian  Schrager,21 the former owner, Schrager, Studio 54, also makes22 a profit when he gets an MCI increase for   the23 hotel. He claims that he has made $3 million   in24 improvements to the building. We the tenants  are25 still fighting for that increase. He has not   been12 
2 able to show proof for all the work he claims   he3 has done to the hotel.4 How can the Rent Guidelines5 Board let my landlord receive a rent  increase6 when he' s already making a lot of money from  the7 guest rooms and also from a  disco.8 And my SRO room is next to  the9 disco. And I have to put up with all that  noise10 every night.11 Why should I? It ' s not fair. No12 increase, please. The landlord doesn't deserve  my13 increase.14 I feel harassed by my  landlord15 with all the rowdiness, loud music and the   crazy16 parties that are going all night. There' s no  end17 to it.18 The stress of my living19 situat ion and fear of increase makes me more  sick20 than what I am. He, Schrager, with the  manager,21 Jerry Mead, have made the room above mine  a22 storage room with no carpet and the noise  is23 coming through all the t ime, all day, all night ,24 knocking, banging, moving heavy things,   pounding,25 coming all night.2 
2 Manager Jerry Mead said are  the3 guests and the maids . His lawyer, Howard Pelz  and4 Jeff Turkel , said so too, and that  I should put   a5 sound proof in my ceiling .6 What can I do? This is not fair .7 My hope is that Rent  Guidelines8 Board does the right thing and vote  zero9 increases for the rooming house, hotel  tenants10 and all the way down for us.11 Thank you so much for letting  me12 testify.13 (Audience participat ion .)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .15 MS. VISSER:	Mr. Hunter,16 followed by Liz Hernandez and Jose  Jorge.17 MR . WILLIAM HUNTER :	Ladies and18 gentlemen of the Rent Guidelines Board :19 Good morning.20 My name is Bill Hunter and  I21 live at 138 West 46th  Street.22 I have spoken before you in  the23 last few years. And basically what I've said   then24 is that , even though I'm disabled , I feel   no25 different than other tenants because I feel  that2 
2 all tenants are disabled.3 We get rent increases no  matter4 the circumstances or lack of services .5 Since 9/11 American has rallied6 around New York. And we've helped people all  over7 the world. Unfortunately,  we've also had to  spend8 a lot of money fighting a  war.9 Here some people have had  to10 leave New York because of financial burdens  and11 the very high rents. Others have chosen to  leave12 New York.13 But those who have stayed  have14 stayed because they love New York and they  want15 to live or die in New York if need  be.16 I would love to see the Rent17 Guidelines Boad show and rally around New York' s18 first line of defense, its  tenants.19 Please show us that you do  care20 as America has shown. Please give us the  zero21 percent rent increase.22 I would like to donate the23 remainder of my time to anyone who needs  it.24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,2 
2 MS. VISSER:	Liz Hernandez,3 followed by Jose Jorge, followed by Terry  Poe.4 MS. LIZ HERNANDEZ:	Good5 morning, Board Members.6 Thank you for allowing me  to7 address you this morning on issues which concern8 SRO tenants, single room tenants and  hotel9 tenants.10 I come to you today as a  tenant11 organizer, an advocate at the West Side SRO   Law12 Project , and I've had the pleasure of    working13 with SRO tenants for the past two  years.14 But I've also had the  misfortune15 of seeing how the City' s most impoverished and16 most vulnerable tenants get screwed over by   the17 landlords.18 The majority of SRO tenants  are19 on fixed incomes. Many are seniors, many  are20 disabled. And their rents are already too   high,21 but they depend on this  housing.22 These SRO units represent  some23of the last entit ies ofaffordable housing in24this City. Without thishousing, these tenants25don' t have many optionsexcept to try their luck
2on the open market andtry to look for an3apartment that doesn' tcost more than $1000,  or4even more devastating,find a nice dirty5cardboard box and findthe most warmest and6	driest niche in their local  park.7	And , unfortunat ely, I'm not8 exaggerating. One of the tenants serviced in  my9 office can be seen begging for food and change   in10 the train station.11 I've also had the misfortune  of12 seeing tenants living in awful  conditions.13 Oftentimes the only way to get these   conditions14 fixed is by taking the landlord to  court.15 And so tenants depend on their16 landlords to ensure that they give them  units17 that are clean and comfortable and safe. And  when18 the landlords don' t offer habitable units,  they19 depend on HPD to make sure that their units  are20 up to code.21 And today these tenants  depend22 on you to make sure that you vote for zero23 percent increases.24 And as a tenant advocat e, I'm25 also seen the unfortunat e results of8 
2 gentrif ication and displacement  in Harlem. Harlem3 is the next big thing in the City.  Everybody4 wants to live there. But the SRO tenant who  lives5 in the brownstone faces a nightmare with the  new6 Harlem housing picture.7	Many of my Harlem tenants are8 tenants living in buildings implicated in the  2039 HUD housing scandal where fake non-profits  and10 greedy speculators left over two hundred  Harlem11 brownstones abandoned and cut a huge gash in  the12 affordable housing stock in that  community.13 My other Harlem tenants live  in14 SROs where new landlords want to convert  their15 homes for profit and displace the permanent ,16 rent - stabilized tenant that lives  there.17 There is no end to the18 harassment , there' s no end to the pressure that a19 Harlem tenant feels.20 Should the landlord that  pours21 cement into the only working bathtub in the  only22 working community bathroom get a rent  increase?23 No, she shouldn' t.24 Is it not enough that SRO25 tenants are poor and depend on this  housing?8 
1	472 It's enough and  it ' s time to3 stop exploiting the poor and the  vulnerable.4 Thank you.5 (Audience participation.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 Ms. Holder .8 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.9 Can you describe	in your10	responsibilities as an organizer can you describe11	some of the conditions that you've seen and the12 services that the tenants are  getting?13 MS. LIZ HERNANDEZ:	Sure.14 I can describe it. I see  it15 everyday.16 I see tenants  that , from the17 most severe to the no heat , no hot water,  no18 paint jobs for years, vermin infestation,19 plaster/paint	chipping, illegal conversion, no20 bathrooms, one working bathroom on a floor.21 I mean I see it all. No  windows.22 Plexiglass instead of glass.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.24 Rubenst ein.25 MR. RUBENSTEIN:	Can you tell12 
1	482 me in your experience if the provisos are  working3 as intended?4	MS. LIZ HERNANDEZ:	Well , they5 certainly need to be stronger. I think that  when6 you do vote for zero increases, you need to  make7 the provisos a little bit more enforceable  and8 stricter.9 It certainly falls on the tenant10 - - the burden of proof  does fall on the  tenant ,11 but I think without it it would be even  more12 scarier. I think you need to keep it. You need   to13 make it more enforceable.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.15 Ms. Holder.16 MS. HOLDER:	With some of the17 issues going on in Lower Manhattan,	I know	I18 actually went to open house on my block  where19 there were two- bedroom apartments going for $280020 a month. I was completely shocked that people   get21 that kind of rent.22 But with some of the23 gentrification displacement , where are our24 neighbors in the SROs  going?25 MS. LIZ HERNANDEZ:	Well , I5 
1	4 92 mean, fortunately, many of them are strong  and3 they are not going anywhere. They refuse  to4 leave .5 (Audience participat ion.)6 MS. LIZ HERNANDEZ:	And ,7 fortunately  - -  I mean one of my  favorite stories8 is Mary Osborne whom you've heard. She's  not9 going anywhere and she goes to court with  her10 neighbors and they're not going  anywhere.11	And as far as - - as long as  my12 off ice is funded , they're not going anywhere.13 And if they have to  go14 somewhere, they may go back to live with  their15 families who are also poor. And , unfortunately,16 they are ending up on the street or in  shelters.17 I mean that 's the reality.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any more19 quest ions?20 (No response.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 Thank you very much.23 (Audience participation .)24 MS. VISSER:	The next speaker25 is Jose Jorge, followed by Terry Poe and  Walter12 
1	502 Bushell .3 MR. JOSE JORGE:	My name is Jose4 Jorge.5 Before I give you my  testimony,6 I want to appreciate this panel. Before we  have7 had a small panel. With this big panel I  think8 our voice is going to be  heard.9 Thank you for the big panel ,10 whoever ordered the big panel .11 (Audience part icipation.)12 MR. JOSE JORGE:	My name is13 Jose Jorge. I am an SRO tenant. I live at the  New14 Wave Hotel on 216 West l O O th Street.15 I came here today to testify16 against rent increase in hotel SRO.  Why?17 The hotel SRO on the west  side18 where I live has been changed illegally. And  the19 City authority has done  nothing.20 And the people who live in  the21 SRO are low- income people. The only way that rent22 rising to any landlord that legally  houses23 especially the people like myself , helping these24 people.25 My hotel is three hundred  and2 
1	512 sixty rooms. Only ten percent is still  living3 there. My hotel has been converted  illegally.4 Every time one room of my  hotel5 is convert ed, it is going to be an apartment. And6 this apartment  goes to high rent. And  it ' s no7 more for the common people in the City,  only8 tourists, a student , other people from outside.9	So they are displacing the10 people who live in this City for a long t ime like11 myself . I've been living here for forty years.  I12 work in the City.13 Now my compensation is to put  me14 out on the street because the rents are so  high.15 The only way you can apply is  if16 you have a lawyer. To hire laywer cost a lot  of17 money.18 We low- income people live on19 Social Security. The Social Security is  $800,20 $400. If we get put out , we are going to be21 homeless. The City said they are housing  5,00022 homeless.  If we allow these landlords to keep23 doing what they are doing, consider two  hundred24 more people on the  street.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 
2 (Audience participat ion.)3 MS. VISSER:	If there is anyone4 in the hall that hasn' t registered but would  like5 to speak, please check in with the  staff.6 The next speaker is Terry  Poe,7 followed by Walter Bushell and Alex  Schafran .8	MR. TERRY POE:	Good morning,9	the Board and Mr.  Chairman.10 Terry Poe, I'm the organizer  for11 the West Side SRO Law  Project.12 I'm not going to deliver  my13 prepared testimony I've decided because   there14 seems to be some confusion concerning the   issue15 of the provisos which have been attached to   the16 hotel orders for the last , in one form or17 another, for probably the last ten years or  more .18 And what I would like to do  is19 try and  explain  how the provisos	- - what the20 proviso says now and how it works or how  it 's21 supposed to work and, in fact , how it does work22 within the time  allotted.23 The language of the proviso  says24 that if the landlord, if an SRO or hotel  or25 rooming house landlord is not renting at   least10 
2 seventy percent of the total number of  dwelling3 units in the building to rent  stabilized4 permanent tenants whom he is charging the   legal5 registered rent , he or she is not eligible to6 take whatever guideline increase the  Rent7 Guidelines Board has ordered for that  year.8 The thinking behind that is  that9 most	- - you know, as many people  have  already10 pointed  out  to you - - most  hotel  owners nowadays11 make the vast majority of their money by   renting12 to tourists or in certain cases to clients  of13 City agencies who pay four or five times  the14 legal registered rents in some cases; and  that15 they, therefore, should not be rewarded again   for16 refusing to rent units which traditionally  had17 been considered units available to low- income  and18 moderate  income people by being given a rent19 increase for violating  those sort of unwritten20 rules that those units will be made available   for21 permanent  rent stabilized tenants.22 In pract ice, the way the23 provisos work, is that a tenant may be ordered   to24 pay the rent increase. And she may say, I'm   not25 paying  that increase, you're not renting  seventy2 
2 percent of the rooms in this building  to3 permanent tenants.4 The landlord will then say,  oh,5 yes, I am.6	The tenant will say, no, you're7 not. I'm going to offer you my regular  rent8 without the increase.9	The landlord may again refuse to10 accept that. And down the road, six months or  so,11 the landlord may file a non- payment petition12 against the tenant whose rent he or she has  not13 accepted.14 At that point it goes to  court15 and a judge has to make a decision what the   legal16 rent should be.17 I'm out of time.18 If you have a question.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, Mr.20 Pagan.21 MR. PAGAN:	Could you finish22 that statement and the explanation? I think  it 's23 something important for  us.24 MR. TERRY POE:	Once it gets25 into court , the real question is on whom the10 
2 burden of proof lies.3 As it stands now, without4 further clarification of the proviso, the  burden5 of proof is probably going to fall on the tenant .6 Now, as actually Chairman  Markus7 pointed out in a conversat ion yesterday, it may8 be unlikely	it 's probably unlikely that a9 judge will require a tenant to prove what  the10 landlord is doing because the tenant doesn' t have11 access to the landlord' s records and so on.12 So a judge may order or may13 allow a tenant and the tenant 's attorney to14 subpoena the records of the landlords so that  a15 determination can be made as to whether or  not16 the guidelines  - -  the proviso  is being fulfilled17 and the landlord is eligible to take  the18 increase.19 So that 's the way it 's supposed20 to work.21 As far as I know to this  point22 there' s been no adjudication of the issue. There23 are several cases  - -  and nothing  has been filed24 yet in court , but there are a number of25 situations where we expect cases will be  filed2 
2 shortly by the landlord.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	As I4 understand  it , Mr.  Poe, you've  suggested language5 to clarify the proviso that has  several6 components, one of which is to, in fact ,  clarify7 what I will call the numerator and denominator   in8 terms of the calculation. The other one  is9 language designed to have this Board  indicate10 that the burden of proof is on the  owner.11 Is that what you are  suggesting?12 MR. TERRY POE:	That 's correct.13 Yes. I mean ideally that 's what we14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I want the15 Board to understand what is being  suggested.16 MR. TERRY POE:	Yes. We would17 like a clarif ication of the Board' s intent with18 regard to those two  issues.19 Something that I didn't mention20 is the fact that in certain cases landlords  are21 claiming  that  - -  the way the language reads now22 is residential units, you know, that  seventy23 percent of the residential units in a  building24 have to be rented to permanent  tenants.25 And some landlords are  claiming2 
2 that residential unit there means units that  are3 already being rented to permanent rent  stabilized4 tenants.5	So, obviously, if that 's the6 interpretation, all resident ial units would7 automatically always be one hundred  percent8 rented to permanent rent stabilized  tenants.9 And that 's clearly not the10 Board' s intent.11 The other issue is whether  or12 not the burden of proof should be on the  landlord13 or the tenant to demonstrate compliance with  the14 seventy percent rule.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell.16 MR. LUBELL:	Mr. Poe , many of17 these tenants, a large number of these  tenants,18 have access to legal services; is that  correct?19 MR. TERRY POE:	No, I would say20 it 's not correct.21 MR. LUBELL:	Well , you will make22 legal services available to a large number  of23 tenants who  - -24 MR . TERRY POE:	We assist25 probably a thousand tenants a year and maybe  only6 
1	582	one hundred of those wind up in court .3	MR. LUBELL:	And Legal Aid will4	also provide assistance.5	MR. TERRY POE:	Not hotel6	tenants.7	MS. HOLDER:	No, not the hotel8	tenants.9	MR. LUBELL:	But your10	organizat ion does; right?11	MR. TERRY POE:	Yes. To some.12 MR. LUBELL:	To some.13 MR. TERRY POE:	To very few.14 MR. LUBELL:	I also find it15 extremely difficult to believe that in a  housing16 court the housing court judges in New York  County17 will decide that the burden of proof is upon   the18 tenant because that 's a burden of proof that is19 not suscept ible of being determined by a tenant20 and the law very clearly says this is one that   is21 required. So why should it be the tenant 's burden22 of proof?23 I have a difficulty in believing24 that a housing court judge will say,  Mr.25 Tenant ,12 
1	592 MR. TERRY POE:	Okay. Well ,3 that 's what Mr. Markus was saying yesterday and4 it 's a good point . I mean that may very well   be5 true.6 It hasn' t been to court yet so7 we are not sure.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. I think9 we can certainly discuss the proviso and  its10 various  intricacies tomorrow. But  - -11 MR. LUBELL:	I think the12 inference clearly, from a legal point of  view,13 the inference clearly is that the burden of  proof14 is upon the owner, just as the owner has  the15 burden  - - just as a owner has the burden  of16 proving that it 's the legal maximum rent.17 So  I can't understand	- -18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well , you and19 I agree there' s the question whether we need to20 clarify that or whether it 's good public policy21 for us to determine whose burden of proof is  it22 in any situation.23 But are there any other24 questions for Mr. Poe?25 Mr. Carmody.9 
1	602 MR. CARMODY:	Regarding the3 fewer than seventy percent permanent	tenants, I'm4 trying to get a feel for what number  or5 percentage  of the population  would be  - -6	MR. TERRY POE:	If you're7 looking, I can run back to my documents. I  can8 give you some exact figures on  that.9	MR. CARMODY:	Documents that you10 present ed earlier?11 MR. TERRY POE :	Yes .12 MR. CARMODY: I was just13 MR . TERRY POE:	Okay . I mean I14 think out of those sixty hotels that  we15 surveyed  - -  thank you very much.16 MS. HOLDER:	I have your17 testimony.18 MR. TERRY POE:	Yes. It ' s next19 to the last page. I'm sorry it 's not paginated.20 But - -21 MS. HOLDER: Table 2?22 MR. TERRY POE:	Yes. It 's the23 notes page following Table 2. And at the  bottom,24 the updated , in the last paragraph,	it says that25 we est imate that of the 6200 plus rooms10 
2 represent ed by these sixty hotels, virtually all3 of which were occupied by permanent	tenants as4 recently as the mid-90s, only about  24385 permanent  tenants remain.6	That is, over sixty percent  of7 the rooms are no longer available for  permanent8 occupancy.9 That 's actually a misstatement.10 Sixty percent of the rooms are no longer  occupied11 by permanent tenants. Very, very few of them   are12 available.13 MR. CARMODY:	Forty percent14 would be occupied by permanent  tenants.15 MR. TERRY POE:	Pardon me?16 MR. CARMODY:	Forty percent17 would be occupied by permanent	tenants; is that18 what you are saying?19 MR. TERRY POE:	Yes. Of these20 sixty hotels.21 MR. CARMODY:	All right .22 That 's - - we had test imony from this owner23 earlier. It seems that if there were to be   an24 increase, they would be worthy of the  increase.25 MR. TERRY POE:	Actually, as I7 
2	recall - -3 MR.  CARMODY:	That ' s my concern.4 MR. TERRY POE:	And you can  5 correct me on this, but I believe that Ms.  Burns,6 she testif ied two years ago, was asked a question7 and her answer indicated that she would  not8 qualify for the increase , that she had empty9 rooms.10 MR. CARMODY:	She said all seven11 rooms were permanently  occupied.12 MR. TERRY POE:	She said that13 today?  Well , then,  I stand corrected.14 MR. CARMODY:	And then also the15 Commander testimony indicates about fifty  percent16 are permanent. So they too would  qualify.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No. The18 opposite.  It 's - -  seventy has to be available. So19 it 's the thirty point.20 MR. CARMODY:	What  I 'm trying to21 get a handle on is who would. If seventy  percent22 shuts out most of the SRO hotels, the increase is  23	moot .24 MR. TERRY POE:	Well , it 's not25 moot .24 
2 (Audience participation. )3 MR. TERRY POE:	Most of the4 Harlem rooming houses would be eligible for  the5 increase.  I don't know about most , but  a6 substantial number of them are rent ing at least7 seventy percent of their rooms to  permanent8 tenants.9 And some of the hotels,  for10 instance, the hotel in which Mr. Crowder and  Mr.11 Herdell testif ied earlier live, at this12 particular point in time would probably  qualify13 for the increase.14 But they are moving very  rapidly15 to not qualify because of their conversion  of16 rooms.17 MR. CARMODY:	Well , this is the18 problem that I'm having with this, is that we  are19 asked to make a blanket decision where there  are20 some buildings that do experience the increase  in21 expenses and that would be entitled .22 So if seventy percent shuts  out23 those that are not complying with the  rules,24 fine. The rest of them should be entitl ed to the25 increase .2 
2 MR. TERRY POE:	Well , if an3 increase is justif ied. I'm not claiming that , but4 I don't think you can5	MR . CARMODY:	It 's true, that an6 increase is justif ied. If we make a blanket7 decision of zero percentage,  those people would8 be shut out who would be entitled  otherwise.9	MR. TERRY POE:	If the10	guidelines'  increase is zero, you're saying,11	MR . CARMODY:	Then those owners12 would be shut out even though they  are13 experiencing  increases in expenses.14 MR. TERRY POE:	Well , I mean15 your own research shows that there was  no16 increase  in expenditures.17 (Audience participation. )18 MR. CARMODY:	The increase shows19 that  - - our conclusion is that there's a   two20 percent  for one-year and four percent  for two21 years. So for the SROs, they get a two  percent22 increase, the same as the  apartments.23 MR. TERRY POE:	Yes. But that24 was the preliminary vote.25 MR. CARMODY:	That was the12 
2	preliminary determination.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I think4	that - -5	MR. TERRY POE:	I'm not6	following. I'm sorry.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No. I think8 he' s testifying that the Price Index indicates  a9 negat ive and, therefore, it should be zero.10 Is that what you are  saying?11	(Audience participation.)12 MR. TERRY POE:	Yes.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any other14 questions?15 Yes. Go ahead.16 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.17 Mr. Poe, can you distinguish for18 us the difference between what it is that   the19 owners actually incur in maint enance of  hotels,20 how their situation is quite different from a   lot21 of landlords in the  City?22 MR. TERRY POE:	How hotel owners23 differ in terms of their structure from   apartment24 owners?25 MS. HOLDER:	Yes.12 
2 MR. TERRY POE:	Yes. I mean we3 believe  - - although we would  love for the  Board4 to do some serious research on this issue, but   we5 believe firmly that the Price Index overstat es6 landlords' actual costs, expenses, because  we7 think that , you know, to put a fancy name on it ,8 that SRO owners' price, the costs, are  sticky9 down, that when - - that they don' t respond   to10 increases in prices by increasing  their11 expenditures in the same way that  apartment12 owners may do.13 We would like it all spread  out.14 You know, if the cost of electricity is too   high,15 the landlords don' t replace the light bulbs. When16 fuel costs rise, they give less heat. And  they17 believe they can get away with that because  what18 they perceive is the vulnerability  and the19 disorganization of a lot of the tenants and  the20 transiency of a lot of the tenants who live   in21 their buildings.22 They're wrong about that in  many23 cases and tenants do get together and they   do24 fight it and force landlords to provide  those25 services .2 
2 But in any case , you know, all3 of the hotels that are supposed to be  providing4 hotel services, very, very few of those  still5 provide those services, like maid service  and6 linen service and switchboard service and  things7 like that .8 I think you could count them  on9 one hand how many of those hotels provide  those10 services and yet they are presumed to  supply11 those by the way the Price Index is  structured.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any other13 questions?14 (No response .)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,16 Mr. Poe. I would just point out that you  were17 speaker thirteen today. I don't know what  that18 means.19 MR. TERRY POE:	That 's lucky.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Good.21 (Audience participation.)22 MS . VISSER:	There are people23 on the list who have not checked in. So if  we24 call your names, if you're in the room,  please25 let us know.2

ALEX SCHAFRAN:	I would like10 to request from the Board if I can reserve  my11 testimony for the evening  session.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.13 MS. VISSER:	Re- register.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That 's fine.15 Make sure you re- register.16 MS. VISSER:	Sandra Windley,17 followed by Bob Sherwood and Michael  Ouellette.18 Sandra Windley?19 MS. SANDRA WINDLEY:	Yes. Right 2 O	here.21 Good morning.22 My name is Sandra Windley.  I23 reside at the St. Clair Hotel , which is also24 known as the Americana Inn, located at 69  West25 3 8th Street.21 
2	In 1993 , an HPD court - appointed3	7A administrator renovated our  building.4	In  ' 94, 64 out of the 66 units5 were refilled with low- income tenants. Later that6 year under new ownership of the Domb family,  a7 drastic change began to happen in our  home.8 We have witnessed tenants  losing9 their homes. Others were offered buyouts  in10 return for relinquishing their rooms back to  the11 landlord.12 By 2001, fifty vacant units  had13 been warehoused and prepared for a  tourist14 business.15 To date there are fifteen of  us16 left residing at the St. Clair Hotel and we  are17 still at the mercy of strangers invading  our18 quiet enjoyment.19 Our food and cookware are  used20 by tourists where they are stored in  the21 kitchenettes on each floor. Bathroom toilets  are22 stopped up, but yet cont inually used by tourists,23 children running in the hallways, and, of  course,24 they are noisy, people loitering in the  hallways25 and playing on the fire escapes.5 
2 Building security is a  major3 problem.  Tenants,  myself  included , have4 experienced	strangers trying our room  doorknobs,5 walking freely about the  building.6 This problem  remains unresolved7 by hotel management.	I have complained to8 management  on numerous occasions about this and9 more only to receive verbal abuse from the  last10 three hotel managers.11 As residents, we are very12 concerned about our health and our safety  exposed13 to unwelcomed strangers, and anyone willing  to14 pay for a room for one night	(no luggage),15 students, tourists, et  cetera.16 We oppose any rent increases  in17 favor of the landlords. SRO hotel - owned landlords18 make the major part of their profits  from19 commercial property and other real estate  they20 possess. The major portion of residents in  our21 building are on fixed incomes. A rent hike  would22 greatly hurt us  financially.23 No one deserves to be  homeless.24 Everyone deserves one very basic need:  shelter.25 Thank you.2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3 (Audience part icipation.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Windl ey,5	there are several questions.6 MS. SANDRA WINDLEY:	Yes.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder.8 MS. HOLDER:	I was wondering in9 your hotel how much are transients and  tourists10 charged for a room?11 MS. SANDRA WINDLEY:	Between $7512 and $110 a night.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where is the14 hotel located again?15 MS. SANDRA WINDLEY:	It 's16 located at 69 West 3 8th Street and 6th Avenue.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there a18 question,  another question?19 MS. HOLDER:	How many units are20 in your building?21 MS. SANDRA WINDLEY:	We have22 sixty- six units.23 MS. HOLDER: And how many  of24 those are permanently  occupied?25 MS. SANDRA WINDLEY:	Fifteen.9 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, Mr.3 Castellano.4	MR. CASTELLANO:	I'm curious5 about the other fifty- one units that are used for6 transients and tourists.7 About how many are occupied  on8 average?9	MS. SANDRA WINDLEY:	I would say10	a major part. I don' t know the exact percentage.11	MR. CASTELLANO:	A majority?12 MS. SANDRA WINDLEY:	A majority,13 yes.14 MR. CASTELLANO:	More than half?15 MS . SANDRA WINDLEY:	Yes. Maybe16 a little under since 9/11, but the rooms  still17 get filled.18 MR. CASTELLANO:	But they are19 paying $75 to $100 a  night.20 MS. SANDRA WINDLEY:	Yes, they21 are.22 MR. CASTELLANO:	And children23 running up and down the halls, stopped- up24 toilets, you know,25 MS. SANDRA WINDLEY:	Door12 
2	slamming. I mean that 's a major problem too.3	MR. CASTELLANO:	This is an4	incredible story. Thank you very much.5	MS. SANDRA WINDLEY:	Thank you.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 (Audience participat ion. )8 MS. VISSER:	Once again, if9 anyone wants to speak that hasn' t checked in,10 please do so at the desk  upstairs.11	We have Bob Sherwood , followed12 by Michael Ouellette , Walter Bushell and Greg
13 Warner. 14
MR. ROBERT SHERWOOD:
Those
15 seats are murder.16 You should have these  meetings17 uptown because it 's hard sometimes to come down18 this far.19 Okay.20 There have been various21 uncontested  reports that landlords have22 experienced decreases of expenses this  past23 fiscal year. Such decreases should be  passed24 along to all tenants in the form of  rent25 rollbacks.15 
2 Furthermore,  all SRO tenants3 should have rent rollbacks to compensate for  not4 having true homes. SROs will never  constitute5 true homes as some do not have privat e bathrooms.6 Sharing has to be done.7 Others do not have true8 kitchens, just a dinky little two- burner hot9 plat e on a dinky little refrigerator.  Dishes,10 pots and pans, et cetera, have to be washed   in11 the bathroom.12 Do any of you up there have  to13 put up with this kind of garbage? I doubt   it.14 The answer is SSO, single  studio15 occupancy, at old SRO  rates.16 Keep the proviso.  Strengthen all17 rent laws. End rent decontrol now. Roll  back18 rents for all SRO tenants  now.19 Thank you.20 Robert B. Sherwood , human being,21 citizen, taxpayer and  voter.22 Hotel Commander,  Room 1112 , 24023 West  73rd Street , New York, New York 10023 - 2793 .24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 (Audience part icipation.)2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'm glad to3 see that you've given the long zip  code.4 (Laughter.)5	MS. VISSER:	Michael Ouellette,6	followed by Walter Bushell and Greg  Warner.7	MR. MICHAEL OUELLETTE:	My name8 is Michael Ouellette and I live at the  Malibu9 Hotel.10 I am tempted to state that  the11 address of the Malibu Hotel is 2688  Broadway12 because that is what it says on the  doorway.13 But that is not the whole  truth.14 My landlord , Mr. Hank Fried, has illegally15 combined three buildings: 2686, 2688 Broadway   and16 2690 Broadway into one building by  extending17 hallways through load bearing  walls.18 Why would Mr. Hank  Fried19 endanger the structural  integrity of the  three20 occupied buildings?21 Money.22 2688 Broadway is registered  with23 the City of New York as an SRO  hotel.24 However, 2690 Broadway, which25 Mr. Fried illegally combined with 2688   Broadway,8 
2 was a nine- unit Class A Residential Apartment3 Building when Mr. Hank  Fried purchased	it.4 Mr. Fried without inspection  or5 permit from the City illegally converted the  nine6 apartments into fifty- four SRO units.7 Then Mr. Fried entered into  a8 contract with the Human Resources  Administration9 to house HIV/AIDS clients at a transient rate   of10 $85 per night per room.11 If Mr. Fried had rented out  nine12 legal apartments at 2690 Broadway to HRA,  the13 City would have paid about $900 per month  per14 apartment. The City would have paid Mr.  Hank15 Fried a total of $8100 per month for those   nine16 legal apartments or $97,200 per year.17 The City now pays Mr. Fried  $1.618 million per year to house clients in his   illegal19 SRO rooms at 2690  Broadway.20 Of course, this scam wouldn' t21 work if HRA knew their clients were placed in22 chopped - up apartments.23 But when City inspectors visit ,24 they enter through a doorway that says  268825 Broadway. Then they are shown the illegal  hotel2 
2 rooms without ever knowing that they have  walked3 into another building, 2690  Broadway.4 The results?5 The clients of HRA are  being6 housed at exorbitant rates paid by taxpayers   in7 illegal housing.8 The hotel rooms were  created9 without permit.10 No one ever inspected the  new11 plumbing or electrical wiring, even though the12 building has suffered two disastrous   fires.13 None of the work was done  by14 licensed professionals.15 The City clients are at  risk.16 The permanent tenants in the Malibu Hotel are  at17 risk. The neighbors in adjoining buildings on   the18 block are at risk.19 The City of New York is  being20 conned by a criminal conspiracy. And Mr.  Hank21 Fried is making an extra $1.6 million a year   just22 out of the illegal hotel rooms at 2690  Broadway.23 My friends and neighbors at  the24 Malibu will be testifying today about what   is25 occurring at 2688 and 2686 Broadway, the  other6 
2 two buildings that comprise the Mali bu Hotel.3 Please ask yourselves now.  Are4 you going to vote for a rent increase for  Mr.5 Hank Fried?6 (Audience participation.)7	MR. LUBELL:	Mr. Ouellett e, has8	this illegal conversion ever been reported to   the910 MR. MICHAEL OUELLETTE:	Yes, it11 has.12 MR. LUBELL:	- - Department of13 Buildings?14 MR. MICHAEL OUELLETTE:	Yes, it15 has.16 It 's registered under the17 Department  of Buildings' violations.18 MR. LUBELL:	And do you know19 whether a violation has been  issued?20 MR. MICHAEL OUELLETTE:	Pardon21 me?22 MR. LUBELL:	Do you know whether23 a violat ion has been issued?24 MR. MICHAEL OUELLETTE:	Yes, it 25	has.10 
2 MR. LUBELL:	My understanding is3 that they are required to show a certificate of   -4 - valid certificat e of occupancy before they get5 any approval for housing HRA tenants; is  that6 correct?7 MR. MICHAEL OUELLETTE:	I8 believe so, but they do not or they have  not9 obtained a certificate of  occupancy.10 MR. CASTELLANO:	They could have11 a certificate of occupancy from  before.12 I mean HRA is not going to  rent13 forty- seven rooms in a building with twenty-14 three.15 MR. MICHAEL  OUELLETTE:	Well ,16 what  happened was - -17 MR. CASTELLANO:	They do dumb18 things, but not that dumb.19 MR. MICHAEL OUELLETTE:	When HRA20 entered the building, went through the  front21 door, above it says 2688 Broadway. As they  went22 up the stairs, they went through one of  the23 illegal halls that they made through the  load24 bearing walls and showed them the fifty- one  rooms25 and represented it as an  SRO.2 
1	812 MR. CASTELLANO:	The certificate3 of occupancy report , which exists, even if the4 certificat e of occupancy doesn' t , will show a5 certain number of rooms in the building.  You6 can't rent more than that number of rooms in  the7 building.8 There' s a non sequitur here9 someplace.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What I would11 suggest , we will forward your testimony to the12 appropriat e officials and tell them that we' re13 concerned that if the facts are accurat e, that14 they do so something.15 MR. MICHAEL OUELLETTE:	Thank16 you.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 MS. VISSER:	We have two more19 registered speakers.20 If there is anyone else who21 needs to check in, please do so upstairs.22 The next speaker will be  Walter23 Bushell followed by Greg  Warner.24 Mr. Bushell .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We all have2 
2 the packet which was handled out by  Mr.3 Ouellette; is that correct? We have Mr. Bushell 's4 testimony and the next speaker' s, Mr . Warner' s5 test imony.6 MR. WALTER BUSHELL:	Okay.7 Hello! My name is Walter  Bushell8 and I live at the Malibu Hotel at 103rd  Street9 and Broadway.10 The Malibu Hotel is composed  of11 three buildings which are respectively 2686 , 268812 Broadway and 2690 Broadway . Two of the buildings,13 2686 Broadway and 2688 Broadway, are single  room14 occupancy hotels . 2690, also known as 216 West15 103rd Street , is a Class A residential building16 that has been converted without permit  into17 fifty- four hotel rooms.18 When I spoke to a City19 inspector,  he asked:  "How  is this possible? "20 The landlord has a history  of21 running this building in a fraudulent and  unsafe22 manner for many years. In addition to the   scores23 of violations on the building, many that  have24 been left for many years without correct ion,25 there have been fires that the landlord has  taken8 
2 advantage of to rid himself of rent  stabilized3 tenants by leaving the building unrepaired  and4 uninhabitable	for months.5	In addition,  the landlord , Mr.6 Hank Fried , has fraudulently rented rooms to7 tourists and the City of New York by  supplying8 illegal accommodations  in a building which has9 major structural changes made without  permits.10 The buildings are now  occupied11 contrary to their Certificate of  Occupancies.12 The landlord had to be forced  to13 install fire escapes recently because there  was14 only one means of egress above the second   floor15 and the means of egress on the second floor  was16 by means of an illegal passageway Mr. Fried  built17 to connect the buildings.18 The activist who was involved  in19 gett ing the fire escape installed was arrested20 and sent to jail over night on trumped up   charges21 leveled by the landlord' s son. He was slapped22 with a restraining order due to the  landlord23 son's false accusations in an attempt to  reduce24 his effectiveness and to intimidate the  remaining25 tenants.6 
2 The landlord has also  deprived3 me of legally mandated services, such as heat   and4 hot water, maid service and hotel phone   services,5 going so far as to tell people that I do not   live6 in the building.  This caused undue consternation7 to my friends and  family.8 The landlord is rent ing out9 rooms to the HIV/AIDS Services Administration   at10 hotel rates even though they are  illegally11 subdivided rooms of apartments that would rent   at12 a drastically lower rent if the City knew   they13 were really apartments.14 The fraud is facilitated by  the15 illegal passageways built between the  buildings.16 So please don' t give a rent17 increase to my landlord, Mr. Hank  Fried.18 (Audience participation.)19 MR. LUBELL:	There are certain20 provisos and circumstances under which we do   not21 grant an increase.22 One of them is if more  than23 seventy percent  of the units  - - which  I believe24 is the case in your building;  is that correct?25 MR. WALTER BUSHELL:	I believe -2 
2	- yes, I believe  that 's correct.3	MR. LUBELL:	So there's not4 going to be an increase in your  building.5 (Audience participat ion.)6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	See how7	responsive the owner reps can  be!8 Go ahead , Mr. Castellano.9 MR. CASTELLANO:	You said that10 he was occupying the building contrary to   the11 certif icate of occupancy, but the previous12 speaker said that no valid cert ificate of13 occupancy existed.14 MR. WALTER BUSHELL:	Well , the15 latest certificate of occupancy that he had.   Now16 he's made changes to the building in between   the17 latest C of 0. But the building' s latest C of O18 said that the building was an  SRO.19 MR. CASTELLANO:	So that a20 certif icate of occupancy does exist.21 MR. WALTER BUSHELL:	For two of22 the buildings.  2686 and 2688 have C of  Os23 invalidly. And 2690 does not have a C of   0.24 MR. CASTELLANO:	But then has a25 certificate of occupancy report which is what   is10 
2	used when a building predates  1938.3	MR.  WALTER BUSHELL :	Well ,4 there' s certainly been major changes in the5 building  since then . So the C of - - it 's6 complet ely illegal.7	As a matter of fact , the8 building is under a vacate order that has  not9 been rescinded, the 2690.10 MR. CASTELLANO:	Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any other12 questions?13 (No response.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 (Audience participation.)16 MS. VISSER:	The next speaker17 is Greg Warner, followed by Bill  Foley.18 Mr . Warner.19 MR. GREG WARNER:	Good morning,20 Board Members, ladies and gentlemen .21 My name is Greg Warner and  I22 hope my statements here today will serve  to23 further illuminat e the unprofessional	and illegal24 conduct which threaten the safety of the  tenants25 at the Malibu Hotel .8 
2 I am not only a tenant at  the3 Malibu Hotel. For four years I was an  employee4 working behind the front desk of the hotel.   In5 that capacity I gained a rare insight into  the6 business practices of a SRO  landlord.7 I have witnessed  construction8 and most of all demolition at the Malibu  Hotel.9 The hotel is actually  three10 buildings which my former boss, Mr. Hank  Fried ,11 joined together without permit. This  was12 accomplished by sledge hammering holes  through13 the load bearing walls between the  buildings.14 New hotel rooms have been built .15 All the new plumbing and electrical wiring   was16 done by a man named Ziggy who Mr . Fried pays  in17 cash to work behind locked  doors.18 To the best of my knowledge,19 Ziggy is neither a licensed electrician  nor20 licensed plumber.  I do know that Ziggy's21 electrical and plumbing  installations have  never22 been inspected by the Department of  Buildings.23 I have recently been cert ified24 by the New York City Fire Department as a  Fire25 Safety Director and I am alarmed at the  gross2 
2 disregard of fire safety standards at the  Malibu .3 Does Hank Fried need a  rent4 increase?5 Besides his profitable  contracts6 with the City, Mr . Fried also operates a7 transient tourist business even though it  is8 against the law to rent rooms on a daily basis  at9 2688 Broadway and 2686 Broadway. The  tourist10 business brings in a lot of  money.11 And , you know, when  I worked12 behind the desk, the daily take averaged $12 , 00013 per day. I was instructed to take  reservations14 secured by credit card but only to accept  cash15 and demand cash when tourists checked  in.16 Furthermore, two sets of  books17 were kept.18 I also witnessed cash payments19 to employees instead of the issuance of  payroll20 checks.21 In the last five years, although22 I paid my rent in cash, I was never given  a23 receipt. When I asked the manager for  the24 receipt , he responded that he could not give me25 one or rather discouraged giving me one  because2 
2 he had told Mr. Fried that I was paying a   higher3 rent than I actually was.4	Tenants' mail , which the Post5 Office drops at the front door for dispersal   to6 the tenants, was frequently delayed or  never7 delivered . This  is of big  concern because  I8 recently learned that the landlord had applied   to9 the Department of Housing Preservation  and10 Development  for a certificate of no harassment.11 These letters were never received by many of   the12 tenants.13 The Malibu Tenants Association14 is still trying to find out what became of  Mr.15 Fried' s appl ication for a certif icate of no16 harassment. HPD has not been  forthcoming.17 The Department of Buildings  has18 not made an effort to force Mr. Fried to   legalize19 his illegal construction. HRA cont inues to  pay20 Mr. Fried exorbitant sums to which he is  not21 legally ent itled.22 Those City agencies are  simply23 not doing their jobs.24 I hope the RGB does their job  by25 denying Mr. Fried a rent  increase.5

GREG WARNER:	No, I did not.8	I was an employee.9	MR. LUBELL:	I suggest that you10 have an obligation to do so and that you report11 that to the appropriate authorities,  particularly12 in this climate. I think it 's very unhealthy and13 you, sir, have an obligation to report  it.14 MR. GREG WARNER:	Sir, I agree15 totally.16 A VOICE:	It 's not his fault.17 MR. LUBELL:	It 's not his18 fault , but he has an obligation to report it.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.20 We will send it along to  the21 appropriat e people.22 Any other questions?23 (No response.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,25 sir.10 
2 (Audience participation.)3 MS. VISSER:	The last4 registered speaker is Mr. Bill  Foley.5 If anyone would like to  speak6 and has not registered , please go to the7 registration desk. This is the last speaker   in8 this morning' s session.9 Mr. Foley.10 MR. BILL FOLEY:	Good morning.11 I'm Bill Foley from the  Hudson12 Hotel located in Manhattan at Ninth Avenue   and13 extending one block from 57th Street to  58th14 Street.15 It's a boutique hotel with  about16 825 tourist rooms. Stabilized  tenants number17 about one hundred and  twelve.18 The bar is a playground	for New19 York night life and the hotel has been the  site20 of parties for political	figures and top21 political	figures and Hollywood celebrities. It 's22 fashionable to be seen at the  Hudson23 You should  - - do you have the24 paper up there about the rent , the decontrol?25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.4 
2 MR. BILL FOLEY:	Now, hotels3 have been practicing rent decontrol. In Section A4 we can see that in ten years forty- three percent5 of a block of stabilized rooms has been lost   to6 the hot student and tourist  market.7 These units have  disappeared.8 The disappearance rate used is 5.5 percent ,  which9 has been about the rate at the Hudson with   two10 different owners.11	In Sections B, C and D, we can12 see the lucrative tourist rates provide  a13 substant ial increase for a given block of  rooms14 when the tourist rates are used to value   the15 vacated stabilized rooms.16 Even using an occupancy rate  of17 seventy- five percent , a boutique rate of $200 a18 night can produce a net increase of  forty- five19 percent  for the group that started out the  year20 as all stabilized.21 A $75 rate could produce  a22 fourteen percent increase.23 Tenants believe that if the  Rent24 Guidelines Board granted an increase, it  would25 add to the leverage that has already been   used12 
2 aggressively.3 Our current owner spent  $504 million to buy the building and another  $605 million to upgrade it. And we are fighting  right6 now a $300 a month MCI increase request . We  think7 that' s pretty extreme.8 We hope to have it knocked  down9 quite a bit , but  it 's an aggressive  indication of10 the way the hotels are  run.11 We ask for an increase of  zero12 percent.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me ask14 you a question.15 In terms of the fact pattern  you16 just described here, and we've had the  proviso17 for a while, have you gotten previous  increases18 or not?19 MR. BILL FOLEY:	No. We were20 under  the  seventy percent .21 It 's most tourists.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. I just23 want ed to make sure. You know, Mr. Schrager  has24 been in jail before.  So - -25 MR . BILL FOLEY:	Oh, no. They2 
2	obey the rules.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.4 MR. BILL FOLEY:	We hope it 's5	the same thing this year.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.7 Thank you.8 Other questions?9 (No response. )10 MS . VISSER:	Are there any11 other speakers who would like to speak who  have12 not registered?13 Is there anybody left?14 (No response.)15 MS. VISSER:	That will conclude16 the morning' s session on the hotels. There is17 another session from 7:15 to 8:15 tonight in  this18 room.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' ll be20 adjourned now unt il 1:15 when we start the21 testimony on the apartments.22 (Which were all the proceedings23 at the First Session of the Public Hearing,   which24 concluded at 11:40 o'clock a.m.) 2510

11032P R O C E E D I N G  S34CHAIRMAN MARKUS:My name is5 Marvin Markus. We are ready to start  the6 afternoon session of the public hearing of  the7 Rent Guidelines Board.8 This afternoon session will  deal9 with apartments. We expect to begin now at  1:1510 and last through six o'clock this evening .11 We are going to limit  speakers12 to three minutes each. When you face the  podium,13 you will see a large clock which right now  says14 three minut es. We will start with the three-15 minute point and we will go down to  thirty16 seconds. It will beep which means it 's a signal17 for you to try to wrap up. And at the end it  will18continueto beep for about five or ten beeps.19And we would like to keep  to20that. Wehave lot more speakers this  afternoon21than we had this morning and we are scheduled  to22end at sixo'clock. We wouldlike to keep to that23schedule.24Anita.25MS. VISSER:If you haven' t
1	1042 already checked in at the desk upstairs,  the3 registration desk, let them you know you're  here4 if you pre- registered.5 If you haven' t pre - registered,6 you can sign up to speak. Just check in at  the7 desk upstairs.8 When you approach the podium,9 could you please state your name for  the10 stenographer before you begin your speech,  state11 your name.12 And I'm going to read out  three13 speakers. If your name is in that group,  could14 you please move to the forward seats so that  you15 can speak directly after the person who is  ahead16 of you .17 Public officials will be allowed18 to speak shortly after they arrive . So if there19 is a change to the order, it 's probably because a20 public official has come in .21 Representat ives of public22 officials are not given special  preference.23 And , again, please  check  in with24 the desk if you haven' t already if you want to25 speak today.2 
2The first speakers will be Anita3Romm,followedby Roberta Bernstein, followed  by4AdeleBender.5 Could Anita Romm approach  the6 podium?7	MS. ANITA ROMM:	H ,  I8 My name is Anita Romm. I am  the9 songwriter for the Metropolitan Council  on10 Housing.11 I have been to all your meetings12 on Reade Street and I have read the report s which13 your staff worked on diligently and for which  so14 many  trees gave their lives .15 But did you really read  those16 reports?17 What were you thinking when  you18 voted for the two percent and four per  cent19 increases last month?20 All the reports showed that21 landlords' incomes went up and their  expenses22 were relatively low due to this past non- winter.23 In addition, nearly every year24 landlords got more of an increase than  they25 deserved. Just look at all of your reports .8 
2 Our fair City needs and  deserves3 a rent rollback.4 What will a rent rollback  do?5 It will have a beneficial effect6 on our overall economy as peopl e will be able to7 purchase more goods and services which  will8 create jobs and we will have less  unemployment.9 Just remember your economics in high school  and10 college.11 In addition, fewer families will12 slip into homel essness so taxpayers will face13 some relief from footing the ever- increasing14 expense caused by homelessness,  joblessness,15 foster care and crime.16 Families will be better able  to17 stay together. And how can you dispute  the18 importance of family values in this day and  age?19 I mean do you want families20 broken up and children being sent to  orphanages21 to subsist on a diet of gruel? Come  on!22 Rent Guidelines Board members,23 search your conscience, read the reports, and  let24 us have a rent rollback this year. You' ll be very25 glad you did.2 
2 Laissez- faire, mon derrier.3 Any quest ions?4	(Audience participation.)5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you. We6	appreciate  the  compliment .7	MS . VISSER:	The next speaker8	is Roberta Bernstein from  SPONY.9	MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Welcome10 back, Mr . Markus .11 And Members of the Board,  good12 afternoon.13 As President of the  Small14 Property Owners of New York, I am painfully  aware15 of the inadequacy of the Price Index in  relation16 to small owners.17 So I took three small buildings,18 analyzed the data.19 I took data from April 1st  to20 March 31st for the years 2000 - 2001, and 2001 to21 2002.  I compared  fuel , electric , water and real22 estate  tax . These  are actual data.23 I'm going to abbreviate  the24 numbers for brevity  sake.25 Building One : fuel up 117,10 
2 electric down 350, water up 785, tax up 1350.  For3 the four categories the total increase  1901.004	Building Two: fuel up 199,5 electric down 216, water up 182, tax up  1820.00.6 For these four categories the cost increase  1985.7	Building Three: fuel down  712,8 but a new boiler was installed last year  more9 efficient than the old one, electric down  420,10 water up 529, tax up 1598. The total  cost11 increase 994.12 If I include my insurance  costs,13 it would have shown even a more dramatic  increase14 in my operat ing expenses .15 Tenant advocates use the  no16 increase arguments of tenants being evicted  and17 not being able to pay rent. They state  more18 layoffs and more evictions are expected.  No19 actual facts here, just  supposition.20 They say the low rent  supplement21 is a poor tax which they successfully lobbied  and22 had you eliminat e this year.23 Now, if tenants can't or won' t24 pay rent , owners can't pay bills and a snowball25 starts, impacting on multi industries and  often8 
1	1092 culminating in the loss of buildings . No one3 benefits.4	Increases are needed. Fuel  costs5 are already rising and tax and water rates  are6 showing no signs of abating an  increase.7	Put the low rent supplement  back8 into the guidelines. It 's not a poor tax, but a9 fair share tax.10 Small owners need a four and  six11 percent  increase this year.12 Owners help rebuild New York13 City, not those who ask for a free  ride.14 Finally, nowhere in the  Price15 Index does it allow for compensation for  the16 personal t ime and effort small owners put into17 making their buildings safe and well - maintained18 places to live.19 Please give us the increases we20 need to cont inue to do a good job.21 Thank you .22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 Any questions?24 (No response.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 
1	1102 MS . VISSER:	The next speaker3 will be Adele Bender, followed by Jack  Freund.4	A VOICE:	You don't have the5	right order. Something' s wrong.6	A VOICE :	I 'm supposed to be the7	second speaker and you haven' t called my name .8	MS. VISSER:	That 's the way you9	signed in .10	Adele Bender.11	MS. ADELE BENDER :	Okay.12 My name is Adele Bender. I'm  the13 Queensboro Coordinator - - I 'm sorry . Is  this14 okay? I'm the Queensboro Coordinator for  JPAC,15 Joint Public Affairs Committee for Older  Adults,16 and I am a Member of the Metropolitan Council  on17 Housing and of the Queens League of  United18 Tenants.19 Here we go.20 New York, New York is a heck  of21 a town, our rents go up and landlords' costs  go22 down . And in the meantime there are people who23 are paying some of the outrageous rents  like24 $3 ,000 for a one- bedroom, $4,000 for a two-25 bedroom in Manhattan.12 
2 In Queens and in the outer3 boroughs $1,3 00 for a one- bedroom, sometimes even4 a studio, and over $2,000 for a two- bedroom.5	Some can pay that , but in most6 cases there are several people sharing  an7 apartment. Many people have lost their jobs.  In8 many instances their unemployment	is running out9 with no extension in sight.10 Landlords want to increase11 rentals that are less than the above- mentioned12 prices that are already unaffordable for many  New13 York renters.14 Either the tenants will be15 priced out of their apartments to make way  for16 tenants who will have to pay astronomical  rents17 described above, or will have to make  enormous18 sacrifices and pay those rents and/or  share19 living quarters with other peopl e making20 extraordinary demands on their privacy  and21 quality of life.22 There is more than enough  stress23 already.24 What will happen to the  elderly?25 Not all seniors qualify for the Senior  Citizens6 
2 Rent Increase Exemptions . They are very3 vulnerable . What happens to these people?4	The food kitchens, which  are5 inadequately funded as it is, have more and  more6 people coming to them because of the increases  in7 rents . Everyone going to food kitchens is not8 homeless. They are just teetering  on9 homel essness .10 The increases in rents  often11 cause tenants to purchase necessitates such  as12 food , et cetera, on their credit cards throwing13 them into unnecessary debt.14 It is all a vicious cycle .15 Do the landlords want to make16 hay while the sun rises? Is there no end to  these17 constant rent increases? Where will it all  end?18 How high the rents?19 Submitted by Adel e Bender,20 Queensboro Coordinator  for JPAC . Thank you.21 I would like to, if I may,  this22 is something that I had cut out of The New  York23 Times in 1994 and it 's about an elderly person.24 He forages in the back of supermarkets because  -25 - it addressed the health care and the drugs,  and5 
1	1132 also he had an apartment for $300. That was  even3 too much. It addressed a lot of the  social4 issues. If I may give it to  you.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure. The6	gentleman down there will take it .7 MS. ADELE BENDER:	Thank you.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are there any9	questions?10	(No response.)11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I have a12 question, Ms . Bender.13 You indicated in your  testimony14 that not all senior citizens are protected.  Are15 you referring to those that don't qualify  because16 either their rent/income ratio is less than  a17 third or their income is over  - -18 MS. ADELE BENDER:	Both, yes. 19	Over the $20 , 000.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.21 There' s no other reason though.22 They just don't qualify23 MS. ADELE BENDER:	Those are the24 reasons, yes.25 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	- - for the20 
2legislat ion.3MS. ADELE BENDER:Right.45                    And also there' sdisabled people that cannot  work,probablythat may be6under 62 whocan't work and there' s problems with7those peoplealso.8CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I just wanted9to make surethat there wasn' t another reason10 that they weren' t. It 's just that they are not11 eligible for funding under the statute.  Okay.12 Thank you .13 Mr. Freund.14 MS . VISSER:	Mr.  Freund will be15 followed by Parvati Devi , Jimmy Silber, Daniel16 Waxman.17 MR. FREUND :	Thank you, Mr.18 Chairman.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Start20 talking.21 MR. FREUND:	Only22 intermittently, I hope.2 3	For the record , my name is Jack24 Freund. I'm Executive Vice President for the  Rent25 Stabilization Association.  I'm here on behalf of24 
2 about 25,000 members who own or manage a  majority3 of rent stabilized properties.4 And I appreciate the  opportunity5 to comment on guidelines proposed for  rent6 stabilized apartments.7 The proposed two and four8 percent increases are insuff icient to meet costs9 already incurred by owners, let alone  higher10 costs down the road.11 As I've argued elsewhere,  the12 Price Index this year is seriously flawed and  at13 odds with the operating cost increases  that14 common sense requires us to  recognize.15 As an indication of the  true16 direction of operat ing costs, 2001 Income and17 Expense data filed by property owners  and18 analyzed by the New York State Division  of19 Housing for use by the Westchester and  Nassau20 County Rent Guidelines Boards show a 5.5  percent21 operating cost increase in Nassau County and  a22 4.1 percent  increase in Westchester.23 These numbers reflect more24 recent income and expense data than is  available25 for New York City. They show that operat ing costs2 
2 in these adjacent and similar communities  have3 continued to increase, while this year' s4 anomalous Price Index has failed to  capture5 similar cost increases in New York  City.6 Operating costs will increase7 signif icantly in the future. The City budget8 avoids tax increases this year, but all  parties9 acknowledge that such increases cannot be  avoided10 next year.11	Water and sewer charges are12 slated to increase at an even higher rate  of13 eight to nine percent per  year.14 Insurance costs, as many  owners15 will test ify today, are soaring. Other cost16 elements such as labor rates and  professional17 fees are again on the rise after several years  of18 moderate	increase.19 And there are always  entirely20 new cost elements such as the increased  costs21 associated with heightened  levels of building22 security.23 One of the most harmful24 inequities of the present system of  rent25 regulation i s the two-year lease renewal option.12 
2 Owners are saddled with the uncertainties  of3 future increases in operating costs while  most4 tenants lock in a guarant eed two- year rate.5 We agree with the comments  made6 by the Chairman in this regard. The two- year7 lease renewal should be signif icantly higher than8 the one- year adjustment. Owners should not be9 forced to subsidize tenants when operating  costs10 increase more than expected in the second  year.11 Finally, the Board must not  be12 reluctant to finetune the rate- setting process by13 allowing a supplemental adjustment for low- rent14 apartments, as well as an allowance  for15 apartments with long- term occupants.16 I thank you for taking these17 matters  into consideration.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any questions19 for Mr. Freund?20 Yes, Mr. Lubell.21 MR . LUBELL:	Mr.  Freund , can you22 tell us why there is a need for a long- term23 occupancy increase, a special increase based  on24 long - term occupancy?25 MR. FREUND:	Certainly.2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you3 step closer to the mike.4 MR. FREUND:	Sure.5 Historically,  owners have been6 subjected to the vagaries not only of the  two-7 year lease option, but a three-year lease  option8 which is totally unpredictabl e.9 And because tenants  historically10 opted for a two-year lease in a  great11 preponderance  and the two-year option12 historically being less than twice the one -year13 increase, plus the unpredictability  of future14 increases, we have a situat ion where long- term15 tenancies have fallen behind at the rate of  about16 one percent per year.17 That 's the added value of long-18 term tenure in New York by virtue of taking  of19 two and before that three-year lease  renewal20 options.21 So long- term tenancies have22 fallen significantly behind rents where  they23 ought to be. And we believe that there ought  to24 be some leveling of these rents, an  average25 bringing up of the rents so that you have  average6 
2 rents that are closer to meeting operating  and3 financing costs.4 Does that explain your  question,5 answer your question?6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any other7 questions?8 Yes, Mr. Pagan.9	MR. PAGAN:	I just quickly want10 to follow up.11 My understanding is that  this12 long- term tenure , is that , from your viewpoint ,13 it 's better to have a fast turnover in the14 apartment than to have a stable populat ion in the15 building?16 MR. FREUND:	No, I didn' t say17 that at all.18 What we believe would be  better19 in the long term would be to have annual  rent20 increases. We don' t think that this Board ought21 to be in the business of trying to predict  what22 future rates of cost increases are going to  be.23 That 's a losing proposit ion.24 We would prefer, just as we  were25 able to eliminate three-year leases at the  State10 
2 level , we would prefer to have one-year leases3 since tenants have a guaranteed right of  tenure4 in any event , and then the Board could more5 precisely calculat e the real increase in costs6 that owners work under and compensat e those costs7 on a yearly basis.8	That 's all we are trying to9 suggest , is a more accurate means of compensating10 owners for their increased  costs.11 MS. HOLDER:	But how do you12 actually calculate then what that increase  would13 be? What would be your methodology that would  be14 better than what this Board uses in terms of  your15 supplement amount? Because what 's your proposal?16 What are you recommending it  be?17 MR. FREUND:	Are you talking in18 terms of a long- term occupancy adjustment?19 We have put	we have suggested20 that for tenants in constant occupancy for  ten21 years or more prior to this past September  an22 addit ional six percent rent increase in addition23 to the guidelines.24 (Audience participation.)25 MS. HOLDER:	What is that based9 
2	on, the six percent? How do you arrive at  that?3	MR. FREUND:	It ' s actually a4	discount as to what the increase should  be.5	As I said, rents tend to  fall6 behind for long- term occupants at the rate of one7 percent per year . So really the catchup for those8 tenants to put them equivalently to where  you9 would be if you were taking a one -year lease10 renewal would be a ten percent addit ional11 increase.12 But , you know, we are asking for13 a six percent increase, which is less than  is14 justifi ed under the situation .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Do you have16 another question? Go ahead, Mr.  Lubell.17 MR. LUBELL :	Mr . Freund, do you18 think there is anything basically unfair  about19 one tenant paying,  as an example , a  thousand20 dollars a month for the same exact apartment  that21 may be even two floors lower, same line, for  that22 same apartment someone is paying $2000 a  month;23 someone is paying $1000 a month for the  same24 apartment that someone else is paying $2000  a25 month based upon longevity?6 
2 Do you find that there is any3 patent unfairness to this?4	MR. FREUND:	Well , there' s5	unfairness, Mr. Lubell , on a number of levels.6	The inequities that arise  from7 the rent regulation system. One, there  is8 economic unfairness to the owner and to  the9 rental housing stock, that is, when you  have10 long - term occupants and rents are held low, there11 are not necessarily compensat ing high rents in12 the building to average out to an economic  rent13 for the building.14 So there is the economic  - - the15 inequity of an unfair economic consequence to  the16 housing stock.17 Where a owner is able to get18 higher rents to compensate for that low rent ,19 which he has to do in order to maintain  a20 building, and that will happen in strong  market21 areas like the Manhattan core, then you have  a22 situation where you are being unfair to  the23 incoming tenant who is probably a recent  mover24 into the City who now has to pay a premium on  the25 rent for no inherent reason but simply to make  up7 
2 for somebody in the building who is paying a  rent3 that is inherently too low to meet the  operating4 cost of that building.5 So you have unfairness at a6 number of levels.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Those are8	very surprising answers.9	MR. FREUND:	Really?10 (Laughter.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead , Mr.12 Castellano.13 MR. CASTELLANO:	Mr. Freund,14 every year I suggest to the staff that we  have15 testimony from non- profit housing companies16 because frankly I'm very interested in what  the17 average cost is of running an apartment in  New18 York City because at least from my way  of19 thinking if somebody is paying a rent less  than20 some number of average, than that person is  not21 even carrying their own weight. You can  forget22 about prof it and depreciation.23 What in your analysis is  the24 average cost of running an apartment in New  York25 City?10 
1	1242 MR. FREUND:	Well , we've heard3 various testimony. Again, I kind of  dislike4 citing an average cost because one of  the5 probl ems of this system is averaging and doing a6 rough just ice cut for everybody even though the7 housing stock varies tremendously within  the8	system.9	I believe right now we have an10 O&M, an Operating and Maintenance Cost , in the11 area of $450 to $500 an apartment. I think  you've12 had testimony from non-prof its that their13 operating costs are in that area even  with14 reduced taxes or no taxes.15 You add to that the cost of16 financing a building , assuming owners carry some17sort ofmortgage, and you are really up around  an18area of$650 to $700 to maintain and finance  the19averageapartment in New York City.20CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder.21MS.

2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you3 very much.4	MR. FREUND:	Thank you.5	MS. VISSER:	Parvati Devi ,6 followed by Jimmy Silber, followed by  Daniel7 Waxman.8	MR. PARVATI DEVI:	I 'm Parvati9	Devi. Okay.10 We need the rent laws  renewed11 now. It 's time the secret of Pataki be exposed.12 We know he sold out to the real estate  industry.13 We know he continues to do  so.14 Doctors, lawyers can't find an15 affordabl e place to live in this country. This is16 a fact.17 We can't afford to live in  this18 outrageously expensive city. If enough of  us19 become homeless, we prey on the rest of  the20 State. This has to be exposed.21 First , a ten- and- a-half percent22 increase over two years for rent - controll ed23 tenants is an outrage. Who knows what damage  you24 people are going to bring today? I hope  not.25 Here is another little secret10 
2 that extends to most Republicans in this  State.3 They would like to pretend that no one in  this4 State is needy due to a permanent  disability.5 Unlike most progressive European countries  who6 take care of the impecunious and the  disabled,7 our Republican- controlled State Senate treats8 SSI, SSD recipients no different than a  welfare9 recipient.10 How - - this dirty little secret ,11 whil e the Federal government does provide a12 yearly cost of living adjustment yearly,  our13 Republican- controlled Senate has not increased14 the State amount in thirteen  years.15 As an SSI recipient , I  pay16 seventy- five percent of my income on rent. There17 is no rent increase exemption for people  with18 disabilities. After decades of a Democratic  bill19 in the State Senate finally the Republican  Senate20 introduced one and several others co- sponsored.21 Giuliani refused to accept  the22 figures of the Independent Budget Office of  $2.223 million the first year, very little to keep  the24 disabled in their homes.25 Once again it seems like  a2 
2 prejudice against allowing us to live a life  with3 dignity.4 Tomorrow I will be testifying  at5 City Hall at one p. m . on the SCRIE Resolution for6 the Disabled in the Council . Anyone else7 interested please come down.8 The Committee will vote9 immediately and the pressure will cont inue for10 shame that so many people with disabilities  have11 to constantly worry about this basic human  need.12 It is time to know if the Mayor,13 our current Mayor, will be as cruel as  Giuliani.14 Renew the rent laws now.  Pass15 the SCRIE bill for the disabled. We need  this16 immediately.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 Any questions?20 (No response. )21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you22 very much.23 MS. VISSER:	Jimmy Silber,24 followed by Daniel Waxman, followed by Ed  Korman.2 
25 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	H .  I
I'm Jimmy
2 Silber . I represent SPONY, which is the Small3 Properties Owners of New York.4	And our owners, many of  them5	have buildings with ten/f ifteen units.	And the6 fact that this Board has not permitted a  low-7 rent adjustment in the past two years brings  to8 highlight the tremendous disadvantage that  small9 owners have with small buildings where they don' t10 have vacancies.11 Many of our owners have12 ten/f ifteen unit buildings in prime locations in13 Manhattan, a block from Central Park, and  they14 have rent stabilized tenants who have been  in15 place for twenty- five years or longer. Their16 rents are well below market.17 And it is the owners,  the18 individual man or the individual woman who  owns19 that building, who has to subsidize those  tenants20 who are living there.21 Rent stabilization is a  subsidy22 and it 's a subsidy that 's not shared by the23 society or by the government. It 's a subsidy24 that 's put on the shoulders of the individual man25 or woman who owns the building, regardless  of6 
2 whether the tenant in place even needs  the3 subsidy.4 And that 's what 's so inequitable5 about this system. That 's where our owners are6 hurting. That 's where our owners have to dig into7 their own resources to keep a building  going8 because they are supporting tenants in place  for9 long periods of time who can afford to pay more .10 So what we suggest is equity.  We11 suggest trying to make the system fairer .12 No owner wants to penalize  long-13 term tenants just because they have been  in14 place. They add stability to the  building.15 But on the other hand, why16 should the individual man or woman who owns  the17 building be penalized for having to support  those18 tenants because they lived there a long  time19 under an inequitable rent regulatory  system?20 So what we propose is a21 longevity allowance that this Board should  start22 to consider. And that longevity allowance  could23 work in this way .24 If a tenant is in place for more25 than ten years, his rent is less than $800,  and2 
2 his income is more than $50,000 a year,  that3 tenant doesn' t deserve to not have extra costs4 given to him.5 Now the New York State DHCR6 already has a plan in effect where owners  can7 challenge tenants' incomes and  deregulate8 apartments. That could be carried on through  a9 longevity allowance asked for by the  Rent10 Guidelines Board .11 It's a way of thinking for the12 future of making this system more equitabl e.13 If people don' t deserve to have14 a rent regulatory subsidy, if they earn  over15 $50,000 a year, then there should be a way  for16 those people to get extra longevity increases of ,17 say, $25 a year in addition to the  rent18 guidelines' increases, if they have been in  place19 for more than ten years.20 That 's a system that would make21this whole rentregulatory process more22equitable .23CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24Perfect t iming.You can tell he' s a professional25witness.
2 (Audience participation.)3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any4 questions?5 Mr . Lubell .6 MR . LUBELL:	Mr. Silber, your7 organization represents small owners . We 've had8 testimony reflecting that small owners pay  a9 disproportionate burden or have  a10 disproportionate burden of real estate taxes .11 Could you comment on that  or12 amplify that?13 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Well , the14 highest percentage of an operating budget is  real15 estate taxes . For some buildings it 's as high as16 one - third.17 So in terms of disproportionate18 share , I don't know exactly what you mean. In19 terms of how the Rent Guidelines Board  counts20 costs and looks at real estate taxes as  a21 component of the Price Index, I think it  severely22 undermeasures what owners pay for real  estate23 taxes.24 MR . LUBELL :	Another  thing  is do25 the small owners have the same access  to4 
2 certiorari attorneys who tradit ionally have been3 very effective in reducing the assessment on  a4 building?5 I would think that many of the6 certiorari attorneys do not want to work  for7 small buildings. Has that been your  experience?8	MR. JIMMY SILBER:	You know,9 small owners with ten units are in a way at  a10 disadvantage  in the entire marketplace	for11 running a building. They are at a  disadvantage12 for trying to get better prices on oil.  They're13 at a disadvant age for trying to get better prices14 from plumbers. They're at a disadvantage  when15 they have to go for legal  advice.16 They're not  - - small owners17 don' t represent a lot of funds for a lot of these18 organizat ions and , as a result , they pay the19 highest prices for each of these  categories.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .21 Ms. Holder.22 MS. HOLDER:	How many units23 would be affected by your proposal , this24 longevity increase, longevity  tax?25 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	How many9 
2	units in New York City?3 MS. HOLDER:	Yes.4 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	I don't know.5 I don' t know how many tenants have rent6 stabilized leases for longer than a  ten-year7 period . We have to find that out from DHCR.8 All I know is that in the  small9 buildings there is very little turnover.  There10 are very little vacancy allowances. Tenants  stay11 in place. With succession laws being very  strong12 for tenants to be able to pass on  apartments,13 tenants stay in place.14 You know, if you look at the15 increases, if a tenant has taken a two-year  lease16 every year since 1985 - -17 (There was an alarm interruption18 in the proceedings.)19 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Okay.20 Ms. Holder, why don' t you repeat21 your question.22 MS. HOLDER:	I wanted to know if23 Mr. Silber had figured how many units would  be24 affected.25 A VOICE:	We can't hear you.5 
2	MS. HOLDER :	You can't hear me?3 A VOICE:	No.4 MS. HOLDER:	I wanted to know5 from Mr. Silber if SPONY had figured out how  many6 units would be affected , and also, you know, with7 this longevity tax, and also are people  subject8 to it every year thereafter so ten,  eleven,9 twelve,  thirteen  - - you say after  folks have been10 in place after ten years. So they would  be11 subject to this supplemental longevity tax  for12 each year?13 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	For each14 period of their renewal , whether it be a one-15 year or two-year renewal .16 MS. HOLDER:	So forever. So17 cont inuous forever .18 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Well , every19 year the Board will decide, just like the  low20 rent adjustment. That 's not forever. We haven' t21 had it for the last year.22 MS. HOLDER:	So you won' t answer23 the question about how many units would  be24 affected by this?25 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Well , we see5 
2 that in smaller buildings of ten to fifteen  units3 that there is no turnover. Tenants stay  forever.4 And that really is a drain on the  building.5 The owners cannot possibly6 continue operating those buildings unless  they7 have outside jobs so that they can put money  into8 those buildings.9	And the inequity here is, you10 know, if a person needs a subsidy, fine. But if  a11 person  - - we have  so many  instances where tenants12 have better jobs than the owners of  the13 buildings. The tenants are lawyers, doctors  and14 they are making more money each year than  the15 owners of the buildings. And yet the owner  is16 subsidizing the tenant. That is  crazy.17 Why should that be? Just because18 somebody that has lived in an apartment  for19 twenty years, that he deserves to be  subsidized20 by the individual man or woman who owns  the21 building?	That' s not right.22 All we want to do is make  the23 system fair. If that person is a low- income24 person, we picked $800 and a $50 , 000 income25 because it would be twenty- five percent of the10 
2 yearly income, which is a national  standard.3 If a tenant is paying $400  in4 rent and is making $100,000 a year, why should  he5 be given this rent regulatory bonus and  subsidy6 that is provided  solely - - the burden is   solely7 provided by the person who owns the  building.8 That 's inequitable.9 And there is a way to make  it10 more fair. There is a system already in  place11 with the State for deregulating high  income12 apartments that could easily be incorporated  into13 a procedure locally with the Rent  Guidelines14 Board and it could be applied to people who  have15 been  in - -  solely for peopl e who have been in16 place for a long time, just to see whether,  yes,17 you are in need of this rent subsidy. And if  you18 are not in need of the rent subsidy, then you  get19 a $25 extra increase.20 It helps the owner maintain  the21 building. It doesn' t even hurt the tenant. The22 tenant is a high income earning tenant .23 That 's all we ask, is to make24 the system equitable.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Carmody2 
2	has a question.3	MR. CARMODY:	I would just like4 to know how many units you represent and  what5 percentage  approximately are regulated.6	MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Almost all of7	our owners have regulated units.8	MR. CARMODY:	And how many units9	as a whole?10 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	We have about11 five hundred owners throughout the five  boroughs12 which would ,  I would  say, come to probably13 somewhere between 7,000 and 10,000  units.14 MR. CARMODY:	And the percentage15 regulated?16 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	The17 percentage regulated? I would say probably  ninety18 percent.19 MR. CARMODY:	Thank you20 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	With a lot of21 rent control , rent stabilized and rent22 controlled.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Rivera.24 MR. RIVERA:	Mr. Silber, are25 you aware that the brownstones  in Harlem, which10 
1	1382 are shells, are selling for $400, 000 and3 $500,000? Are you aware of that?4	MR . JIMMY SILBER:	If you tell5	me that , I believe it .6	MR. RIVERA:	Well then the next7 question is, have you been advising people  that8 you represent to sell in this particular  market9 if they can't make it like any businessman?10 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	You see, that11 - -  SPONY is a group of people who own  buildings12 not because they were investors, not because  they13 were speculators in New York City real  estate.14 Most of our owners live in  the15 buildings that they own. They are our homes.  And16 a lot of us inherited our buildings.  Our17 grandparents  were  the original  owners . They've18 been passed down to our parents and they  have19 been passed down to their  children.20 And a lot of our owners are21 immigrants. A lot of owners  - -  the ownership of22 buildings in SPONY crosses the rainbow of  New23 York. It's blacks, it 's Puerto Ricans, it ' s24 peopl e from the Caribbean, it 's people from25 Poland, it ' s people from Russia. It 's everybody7 
2 who came to the City who wanted to realize  the3 American dream and thought about buying a  small4 building. And they thought about buying  it5 because primarily they wanted space  for6 themselves and their families .7 And that was the initial8 incentive for why people invested in New York  in9 the same owner category.10 And what they inherited  were11 rent regulated tenants in their buildings  with12 them. And, you know, that ' s the situation of what13 the small ownership consists  of.14 For me to go out and say,  you15 know, you've l ived in your building for ten16 years, you've raised your children there  and17 you're subsidizing your tenants, so sell  your18 building, that 's not a logical response to these19 owners.20 (Audience participation.)21 MR. RIVERA:	Mr. Silber, isn't22 that a business decision? You' re saying that they23 bought the building with their eyes  opened24 knowing what they were confronted with. And  they25 have a building now which they are managing.  And2 
2 you're saying they can't meet the  cost.3 Like any other businessman,  the4 question is do you stay or do you get  out.5 And in this market why wouldn' t6 you advise your own owners to sell?7 (Audience participation.)8 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Because they9 don' t  - - where will they go? They' ll have to buy10 another piece of property.11 (Audience participat ion. )12 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	You know,13 this market of owning a building and making  it14 worth is not like - -15 (Audience participat ion.)16 MR . JIMMY SILBER:	- - any other17 market  because  if you own a building	- -18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.19 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	- - your costs20 are not - -21 (Audience participation.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.23 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	- - your24 costs and your expenses are not regulated as  is25 every other business, like owning a grocery   store2 
2 in New York . But your income is completely3 regulated unlike every other business in  New4 York .5 A grocery store can raise  prices6 if they are going through a period where  they7 have extraordinary expenses .8 An owner of a rent  stabilized9 building cannot raise rents if he  has10 extraordinary expenses.11 So that 's the difference. A lot12 of these owners bought these buildings ten  years13 ago when things were better. But because of  rent14 stabilization, because of long- term tenants who15 are constantly being given this subsidy of  paying16 the low market rents, owners have not been  able17 to keep up with it . They don't have the resources18 for emergency repairs.19 If the sidewalk cracks one20 winter and an owner has to pay $15,000 to  replace21 the sidewalk, he can't ask the tenants to  recoup22 any of that .23 He has to take all of that  money24 out of savings that he has . That 's why it has25 become so diff icult.2 
1	1422	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr . Lubell3 has another question .4 (Audience part icipation .)5	MR . LUBELL :	Mr . Silber, I'm6	sure you're aware that when Mr. Rivera   - -7 A VOICE:	We can't hear you .8 MR . LUBELL:	- - when Mr. Rivera  9 ment ioned that townhouses are being sold for10 $500,000, those townhouses are  individually11 occupied and if  it ' s someone' s principal12 residence , you have a deduction of $250,000 for13 an  individual ,  $500,000  deduction, exemption14 rather, for a married  couple.15 The buildings  you represent ,16 SPONY, are not single- family residences which  are17 principally owned by an individual.  Someone18 selling your building may not be able to pay  the19 taxes because if they've owned it for a  while,20 they may have exhausted depreciat ion, and they21 would have substantial taxes to pay without that  22	$250,000 or $500 , 000 deduction.23 And so it 's apples and pears;24 isn't that correct?25 MR . JIMMY SILBER:	Yes, that 's23 
1	1432 correct.3 And I think it 's just totally4 inappropriate for somebody to suggest to an  owner5 who bought a small building for a place to  raise6 his family, who has put time and equity into  that7 building, to say, well , you can't afford it any8 more to subsidize these rent regulated  tenants,9 so sell your building.10 That is totally inappropriate.11 This is the owner' s home .12 (Audience participation.)13 A VOICE:	If you can't make a14 living, sell it.15 MR. LUBELL:	Your building' s in16 Far Rockaway, your building' s in the South Bronx,17 your building' s in some parts of Crown Heights  in18 Brooklyn, are they going to get eight to  ten19 t imes the rent?20 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	I doubt it.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Rivera22 wants to respond.23 MR. RIVERA:	I just want - -24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And then I go25 to Mr. Pagan and then Mr. Castellano. You' re a2 
1	1442	popular witness, Mr. Silber.3	MR. RIVERA:	I just want to make 4 the clarification .5 Mr. Lubell ment ioned that I had6 stated that a brownstone that is occupied  goes7 for $500 , 000. These are shells. These are not8 occupant - owned. 9 The occupant - owned are far more 10	than $500,000.11 (Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Pagan.13 MR. PAGAN:	I just have a few14 questions because I'm trying to understand  the15 whol e thing.16 Would you say that a building17 that has a mixed tenancy is better than one  that18 has a single tenancy?19 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	A building20 that has a mixed tenancy?21 MR. PAGAN:	Yes.22 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	What do you23 mean by mixed tenancy?24 MR. PAGAN:	Mixed tenancy25 meaning having different types of incomes  or11 
2 different types of ethnicities or combined in  the3 building.4	MR. JIMMY SILBER:	As opposed to5	everybody paying the same rent?6	MR. PAGAN :	As opposed to7 everybody is on the same type of economic  sphere8 or race.9	MR. JIMMY SILBER:	You know, I10 believe  in the free market . I believe  that  if11 there were no rent regulation, then prices  would12 settle all over the City according to  location.13 Location is always what14 determines the value of real estate in any  city15 that has no rent regulation.16 MR. PAGAN:	Besides that. We are17 going to have rent regulat ion for a while.18 My issue is that you are  asking19 people who make $50 , 000 and over and pay $800 to20 not pay two percent or four percent but pay  eight21 or ten percent depending on whatever the  rent22 guideline is and that you pay that every time  a23 new lease comes up.24 This applies to families  that25 have more choices in a building and probably  are10 
2 the most likely to move away, moving down then  to3 a lower economic sphere where you are going  to4 have difficulty refilling those apartments in  the5 long run.6 So I don't know whether this7 proposal  that you are putting  together  - - in the8 short run it sounds great , you know, here' s a way9 of increasing our income. Over the long period  of10 time you may just have a one size or one  economic11 group who are not able to meet your payments  or12 one that is going to be a higher turnover  giving13 you more headaches in reference to repairs  and14 maintenance.15 I just don' t know if - - like I16 said , in the short run it sounds great. In the17 long run I think  it ' s something  that owners,18 small homeowners, should think  about.19 MR . JIMMY SILBER:	Well , I think20 in theory what you say may be accurate.  In21 practice it 's not.22 Because there' s such a disparity23 today between the rent of the rent  stabilized24 tenant who has been in place for twenty years  and25 what the market rent is, no matter what area  of2 
2	New York he lives in.3	If you have a tenant who has4 been  - - who had an apartment  $300 in 1995 and  he5 took two-year renewals each year, he would  have6 effectively had about a $10 increase in rent  each7 year .8 MR. PAGAN:	Yes.9 MR . JIMMY SILBER:	His rent10 today is so far below market that even with  your11 two percent or four percent for a one and  two-12 year lease, if you added a $25  longevity13 allowance to that if he made over $50,000 and  if14 he paid less than $800 in rent , he would still15 have a rent that is so far below market that  he16 would never consider leaving that  apartment.17 But what it would effectively  do18 is help the owner of that building maintain  his19 units.20 MR . PAGAN:	What I see in21 Will iamsburg is that as a family moves in that22 could afford , they force - -  the owners force  the23 ones that protest through some harassment  action24 for non- service. And that 's really the problem25 that I see in many of these  actions.10 
  2 MR . JIMMY SILBER :	Well , you3 know, harassment  is a totally different story.4 No owner approves of harassment5 and there are strong laws6 (Audience participation .)7 MR . JIMMY SILBER :	There are8 strong laws - -9 (Audience participation .)10 MR . JIMMY SILBER:	Owners in11 SPONY do not approve harassment. And there  are12 strong laws in the City to punish owners  who13 violate the laws .14 Harassment	laws should not be - 1516 (Audience participation.)17 MR . JIMMY SILBER :	- - a threat18 when you' re considering a longevity allowance as19 ways of making the system more equitabl e .20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Just one more21 question on this, Mr . Castellano, and we' re going22 to move ahead.2 3MR. CASTELLANO:Mr . Chair,24thank you .25But I'm confused. Mr . Rivera
2 asked Mr . Silber a quest ion and Mr. Silber3 answered it. But I didn' t understand the4 question.5 Mr. Rivera made a  suggestion6 that if the owner can't afford to pay his  bills,7 the owner could sell the  building.8 But rent regulation moves  with9 the ownership. The rents won' t change. So we' re10 making Person A' s probl em Person B' s problem. But11 the problem exists .12 And we are here to discuss13 public policy  issues .14 I don't think now telling15 somebody to sell their building  solves a problem.16 It transfers a problem.17 (Audience participation.)18 MR . RIVERA:	Mr.  Chairman?19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Rivera.20 MR . RIVERA :	To make a21 clarif ication,22 (Audience part icipation .)2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could we have24 some quiet .25 Listen, everybody hear who  wants24 
2 to speak, who wants to speak is entitl ed to3 speak. We need to have quiet in the  audience.4	All right. I don't mind if5 peopl e applaud or laugh or whatever or clap . But6 we need to have quiet in the audience so we  can7 get the business done and everybody who is  here8 who wants to speak can speak because we are  going9 to be done today . And if you don't get to speak,10 you're going to be all day and you're not  going11 to be happy .12 So let' s have some decorum.13 Mr. Rivera.14 MR. RIVERA:	I just want to15 clarify the comment that was made. It wasn' t a16 question, just a comment that I say that a  person17 should sell. And I did not have a  question18 addressed to Mr. Silber. I did ask Mr.  Silber19 whether he advises his clients to sell in  this20 part icular market .21 And I will say that even  though22 the rents remain the same , the prices would not23 be that high if there weren' t buyers buying them.24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay. Okay.5 
2 There' s no response.3 Last question hopefully .4 MS . HOLDER:	I just want this5 on the record.6 (Audience participation.)7 MS. HOLDER:	I just want to8 bring up one point as a point of  clarification9 that the retaliatory evict ion of harassment	laws10 here in New York are very weak and very  difficult11 to do.12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. HOLDER:	For those who have14 to go to buildings on a daily basis, it  just15 doesn' t work and  it doesn 't work  in the courts16 and  it ' s extremely weak . And we train our17 attorneys to understand that as they go in  for18 defenses for tenants.19 But I just had a question . I20 understand that there are issues of public  policy21 that my colleague, Mr . Castellano, was talking22 about .23 But to me it just seems  like24 there is a constant shift ing on landlords' part.25 I know that it 's your responsibility to make sure2 
2 that you for your members, SPONY, get as  much3 revenue into their hands as  possible.4 But I just don' t understand why5 you think the best way to do it is on the  backs6 of tenants in the same way that so many folks  who7 are members of SPONY are talking - - these are our8 homes, we have ten and fifteen units, and we  are9 not big- time landlords, we need this money, and10 where else would we go, these are our  homes11 these are the homes of thousands of people  who12 live in your units.13 And I was thinking that you  all14 would appreciate the longevity. And my concern  is15 how is it that you can still justify this kind  of16 shift ing for revenue on the people who are17 supposedly your neighbors that you live with  that18 you would care about or should care  about.19 (Audience participation.)20 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Well , I don't21 understand what you mean by shifting of  revenue22 because there is no other way for an owner to  get23 income from his building  - -24 MS. HOLDER:	I mean, I 'm talking25 policy issues that are not before this Board.  We2 
2 need to talk about maybe how we can get you  all3 property tax relief. That 's not an issue that 's4 before this Board and maybe that would be  the5 best way.6 Maybe that 's even a more7 responsible way that we can all work together  as8 New Yorkers to help you all out , your diverse9 members in your trade association, as well  as10 helping people who are their neighbors and  also11 the folks they pay rent to.12 So what I'm asking though  is,13 what  is before  the Board ,  I certainly hope14 there' s no longevity tax, and how do they truly15 justify trying to create this additional  revenue16 off of the backs of your tenants who you  are17 telling me are oftentimes these folks  are18 neighbors and people that , you know, rubbing up19 against in the hallway on a daily basis. Not  just20 their landlords, but they' re neighbors; right?21 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	That 's22 absolutely right.23 And all we are asking for  is24 equity in the system.25 If a person lives next door  and2 
1	1542 he rents an apartment of mine, and he' s a doctor3 and he makes $100,000 a year and he has a  rent4 stabilized rent of $400 and the market is  $700,5 why should I be subsidizing him for that  extra6 $300? Why can't he pay a little bit more? He' s7 not in need.8	I agree with you. I completely9 agree with you. All the owners in SPONY  agree10 with you, that tenants in need need to  be11 protect ed. We are not asking to bump up rents on12 tenants in need. But let us free up those  that13 don' t need it.14 Why is rent regulation given  out15 willy- nilly to anybody who happens to live in an16 apartment before a certain  date?17 Shouldn't there be some18 recognition of need on that tenant 's part?19 Shouldn' t there be some recognition of how much20 that tenant earns before he gets a subsidy,  again21 a subsidy that solely puts a burden on  the22 individual owner who owns the building?	It 's not23 a government subsidy.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,25 Mr. Silber. Thank you.9 
2 (Audience participation. )3 MS. VISSER:	The next speaker is4 Daniel Waxman, to be followed by Ed Korman, to  be5 followed by Faith Steinberg.6 Mr. Waxman.7 MR. DANIEL WAXMAN:	My name is8	Daniel Waxman. I'm a tenant and a member of   JPAC.9	Each year landlords ask for10 large rent increases. This year their costs  have11 decreased for the first time. So they have  no12 right to demand rent  increases.13 To the contrary, rents should  be14 rolled back three- and - a-half percent	for one-15 year leases and 1.75 percent for two- year leases.16 If the Board wants to be fair  to17 tenants, they will not permit increases in  rents18 but roll back rents because of the decreased   cost19 for landlords.20 It is important that rent21 control and rent stabilization laws be  renewed22 this year until 2008.23 Vacancy decontrol should  be24 eliminated. This law has drast ically reduced the25 affordable housing stock in New York City  and10 
2 increases the chronic housing shortage in  our3 City .4 This  law affects low- income ,5 moderate and middle - income families. Rent control6 and rent stabilization should be strengthened  to7 protect seniors and the disabled , the population8 least likely to afford rent  increases.9 Other reforms are needed  as10 well. Reforming the Major Capital  Improvement11 program to protect seniors and the disabled  from12 unfair rent increases.13 To summarize, no rent  increase14 for the landlords this year but rent  rollbacks.15 Renew rent control and rent16 stabilization laws until 2008 so we don' t have to17 go through this rigmarol e every few years.18 And strengthen the rent  control19 and rent stabilization  laws.20 We should eliminate vacancy21 decontrol for the reasons which I just  gave.22 (Audience participat ion.)2 3	MR. DANIEL WAXMAN:	Reform the24 Major Capital Improvement system so the  disabled25 will not be subject to unfair rent  increases.24 
1	1572 The Senior Citizen Rent  Increase3 Exemption program should be extended to  non-4 seniors with disabiliti es.5 We would appreciat e that the6 Board seriously consider our  requests.7 Thank you.8 (Audience participation.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,10	Mr. Waxman.11	MS. VISSER:	Mr. Korman.12 MR. ED KORMAN:	My name is Ed13 Korman. I'm the Executive Vice President of  Small14 Property Owners of New York.15 I'm going to continue but I'm16 not going to say a whole lot of speech  like17 everybody else did.18 But nobody wants to take  into19 real ity what 's really going on in our City.20 In the high density areas,  in21 Bushwick and in the South Bronx, insurance  costs22 have increased. And I've submitted everything  to23 your agency through Mr. Castellano, bills  and24 documents to show that the insurance  has25 increased one hundred and twenty- five percent.12 
2 I also submitted documents that3 fuel oil and natural gas did go down thirty- six4 percent this year. But the year before it went  up5 three hundred percent.6 Also in the high density  areas7 nobody wants to realize that when one family  of8 three moves in, you wind up with nine people.  And9 nine people to use heat and hot water and  abuse10 the facilit ies is not a good deal .11 You don't have  - - you can't12 include safeties for boilers, oil  tanks,13 registrations, fines for not filing because  the14 City forgot to bill you, misbillings by  the15 agencies.16 You people, I don't know how17 many of you are actually in City government , but18 I would advise you, in order to give everybody  a19 fair and equitable situation, you have to  come20 out to the street with us.21 Real estate taxes in the  high22 density areas are out of whack because on  Park23 Avenue these guys are making a big bundle  with24 the free market rents and we' re making nothing.25 Do we include  - - Ms. Holder, as2 
2 far as in court , did you ever go to the court3 system? Did you ever see when someone doesn' t pay4 the rent for four months, they get six months  and5 then nine months after and you have to  forgive6 all the rent?7 How can we pay all of these8 increases and pay all these bills when we  don't9 get rent?10 So whatever we think we' re going11 to get - - whatever we' re going to get is going to12 support all the increases that we are  getting13 from the City.14 And I think that we are  entitled15 to all of this.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right.17 Are you done?18 Ms. Holder, first.19 MS. HOLDER:	I don' t have a20 question. I just wanted to respond .21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.22 Respond .2 3	MS. HOLDER:	I 'm an attorney24 and I go to Housing Court and I've been going  to25 Housing Court since 1991. And I'm familiar  with24 
2 the Housing Court system.3 And I would be more than  happy4 to talk you about my experiences in the  Housing5 Court system.6 And right now I do  citywide7 representation  so I'm obviously very familiar8 with all of the Housing Courts in the  different9 boroughs. And they vary  greatly.10 But I would be more than  happy11 to make myself available to talk to  you.12 And I mean it sincerely, and  I'm13 not saying this sarcastically. You know, I  get14 frustrated with the court system on behalf of   the15 tenants .16 And so I'm more than happy  to17 talk to you and share  experiences.18 MR. ED KORMAN:	But how much19 money do you really think is lost and   forfeited20 in Housing Court that should go to run  the21 buildings when we get fines for rubbish?  Who22 dirties the sidewalks? The landlords or  the23 tenants? They have no respect for  anybody.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right.25 MR. ED KORMAN:	It's an2 
2 inequitable  situation. And  I ' ll take you up on3 that to have a discussion on how to do it .4	MS. HOLDER:	I'm more than happy5 to discuss it. And I don't want to take up a  lot6 of time, Mr. Chair.7	But I would also say, I mean8 just so that you understand my position, is  that9 the cases that we  see in Housing  Court , it  always10 seems to be about money and it doesn' t seem to be11 about anything else.12 And we have very difficult  times13 trying to enforce the violations and the  Housing14 Court regulations before the judges that , you15 know, that are appointed in those  positions.16 But I'm more than happy to  talk17 about it. I just have a different  perspective.18 This makes up my experience,  but19 I take very seriously, you know, your  concerns.20 I'm more than happy to take the time to  talk21 about the issues.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,23 Mr. Korman .24 MS . VISSER:	Faith Steinberg,25 to be followed by Chris  Athineos.8 
2 MS . FAITH STEINBERG:	Lady, at3 long last , and gentlemen:4 I 'm a native New Yorker and  I5 love this City, but this great City is  gradually6 being diminished by the real estate  industry.7 Part of this greatness is  its8 diversity - rich, middle class, poor, artists  of9 every variety as well as Wall Streeters .10 But it is becoming less diverse11 as affordabl e housing is disappearing. Greedy12 landlords - and I would like to remind some  of13 you that greed is one of the deadly sins  -14 (Audience participation .)15 MS . FAITH STEINBERG:	- - greedy16 landlords are going into low and middle- income17 areas displacing people and  creating18 homel essness.19 I hold this Board partially20 responsible for this situation for allowing  the21 breakdown of our rent laws and for the high  rent22 increases.23 If you have no compassion  for24 those less fortunate, do it out of  enlightened25 self - interest . If there are people out there  with2 
1	1632 no homes or living in squalor and  crowded3 situat ions, while others are living in trumped4 towers, it is not a safe situation for me or  you5 or your families.6 Also, we need new businesses  in7 the City but they won' t start up here because8 there is so little affordable housing.  Companies9 have  low and middle- income  employees -10 recept ionists, mail clerks - they need affordable11 places to live .12 Businesses try to pay as  little13 as possible and landlords want to charge as  much14 as possible and the poorest are the ones that  are15 squeezed while the fat cats get  fatter.16 One member of this Board  every17 year insists that the upkeep of an  apartment18 costs $450 a month. Who are you kidding? If  my19 landlord is any indication, it 's more like $450 a20 year .21 Besides, I know the lying  and22 cheat ing that goes on. I've worked in the23 business world and I can testify to that ; jacked24 up bills and withholding of rent checks at  the25 end of the fiscal year to avoid paying taxes  and2 
1	1642 making it look as though there are less prof its3 and maybe even loses.4 By today' s news you can see this5 is really the American way.6 As far as the anecdotal  evidence7 I hear of the diff iculties of small landlords,8 there are tenant stories of monstrous  landlords9 that can be told a hundred times  over.10 Finally, a partial solution  to11 this housing crisis is to work to restore  Federal12 money for subsidized housing to the pre- Reagan13 era.14 You are urged to roll back  the15 exorbit ant increases of the prior years and16 certainly no increases.17 Thank you.18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Chriq21 At hineos, followed by Regina Shanley, and Dennis22 Gittens will follow Regina  Shanley.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.24 MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	My name is25 Christopher Athineos, and I am a small  property2 
1	1652 owner from Brooklyn. My family lives in  and3 operates the properties which we own. And I  am4 here today to urge you to vote for  guideline5 increases that keep with your mission and  purpose6 as Members of the Rent Guidelines Board, that  is,7 to preserve and maintain rental housing  for8 renters in New York.9	The proposed increases of  two10 and four percent do not even begin to address  the11 skyrocketing costs that we have endured over  the12 past year. This year has been the  most13 devastating with the high cost of  insurance.14 My most recent insurance  policy15 was renewed in December 2001 which went  from16 $19,359 to $39,320 , an increase of one hundred17 and three percent .18 I am now looking for quotes  in19 June for my renewal this December because it 's so20 diff icult to even find insurance after September21 11th. And it 's now not uncommon for property22 owners to be hit with insurance increases  of23 three to four hundred percent.24 Everyone must share the  burden25 of this expense. And it 's much more diff icult for10 
2 us, the small property owners, to bear since  we3 don't have the resources to endure  such4 increases.5 So far I have only mentioned6 insurance as a skyrocketing cost , but it is7 unfair that the PIOC doesn' t take into account8 the frequency of a certain  cost.9 The Board looks only at the10 incremental increase of legal fees, for  instance,11 from one year to the next , but does not examine12 the frequency to which we employ an attorney  or13 the frequency to which we are in  court.14 Most recently, I prevailed on  a15 case against a nuisance tenant which I have  been16 litigating since 1985. This tenant had  an17 accumulation of garbage and debris pil ed in her18 apartment from floor to ceiling , so much so that19 there was only a one- foot wide path in the20 apartment to walk.21 The stench was so bad that  the22 health and building departments were called  in23 and they placed a violat ion in 1989 on me, the24 owner of the building, for a violation that  was25 indisputably caused by the  tenant.2 
2 This tenant manipulated  the3 court system and judges for years. And since  the4 judges are so reluctant to enforce the laws,   they5 gave her countless opportunities to clean up   her6 apartment. After each opportunity the court  gave7 her, the condition reoccurred, hence  the8 nuisance .9 Finally, when the stench became10 unbearable, every tenant in the building  came11 down to court to testify against this tenant.  And12 at long last justice was finally done and  the13 tenant was evicted.14 But at what cost? Over the  last15 seventeen years I've spent over $100,000 in  legal16 fees to evict this tenant and thousands  of17 dollars in lost rent from tenants who  vacated18 their apartments because of the  stench.19 The PIOC does not take this  into20 consideration.21 Lastly, properties which  are22 older require much greater maint enance than a23 buil ding that was built say thirty years ago.  Try24 a building like mine that was built over  a25 hundred and fifty years ago. If you expect   owners2 
2 to do their job in providing tenants a decent ,3 safe place for people to live, then you  must4 provide rent increases that are consistent  with5 that goal.6 I recommend that the Board7 approve  increases of eight percent  for a one -8 year lease,9 (Audience participation.)10 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:11 ten percent  for a two-year lease;12 (Audience participat ion.)13 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:14 and a fair share surcharge of $20 on  apartments15 that rent below $600 a month.16 You can't equate low rent17 (Audience participat ion.)18 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:19 with low income. I have plenty of tenants,  you20 know, from my personal experience, with  rents21 below $600 who have incomes above  $40,000.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.23 Mr. Castellano, any  questions?24 MR. CASTELLANO:	I have a25 couple, Mr. Chair.2 
2	CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Okay.3	MR. CASTELLANO:	I would like to4 ask about the nuisance tenant to begin  with.5 How was the nuisance tenant6 represented in court?7	MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:	Back8 in 1985 several times for several years she  was9 represented by Legal Aid . I had to pay my10 attorney, but she didn' t have to pay anything to11 The Legal Aid Society, and manipulated	the court12 system and the judges also13 MR. CASTELLANO;	So Legal Aid14 responded with tax dollars supporting this lady' s15 posit ion of maintaining a nuisance in the16 building while you got a code  violation.17 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:	Yes.18 MR. CASTELLANO:	Thank you very19 much.20 I have another question about21 insurance coverage , more of a monetary type of22 question, now that I know where all my  tax23 dollars are spent .24 Your insurance coverage25 basically  doubled - -	your  cost basically8 
2doubled.3MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:4Right .5MR. CASTELLANO:	Did the6	insurance carrier compel any change in  the7 policy?8 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:	Now9 they're - - now when I 'm  looking for renewal  now,10 they are eliminating coverage for lead paint .11 MR. CASTELLANO:	Well , in12 December did they have a  change?13 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:	No.14 MR. CASTELLANO: Did you make  any15 changes - -16 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:	No.17 MR.  CASTELLANO:	- - in the18 policy to increase your  cost?19 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:	No,20 I didn' t increase my coverage. It was apples and21 apples, the same exact thing, a hundred and  three22 perc ent increase.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any24 questions?25 (No response.)9 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,3 sir. We appreciate it.4	MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:	Thank5	you.6	MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Our next7 speaker is Regina Shanley, followed by  Dennis8 Gittens, to be followed by Clare  Dockery.9	MS. REGINA SHANLEY:	Good10	afternoon.11	My name is Regina Shanley. I'm a12 tenant in a rent stabilized apartment in  the13 Woodside, Sunnyside, Long Island City area  of14 Queens.15 This neighborhood is a source  of16 pride to its residents . There are some four17 generation  families, many three generation18 families, and many long - t ime residents who live19 with newcomers.20 This has always been a working21 class neighborhood. The people have a true  work22 ethic. They are nurses, fire- fighters, mechanics,23 clerical workers and teachers. They are not  CEOs,24 they' re not Donald Trumps or Bill Gates.25 They are, however, the people12 
2 who keep the businesses of the CEOs and  the3 Donald Trumps and Bill Gates running and  help4 keep the economy going.5 The neighborhood  currently is6 facing a crisis, housing costs. The price  of7 houses being built has gone beyond anyone in  the8 neighborhood being able to afford them. The  price9 of rent has gone so high, it 's gone to be unable10 to afford it.11 Senior citizens in controlled12 apartments are seeing large rent increases  and13 fuel surcharges, and in stabilized apartments  the14 rent increases are higher than the cost of  living15 increases.16 Young couples with or17 anticipating families cannot afford $1600  to18 $1800 for a two-bedroom  apartment.19 A college graduate working  for20 four or five years as an administrative  assistant21 making $27,000 or $28,000 a year cannot  afford22 $800 to $1000 a month for a studio  apartment.23 Others, such as peopl e on24 disability, and that includes me, cannot  afford25 any increases in rent .2 
1	1732 This neighborhood  and others3 like it , and the people who live in them, are the4 backbone of New York City. This bone can  easily5 be fractured by rising rents crippling New  York6 City.7 Keeping rents at current  levels,8 or even better, a rollback, is essential to  the9 healt h and preservat ion of my neighborhood and10NewYorkCity.11Thank you.12CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Thank you.13Any questions?14(No response. )15CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Thank you.16MR. McLAUGHLIN:Our next17 speaker is Dennis Gittens.18 As he' s coming to the mike, just19 a remainder, if you want to speak, you have  to20 check in at the desk at the front door even  if21 you pre- registered.22 MR. DENNIS GITTENS:	My name is23 Dennis Gittens. I own a small fourteen- family24 apartment in Crown Heights. It 's thirteen years25 now I'm owning the building.17 
2 Two- thirds of my tenants pay a3 little more than $500 and occupy two and  three-4 bedroom apartments.5	The tenants, some of them  double6 up so my water just keeps escalating and  every7 year water goes up.8 We have  - -  the Board recommended9 6.5 percent this year increase of water.  The10 taxes go up every year. I cannot challenge  the11 tax because I don' t have the money to pay the12 attorneys and the accountants to help  me13 challenge it.14 The insurance has gone up15 tremendously after September 11th. I used to  be16 covered with lead paint. I pay the same  amount17 for less coverage with no lead paint now. And  I18 had to shop around quite a  bit.19 If it was left to me and the20 tenants to give me adequate money, they  would21 give me if the government weren' t involved22 because I don't call myself a landlord. I  call23 myself a little property owner. And believe  me,24 ninety- nine percent of the tenants and I have a25 very good relationship.  I give them good service.6 
2	I'm there every day two or three times a  day.3	People pass, they throw garbage4 down. Before you know it , the City gives you a5 ticket . I cannot understand.  I listened  to one  of6 the gentlemen up here saying if you  can't7 maintain your building, why don't you sell  it.8 You are going to tell me  after9 thirteen years I put my heart and soul into it ,10 even though I sell it today, I wouldn' t make back11 the money that I put in it plus the  aggravation12 that I have.13 I am saying that it is very14 unfair that I cannot make an adequate profit   from15 the investment I put in thirteen years ago,  my16 wife and I , as compared with other businesses .17 This is a business like  any18 other business. No senior citizen could go to  the19 supermarket and take something and say, well , I'm20 a senior citizen, when I get to the counter,  I'm21 paying $10.22 This is very unfair. And I'm  not23 saying that we shouldn' t be sympathetic to some24 of these people and so. But it is  extremely25 unfair. Why can't we have a fair shot? I  think4 
2 this thing is too much polit ics more than3 anything else.4 (Audience part icipation.)5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do we have6	any questions?7 Mr . Castellano.8 MR . CASTELLANO:	Mr. Gittens,9 there are people on this Board who believe  that10 you are not entitled to get more money for  those11 apartments.12 There are people on this  Board13 who believe you are placing a burden on  tenants14 who can afford to pay more, and at $500 a  month15 for a three- bedroom in Crown Heights is more than16 enough to pay the expenses of running  that17 apartment.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there a19 question, Mr . Castellano?20 MR. CASTELLANO:	I wonder if he21 agrees with that.22 MR. DENNIS GITTENS:	That is23 absolutely absurd because when we are in  a24 depressed neighborhood, our insurance is  more25 than anyplace else. Anybody coming in to work  for9 
2 us they feel as though they are doing a favor  to3 us. They are threatened. So everything is  more4 expensive for us.5 So this is absolutely absurd.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.7 Any additional questions?8 Mr. Lubell.9 MR. LUBELL:	Mr. Gittens, why10 don't you sell your building and make a  huge11 profit and live happily ever  after?12 MR. DENNIS GITTENS:	I don' t13 think it would ever happen  - - if I sell it   now,14 it would ever happen because I'm not going to  get15 the amount of money that I put  in.16 When I bought  it , I take a  loan,17 $100 , 000. I renovated it. The inspectors came and18 they inspected everything and everything  was19 correct.20 Last winter I had to put in  a21 new boiler. I have right now, I have  the22 Pakistanis doing a point ing for me which I did23 before, and it 's $11,000.24 And every year as a rule,  when25 summer comes, I'm inside apartments paint ing them10 
2 because my way is I don' t want to be a slumlord.3 I want to be - -  I want my apartment building   to4 reflect me.5	And as such, the wife, being  a6 registered nurse, we've just taken all the  little7 money we have and put it into it and hoping  that8 one day we sell .9 In October coming up I will be10 sixty- seven years of age. I thought thirteen11 years ago if we had done this, by now we  could12 sit back  and get , you know, some income from   it13 that would help us with the little  Social14 Security we are getting.15 It is not happening.16 (Audience part icipation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One more18 question.19 MR. CASTELLANO:	Describing20 your building , you work on it personally?21 MR. DENNIS GITTENS:	Yes, I do.22 MR. CASTELLANO:	You take the23 hammer and you take the paint brush. Do you  pay24 yourself a salary?25 MR. DENNIS GITTENS:	No. There' s6 
2	no salary.3	MR.  CASTELLANO:	You ' re a4	fourteen-unit building . You file real property5 income and expense statement s every year .6 MR.  DENNIS GITTENS :	Yes, I do .7 MR . CASTELLANO:	Yet that report8 does not reflect at all any of your personal  work9 in that building.10 MR . DENNIS GITTENS:	No, it11 doesn' t .12 MR . CASTELLANO :	Thank you .13 MR. DENNIS GITTENS :	And I do14 everything. I'm up to midnight .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The owners in16 adjacent buildings that may not be  providing17 similar levels of service, are they likely  to18 have more turnover or less turnover than  you?19 MR . DENNIS GITTENS:	Well , the20 adjacent building to me was completely  rehabed.21 So they are getting what are called  marketable22 rents.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank24 you, sir .25 (Audience participat ion .)8 
1	1802 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	The next3 speaker is Clare Dockery, to be followed  by4 Marolyn Davenport and then Myrna Beth  Hurwitz.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We would6 appreciate it if you would try and move up  when7 your name is called so that we can get  through8 quicker. Every second  counts.9	MS. CLARE DOCKERY:	Thank you10	for letting tenants speak. I appreciate  it.11	My name is Clare Dockery and I12 am a member of the Park West Village  Tenants13 Association.14 I believe that safe, decent ,15 affordabl e housing is a right of every person.  It16 is not right to expect to make a  fortune17 providing the necessities of life to middle  and18 working class peopl e, and housing is surely a19 necessity, not a luxury.20 Information provided by the  RGB21 indicates that landlords' expenses decreased  last22 year and that landlords are making  healthy23 prof its. Yet they want to increase rents  again.24 These are RGB numbers, not25 numbers compiled by tenant advocates. Yet  many12 
1	1812 rent stabilized tenants are paying one- third or3 more of their income for  rents.4 It is not just older people who5 are forced to make a choice between rents  and6 medicine. Any of us who read the newspaper  or7 watch television knows that homelessness  and the8 need for free food are dramatically increasing  in9 the last few years, and specially since  9/11.10 Younger people who cannot  afford11 rent stabilized apartments double up, triple  up,12 quadruple up , and still many of them leave New13 York because they cannot afford to stay  here.14 People must not be forced into15 homelessness because of rents increasing  much16 faster than income.17 The New York Times recently  said18 that the average family income was $54,000 .19 That 's family income. Divide that by twelve,20 multiplied  by	.03 , or thirty percent , and you get21 $1350 as the amount a family should be paying  for22 rent a month . Try finding a two- bedroom apartment23 for that.24 I am not asking landlords to25 endure hardships. If an individual landlord  is2 
1	1822 really struggling, he or she can apply for  a3 hardship increase . But to get a hardship4 increase, a landlord must open his or her  books,5 which most landlords do not want to  do.6 However, I rarely hear of7 landlords going bankrupt. I hear them seeking  to8 buy more buildings.9 There should be a rent  rollback10 in 2002, not  a recent  increase. There  - -11 (Audience participat ion.)12 MS . CLARE DOCKERY :	- - should be13 no supplementary increase on low rent  apartments,14 no new gimmicks to make living more expensive  for15 the peopl e who make New York run - teachers,16 civil servants, nurses, firemen, and so on.  We17 need these peopl e to keep New York functioning18 and they must have affordable  housing.19 I would also like to ask the  RGB20 whether what tenants say at this hearing  will21 affect your decision about rent increases.  When22 you reach your decision tomorrow, I hope  tenant23 advocates will believe that the RGB members  are24 concerned about keeping affordable  housing25 available for working and middle class  New2 
2 Yorkers.3 Last year many tenants and  their4 advocates felt these hearings were a sham and  a5 waste of time on everybody.6 I ask that you listen to what7 the tenants who have testif ied say and vote for a8 rent decrease. I ask you to let tenants know  who9 decides what rent increase they will get. And  I10 ask you to look at the people in the audience  and11 ask yourself how much do they pay for rent , what12 choices will another rent increase force them  to13 make.14 Expenses are down,15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Wrap up,16 please.17 MS. CLARE DOCKERY:	- - rents18 should go down.19 Thank you.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 (Audience participation.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any23 questions?24 (No response.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 
2 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Our next3 speaker is Marolyn Davenport , to be followed by4 Myrna Hurwitz and Dan  Margulies.5	MS. MAROLYN DAVENPORT :	Thank6 you.7 I'm Marolyn Davenport for  the8 Real Estate Board of New York, an associat ion of9 owners, builders, managers and brokers of  high-10 rise residential property .11 I urge the Rent Guidel ines Board12 to set realistic rent increases which  reflect13 today' s substantially  increased and increasing14 costs.15 The proposed increases of  two16 percent for a one-year lease and four percent   for17 a two-year lease will not cover the rising  costs18 of operat ing apartment buildings in light of19 recent trends, part icularly that in terms of the20 insurance premiums.21 The Price Index of Operating22 Costs is something of an aberration this  year.23 The drop in fuel costs during an  exceptionally24 mild winter is highly misleading. Oil prices   are25 notoriously volatile, and unfortunat ely we are6 
2 not likely to have two such warm winters in  a3 row. More importantly, as the core PIOC  shows,4 all other costs rose substant ially.5 The World Trade Center  attack6 had a dramatic impact on the rising cost  of7 insurance for New York City property owners.  Many8 owners saw increases of over a hundred  percent.9 We have been advised by the insurance  industry10 that these increases can be expected for at  least11 the next three years.12 Tax assessments have  risen13 substantially this year, and water  rates14 continue. Labor costs, part icularly for repairs15 and maintenance, have increased. The high  volume16 of construction across the City has  caused17 substantial increases in repair and  maintenance18 costs as the labor pool for this work has  shrunk.19 Facade work continues at  an20 extraordinary pace. Lead paint maintenance  is a21 cont inuing expense. And mold has become another22 added  insurance cost .23 Taken together, the outlook  for24 the next two years is clear: operating costs  are25 on the rise.2 
1	1862	For all of these reasons, we3	find the proposed increases fall short .4	Additionally,	I want to strongly5 support the recommendations for a  longevity6 increase. It is the role of government , not the7 individual property owner, to subsidize  rents8 when it becomes necessary.9 Thank you .10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are there any11 questions?12 (No response .)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. McLAUGHLIN :	Our next16 speaker is Myrna Beth Hurwitz, followed by  Dan17 Margulies,	followed by Florence Rice .18 MS. MYRNA BETH HURWITZ:	My19 name is Myrna Beth Hurwitz . I am a rent20 stabilized tenant with a one-bedroom apartment  in21 a condominium converted building on West  12th22 Street in Greenwich Village.	I am sixty-nine23 years old , retired , on a fixed income,  paying24 $1112 a month rent , more than a third, actually25 nearly forty percent , of my taxable income.5 
2 My Social Security did not3 increase nearly the same percent as my last  rent4 rise.5 I moved into my apartment6 thirty- three years ago. Such tenant longevity7 creates communities and a tax base for this City .8 I thank the Board Members who, in the  preliminary9 vote, defeated the proposed extra charge  for10 long- term tenants, and also who rejected a11 threatening proposal  to reimpose an additional12 charge on low- rent apartments . I urge you to13 remain steadfast in your opposition in the  final14 vote.15 I live in fear of the time  when16 my rent will exceed my capacity to pay it.  I17 don' t know where I would go .18 Multiply my situation by  the19 many among the city' s two and a half million20 tenants who feel the same vulnerability and  face21 the same limited or non- existent viable options.22 My lease doesn' t even come up23 for renewal during this next period but I'm  also24 concerned for other tenants for whom  displacement25 is an imminent threat.2 
2 Our appeal for a rent  rollback,3 or at the very least a freeze, is solidly  based.4 The Board' s own data show that landlord profits5 went up by nearly forty percent	in the last four6 years, the highest in history .7	Also an historic first is  that8 the Board' s Price Index is negative, including9 that thirty- six percent decrease in fuel.10 Landlords have other sources  for11 increases  - Major  Capital  Improvement  charges -12 since 1997, dramat ically higher vacancy13 allowances, the deregulation provisions  that14 apply to rents of $2000 or  more.15 Your rejection of the16 preliminary  two and four percent guidelines and17 adopt ion of a rent rollback or freeze would be18 both fair and fiscally  responsible.19 There is a Hebrew  injunction,20 tzedek, tzedek tirdov, justice , justice you shall21 pursue .22 I urge you to pursue justice  for23 the tenant s of New York City.24 Thank you.25 (Audience participation.)8 
1	1892	MR. McLAUGHLIN:	The next3 speaker is Dan Margulies, and he will be  followed4 by Florence Rice , and then Andrew Hoffman.5	MR. DAN MARGULIES :	Hi! My name6 is Dan Margulies.	I 'm Executive Director of the7 Community Housing  Improvement Program.8 I would like to make a couple  of9 brief points and then discuss a looming  crisis10 facing the apartment industry.11 First , tenant advocates have12 argued that owners' net operating  income13 increased in 2000 so rents should be  reduced.14 To the contrary, the Board must15 recognize that net operating income declined  in16 2000 outside the Manhattan core, a harbinger  of17 recession that will show more clearly in the  200118 and 2002 numbers.19 It is also not the Board' s job20 to match rents and expenses dollar for dollar.  It21 is your job to moderate increases, according  to22 the statute , as we make a transit ion from23 regulation to normal markets .24 As long as regulated rents  are25 below market rents, there must be  increases6 
2	allowed.3	Second, the Board has to4 consider the future as well as the past.  The5 guidelines voted on tomorrow will apply  until6 September 2004. Right now, the biggest cost  in7 operating apartments is taxes. That is going  to8 be an even bigger factor  soon.9	After approving a new  City10 budget last week, Council Speaker Gifford  Miller11 was quoted as saying we are going to have  to12 raise taxes next year. There have been reports  of13 a property tax surcharge as soon as six mont hs14 from now as soon as the November elections  pass.15 Finally,  I 'd like to take a16 minute to talk about insurance costs. The  Board17 staff is projecting  sixteen percent  increases. We18 are now experiencing typical increases of  fifty19 to a hundred and fifty percent with some  premiums20 tripling.21 The Income and Expense  study22 reported average insurance costs of $22 per  month23 per apartment in 2000. Several of our members  who24 were paying that a few months and a year ago  are25 now paying $40 to $60 per unit per  month,10 
2 essentially one mont h' s rent for the average3 apartment every year going to insurance  premiums.4 But that 's not the worst part.5 Redlining is back . In some neighborhoods	for any6 properties with any loss history it is  now7 difficult to find insurance at all. We  are8 expecting a huge loss of insurance in the  Bronx9 as of July 1st with the failure of  National10 Program Services, a purchasing group  that11 represented hundreds of  buildings.12 As bad as renewal rates  have13 been, owners switching to new carriers  are14 getting socked even worse.15 It 's hard to get coverage for16 the same liability limits . Our best guess, after17 lengthy and heated discussions with insurers  and18 agents, is that this hard market will last  at19 least several years capturing every owner  before20 stability returns.21 For these reasons the22 prel iminary guidelines should be raised and a23 long- term tenancy supplement in particular should24 be added.25 Thank you .2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3 Could you elaborate on this4 failure of the Bronx, this co- op or whatever it5 is?6	MR. DAN MARGULIES:	Yes. It was7 a company called Neighborhood  Program Services8 which is what they call a insurance program.  It9 aggregated a number of owners in their  portfolios10 providing them insurance through, I  think,11 Virginia Casualty.12 The probl em was that the13 organizers were crooks. They didn' t transfer the14 premiums to the carrier. I believe there is  a15 principal going to jail and Virginia  Casualty,16 out of the goodness of its heart , since it never17 received these premiums, agreed to keep  the18 policies in force until July  1st.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 Are there questions? Mr.  Lubell21 MR. LUBELL:	Mr. Margulies,22 although we've heard it before, I know you have  a23 part icular expertise with reference to the need24 for a longevity allowance.25 Could you tell us something7 
2 about that?3 MR. DAN MARGULIES:	Yes.4 I think	Mr. Freund mentioned5 earlier that if you follow the HVS numbers  on6 rent relief , the benef it from long- term tenure is7 about one percent a year. And we 1  ve suggested  a8 long- term tenancy supplement for tenants who are9 in place more than ten years.10 The average long- term tenant11 obviously  hasn 1   t been there just ten  years.12 They 1  ve been there ten to thirty or forty  years.13 And in looking at the HVS numbers and looking  at14 in particular the rent rolls of many of  our15 member buildings in our organization, we 1      re16 seeing that the average rent of people who  have17 been there ten years or longer is twenty - five to18 thirty percent less than the average rent  of19 people who moved within the past ten  years.20 So there is a very distinct21 difference. And the six percent supplement  that22 we 1  ve talked about at that point on top of  the23 one and two- year guidelines would still leave24 those tenants paying substantially  less.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.2 
2	Rubenstein.3	MR. RUBENSTEIN:	Have you any4 evidence that there' s sort of a clustering5 problem of tenants with longevity which  is6 contributing  to certain buildings7	MR. DAN MARGULIES:	Well ,8 obviously, in some buildings the pattern would  be9 more apparent than others.10 As was mentioned earlier,  in11 some small buildings there is no turnover. So  you12 only have one or two more recent  vacancies.13 In larger buildings there  seems14 to be more turnover.15 But I think that across the16 board you are looking at somewhere  between17 fifteen and twenty- five percent of any building18 that makes up these long- term tenancies that are19 substantially  below  market , twenty- five/thirty20 percent  or more  - - not below market , excuse me,21 below the average of people who have moved   within22 the past ten years.2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any other24 quest ions?25 Mr. Pagan.24 
1	1952 MR . PAGAN:	Mr. Margulies, you3 indicated that there are tenants who have  been4 there ten, twenty, thirty, forty  years.5	Do you an idea of what6 percentage are in each of those, ten,  twenty,7 thirty or forty years?8 MR. DAN MARGULIES:	No.9 MR. PAGAN:	I would imagine that10 many of them are reaching or are senior  citizens11 at this time or maybe on some kind of  fixed12 income, and at this time we would probably  do13 more damage to them than14 MR. DAN MARGULIES:	Actually, I15 believe in the submission that was made by  the16 Rent Stabilization Associat ion to the Board in17 writ ing a month or so ago they explored exactly18 that issue and determined that there was  no19 particular income tilt in that segment. It 's20 pretty well spread.21 And , of course, as with any rent22 increase, if the market won' t support it in a23 particular building or neighborhood, you won' t24 collect it .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. Mr.10 
1	1962	Lubell.3	MR. LUBELL:	Mr. Margulies,4 isn't it correct that by reason of  survivorship5 we may not know whether all of those tenants  are6 elderly tenants or the children or grandchildren7 of those elderly tenants or the younger  spouses?8	MR. DAN MARGULIES:	Of course,9 under rent stabilization and rent control  tenants10 are entitled to succeed family members and  are11 entitled to succeed to apartments, and many  do.12 The pattern of the grandchild13 moving in with the grandparent just before  the14 grandparent goes off to a nursing home or  Florida15 is quite common.16 And I think everybody in  the17 audience probably has known or knows  situations18 like that.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Just to20 clarify, you and Mr. Freund talked about  a21 longevity increase which would take the shape  of22 six percent	if you have been there over ten  years23 and Mr. Silber' s variation on that being with a24 certain percent  of a - - with a minimum  rent  or25 actual rent of $800 , and I believe the same ten9 
1	1972	years, I think that 's it ; is that  correct?3	MR. DAN MARGULIES:	That 's4	correct.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	There are two6	proposals that are being  advocated.7	MR . DAN MARGULIES :	They are8	different proposals.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.10	Go ahead , Mr. Carmody.11	MR. CARMODY :	I believe the MCis12 are chargeable sixty percent per year  assuming13 the maximum MCI.14 MR. DAN MARGULIES:	The - -15 MR. CARMODY:	Is there any16 allowance for the preceding  ten years if they17 were fifty percent MCis or fifty- five percent?18 MR. DAN MARGULIES:	Yes. It 's a19 little complicated. Bear with me if I screw  it20 up .21 Currently, an MCI is  calculated22 as 1/40th - - excuse me , 1/84th of the cost of   the23 entire projects. So to make it easy, if it  was24 $84 dollars, the MCI would be a  dollar.25 And then that is divided  among12 
2 the tenants based on room  count.3 Now if the tenant 's portion  is4 more than six percent of the rent the tenant  was5 paying when the application was filed, then  the6 owner can only collect six percent that year,  but7 the balance can be collected the following up  to8 six percent.9	MR. CARMODY:	Right.10 So if the maximum - -11 MR. DAN MARGULIES:	It gets12 phased in.13 MR. CARMODY:	- - if the maximum14 MCI is performed, they would have more than  sixty15 percent  in a ten-year period  of MCis  if it ' s six16 percent as a maximum each year for ten  years,17 plus that would be compounded , up to seventy18 percent .19 So if they had a seventy percent20 increase on the rent , would this longevity also21 apply?22 MR. DAN MARGULIES:	Yes, of23 course.24 Because those increases are25 across the board and they don' t do anything about10 
2 the imbalance between the long - term rents and the3 newer rents.4	Someone who moved in five  years5 ago or three years ago would have that MCI  built6 into their legal rent as well. So the  disparity7 remains.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on a9	second.10 Go ahead , Mr. Rivera.11 MR. RIVERA:	Yes, Mr. Margulies.12 You mentioned before that if  a13 person couldn' t pay the increase that the14 landlord  in effect would  have  to swallow - -15 MR. DAN MARGULIES:	No. What I16 meant to say was that in particular  neighborhoods17 in particular buildings there is a market rent .18 And if the increase yielded a higher rent  than19 the market in that area would support , then the20 owner would not be able to collect  it.21 MR. RIVERA :	And isn't it true22 that in this particular market that if  someone23 does not pay the rent , that the landlord  - -  and24 I 'm just talking about the landlord in this25 particular market would kick that tenant  out?10 
2 MR. DAN MARGULIES:	Well , if the3 tenant did not pay the rent perhaps, but we  are4 not talking about that.5	What we are talking about is  the6 agreement upon what the new rent is. There  are7 landlords cutting deals every day in the City  in8 different neighborhoods at different rent  levels9 for less than the legal rent they are entitled  to10 because the market in their building or in  that11 neighborhood	simply doesn' t come up to the legal12 regulated rents that they are permitted to  have13 on renewal or vacancy.14 And that varies, those  levels15 vary from neighborhood to neighborhood around  the16 City. But there is definitely a market out  there17 that functions under the legal  rents.18 MR. RIVERA:	Do you have any19 figures to back that up?20 MR. DAN MARGULIES:	Well , the21 figures  that DHCR provided	I believe  - - I'm not22 sure if they provided a number on the number  of23 preferential rents registered. I can't recall  the24 specific number.25 But our guess is that roughly  a
