1	112	P R O C E E D I N G S34	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5	Good afternoon.	My name is Marvin6 Markus and I'm Chair of the New York City Rent7 Guidelines Board.8 And I'd like to welcome you to a9 series - - one in a series of meetings and public10 hearings on the allowable lease guideline for11 rent stabilized apartments in New York City12 subject to lease renewal between October 1, 200613 and the end of September 2007.14 This, as I stated, is a public15 hearing.	And people were asked to register if16 they wanted to.	And I'd like to read some rules17 here.18 But just to be clear, there is19 another hearing being held on the proposed rent20 adjustments being held on June 22nd at the Great21 Hall at Cooper Union, 7 East 7th Street from22 scheduled to go from ten a.m. to six p.m. ,23 pre-registration to speak at this hearing ending24 at 1 p.m. on June - - the day before Wednesday,25 June 22nd.6 
 2 You can sign up by calling the Rent3 Guidelines Board at 212-385-2934 .	You can also4 register to speak at the hearing up to six p.m.5 The final vote on the Guidelines6 will be held on Tuesday, June 27th at the same7 Cooper Union starting at 5 :30 p .m .8 Just for Members, you will find in9 your folders a draft of the Explanatory10 Statements of Findings for both apartment and11 hotel guidelines.	Please review and get any12 comments to the staff by the morning of June 13	26th.14 As you know, we're under mandate to15 be simultaneous with our adoption to adopt16 Explanatory Statements and Findings.17 As to financial disclosure, once18 again, delayed.	We should have a financial19 disclosure form package for you in time for the20 June 27th vote.21 In terms of the hearing, I can make22 a couple of statements so that people are clear23 on the rules.24 Particularly as to pre-registration,25 I don't know if we have anybody who's in the14 
2 audience who is not preregistered, but3 preregistered speakers who have confirmed their4 presence on the day of the hearing will be heard5 in the order of pre-registration and before those6 who have not preregistered.7 However, if your number on the8 pre-registration list has been passed, if I call9 the speaker for a higher number than yours before10 you check in, your place is forfeited and you11 must re-register at the end of the list.12 Speakers will be called in the order13 of pre-registration only if they have checked in.14 You need to check in upon arrival with the staff15 on the day of the hearing.16 Check in is upstairs up in the17 lobby.18 I will periodically reread these19 rules so that people are familiar with them.20 The first speaker - - and also I'm21 going to try to alternate landlord speakers and22 tenant speakers.23 The first speaker is Frances24 Lombardi.25 The mike is over there.2 
2 Frances.3 Let me actually let people know the4 order they' re going to go in.5 Frances Lombardi;6 Followed by Larry Wood.7 So if you could get, you know, close8 to the mike up there.9 Followed by Suraj Persaud;10 Followed by Adele Bender, traveling11 out of Queens to come to the Bronx, okay?12 Frances Lombardi.13 And it's three minutes and you will14 have a warning at thirty seconds.	It's this15 thing here (indicating.)	We should have one16 more.17 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	There's a staff18 member by the microphone.	And if you'd like to19 hand in your written testimony after you're done20 and give it staff, that would be great.21 Thanks.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.2 3	MS. FRANCES LOMBARDI:	This year24 the Rent Guidelines Board has set a possible25 range of rent increases for one and two-year24 
2 renewal leases.	The range set for one-year lease3 renewals is three to six and a half percent.	And4 for two-year lease renewals the range is five to5 eight and a half percent .6 These ranges are too low .7 Apparently in setting such low guidelines the8 Rent Guidelines Board might not have been current9 with the enormous expenses incurred in the10 management and maintenance of essential services11 in multiple dwellings.12 Over the past four years owners'13 operating costs have increased by more than 3714 percent, but for the past three years one-year15 guideline increases voted by the Board have16 totaled less than eleven percent.17 How, owners ask, can the housing18 industry survive with such paltry and19 unrealistically low guidelines year after year?20 It cannot and will not survive for long if this21 is allowed to continue unabated.22 The misinformed perception by many23 is that owners collect huge sums of rent money24 and pocket most of it for themselves as profits.25 Nothing, nothing, I say can be further from the2 
2 truth.	The fact is that every month owners are3 burdened with a host of building expenses that4 must be met whether or not the rents collected5 are sufficient to meet them.	All too frequently6 they are not sufficient .	All too frequently7 there is a very little money left over for the8 owners to compensate him or her for the effort9 and financial investment in the property.10 In order to clarify matters and11 inform those who might think that being an owner12 is a lark and low guidelines are adequate and13 justified, I have complied here a list of14 expenses that owners are responsible for.15 I may not be able to complete them16 all because of the time elements here.17 The first one is real estate taxes,18 the biggie which increases year after year.	This19 year there is an increase of 7.8 percent.20 Next, water and sewer taxes.	They21 have increased 9.4 percent.22 Then fuel cost.	This has increased23 astronomically.	We all know what we pay for24 gasoline and number two, number four and number25 six oil and natural gas are way up in the cost as2 
2 never before.	An increase of 22.8 percent.3 Then there's fire and liability4	insurance.	This has also increased dramatically,5 a 104 percent increase in the past four years.6 And there was a 2.5 percent increase again this7 year.8 Then they are employee salaries, a9	2.5 percent increase.10	Employment and disability insurance11	cost.12 Owners must pay estimated quarterly13 taxes every three months which keep going up year14 after year.15 Then there' s the HPD annual16 registration fee.	DHR annual registration and17 registration fees must be paid along with the18 laborious paperwork that registration entails.19 Then there's DEC oil tank2 0	registration fee, inspection - -21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap22 up.23 MS. FRANCES LOMBARDI:	Okay - -24 well.	Okay.	I'll go on and on.	But too many25 owners like myself have tenants in the building21 
2 who make - - who pay very low rents simply  because3 they have been in occupancy for many years.4 However, even though over the years operating5	costs have risen substantially, these tenants are6 now paying rents that are $400 to $500 below7 market level.8 Is this right - -9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to wrap10 up.11 MS. FRANCES LOMBARDI:	Could I12 continue?13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No.14 Thank you.15 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	I have a16 question, Mr. Chairman.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.18 Question, ma'am.19 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Ma'am?20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma'am, question.21 Ma'am, question.22 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for23 your testimony.24 How many units in your building,25 please?10 
2 MS. FRANCES LOMBARDI:	I have - -3 altogether I have 37 units.4 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	What zip code5 are you in?6 MS. FRANCES LOMBARDI:	10461 and7	10462.8 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank10 you.11 Mr. Wood, Larry Wood;12 Followed by Suraj Persaud;13 Adele Bender;14 And after Ms. Bender is James Jones.15 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Thank you.	Good16 afternoon.17 I guess I just want to start by18 thanking all of the Members of Rent Guidelines19 Board for their service.20 I know this has got to be one of the21 most - - one of the most thankless tasks that22 exist in New York City because you don't seem to23 have anybody who's perceived as a winner,24 landlords or tenants.25 And many people are very cynical.10 
2 They kind of think the fix is in, it doesn't3 matter.	Why come down and testify, a deal's4 already made and I really don't believe that' s5 the case.6 It's my understanding that year7 after year there's a tug of war that goes on8 between the two - - landlords reps and the two9 tenant reps over trying to win the hearts and10 minds, at least of the three Public Members.11 And there' s a real debate that goes on.12 It's also very frustrating that we13 have this one- size- fits all approach when it14 comes to rent increases.	And year after year15 you have to really struggle between, you know,16 what is a fair and warranted rent increase for17 those buildings.18 I know owners who really warrant one19 and need one versus the very compelling stories20 you're going to hear from tens of thousands, if21 not hundreds of thousands of tenants who paid any22 sort of rent increase, is a real, real hardship.23 The housing crisis in the City is24 just unbelievable the numbers of people who exist25 in the shelter system who are paying substantial2 
2 portions of their income towards rent.	It's just3 unfathomable to me how people can survive.4 But you have found ways of getting5 around a one-size-fits all over the years.6 Certainly one of the things you've done in past7 years has been provisos for the SROs which have8 divided up the increases.	And you've really9 listened to the tenants from SROs and from folks10 from the SRO Law Project.	And I worked there11 myself for nine years.12 And you made distinctions and you13 understood that landlords in some SROs were14 making more than an adequate rate of return in15 their property.	And you have to look at the16 rate of return in the building and not the17 individual rent for the particular unit or18 particular apartment.	You look at the rate of19 return for the building and what' s fair and is20 that landlord making enough money and what can we21 do to protect those tenants in that building and22 preserve affordable housing at the same time23 you're trying to establish a reasonable rate of24 return.25 You've also, in years past, have2 
2 done something called supplemental rent3 adjustments.	I'd say that was the flip of the4 proviso that tenants have been asking for you to5 consider for buildings that have significant6 amounts of deregulations.7 What I've argued is that a building8 that has a lot of deregulation, that landlord is9 making a great rate of return in that property.10 Similarly, when you looked at buildings that had11 really low rent rolls, we had a lot of apartments12 that were renting below 200, below 400.	There13 were fourteen different years that the guideline14 - - the Board issued a supplemental rent increase.15 And you found the statutory authority to do that.16 And I would argue that you had the17 same authority to look at the	the buildings18 that have significant numbers of deregulated19 units and not give a rent increase for those20 remaining tenants in that building.21 I think it's a fair and just thing22 to look at and seriously consider.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you wrap24 up.25 MR. LARRY WOOD:	I want to say10 
2 another word about SROs and I - - again, you'll be3 hearing from the various tenants.4 And if you for any reason do not5 believe you have the authority to issue a proviso6 then I don't think you can justify anything but a7 zero increase for those remaining SROs tenants8 that exist in that housing.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 (Applause.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You can ask a12 question. Go ahead.13 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Hi.	Thank you14 for your testimony and for all your work.15 Larry, I know you're a renter. Where16 do you live?17 MR. LARRY WOOD:	I live in Manhattan18 on West 85th Street.19 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And how many20 units are in your building?21 MR. LARRY WOOD:	I have a - - I live22 in a building that' s thirteen units.	And I'm one23 of four rent regulated tenants that are left in24 that building since '97.	The other nine units25 have been deregulated.10 
2 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And how much are3 those units going for?4	MR. LARRY WOOD:	My rent is5 currently about $900.	The - - when my - - when my6 unit becomes vacant we have a - - basically a de7 facto vacancy decontrol.	The apartment next door8 to me rents between 3 ,500 and 4,000 a month.	In9 fact, my two children think the apartment is10 haunted because every couple of months there' s a11 new group of tenants moving in and out of that12 apartment.	Usually young students all chipping13 in to afford the $4,000 rent.14 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	If we were to15 consider - - if the proviso was possible, what16 kind of impact do you think that would have in17 your building and to your owner?18 MR. LARRY WOOD:	I don't think it19 would have a huge impact on my owner of my20 building.	The landlord I believe is making more21 than an adequate rate of return in my building.22 The proviso providing for a rent freeze for those23 remaining tenants and remaining tenants in the24 similar buildings, it would prevent an increased25 hardship.	It would also serve to preserve those5 
2 units a little longer, but it wouldn' t stop my3 landlord from deregulating those units upon4 vacancy.	There 's vacancy allowances, those are5 MCis .	There' s other ways of getting the rent up6 so it may slow down deregulation but it certainly7 won' t stop it.8	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	You said9 something about the supplemental that in previous10 years this Board has allowed on low-renting11 apartments.12 What are you talking about in terms13 of the reverse, what exactly are you saying?14 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Well, I can15 understand the rationale that landlords made over16 the years.	They claim that these very low rent17 in some - - I think the first year it was rent18 under the $200 and it went up to $500 a month.19 But they argued that where buildings that had20 significant numbers of low rent apartments had a21 really low rent roll and that landlord wasn' t22 getting an adequate rate of return .	So they - -23 the rent guidelines saw fit to grant a24 supplemental increase beyond the across-the-board25 increase that all the other apartment owners - -9 
2 apartment tenants were getting.3 So they found the authority to break4 outside that mold to assist those landlords who5 they perceive to be at risk at having a low rent6 roll.7 I'm arguing the opposite.	When you8 have twenty percent or fifty percent of the9 buildings deregulated and that landlord's making10 market rents, I would argue that they're making a11 more than adequate rate of return.	And a fair12 adjustment would be zero for the remaining13 tenants.14 It's a balancing act, a fair rate of15 return versus trying to preserve affordable - -16 and minimize the hardship on those tenants who17 are paying so much for their income.18 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Oh, okay. I19 thought you were targeting units and saying that20 if there were units that actually rented over a21 certain amount, that those units would not be22 allowed an increase, kind of like the direct23 inverse.2 4	MR. LARRY WOOD:	That's another25	approach, you know .	An apartment is renting for
2	$1,800, you know, that' s certainly more than the3	average carrying costs of those apartments.	That4	would be another way of perhaps looking at it.5	But, again, that' s apartment by apartment.	We're6 trying to look at the rate of return for the7 building where possible.8 And I think there's research that9 the Board can do to try to ferret out a little10 more of this of where these buildings exist in11 any significant number, what boroughs and12 communities are tenants paying the highest13 percent of their income towards their rent.14 I think more research would be very15 helpful in trying to figure out where these16 provisos might make sense.	And I think they17 would really be a tool that the RGB should look18 at.19 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you.20 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider.22 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for23 your testimony.24 How long have you lived on West 85th25 Street?10 
2	MR. LARRY WOOD:	Since 1978.3	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And your4 rent, if we may ask?5 MR. LARRY WOOD:	I told - -	I said6 it before.	I'm paying about $900 a month.7 There' s four apartments that are regulated in8 that building and the other nine are deregulating9 and going in excess of $3,500 a month.10 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And the size11 of your apartment, please.12 MR. LARRY WOOD:	It's a six- room13 apartment.14 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And how many15 in your family occupy it?16 MR. LARRY WOOD:	My wife and my two17 children.18 I could not afford the Upper West19 Side.	And I couldn't afford to work at the20 Riverside where I do if it was a market-rate21 apartment.	I'd be out of the City.22 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And your rent23 in 1978, if you remember.24 MR. LARRY WOOD:	I remember.	It was25 $350 when I moved in.4 
1	292	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	350?3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Thank you very5 much.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Suraj Persaud;7 Followed by Adele Bender;8 Followed by James Jones;9	Followed by Susi Schropp.10	Mr. Persaud.11	MR. SURAJ PERSAUD:	Good afternoon,12 everyone.13 My name is Suraj.	And I am one of14 the principals of a number of buildings here in15 the South Bronx.16 Let me begin by saying that as time17 progresses life here in New York City has become18 increasingly expensive .19 Landlords of the five boroughs of20 New York will need an adequate rental increase in21 order to cover the normal maintenance of22 buildings to code as per New York City Department23 of Buildings.24 For example, in my own scenario I've25 seen an overall operating cost increase of 29.7512 
2 percent last year alone.	Some of the items that3 contribute that number:4 Oil has increased 43.67 percent;5 Water has increased 12.19 percent;6 Electricity has increased 15.727 percent;8 Real estate taxes have increased9 56.23 percent over the past two and a half years;10 Building maintenance crews' salaries11 have increased 13.45 percent over the past two12 years and they're looking for another raise come13 the end of this year.14 Building supplies have increased15 38.74 percent.16 These are just a few items I listed17 that have affected myself and other principals18 involved.19 There's not one day that goes by20 that I do not worry about it if the services are21 being performed to completion within my22 buildings.	Yet year after year we've seen our23 operating costs go beyond the gross income of24 certain - - in certain cases in certain buildings.25 With all this said, I'm cautiously2 
2 optimistic that the Rent Board, along with all3 landlords and tenants, will arrive at some fair4 rental market increase to cover, and I stress, to5 cover the ever rising operating building costs6 here in New York and its five boroughs.7 Thank you for your time and your8 cooperation.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	Mr. Chair.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on.12 Go ahead, Betty.13 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Yes.14 How many buildings were you talking15 about altogether?16 MR. SURAJ PERSAUD:	Fifteen.17 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Fifteen? Have the18 value of those buildings gone up?19 MR. SURAJ PERSAUD:	In most of the20 years, yes.21 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Has there been a22 re-financing of the underlying mortgage?2 3	MR. SURAJ PERSAUD:	No.24 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Why not?25 MR. SURAJ PERSAUD:	There was no24 
2 mortgage.	These are investors that come in with3 cash and they buy and so on and so forth.4	DIRECTOR ADAMS:	I see.5 Thank you very much.6 MR. SURAJ PERSAUD:	Thank you.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider.8 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for9 your testimony.10 Do you know the zip codes of the11 buildings that you're - -12 MR. SURAJ PERSAUD:	I know one of13 them. It's 10452 and I'm going to guess 10467 the14 other one.15 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And how many16 unsolicited offers do you get each week or each17 month to purchase one or your whole portfolio of18 properties?19 MR. SURAJ PERSAUD:	There - - they20 vary by area particularly in the South Bronx21 closest to the Number 4 and D trains.	I'll get22 an offer maybe a month - - once a month, twice a23 month maximum.24 And the other - -25 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	I'm sorry. Go5 
2 ahead .3 MR. SURAJ PERSAUD:	And the other4 areas outside of, you know, the 4 and D line5 probably maybe lucky if twice every six months .6 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER :	Have you seen7 - - the activity for these unsolicited offers,8 have you seen an increase in such offers over the9 past year or so?10 MR. SURAJ PERSAUD :	Yes, definitely .11 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And what' s12 prompting you not to sell?13 MR. SURAJ PERSAUD:	We were in the14 business for over forty years.	I mean it's kind15 of - - it 's kind of a family thing and it's kind16 of investors that come together and try to17 provide a fair service for what people pay for .18 We' re not just in it for the money.19 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	All right.20 Thank you .21 Is there a point though in the22 operations of these buildings where you feel it23 might be best to sell?24 MR . SURAJ PERSAUD :	If - - certainly25 if the operating costs continue to go beyond, I2 
2 see my predecessors might be considering selling,3 sure.4	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .6 Adele Bender.7 MS . ADELE BENDER:	My name is Adele8 Bender.	And I'm the Queens Borough Coordinator9 for JPAC, Joint Public Affairs Committee for10 Older Adults.11 We advocate for seniors mostly.	And12 I'm here to speak for seniors and for the tenants13 in New York City.14 I live in Queens.	I'm a rent15 stabilized tenant, but I always speak for16 anything that has to keep their affordable17 housing and affordable roof over their heads.18 I consider my community New York19 City.20 Despite some of the rent laws in the21 SCRIE that has been passed and the DRIE, there22 are many of our members that just about miss it.23 And it is really becoming increasingly difficult24 for them to pay these increases.25 You talk about an eight and a half5 
2 percent increase, but remember, that is often on3 top of MCis and other type of increases that4 people are receiving, including unique and5 peculiar that they' re trying to do to some of the6 people going on rent stabilization in the7 Mitchell-Lama buildings.	So it is becoming8 increasingly difficult for many of the average9 working or senior people to live in the City.10 I know of people that are very11 capable and have a lot to offer and are12 considering moving out of this City because even13 with a - - what is considered a halfway decent14 salary, they can't make it here anymore.15 I know of young couples that are16 really struggling to make the rent working either17 two jobs or working long hours.	They're tying to18 raise their kids, save enough money for an19 education and it's very, very difficult for them20 to pay this rent.21 For a lot of people the average22 median rent in New York City for 2004 was like23 $32,000, that was across the board.	Imagine how24 it is for a person that' s on a fixed income.25 And I know that this what some of our members,2 
2	our senior members are going through.3	Something has got to be done.	And I4 know that the landlords talk about their5 expenses, but what about our expenses, especially6 people that are senior or disabled, we have a lot7 of medical expenses.	And we have to pay8 utilities also.	We have to put out money for9 doctors and health-related expenses and10 prescription drug expenses which everybody is11 complaining about despite the so-called laws that12 have just been passed by the Congress.13 As I say, we do have expenses.	And14 this eight and a half or five and a half percent15 increase that you talk about is just it's going16 to be really, really difficult, if not17 impossible.18 And when I talk about people leaving19 the City, what about seniors that can't leave the20 City, that don't have this kind of money to just21 pick up and go.	Where are they supposed to go?22 There is no affordable housing in the City.	The23 affordable housing base is shrinking.	And it's24 really a crisis and a desperate situation.25 Please take what I have said into4 
2 serious consideration.3 Thank you.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5	(Applause.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	James Jones;7 Followed by Susi Schropp;8 Followed by Sandra Erickson;9	Followed by Mickey Gensler.10 MR.

2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you.3	Susi Schropp.4 MS . SUSI SCHROPP:	Good afternoon .5 Thank you for the opportunity to6 testify before you today.7 My name is Susi Schropp.	I'm a8 member of the Shalom Tenants Alliance, a group of9 tenants in now over 150 - - 115 apartment10 buildings owned and operated by the notorious11 Shalom, also known as the Oham (phonetic) Shalom12 Family.13 With my testimony I particularly14 appeal to the Public Members of this Board.	Four15 years ago I came to speak before you for the16 first time.	Back then most of my long-term17 neighbors were still living in the building .18 Today, 95 percent of once rent19 regulated units have been vacated and deregulated20 through harassment and increased rents.21 Years of harassment by my landlord22 was stopped on October 22, 2005 when the23 Manhattan DAs office executed a search warrant on2 4	my landlord' s offices.	An  investigation into25	serious charges of fraud is currently ongoing.
2 Yet the Rent Guidelines Board has rewarded the3 Shaloms with generous increases.4 This year I'm earning the same I did5 in 1997.	My income has decreased on a yearly6 average by 12.5 percent since 2003 while my rent7 has steadily increased.	I'm not able to afford8 heath care.9 The RGB has assisted owners greatly10 by accelerating the race towards the $2,00011 vacancy decontrol threshold resulting in12 increased harassment.13 Contrary to the claims by owners,14 landlords do not suffer hardship.	The Shaloms15 did so well last year that they added at least16 ten more buildings to their growing empire.17 It is unjust that the entire City of18 rent stabilized renters suffers for a few19 exceptions of owners who are not able to make a20 profit in such a booming industry.	Even a ten21 percent or more rent increase would not make a22 difference to the few owners suffering from2 3	II hardship. 11	Such owners would do better by24 selling their buildings.25 Tenants who cannot afford their24 
2	rents anymore are forced to move out of the City3	or end up on the street or in shelters.	The4 most recent Census numbers speak for themselves.5 Between 2000 and 2004 an average of6 210,000 people per year, a total of 184,0007 people left the Big Apple because they could not8 sustain life in the City.9 New York City has the nation' s10 second highest poverty rate with 16.3 percent of11 its population poor.	Today' s average New York12 City household pays 32 percent of their income in13 rent.14 Over the past three years, 38,00015 tenants were forced to live in City shelters, a16 record level.17 The vacancy rate remains extremely18 low at three percent versus the national average19 of 9.7 percent.	Again, the New York City Rent20 Guidelines Board has contributed greatly to these21 devastating numbers through a cumulative high22 yearly increases.23 The Members of this Board must begin24 acting responsibly and recognize the growing25 housing crisis in New York City.4 
2 It is my - - in my building 953 percent of rents were raised from 900 a month to4	an average of 2,995 month.	The owners are5 clearly not suffering from hardship.6 I ask the RGB to send a message to7 Albany by freezing rents to	and to demand the8 repeal of the Urstadt Law now or taxpayers will9 have to carry the brunt of the growing housing10 crisis for generations to come.11 Like last year, I extend a warm12 invitation to the Members of this Board to meet13 with the Shalom Tenants Alliance.14 Thank you for your undivided15 attention.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 (Applause.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sandra Erickson;19 Followed by Mickey Gensler; and20 Mary McCune;21 And then Michael Meade.22 Sandra Erickson.23 MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	Yes.	Hello.24 My name is Sandra Erickson.25 I am a property manager and owner5 
2 here in the Bronx for 25 years.	I'm also the3 President of the Bronx Manhattan North4 Association of Realtors.5 I just wanted to share that I own6 and manage mostly affordable housing units.	My7 rents are quite affordable from between maybe 1508 a month up to maybe 900 a month for the9 three-bedroom/two bath unit.10 I found it very challenging to be11 able to meet the increased expenses this year.12 We really do need an appropriate increase in13 order for me to provide the services my tenants14 have come to expect.15 And I also hear from a lot of16 smaller owners that are really, really having a17 very difficult time.	They call over to the Board18 to ask for help with meeting some of the19 increased requirements like the local led20 Local Law 1 that involves led paint requirements.21 Some of these laws have become - - have made it22 increasingly difficult for some of these owners23 to meet their obligations.24 Thank you.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 
2	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair .3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any questions?4 Yes.5 Question, Mr. Schleider.6 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.7 Thank you for your testimony.8 About how many buildings do you9 represent and own?10 MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	Thirteen.11	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And do you12 have the zip codes by any chance?13 MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	10456, 10457.14 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And about how15 many units do you have?16 MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	A hundred and17 fifty.18 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	One/five/zero?19 MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	Yes.20 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And your21 rents, your rents range from the mid- hundreds to22 about $900?2 3	MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	Yes.	In my24 affordable housing, which is - - about 115 of  the25 150 are affordable housing units.24 
2 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Any subsidies3 along with those affordable housing?4	MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	No.5 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	So this is6 just your holding them at these rent levels to7 provide the housing?8	MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	Yes.9	On average we provide housing for10 people making between fifty and sixty percent of11 the area median income.12 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	That' s13 commendable.14 About how many buildings does this15 represent?16 MS . SANDRA ERICKSON:	Of the17 affordable - - nine buildings, the 115 units.18 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Okay.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And the other 3520 units are in what21 MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	They're in22 very marginal areas, very difficult properties to23 manage.	Very heavy - - a lot of drug activity2 4	mainly in those areas.	Very challenging25	properties.	Very expensive to run .
2 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	As the3 expense profile keeps increasing, do you see a4 point where you may have to divest in these5 buildings, sell these buildings?6 MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	Well, the7 affordable housing buildings cannot be sold.8 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Because?9 MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	Because10 they' re in a tax credit program.	And there' s a,11 you know, certain agreements that you have to12 keep the buildings for fifteen years without13 selling them.14 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And about how15 many more years do you have left on that16 covenant?17 MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	Fourteen18 years.19 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Great.	Thank20 you.21 MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	Okay.	Thank22 you.2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 4	DIRECTOR LUBELL:	I have a question.25	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.
2	A question, Ms.3	DIRECTOR LUBELL:	Excuse me.4 MR. MICKEY GENSLER:	Hello.	I'm5 Mickey Gensler - -6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Gensler, hold7 on one second.	There's a question still for the8 previous speaker.9	MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	Yes.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.11	DIRECTOR LUBELL:	What is the - -12	how many units do you have that rent between say 13	150 and $350?14 MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	Well, those15 were the existing tenants and there're - - I would16 say about twelve or thirteen, in that range.	The17 rest would be the majority, one-bedrooms are 500;18 two-bedrooms 600, and three-bedrooms seven.19 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	How much does it20 cost you to repaint the units that are renting 21	for say $150 to $350?22 MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	Well, to23 repaint would be - - depending on the size, would24 be maybe 500.	Maybe one-bedroom, maybe one,25 two-bedroom $500.	Because of those rents, you22 
2 know, I can only - - I have to get the super to do3 it because I can't hire a painting contractor.4	DIRECTOR LUBELL:	Thank you.5 MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	Okay?6 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	So you7 renovated these buildings, is that it, so you8 didn't displace tenants when you - -9	MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	No, no.	No10 displacement, no.11 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Great.	Thank12 you.13 MS. SANDRA ERICKSON:	Okay. Thank14 you.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 Mr. Gensler.17 MR. MICKEY GENSLER:	Okay.	Hello.18 I'm Mickey Gensler, President of the Skyview19 Tenants Association of Riverdale.20 Donald Trump, Barbara Cochrane and a21 sleuth of other real estate millionaires keep22 giving seminars on how easy it is to get rich in2 3	real estate.	With friends in the Legislatures,24 the Rent Increase Guideline Board and the DHCR,25 you can't miss.	The Legislatures have made sure24 
2 that rent increases will be compounded every one3 or two years instead of three.	And they will add4 in the MCI, to the MBR so the tenants who pay to5 have their buildings co-oped will pay forever for6 bad windows, bad roofs and other poor repairs and7 insulations.8 The DHCR will allow unscrupulous and9 ineffective landlords to enjoy the luxuries of10 the Guideline Board's increases even if they do11 not follow the guidelines by making necessary12 repairs in the minimum of time.13 The Rent Increase Guideline Board14 will also force these same landlords to take an15 increase even if they do not deserve it.	It has16 never been a case of is the increase warranted,17 but rather how much.	How much can we give those18 politically expedient?	In an election year we19 cannot anger the tenants.	So little will help20 make it up - - make it up for it in a non-election21 year.22 This year the excuse is the rise in23 oil prices, but because it is factored into the24 MBR you will pay forever even when oil prices25 come down.	So you see the real estate2 
2millionairesare right.3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Thank you,4Mr. Gensler .5Any questions?6(No response.)7CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Thank you.8(Applause.)9CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Mary McCune.10MS. MARY MCCUNE:Hello. My name' s11Mary McCune.12 I am here today as a member of Nos13 Quedamos Project Remain.	And I'm also a member14 of the 101 Cooper Street Tenant Association in15 Northern Manhattan.16 I'm a housing attorney for a legal17 services organization for the past thirteen18 years.	And before that I was a tenant organizer19 so I think you can tell that this issue is very20 important to me.21 One of the things that really struck22 me when I was listening to the previous testimony2 3	sorry.	I think I'm losing my mike here - - was24 when one of the owners talked about he wasn' t in25 this business just for the money.	And I think24 
2	that' s something that this Board loses sight of3 sometimes, that this is about more than just4 profits and costs.5 One of the things that we can't6 really put a value on is our communities and the7 diversity of our communities is priceless.	It's8 what attracts people to the live there.	It's9 what makes them a wonderful place to be.	And10 we're losing that diversity in Northern11 Manhattan.12 As some speakers have already said,13 there's an affordable housing crisis in New York14 City.	I can't tell you how many people have15 left my building in the last five years because16 they simply can't afford the rents anymore.17 When I listen to people say that the18 rent increases that have been given by this Board19 total only eleven percent, in looking at that20 without looking at the fact that rents of - -  have21 typically doubled, quadrupled or even sometimes22 increased even more than that in the past few2 3	years as well, it doesn't give you a complete24 picture.25 So what I would like to do is	isROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC. 1   212-840- 1167521 Fifth Avenue 1	17th Floor 1	New York1	New York 10175
2 focus for a moment on the loss that our community3 feels when the base of our community changes.4 And that' s one of the things that Nos Quedamos5 and Project Remain is trying to change.6 What' s happening in Northern7 Manhattan is that the rents have gone so high8 that landlords have this huge incentive to evict9 tenants that are paying low rents and they're10 usually willing to do that by any means11 necessary.12 The housing stock is deteriorating.13 We' re always told every time we come here that14 landlords aren't making repairs because they15 can't afford to put money into the building, but16 rents have gone up tremendously and yet we still17 don't see those repairs happening.18 I know in my building we've had a19 rent reduction order for the past three years20 because the landlord isn't making repairs.	And21 we had a number of elderly tenants that have22 passed away as a result - - of partly because of23 the problems with the elevator.24 One elderly had to leave.	He had a25 heart operation and was not able to return2 
2 because the elevator service was so unreliable3 that it could have cost him his life.	And he4 ended up being forced to stay in a nursing home5	and passed away anyway.6 So I'd like to honor the memory of7 the many elderly people in my building who have8 passed away in the last two years, as well as the9 people that have left our community permanently10 and to ask you to allow us to stay.11 If you just - -12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap13 up.14 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	I know I'm15 beeping.	I'm sorry.	It's the beeping that's16 throwing me off.17 But anyway, I just wanted to say18 that although landlords shouldn't have to19 subsidize low-income tenants, we shouldn't have20 to subsidize incompetent landlords either.	And21 we shouldn't have to pay for services that we're22 not receiving.23 So I'd ask the Rent Guidelines Board24 to take that into consideration when they grant25 the increases and look at the other increases6 
2 that landlords get aside from rent increases3 through the Rent Guidelines Board.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	Thank you.6 (Applause.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Michael Meade8 representing State Senator Eric Schneiderman;9 Then Barry Soltz.10 Mr. Meade, are you on the way? Is11 that you?12 Then Michael - - Barry Soltz;13 And then Hilda Chavez.14 MR. MICHAEL MEADE:	Good afternoon.15 My name is Michael Meade.	And I am16 testifying as a representative for State Senator17 Eric Schneiderman who's in Legislative Session18 today and is unable to attend this hearing.19 Senator Schneiderman represents the20 31st Senate District which includes parts of the21 Upper West Side, West Harlem, WASHINGTON Heights,22 Inwood and Marble Hill in Manhattan and Riverdale23 in the Bronx.24 For more than half a century New25 York City has had a housing emergency.	With6 
2 vacancy rates consistently below five percent and3 market rates - - market-rate rents skyrocketing4 out of control, the crisis is as real today as it5 was when rent regulations were first implemented.6 In addition, decontrol of regulated7 apartments and yearly rent increases approved by8 the Rent Guidelines Board have pushed thousands9 of previously-regulated	apartments out of the10 system and eroded the stock of affordable11 housing.	It is now virtually impossible to find12 affordable housing New York City.13 Data recently released by the14 Department of Labor has shown that living15 expenses have risen dramatically for New York16 City tenants in the past year.	During the same17 year household incomes have remained stagnant.18 Therefore, the RGB' s proposed ranges of increases19 - - ranges of increases which could potentially be20 the largest in fifteen years, are unreasonable21 and unfair to tenants and will result in22 increased financial hardship for the low and23 moderate-income families who play such a vital24 role to this City.25 I join with the tenants today in2 
2 urging the Board to reject the guidelines3 approved in the Preliminary Vote last month.4 Instead, I recommend that the Board adopt a rent5 freeze on both one and two-year leases for all6 rent-regulated tenants, including those tenants7 who live in single room occupancies in8 residential hotels.9 In addition, I urge the RGB to10 reform the formula used to calculate operational11 costs which currently only takes into account the12 State Price Index and does not consider the other13 factors such as income growth.14 Using only the Price Index has15 allowed landlords to consistently be awarded16 large increases despite the enormous returns they17 are already receiving from their valuable18 property.19 The increases proposed by the RGB20 over the past few years, unfairly justified by21 the Price Index, have effectively padded the22 pockets of landlords through the City with the23 hard- earned money of New Yorkers, middle and24 low-income residents.25 Every week my office receives dozens2 
2 of calls from tenants who are unable to find3 affordable housing, would cannot afford to  live4 in the place they have called home for so long5 and who are alarmed by the scarcity of affordable6 housing in this City .7 There is a clear connection between8	RGB increases and the loss of affordable housing9 as more units become subject to vacancy10 decontrol.	We must do all we can to ensure that11 New York City retains its rich diversity and12 support all its citizens.13 Low and middle-income tenants must14 not be forced out of their homes which will15 surely happen if the RGB approves yet another16 rent increase.	And so Ijoin with tenants once17 again this year to urge the RGB to roll back the18 rents and to protect, not erode, the diminishing19 stock of affordable housing in New York City.20 Thank you.21 (Applause.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 Barry Saltz;24 Followed by - - change the order a25 little, Esderinor Baptiste;9 
2	Followed by Sussann Clarke .3 Go ahead, Barry.4 MR. BARRY SOLTZ:	Hi .5 My name is Barry Soltz .	I 'm a6 member of the Janal Towers Tenants Association7 and I'm on their Legal Committee.8 Recently this past January, our9 building left the Mitchell-Lama program.	Since10 then we have since gone into rent stabilization .11 And in addition to that , our tenants are being12 faced with a rent increase which is basically13 double our existing rents using unique and14 peculiar circumstances by our landlord.15 In addition to that, there are about16 20,000 former Mitchell- Lama tenants in rent17 stabilization that could be looking at these18 increases as well, that is in addition to the19 regular RGB rent increases .20 If our landlord is successful, we21 will no longer have affordable homes .	We have22 teachers, nurses, transportation workers, et23 cetera, who could all lose their homes .24 Over 25 percent of Bronx households25 are below the poverty line .	And the median5 
2 income of Bronx residents is the lowest in  the3 City, 22,000 per year.	Over thirty percent of4 Bronx residents pay over fifty percent of  their5 income on rent.6 An NYU report also found that  while7 the median rent for unstabilized apartments in - -8 unsubsidized apartments in New York City jumped9 to $900 from $750, a twenty percent increase in10 three years, the median household income in  the11 City shrank to 40,000 from 42,700.12 The Bronx has the highest number of13 maintenance deficiencies in the City, 1.4  per14 unit.	The Bronx also, according to HPD, has  the15 highest number of serious violations, 63.3  per16 1,000 rental units.17 Rent stabilized landlords are18 earning generous profits.	The 2004 income and19 expense data, which is the most recent available,20 showed net operating incomes increased from  37.821 to 38 percent.	This gain occurred despite the22 Price Index surge of 16.9 percent that  year.23 This year the Price Index of 7.8 percent is  half24 of what it was in 2004.25 We urge you to not only call for a2 
2 rent freeze, but to join City Council in their3 support of Home Rule.	Tenant's rights are being4 stomped on by aggressive landlords.	We need Home5 Rule to protect us since Albany has been unable6 to protect us.	New York City should decide7 what' s best for New York City, not Albany.8 As tenants we demand safe,9 affordable housing and a healthy, stress- free10 environment.	This can only be achieved through11 Home Rule for New York City.12 (Applause.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 Question.	Sir, question.15 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you for16 your testimony.17 How many units in your Mitchell-Lama18 building?19 MR.

My unit, a one-bedroom, I24 believe the base rent is 609.	The landlord has25 put in for a increase up to 1290.	Stellar2

I don't want it going18 up anymore.19 My name is Baptiste.20 Thank you.21 (Applause.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 3	Sussann Clarke, please .2 4	MS. SUSSANN CLARKE:	Good evening.25	My name is Sussann Clarke.	And I'm here to speak
2 on behalf, not only of myself but also my3 community.4 I lived for the past, almost twelve5 years in Harlem.	I start living in my apartment6 eleven years ago .	When I moved there I was7 paying a very small rent.	And in that space of8 time in eleven years my rent have increased to9 almost $200.	I didn't mind so much before10 because I was working.	I became disabled because11 I suffered a stroke two years ago.12 And I'm unable to work anymore.	Now13 I'm on a fixed income.	I'm living off Social14 Security since I'm unable to work.	And just like15 me there are many people, not only in my16 building, but in the community that is living off17 a small income.	There are people who work that18 their income is very low.19 And I'm here to ask this Board to20 please consider the situation that people who if21 you - - if you pay the rent, you can't pay your22 light bill, we have a lot of expense also just23 like the landlords.24 Landlords are here talking about25 their expenses, but what about ours?	We have2 
2 enormous expense .	We got to eat .	We've got to3 feed children.	We got light and telephone and4 everything.5 So I'm here asking to please6 consider our situation and please do not increase7 the rents because we - - things are terrible8 enough now as it is.	Many people have moved not9 only out of Harlem, but also the entire New York10 State.11 I know people who have moved even12 from Long Island because they couldn't live here13 anymore .	I mean it's getting to the point that14 nobody	no poor people can live here anymore.15 And we are asking together to please consider - -16 to please consider us.	And do not increase our17 rent anymore because we cannot afford - - afford18 it as it is now.	And if you increase it more19 you're telling us to get out of New York State20 entirely.	And where are we supposed to go?21 Thank you very much.22 (Applause.)2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 Joseph Wooden followed by Speaker25 Christine Quinn followed by Jerry Castro .24 
1	652	Mr. Wooden.3	MR. JOSEPH WOODEN:	Yes.4 I was going to say - - I was - - I had5 written out an article about the Urstadt Law, but67	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to speak8 louder.9 MR. JOSEPH WOODEN:	I had written10	out an article about the Urstadt Law but I'm sure11	that a lot of people are familiar with it.12 Basically what it is is Albany13 decides rent and eviction rules in New York.	And14 all of us want it out. We want New York to start15 doing this.16 (Audience participation.)17 MR. JOSEPH WOODEN:	You know, the18 thing is now, I'm not disabled.	I'm 58.	I'm19 still able to work as far as I know, but since20 2001 I got laid off by downsizing.	And er21 since then I've been trying to find work.	I'm22 not finding it.	No one will hire me.	I don't23 know if it's my age or because of what the24 insurance companies are doing as far as these25 companies are concerned.	I get work two, three12 
2 days a week sometimes, if I 'm lucky .	I 've had a3 couple of weeks where I haven' t been able to work4 at all .5 And one pf the burdens on my back6 has been trying to the afford the rent and never7 knowing if I was going to have enough.	I start8 thinking at the beginning of the month am I going9 to be able to have enough rent for next month .10 And then here it comes, a raise.	And then the11 electricity goes up .	My expenses go up .	The12 groceries go up.13 Some of these landlords, yes, they14 could have the - - yeah, there in - - they're in it15 to make money and there' s no doubt about that .16 Some of the landlords, yes, they do the work,17 they take care of the buildings but some of them18 don't .19 I hadn' t seen a decent repair in my20 apartment building on Valentine Avenue for years .21 At night I'd be watching the TV trying to listen22 to the news and I hear the patter of mouse - -23 mice across the ceiling or eating through the24 ceiling , living with the roaches .25 This is not what I wanted for my2 
2 wife and my mother - in-law .	And now I'm asking3 you or at least for some of the people.	You've4 heard from disabled people.	You heard from5 people that are on fixed incomes and I'm one of6 them .	At least think about freezing the rent .7 It 's been going up every year .	I think the8 landlords can afford a one or two-year freeze on9 that rent because we have to try to finagle our10 pocketbooks around with what we to have to deal11 with .	Let them learn how to deal with and12 finagle around also .13 And that' s all I'd like to say.14 (Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you .16 Speaker Quinn.17 CITY COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Thank18 you.19 I've come to testify tonight in20 opposition to the rent increases that have been21 put out as proposals by the Board, both those for22 the one-year and two-year leases.23 And the reason that I've decided to24 attend this particular public hearing in the25 Bronx is because I think this borough in2 
2 particular, the renters here are facing some of3 the worst challenges of any of the renters in the4	borough.5 This borough has - -6 (Audience participation.)7 CITY COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	The8 median income of renters in this borough are the9	lowest of any borough in the City.	Renters in10 this borough pay, as compared to other boroughs,11 the highest percentage of their income for rent.12 And, in fact, a little over thirty percent of the13 renters in this borough pay up to fifty percent,14 if not more, of their income towards rent .15 Now, that is a very frightening16 reality about the economic situation of the17 renters, and in particular, rent-protected18 tenants of this borough.19 And that' s a situation where if the20 proposed ranges that you all have put out there21 are going to go through, we're going to see many22 of the men and women who testified tonight be at23 risk of losing their homes.	And that' s a24 scenario which, if you put that in the context of25 the overall housing crisis in this City, the10 
2 Board, if they enact these rents will, in fact,3 make the housing situation for this borough and4 potentially the entire City worse.5 I mean this Board has a job to weigh6 all the information that you get from the tenants7 any from owners in your deliberations - though I8 believe you get more information from the actual9 books and accountings of tenants than you do from10 landlords.	But that's perhaps another discussion11 for another venue.12 That said, I think you need to bear13 in mind the very tenuous position that the14 tenants of this borough are in as you decide what15 recommendations you're going to make.16 And the ranges that are out there17 when you line those up against the other18 increasing expenses in the lives of rent19 stabilized tenants in the Bronx and in our other20 four boroughs, you will see clearly that the21 ranges you are proposing are beyond those that22 can be absorbed by tenants.23 And if you were to act on those, you24 would be, in fact, taking a step that would25 further destabilize the tenants of rent protected2 
2 housing in this City.3 And I know that isn't something that4 this Board wants to do.	So I would urge you to5 dramatically reconsider the proposal that is on6 the floor tonight.7 Thank you.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Excuse me.11 Speaker, we have a question.12 CITY COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Sorry.13 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	Thank you very14 much for coming, Madam Speaker.15 I have a question.16 The number of distressed properties,17 that is, properties that don't generate enough18 rental income to cover their expenses, has19 accelerated rapidly.	It's nearly doubled to 11.620 percent of our housing stock.21 Do you or does City Council have any22 proposals to stem the tide of increasing23 distressed properties?24	CITY COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Well,25	let me say a couple of things on that matter.
2 One, our Housing Committee is going3 to be taking up a number of different matters4 relating to distressed properties and also a5 number of different issues relating to this6 housing stock.7 You know, one of the issues that may8 or may not be causing the increase in distressed9 properties is obviously the reality of increasing10 fuel and heat costs for everyone involved in11 housing.12 And last year, though not Speaker,13 when I was Chair of the Health Committee, I did14 work with the RSA and others to try to get a15 package of legislation through that would have16 helped begin to ease some of the expenses as it17 related to rent and heat and hot water for owners18 in this City.19 We weren' t unfortunately able to get20 the Mayor' s support on that legislation, but that21 is a piece of legislation and an effort I'd like22 to go back to with the RSA and others to see what23 we can do in a fair way.	Because the reality of24 that is a lot of that cost is born by the owners25 and a loss of that cost is passed on .	But the2 
2 reality is if we don't find some way to stem it3 so it doesn't end up hurting both folks in the4 housing market, it will just continue to lead to5 the type of numbers that you're looking at.6 But we've been having conversations7 with different folks on both sides of this issue8 around distressed properties to try to spell out9 and develop a better agenda beyond just the heat10 and hot water point piece of legislation that11 we've already looked at.12 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	Thank you, Madam13 Speaker.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 CITY COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	You're16 welcome.17 (Applause.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 Let me just make an announcement and20 then Mr. Pagan will repeat it in Spanish.21 In terms of pre- registration.22 Preregistered speakers need to confirm their23 presence here upstairs.	There' s a booth before24 you walk in.	And you will only speak if you25 check in.2 
2 We're going to call people in the3 order of pre- registration and those that register4 here who did not preregister will come after.5 Mr. Pagan.6 DIRECTOR PAGAN: (In Spanish.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .8	The next speaker is Jerry Castro.9 Mr. Castro, are you here?10 Yes.	Is that you?	Yes.11 Then followed by Ana Ingersoll;12 Followed by William Stanford.13 Mr. Castro;14 Ms. Ingersoll;15 Mr. Stanford.16 If you could move over towards the17 mike so we get people - - we don't waste  time.18 Go ahead, Mr. Castro.19 MR. JERRY CASTRO:	Good20 afternoon - -21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good afternoon.22 MR. JERRY CASTRO:	- - Members of the23 Board and good afternoon, ladies and gentleman.24 (In Spanish.)25 MR. JERRY CASTRO:	Excellent .	My9 
2 name is Jerry Castro and I work with the SRO - -3 West Side SRO Law Project .4 We are here today to basically - -5 I'm here today to basically talk about what's6 affecting SRO tenants in terms of affordability7 and encourage at least - - to let the Board know8 that - - to consider the increases that you are9 opting on SRO tenants and keep it at zero.10 I've been practicing this and can't11 seem to get it straight .12 But anyhow, SRO units are part of13 affordable housing.	We are - - we tend to - -14 Jesus Christ.15 Can I come on the next - -16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Can you what?17 MR. JERRY CASTRO:	If I can be18 if I can come on the next - - on the next line and19 speak again because I'm a little nervous on this.2 0	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Nothing to21 be nervous or to be afraid of us.22 You want to come back a little23later?2 4MR. JERRY CASTRO:Yes, please.25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Okay.	Thank
2	you.3	MR. JERRY CASTRO:	Okay?	Thank4 you.5 (Applause.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We'll call you7 in a couple, all right?8 Ana Ingersoll;9 Followed by William Stanford.10 (Applause.)11 MS. ANA INGERSOLL:	Good afternoon12 to everyone here.	My name is Ana Ingersoll.	I'm13 the President of the Union Communal of Washington14 Heights and Inwood.	I am representing over 2,00015 families in the area of Washington Heights and16 Inwood.17 I have a question for the Panel and18 for the landlord.	They keep asking for a rent19 increase and rent increase for expenses.	Where20 is the money going that they're receiving and21 subsidizing from the City, state, Federal22 Government and welfare, Section 8, SCRIE, and the23 loans that they give to the bank?24 They keep asking for more money,25 more money and they're not telling us what4 
2 they're doing with the money they are receiving3 at the present time because the buildings are4 falling apart.	They' re full of roaches and mice.5 We have to ask them for permission to use the6 apartment, the roaches and the mice.7 Plus the walls come falling down.8 Lead paint, ceiling falling, people getting sick,9	children developing asthma for no reason other10 than to be in a contaminated apartment.11 So ladies and gentlemen, can the12 landlords please answer us where they're putting13 the money into.	They're not putting it back in14 buildings.15 That' s all I have to say.16 Thank you.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 (Applause.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	William2 0	Stanford;21	Followed by Nat Weiner.2 2	Go ahead, Mr. Stanford.23 MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:	Hi.24 You need to put a freeze on the rent25 increases because a lot of buildings here in New23 
2 York City have violations.	The tenants that live3 in these buildings with violations, they pay rent4 and yet - -5 (Audience participatio n.)6 MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:	they're7 not getting any assistance.	The landlords aren't8 doing anything about these violations and yet you9 expect them to pay you more rent.	Where' s this10 - - where' s this money going?	That' s what I'd11 like know.	It is going to the bars?	Is it going12 to the peep shows?	Is it going to other shows?13 What?	Where is it going?	I don' t understand14 that.15 I mean I'm like this, if you're not16 going to go out to the landlords who don't do17 anything about these violations, then why the18 hell should these tenants pay you extra money for19 rent? I don't understand that.	What are they20 getting out of this deal?21 (Applause.)22 MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:	It sounds23 like you're telling us to break it down like a24 generation X, are you serious?	I don't want	I25 wouldn' t pay you extra rent.	I tell you to your2 
2	faces, if you want extra rent, you take me to3	Housing Court.	It's that's simple, you take me4 to Housing Court.	Because I don't feel they5 should have to pay you more money.6 This is getting ridiculous.	You7 keep charging more money for rent like the Wayans8 Brothers and yet you don't assist them when they9 have violations, whether it's a rodent problem, a10 flood problem, a ceiling problem, a lead problem.11 Some of these tenants have asthma so12 they have to watch their step, okay?	Lives are13 at risk.	If you're going to put their lives at14 risk, don' t ask them to shell out more money for15 rent because I don't think that's right.	They16 should shell out money for medication if that's17 the case.18 You got to be - - you got to be19 kidding.	You know, this is like - - this is off20 the wall.	I'm sorry.	This is off the wall.21 You really should consider putting a freeze on22 these rents for a long time because you got23 enough in your pockets as it is.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 (Applause.)4 
2 Mr. Weiner, Nat Weiner.3 If you could, the people that I4 called would get closer to the mike, it would be5 great .6 Nat Weiner;7 Dorothy Chapoty;8 Followed by Vincent Disanto, okay?9 Nat Weiner;10 Dorothy Chapoty;11 Vincent Disanto;12 Mr. Weiner.13 MR. NAT WEINER:	In 1977 during a14 World Series Game, the Good Year Blimp focused on15 a building burning a few blocks away.	Howard16 Cosell said the Bronx was burning.17 The Bronx is no longer burning, it's18 booming.	There's construction everywhere.	But19 at the same time the people who supported the20 Bronx when it was burning, the people who propped21 us the Bronx when it was burning when nobody else22 wanted the Bronx, are now being forced out of23 their homes.24 I would request that the RGB very25 seriously consider this and give us a very small2 
2 increase in our rent.3 Thank you.4 (Applause.)5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 Dorothy Chapoty.7 MS. DOROTHY CHAPOTY:	My name is8 Dorothy Chapoty.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sorry.10 MS. DOROTHY CHAPOTY:	I'm a - - the11 golden years, they called this the golden years.12 I'm a senior citizen in Washington Heights.13 There is a large population of Senior citizens14 there.	And over the years the rents have gone up15 and the services have gone down.	And some16 landlords, some of them should open their books17 to show if they really have a loss.18 And there are tenants who don't get19 heat when they should, but the landlords still20 get their rent increases.	And when the rents go21 up security goes up.	You have to pay more22 security.	And there' s interest on that security.23 And a lot of people do not get it from their24 landlords even though they ask for it year after25 year. They don't get a paint job when they ask10 
2 for it.3 Seniors - - the increases in their4 Social Security is next to nothing, but yet large5 increases for phone, Con Ed, medicine, that goes6 up.	And in the investments, about investments,7 if you - - they can't keep up with the standard of8 living.9 Back in 1957 you could get three10 percent interest on your savings account or your11 Christmas Club if you made like $70 a week.	And12 today, right now you have to have $49,000 in the13 bank in the savings to get a .35 percent.	And14 it used to take one week's salary or less to pay15 your rent.16 And I live in a walk-up.	He doesn't17 even have to fix an elevator.	And there' s no18 more garbage collection.	They don't give you new19 toilet seats when - - and they don't - - there's a20 struggle for a paint job.21 And recently the landlord' s getting22 $13.62 for a washing machine which we thought23 maybe would pay for his water but he said no, if24 the plumbing breaks.25 And my landlord was on Channel Seven2 
2 as being the worst landlord in the City yet he3 gets all the increases he wants.	And I think4 all landlords should do something about the5 pigeons.	People talk about asthma and you can6 get meningitis and asthma from pigeons.	And it's7 just - - the buildings are just full of them in8 Washington Heights.9 And that' s all I have to say.10 (Applause.)11 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I have a12 question.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 We have a question.	Ma'am, we have15 a question.16 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you for your17 testimony.18 MS. DOROTHY CHAPOTY:	Okay.19 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	You said that you20 live in Washington Heights?21 MS. DOROTHY CHAPOTY:	Yes.22 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Who is your23 landlord?24 MS. DOROTHY CHAPOTY:	Moshe Pilli25 (phonetic).	I thought he owned two buildings.2 
2	He owns a sleuth of them.3	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	How many units4	in your building?5	MS. DOROTHY CHAPOTY:	Twenty- five6 families in my building.	And twenty in the one7 next door.	And we all get heat off the one8 boiler.9	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And you said10 that you all have horrible conditions in the11 building?12 MS. DOROTHY CHAPOTY:	Well, we13 could use a paint job on our fire escapes.	In14 fact, I had the Fire Department come over because15 at one time two steps were missing and they said16 they weren't going to fix it.	But when the Fire17 Department came over, they fixed it the next day.18 But they don't - - people are complaining they're19 not getting paint jobs in the next building from20 mine.	They told me that today.21 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And what do they22 do in order to try to get those maintenance or23 repairs?24 MS. DOROTHY CHAPOTY:	They just25 he just ignores some of them.	Not everybody,10 
2 some people can get things they want but some3 people can't.4	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Why do you think5	that is?6	MS. DOROTHY CHAPOTY:	I think7 'cause some people know the law and some people8 took him to court, like myself.9	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Okay.	Thank10 you.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank12 you.13 (Applause.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker15 is Vincent Disanto;16 Followed by Ursula Morgan;17 Followed Julio Munoz.18 Go ahead, Mr. Disanto.19 MR. VINCENT DISANTO:	Hi.	Good20 evening.21 My name is Vincent Disanto.	I22 reside at 336 West 19th Street which is a single23 room occupancy building.	I've been there about24 ten years.25 The property has been flipped for10 
2 more than ten times, fifteen times over the ten3 years, more years than I've actually lived there,4 always changing owners.	We don't know what's5 going on .	And really poor management.6 It's an old and run down building7 and an eyesore on the building.	It's a8	tree- lined street.	It's upkeep is very limited.9	Inside the main common corridor area10 it's dirty, dusty.	And some sections of the11 carpeting are actually burnt and torn up .12 We share toilets in a building and13 they're never cleaned.	There's gnats and roaches14 crawling all over the floors and walls.15 The reason for participating today16 is because I'm primarily in defense of my fellow17 tenants.	Many of them are old and they are on18 assisted living.	They live day- to-day with19 extraordinarily tight budgets and it's just20 getting by.21 An increase in their rent would have22 a cataclysmic effect on how they manage to23 survive.	Myself, my paycheck is already24 slaughtered by nearly fifty percent which is25 diverted to paying rent.	My income doesn't10 
2 allow for me to live luxuriously and I'm forced3 to penny-pinch so that I can pay bills on time.4 Everyday is a struggle to limit my spending so I5 can also afford to pay back my student loans6 which I aspire one day to move out of the SRO,7 but right now it's really tough.8 Personally a two to four-percent9 increase in my rent would deduct another $30 to10 $40 out of my own pocket.	Spare change to some,11 but it's funds I depend on to sustain obligatory12 life functions.13 It's hard enough already to plan my14 expense allowance as it is.	A rent increase15 would greatly throw me off and ultimately I'm16 afraid I might even be forced to move out.17 Please do not give us a rent hike.18 Thank you.19 (Applause.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question, sir.21 Question . Question .22 DIRECTOR KAUFMAN:	Hi.2 3	MR. VINCENT DISANTO:	Hi.24	DIRECTOR KAUFMAN:	How many rooms25	are in your SRO?
2	MR. VINCENT DISANTO:	There are3	thirty units.4	DIRECTOR KAUFMAN:	And do you know5	how many are occupied by stabilized6 MR. VINCENT DISANTO:	Good question.7 Actually the entire top floor is8	unoccupied.	About six to ten units not occupied.9	DIRECTOR KAUFMAN:	Are unoccupied?10	MR. VINCENT DISANTO:	Unoccupied,11	yes.12 DIRECTOR KAUFMAN:	And the rest13 are stabilized tenants in14 MR. VINCENT DISANTO:	I believe so.15 DIRECTOR KAUFMAN:	Thank you.16 MR. VINCENT DISANTO:	Thank you.17 (Applause.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ursula Morgan;19 Followed by Julio Munoz;20 Followed by Rafael Gomez Luma.21 Ms. Morgan.22 MS. URSULA MORGAN:	Yes.2 3	Hello.	I live in the Norwood24 section, zip code 01467.25 And I just want to let you know that24 
2	the increases are a bit too much.	We cannot3	afford another increase.	If you do, there are4 going to be, by the thousands, a lot of homeless5 people.6 And I'm just going to give you one7 example of a family in the neighborhood who lived8 right next to me and got evicted because she9 could not pay her rent.	She became a victim of10 society today.	You know, she is a person who has11 kidney failure, has three children and was12 evicted because her rent went up and could not13 pay it.14 She stayed in the street for a whole15 night with her three children because shelters16 won' t even take her in due to her illness.17 As a result, she had to stay at a18 family member's house in a one-bedroom apartment,19 okay, where her grandmother lived.	And she was20 going to be - - she was being threatened to be21 evicted if they didn't get the family out.22 This is a problem that' s going on.23 And this is just one, okay.	There was an24 elderly citizen that lived in my building also25 and she got evicted, okay.4 
2 They are - - Pinnacle has been buying3 up all these buildings and they have been taking4 people and throwing them out, okay, under all5 sorts of - - all sorts of trickery that they're6 using.	They'll say that the people are not7 really the tenants there simply because their8 name has been changed or they've been married in9 previous years.10 There' s a lot - - there' s a lot11 that's going on.	And if you want to see a City12 full of homeless people, keep raising the rents13 • cause that's exactly what's going to happen.14 (Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 Julio Munoz.17 MR. JULIO MUNOZ:	Yes.	Thank you,18 Mr. Chairman.	Thank you to the Board Members for19 scheduling this meeting here in the Bronx. It20 makes it easier for us to voice our opinion.21 I'm a tenant in the Bronx.	Lived in22 the Bronx all my life.	I'm concerned about the23 proposed raises.24 I would submit that I think that for25 the one-year and the two-year lease, this cycle I2 
2 think we should freeze them.3 I also am concerned about rent4	control basically as a law.	I think that New5 York City needs, and I don't know if you have any6 input in that, but New York City needs to have7 the power and the City Council should have the8 power to set the rates.9 I'm also concerned about the fact10 that wages have not increased in New York City  or11 in New York State to keep up with the increases12 that you've proposed in the past.	And so I13 submit to you again to freeze the - - just decycle14 the raise.15 Thank you.16 (Applause.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 Rafael Gomez Luma;19 Followed by Eamon Toscano.20 Mr. Luma;21 Mr. Toscano, hold on a second.22 Followed by Mary Silva.2 3	Go ahead.2 4	MR. RAFAEL GOMEZ LUMA:	Hello.	As25	a member of the Community Center I go to many
2 appointments and I visit many senior citizens.3 They are very concerned with the situation of4 housing in New York City right now.	Their income5 is not increasing and rents and inflation and all6 the other things are really talking away from the7 way of living.8 And I think it is important when we9 make decisions today to take into consideration10 the future of this generation and the previous - -11	and the future generations .12 I think that it's easy to point out13 to the landlord who are trying to make the most14 money as they can.	They are in the business of15 making money.	And it's also - - it's easy for16 the landlords to talk about, you know, the17 increase in the rent, on the oil, the property18 taxes, inflation, and some other things.	But we19 have to look at the people who supposed to make20 laws like State law officials, City officials who21 are not taking care, they are not addressing the22 problem of affordable housing.	And because of23 them, because they are neglecting their job, is24 that today we face these problems.25 So we have to make sure that these12 
2 people get the message and to tell them that3 judgment day is coming in November and that we're4 going to remember and we're going to left behind5 those who failed the test.6 Thank you.7 (Applause.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 Mr. Toscano;10	Followed by Mary Silva.11	Hold on one second.12 Followed by Lisette Mendez.13 Go ahead, Mr. Toscano.14 MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	Good evening.15 My name is Eamon Toscano.	I own a seven-family16 apartment house in the Bronx.	It's composed of17 six two-bedroom apartments and one one-bedroom18 apartment.19 The average rent for the apartment20 is $751.	That covers a range of 483 for21 two-bedrooms on the low end and 940 for22 two-bedrooms on the high end.23 All the tenants have working24 families.	I've owned the building since 1982.25 And for the first eighteen years I had to put12 
2 money into it every year, even though I did most3 of the repairs or at least many of the repairs4 myself.5 I worked a day job and I made the6 repairs on weekends.	I had, and I still have,7 very understanding tenants.	I bought all kinds8 of "how to" books.	And among the many things I9 learned was that I'll never be a good plumber.10 I bought the building during the11 years when the City was talking private property12 from land owners by making decisions that blocked13 land owners from making a return on their14 investment.15 Landlords who had for years16 satisfactorily maintained their property had to17 face the sad realization they could not hold on.18 Only well-financed landlords who are silly young19 men who felt that this was there only chance to20 ever own a multi- family building became or21 remained landlords.22 Now, you already have a large amount23 of data on the cost of operating a building in24 New York City.	You already know that there's a25 big difference between Manhattan and the outer2 
2 boroughs.	And you know there's a big difference3 between a small building and a larger building as4 far as the impact of increasing costs.	It seems5 that the small landlords are always playing6 catchup and never quite getting there.7 Your position on the Board calls for8 you to preserve the housing stock in New York9 City.	If you vote an increase that is not10 reasonable, then landlords will cut corners that11 will have a negative impact on tenants and on the12 quality of housing both the physical plant and13 tenant services.14 My testimony tonight is simply to15 ask you to vote an increase that your own16 research tells you is needed to maintain and17 perpetuate an adequate standard of non- luxury18 housing.19 How much would you need to continue20 to deliver decent housing to tenants if you parse21 money?	And landlords will be able to point to22 you as contributing factor in any reduction in23 the quality of non-luxury housing.24 Thank you for the opportunity to25 help you establish a reasonable guideline for the2 
Thank you, Mr.Mr. Chair.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.	We have7 a question.8 (Applause.)9	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for10 your testimony.11 You have what, six units or seven12 units?13 MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	Seven.14 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Seven units in15 your building.16 And the zip code, please is?17 MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	10467.18 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Great.19 You've owned the building since 198220 you said?21 MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	Yes.22 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	For the past23 24 years.	And out of those number of years24 you've put money into this building about how25 many years?10 
2 MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	Seventeen out3 of the eighteen, out of the first eighteen.4 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And the rents5 that you're charging, the ones that you quoted6 are modest rents.7 MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	It's what the8 rules allow.9	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	That' s right.10 If it got to a point where your11 expense rose faster than you were able to12 increase your rents - - and I'm sure your tenants13 have been very stable over the past ten years?14 MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	Pretty much so.15 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Pretty much16 so, okay.	So you're not getting big increases17 'cause you don' t have much turnover.18 MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	I don't.	I19 actually count on that every once in a while20 because it helps and that accounts for the 940.21 But, you know, these people - - I live across the22 street.	I've known these people all my life so23 it's not like I can encourage people to leave.24 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	I understand.25 That's commendable.10 
2 Now, if it got to a point where your3 expense profile rose much faster than your4 ability to raise these rents, would you consider5 selling your property?6 MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	Sure.7 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And how many - -8	MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	I'd sell both.9 The one I live in, the one across and the one10 we're talking about.11 I mean the whole idea was if I can't12 keep this neighborhood whole I'm going to have to13 leave too.14 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And how many15 phone calls a month would you say you get,16 unsolicited phone calls, from brokers or17 investors trying to buy your property?18 MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	None.19 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	You don't get20 them at all?21 MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	No.22 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Can they?	Do23 you have a listed phone number?2 4	MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	I have a listed25	phone number, yeah.
2	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.3	MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	There was4 another question?5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No questions.6 Thank you.7 Wait.	Question, sorry.	Mr.8 Toscano. Sorry.9 Ms. Kaufman.10 DIRECTOR KAUFMAN:	Hi.11 I just had a question for you.12 What would you consider a reasonable13 increase this year?14 MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	You're talking15 about a wish list of like - - starting with 10016 percent.	I actually think that something	I17 realize your guidelines have come up with a18 bracket of eight and a half percent.	I would19 hope that you would come near that.	Ten percent20 would be ideal. 2122 I mean if you think about it, I23 don't think I could ever get that, but - - and it24 would be a burden on some of the tenants.	But25 when you think of the lower-paying tenants, let's22 
2 face it, they - - they' re all working people and3 some of these apartments are very reasonably4 priced under the current rules.	So ten percent5 of $500 is stiff, but still $12 a week so that' s6 what I would look for.7 DIRECTOR HOLDER: I have a question.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Adriene.9	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	You said the10 majority of your tenants are long-term tenants.11 MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	Yes.12 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	So - -13 MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	Long-term, you14 want to define long-term tenants?	But I mean15 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Yes, please.16 MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	The newest one17 there is about going on three years.	And the18 oldest one is twenty years, thirty years.19 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Have you been20 able to realize the increases every year for all21 your tenants?22 MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	No.	If you're23 talking about the difference between the legal24 rent and the collectable rent, no.25 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	So you have10 
2	given out preferential rent leases?3	MR. EAMON TOSCANO:	I've gone by the4 rules and tried to get what I think is5 reasonable.	But quite frankly if somebody' s not6 making a lot of money and the calculation comes7 out to $45 a month, I'll either round down to 408 or something like that just to make it more9 palatable.10 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you.11 (Applause.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 Thank you.14 Mary Silva;15 Followed by Lisette Mendez;16 Followed by Jose Rodriguez.17 Go ahead.
