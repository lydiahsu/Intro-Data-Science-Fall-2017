34	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good morning.5 My name is Marvin Markus .	I'm the Chair of the6 New York City Rent Guidelines Board.7 I'd like to welcome you to a public8 hearing, one in a series of public meetings and9 public hearings designed to fulfill our statutory10 mandate which is to promulgate allowable lease11 rental adjustments for residential apartment12 houses, loft apartments and hotel apartments for13 leases that take effect pursuant to the Rent14 Stabilization Law, October 1, 2007 and the end of15 September 2008 - - 2006.	Sorry . September - -16 October 1, 2006 through the end of February 2007.17 Let me make a couple of18 announcements.19 As most people know, the final vote20 on the guidelines will be held next Tuesday night21 here at Cooper Union starting at 5:30 p.m.22 For Board Members, in your folder23 you' ll find copies of the proposed apartment,24 loft and hotel orders as printed in the City25 Record on May 15th that we were holding hearings5 
 2 on this language that was adopted on the3 preliminary vote.4 Please review it for the June 27th5 vote.	You' ll also recall that the last two6 nights or three nights ago in the Bronx we gave7 you, in your folder, the explanatory statement of8 a draft explanatory statement which will also9 be up for adoption on Tuesday.10 Also Board Members, please submit11 your nonpublic per diem request to Leon by July 12	15th.13 Now, in terms of the rules here,14 many of you have preregistered.	Just so you15 understand, preregistered speakers who have16 confirmed their presence on the day of the17 hearing will be heard in the order of18 pre-registration and before those that are not19 preregistered.	However, if we run out of20 preregistered - - however, if your number on the21 preregister listed has been passed, if I called22 your number and I called the name that' s higher23 than yours before you check in, your place is24 forfeited and you must reregister at the end of25 the list.13 
2 Speakers will be called by the Chair3 in the order of preregistration only if they have4 checked in.	So you need to check in and come5 back in the auditorium.6 We' re going to get started now.7 The first speaker is Anita Romm.8 MS. ANITA ROMM:	Romm.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Romm.	Oh,10 Anita.	How you doing? You're going to sing it11 for us today?12 MS. ANITA ROMM:	If I have time.13 Good morning.	My name is Anita14 Romm.	I'm the songwriter of the Metropolitan15 Council on Housing.16 Every year I come here and told you17 what will happen if rents go up more than they18 should, such as people being unable to purchase19 goods and services resulting in broken families,20 business failures and unemployment.21 You know why I couldn't come here22 last year, but most of you read the written23 statement that I mailed, didn't you?2 4	My husband broke his ankle, was25	discharged from the nursing in a wheelchair and I
2 had to write to the Human Rights Commission to3 force my landlord to install "Walter's Ramp. "4 Now he can use a cane, but I still5 have to drive him around.	And gas has gone way6 up.7 I am now in a Medicare Part D8 doughnut hole.	One of my drugs is ridiculously9 expensive but if I don't take it, I could become10 disabled and I would have to spend much more to11 hire a home health aide and I wouldn't be able to12 come here and bother you anymore.13 Instead of a $540 in co-payments14 last year - - like last year, I now face almost15 $5,000. I'm really being squeezed.16 Now in past years when expenses17 didn't really go up landlords still got big18 increases.	2002 should have merited a rent roll19 back, but you guys still voted an increase.20 This past winter wasn't so bad after21 all and considering the net disappearance of22 rent-regulated units, now is the time for you to23 vote for a rent freeze and to push for repeal of24 the Urstadt Law.25 Okay.	Give us a rent freeze will6 
2 you huh, give us a rent freeze will you, huh.3 Every year you raise all of our rents above the4 level, the level dictated by common sense.	Give5 us a rent freeze will you, huh and you won't have6 to listen to my songs.7 (Applause.)8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms . Romm, make9 sure he gets the notes right too, not just the10 words.11 Thank you, Anita.12 James Anderson.13 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Good morning.14 I am here15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to speak16 into the mike, Mr. Anderson .17 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Yes .18 All right?19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay .20 MR. JAMES ANDERSON :	I'm here to21 bring facts, evidence and proof.	Please be nice,22 listen carefully and if you see that I cheat,23 talking wrong or something by the rule, please24 correct it .	And don't be scared, I respect your25 authority .9 
2 You know, the same problem we state3 and make it more, but all the problems go up.4 Fuel go three time up.	And nobody of these big5 shots protested that fuel has to coming down or6 even stop it, only Bush protest it.7 Many people and Congress care that8 the election near and maybe come a little down,9 how long, we don't know.10 United Nations don't include.	They11 must be stopped and they don't care so not12 necessary to blame landlords for the fuel.13 Thanks God only Bush says cut the tax.	John14 Carey don't care and call another filibuster,15 just want to stand to talk.	Do not care and16 definitely can never be care.	Even the Mayor and17 Governor.18 And Mayor very smart, 35 Federal19 Government, now they cut it about 50 percent20 about money towards Federal.	Must give - - be21 give it to the seat, so coming more now.22 A lot of people complain and ask23 affordable house.	If you ask me and anybody, the24 first will be agree affordable house.	We need it25 for big family, working people, loss salaries.2 
2 But Mayor don't care, Governor don' t care,3 Legislation don't care.	And they don't build up4 probably projects for City buildings last four5 years.	Very smart people. So we living in6 liberal city when the landlord don't give the7 people the rights like terrorist.	When landlords8 says lease one year, tenant says two years, but9 then two years.	You must give one though.	But10 we don't have in New York City because New York11 City liberal city, still going around, still now12 problem about that.13 And how we continue this, God knows.14 Liberals who claim they're for people they don't15 care, even in Albany, in Washington D.C. , they16 just very at peace to criticize each other and17 this is the game so how we get to continue to18 make that known.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Wrap you, Mr.20 Anderson.21 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Any question?22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No. You've got23 another 26 seconds.24 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Twenty six25 second.2 
2 I see outside says before some thing3 to the landlord, open your boxes, they are4 crooks.	I want one answer to them, open your5	necks for sweet sex and they may stop.	Because6 open the books, only district attorney, judges7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay,8 Mr. Anderson.	Thank you.	Thank you.	Thank you.9	MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	That' s been10 against the11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 Goodnight.	Bye- bye.	Thank you.13 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Have a nice14 day.15 (Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Have a nice day.17 Can you strike that from the record?18 Ann Salzberg is next;19 Followed by Patrick Siconolfi.	I20 think I spelled your name wrong.21 Dalia Krinsky follows Mr. Siconolfi;22 And Mr. Korman, Edward Korman23 follows Ms. Krinsky.24 Ann Salzberg.25 MS. ANN SALZBERG:	Thank you.10 
2 Thank you for letting me speak, this Board.3 My name is Ann Salzberg4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Speak up.5 MS. ANN SALZBERG:	Sorry.6 Okay.	My name is Ann Salzberg and I7 live in Peter Cooper/Stuyvesant, a once8 affordable housing complex.	I am also a rent9 stabilized tenant.10 And I'm begging you on behalf of the11 more than one billion - - one million other rent12 stabilized tenants - -13 A VOICE:	Speak louder.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on a second.15 Fix her mike.16 We' ll restart it.	Hold on a second.17 MS. ANN SALZBERG:	Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You want one19 tall, one short one.20 MS. ANN SALZBERG:	Hey, good things21 come in small packages.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, that's23 right.	No, I'm just talking from a process24 standpoint if we have to change the mike every25 time.5 
1	232 Hold on a second. I'll give you back3 your three minutes.4 Go ahead.5 MS. ANN SALZBERG:	Thank you.6 Okay. Thank you for letting me speak7 before this Board.8	My name is Ann Salzberg.	And I live9 in Peter Cooper/Stuyvesant, a once affordable10 housing complex .	I am also a rent stabilized11 tenant.12 And I am begging you in behalf of13 more than one million other rent stabilized14 tenants to please not implement these unfair rent15 increases that will be a terrible burden for many16 of my fellow tenants.17 Both my family and my husband' s18 parents came to New York from war-torn Europe19 and just as Joel Klein' s parents raised their20 families in affordable housing and were able to21 send their children to college because of22 affordable housing.23 Now, as we all know, affordable24 housing or rent stabilized apartments are25 disappearing from this great City.	My husband9 
2 and I work hard and cannot afford this 8.53 increase.4 Like many New Yorkers our wages have5 not kept pace with these yearly rent increases6 and, in fact, are sagging behind more and more7 each year.8 We all know that this City is9 becoming only affordable for the rich and the10 middle class or the poor are being priced out.11 You may ask who cares about affordable housing or12 rent stabilized apartments?	Everyone should13 because without them it will be harder for the14 future generations of firemen, teachers, cops,15 social workers, health aids, nurses and et16 cetera, to come to New York and continue to make17 this City great.18 I am pleading with this Board to be19 fair to me and my fellow tenants.	Please don't20 price us out with these unreasonable rent21 increases.	New York City has no problem in22 giving away tax breaks for wealthy stadium23 builders or property tax giveaways to developers24 of luxury apartments and the people who buy these25 co-ops or condos.2 
2 I wish that I could afford a co-op3 or condo in New York City so that I don't have to4 come before this Board each - - each year.	But5 the fact that the average price of one is now6 close to one million dollars is beyond the reach7 of many New Yorkers like me.8 Again, please consider what these9 huge rent increases do to peoples' lives.10 Thank you for your time.11 (Applause.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 Patrick Siconolfi;14 Followed by Dalia Krinsky;15 Followed by Mr. Korman;16 Followed by Adele Bender;17 Followed by Gale Stein-Weinstein.18 Go ahead.19 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Good20 morning.	And thank you for pronouncing it21 correctly.22 I'm Patrick Siconolfi from Community23 Housing Improvement Program, CHIP.24 The Board has determined that the25 Price Index for the current year is 7.8 percent2 
2 and I will address several aspects of this3 number.4 First, the number is unrealistically5 low.	It is time to review the research methods6 and the data collection practices of the Board.7 The numbers which resulted from this process are8 not consistent with other data on the subject,9 nor are they consistent with the experience of10 owners.11 Second, the Board has adopted a12 sustained practice of discounting these13 components, the components of the plan.	While14 the practice is used broadly by the RGB and has15 been used for some time, the discounting of16 expense data became especially egregious this17 year.	A look at the energy component, for18 instance, demonstrates the point.19 One example concerns discounting of20 electricity costs by a measurement method.	Here21 the RGB reveals that it used two methods to22 assess the change in electricity costs.	One23 method yielded a decrease of eight percent.	The24 other method yielded an increase of 19 percent.25 The Board, of course, used the decrease of eight2 
2 percent; the difference of 21 percent is not even3 explained.4 Suggesting - -5 A VOICE:	Louder.6 MR. PATRICK KORMAN:	Sure.7 Suggesting that there was a decrease8 in energy costs in the current environment is not9 just credible.10 Another example is the RGB' s refusal11 to acknowledge a new cast - - cost category for12 lead abatement expenses, as if these costs are13 counted elsewhere or don't matter, refusing to14 account for these costs contradicts the RGB' s own15 statement on page one of the PIOC that, and I16 quote, "the market basket is fixed in the sense17 that the quantities of goods and services of each18 kind remain constant."19 Clearly, there is new20 responsibility, the basket is constant, it21 becomes larger.22 Another example is the discounting23 of tax expenses.	Though less egregious in this24 year than previously, due to drop in value of the25 value of abatements due to a drop in the7 
2 assessments rather than to the change in your3 procedure, but this is having the effect of4 showing a lower tax expense than is applicable5 and it takes back with this hand what the6 Department of Finance grants to owners7 previously.8 Third is the Board's practice of9 setting guidelines which are significantly less10 than the PIOC.	Even if one were to assume that11 the PIOC in its derivation and treatment of12 expenses were correct, let's make that13 assumption, the Board then engages in another14 practice which is to set the guidelines15 substantially lower than the PIOC, that's what16 you've done over the last several years.17 Last year the PIOC was 5.8 percent18 and it was discounted all the way down to 2.7519 percent as a guideline.	Accordingly, the Board20 is not even willing to honor the expenses it does21 recognize.22 Finally, a reminder.	Price controls23 always lead to shortages. We are now more than24 sixty years into a temporary housing emergency.25 It should be clear that throughout that the2 
2	current price control regime it does not work.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Question .5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.6 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for7 your testimony.8 In your estimate what should the - -9	what should the range of increases be?10	MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Well, I11	think to answer that you have take look at what' s12 actually happened with expenses.	And one of the13 things that you have to look at first is what' s14 actually happening with energy expenses.15 To suggest that energy expenses,16 particularly electricity expenses went down, is17 just not credible.	I think you need to look at18 the fact those increases have been, to cite your19 own number, at least 20 percent, and to cite20 other numbers, much higher than that.	So I21 think we can look at that.22 And when you look at the amount that23 contributes to the total cost basket I think you24 see that the PIOC is not realistic, it's25 unrealistically low.12 
2 In addition to that, and we've been3 saying this as an industry for years nows, the4 rent - - the lead paint abatement expense are5 real.	They're not accounted in the basket6 anywhere.	And you have the basket of expenses7 divided into, you know, eight or nine components.8 And you chart those components.	But what happens9 when by statute the City adds another component,10 you know, you're just ignoring it.	There has to11 be a recognition to that cost factor.12 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Just as a13 follow-up - -14 A VOICE:	Excuse me, excuse me, but15 it's inequitable for - -16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sir, you'll get17 your chance.18 A VOICE:	No, no, no.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, yes, yes.20 You will get your chance.	Yes, yes, yes, you21 will have time	no, no, no.	Quiet.	You will22 be entitled to talk when it's your chance.23 Go ahead.	Go ahead.24 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Just a final25 follow-up.2 
2 You mentioned that real estate3 assessments have gone down a bit.4 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Well, that5 was in the prior year.	This year,	and if I just6 may, this year they've gone up in terms of some7 additional levels, the assessments have gone up8 fifteen percent this year.9 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Yes, we see a10 further rise in assessments if the Homeland11 Security funding doesn' t come to New York.12 MR. SICONOLFI:	Well, yes.	And13 for that and a whole host of other reasons.	You14 have to take a look at how the City Council sets15 that assessment number and the tax rate number.16 Essentially they back into those numbers after17 they've set the City' s budget.	And the city18 there' s enormous pressure on The city budget,19 which, as we know, we' re looking at maybe a good20 year now and we know that the next several years21 out are projected to be very significance22 deficits.23 And what they' re going to do because24 they have no - - they don't really have an option.25 What they're doing is they're going to back into2 
2 high assessment and higher tax rates and it will3 passed on to the industry.4	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Not fall back6 into the assessments, they're backing it into the7 tax rate.8 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	They're9 backing it to the tax rate but they set the10 assessment higher as well.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, they don't12 set the assessments, Finance sets the13 assessments.14 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Finance sets15 the assessments.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank17 you.18 The next speaker is Dalia Krinsky.19 (Applause.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Followed by Mr.21 Korman;22 Hold on a second.23 Followed by Adele Bender;24 Followed by Gale Stein-Weinstein.25 Go ahead.12 
2 MS. DALIA KRINSKY:	Thank you.3 I am speaking to the committee, and4 the chairman specifically because my husband5 could not be here today because he' s in court.6 And just to mention that it's7 happened to be the wrong time for professional8 people that has to pay very high rent in9 Manhattan City.10 And what I want to say here that11 landlord reach a point in New York City, in12 Manhattan that the greed is going above and13 above.	And what happened is and the reason that14 I'm here is because I'm speaking on behalf of a15 lot of migrants in New York City.16 And I was - - February 12th we had a17 traumatic event, we had a fire in our apartment,18 okay, Upper East Side.	I went through what even19 my folks with different people that representing20 rent stabilized rent control.	And I learned that21 the law did not require alarms in the hallway,22 either in the lobby.	And what I learned is the23 landlord didn' t care.	We were six months outside24 from our apartment because the landlord, who25 lives in different country, and we pay ten2 
2 thousand dollars to fight in court and the judge3 was holding her in contempt.	And my daughter was4 inside the apartment.	And the Fire Department5 and the City Council said come here.6 And to educate the people in the7 committee, that instead to focus on money and8 increasing rent to very hard working people,9 focus on safety.	Please, I'm begging you, people10 in our building did not even now about the fire11 that occur in the Upper East Side.	It could12 happen to anyone tomorrow.13 The Fire Department said only14 someone like you can fight.	Let me say that, I15 don' t wish on anyone, no one as a mother, as a16 human being.	Please, I'm begging you again and17 again and again, landlord live in foreign country18 and I have to subsidize their lifestyle because19 no law require safety to children.2 0	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 (Applause.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Korman, Ed23 Korman.2 4	MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	Mr. Chairman,25	Members of the Board, first, may I ask how the
2 Board measures the Price Index of operating3 costs?	I would have to say that properties that4 do not submit an RPIE are not included in the5 calculations and these properties are in the6 hi-density, low-income areas.7 The small properties with four to8 twenty units, which make up a big majority of New9 York City housing - and their locations are in10 Bushwick, Ridgewood, South Bronx, all high11 density areas that are watched by insurance12 companies and that have six to eight or ten13 people or sometimes more, living in a Two bedroom14 apartment.15 What is the RGB and this16 administration doing to support the existing17 properties that we have? Your percentages are off18 by more than you will ever know.19 Real estate tax increases are going20 through the roof because the assessments of the21 buildings in manhattan that these developers22 have, are escalating and are making mega money23 causing our assessments to escalate and we are24 losing money.	So the percent that the Board saw25 as an increase IS not reality.2 
2 I have six- family housing in3 Bushwick, a number of admitted companies,4 Greenwich, Realm, et cetera, stopped writing in5 these areas.	My broker had to insure me with a6 non-admitted company, American Safety Indemnity7 Company.	Did you ever hear of them?	I didn't.8 And my insurance went from $3,267.00 TO   $5,300.009 and your increase, again, inaccurate.10 Natural gas prices.	Last year at11 $8.29 per decatherm from 1/05 TO 12/05 I paid  a12 total $11,775.22 for the year, plus the cost to13 KeySpan for delivery.14 The price this year went TO $15.4315 per Decatherm.	So far this year from January '0616 to May 5 '06 I paid a total of $11,234.22, plus17 the cost of KeySpan deliveries more than doubled18 and the invoices are enclosed to show you.19 Number 2 oil went from $1.30 to a20 high OF $2.38.21 If an owner has high costs, the only22 way we can pass them on is through the RGB.23 Service companies I'm sure received similar24 increases, they just pass them on to the25 consumer.2 
2 Have you ever been to Housing Court?3 If one tenant out OF six OR eight doesn't pay4 rent, it's devastating to an owner, especially5 when the judge gives the tenant six months to pay6 up before you can evict them.7 The DEP is doing the multifamily,8 conversation, a six family house will go from9 $2,100 a month a year to $3,500 plus nine10 percent.	It's up to 67 percent.11 The Lead Law, we have to get a dusk12 light test which for every apartment is over13 $400.	We don' t get that money back.14 Did you ever take into consideration15 the decrease in rents from Section 8 housing? The16 rents decreased by as much as twenty percent.17 Affordable housing is needed but not on the backs18 and pockets of the small owners that someone - -19 sometime or most of the time don't know who and20 how many people are living in an apartment.21 If we sell to developers that are22 here now, affordable Housing will become extinct.23 The seniors here are the lucky ones. SCRIE pays24 their rent increases.	There will be only one25 million dollar condos2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap3 up, Mr. Korman.4 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	- - one million5 condos, public housing and abandoned housing  left6 in our beautiful city.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Question .9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.10 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	How many11 properties do you own?12 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	Six.13 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And how many14 units in each property?15 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	There are16 varying.	Most of them are 6's an and two are17 thirteen and fourteen.18 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And how long19 have you owned those properties?20 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	From 1984 and21 so on.22 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Twenty23 some-odd years?24 And how many requests a month or so25 you get unsolicited from brokers or developers to10 
2	buy your properties?3 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	Everyday.4 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Everyday.5 And what keeps you from selling those properties?6 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	Well, first of7 all, I'm a senior.	I went into this then sold my8 contracting business to have something easier to9 when I become older so I'd had something to10 rely11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Didn't turn out12 to be easier, did it?13 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	No, it's not14 that.	It's not funny.15 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	That begs the16 next question.17 Your basis on the properties are	a18 bit lower than somebody corning in now to buy19 these properties so you could afford to save a20 little bit more with rent increases and21 collections and such.22 But at what point does it come when23 your insurance premiums get so high or the24 assessments get so high and the fuel gets so high25 that you pick up that phone and decide to call5 
2	for the broker or that developer3	MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	Well, it's 4 getting to that point now especially the building5 - - I have one building on Bushwick Avenue that' s6 a pristine building that was built in roughly7 1900.	So far the last number of years since I've8 had it, I had to put in updates and maintain the 9 structure so it would be sound and safe, about 25 10	30,000.11 Most of these - - most of these12 increases	I had to refinance some of these13 buildings to get the money.	I had two framed14 houses that needed work because I thought that15 they had to be - - they had to bed updated and16 they had to made to withstand, you know, the new17 weather and whatever.18 I had them totally resurfaced on all19 sides.	I had new beams put in.	That cost a lot20 of money.	And all these companies charge you21 what they want.	You're at their mercy when you22 have to get a building permit to do it.23 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Any of those24 costs get passed on to the tenants as an MCI?25 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	No.11 
1	412	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You had a4	question.5	DIRECTOR KAUFMAN:	Thank you for6 coming.7 How does the rent that you collect8 in your apartment, which you said is in9 Bushwick - -10 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	Yes, ma'am.11	DIRECTOR KAUFMAN:	- - compare with12 the rent that you left to collect under rent13 stabilization ?14 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	Most of my15 apartments - as the people move out because of16 the new landlord and the requirements and the age17 of properties - I find that I have to update18 them.	New doors, change windows.	Well, windows19 can change.	Redo the kitchens, redo the20 bathrooms.	And the - - I had legalized rents of21 $1,800, $1,900 and I had most - - I would  say22 except for one apartment, I get preferential23 rents of much, more lower.24 The only one I have is an apartment25 where I had the rent - - I put in so much money12 
1	422 that the rent is over 2,000 where I've got,3 believe it or not, eight or nine people, and I4 don' t even know how many, living there.	And of,5 course, they were paying I think $1,100.	And I6 said if you want to maintain this amount of7 people they tell me	I told them that I had to8 have a little bit more money other than the rent9 stabilized rate.	So she says why, don't ask them10 for more money.	I says, well when you have11 eight people talking showers, the water costs12 more.	The fuel to do it cost more and little bit13 of abuse in the apartment.14 And I really don't - -15 (Audience participation.)16 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	Excuse me, why17 don't you buy them.	I don't get - - and in most18 cases in the one building, the electric is19 updated, the roof is updated, the windows are20 updated.	All my buildings are registered with21 the Police Department and to be safe and secure22 with the FTAP program to the District Attorneys.23 And all this takes money and it just isn't24 anymore left.	And I feel that I'm getting to a25 point where I'm just not happy anymore.
14 32A VOICE:	Then sellit, sell it.3MR. EDWARD KORMAN:Why don't you4buy it.5CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Yes, we have6 another question.7 Mr. Korman, if you're telling us8 that most of these units that you have to give9 preferential rents, why are we the problem?	Why10 is the guideline the problem if you can't get the11 allowable increase?12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	Because14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	Because16 they're not all in that category.	And that if17 some of the apartments that I'm getting less and18 that are not destabilized, which roughly I have19 out of eighty apartments I think I only about ten20 or fifteen.	I'm still under the guise of the21 Rent Stabilization Code and I can use the money.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I understand.23 Thank you. Thank you.24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Adele Bender.
2	Adele Bender;3	Followed by Gale Stein-Weinstein;4 Followed by James Jones;5 Followed by Kristen Morriseau .6 Go ahead .7 MS. ADELE BENDER:	Good morning.8 My name is Adele Bender.	I'm the9 Queens Borough Coordinator of JPAC, Joint Public10 Affairs - - can you hear me okay?11 Joint Public Affairs Committee for12 Older Adults.13 In answer to this contract, the guy14 with a contract doesn' t know what he' s getting15 into, okay.16 The other thing I do want to bring17 up is18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So he' s getting19 into a problem is what you're saying.20 MS. ADELE BENDER:	Yes.21 Anyway, it is becoming increasingly22 difficult to keep up with the rent hikes.23 Citywide, unregulated rents are 70 percent higher24 than regulated rents.	The median regulated rent,25 and I didn' t do this calculation, is $640 while10 
2 the median unregulated rent in comparable3 buildings are four figures that range well over4 the $1,000 a month and up for a studio, one and5 two bedroom apartment.6 The $600 figure to some may not be7 much, but when you don't have the money, it's a8 lot.9 Vacancy decontrol has greatly10 decreased the City' s affordable housing supply.11 112,000 rent regulated units have been lost12 permanently since 1996.	Many people living in13 rent regulated units are people on fixed incomes,14 namely seniors and disabled who do have not the15 means now and will have to move out of their16 communities.	Raising the rents and putting them17 to such a position is breaking up communities.18 It's not going to help this society.	You just19 heard one person that's a professional and he' s20 been caught also having problems.	So you could21 imagine also what other people on fixed incomes22 are having double the problem.23 One of our members, who does live in24 Peter Cooper Village, just signed a new lease for25 over $1,000.	When they moved in it was 500.2 
2 These are seniors that have medical, health3 expenses, family expenses.	I know what they're4 going through.5 One of the tenants that lives in my6 neighborhood just said she's - - she's disabled.7 She's 60 years old.	She doesn't - - she can't8 qualify for SCRIE because I guess she has a9 couple of dollars too much.	She does not know10 what her - - her rent is nearly a thousand11 dollars.	Between her health expenses, her rent12 expenses, she does not know what her fate is as a13 member of the community.	And she's lived here14 for years.	And she is really stretched out.15 You know, we have a mental health16 community - - committee on JPAC and they talk17 about stress and anxiety which is a real thing18 for many seniors because of chemical reasons and19 many other reasons.	But let me tell you if you20 think you're going lose the roof over your head,21 you lose a lot of sleep too and that's not very22 good for your mental health.23 At many of the senior centers they24 have presentations and a lot of people walk up to25 me and they cannot afford to pay the increases in2 
2 their rent.3 I just do like to say one other4 thing.	And many times the factors that I have5 come up with there may be people that state, well6	this is not my problem, but you do have income or78 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap9 up.10 MS. ADELE BENDER:	- - a low11 earning.	But let me tell you something, if this12 kind of mentality was pervasive in our society,13 nobody would ever give to a charity .	Nobody14 would ever do volunteer work.	And if somebody15 fell, nobody would pick them up because it's not16 their problem.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Gale20 Stein-Weinstein.21 MS. GALE STEIN-WEINSTEIN:	My name22 is Gale Stein.	I'm Gale-Stein Weinstein, a23 property owner of three small New York City24 buildings.	My family has owned properties in our25 neighborhood for 60 years and our present10 
2 properties for more than 50 years, more than half3 a century.4 We did not abandon them when the5 City fixed our national disaster of the 70s.	In6 the B O 's our neighborhood was the drug capital of7 this City.	But my family stayed, paid taxes and8 provided services and housing to New York City9 residents.10 In 2002 my yearly oil cost for one11 building of 28 units and two stores was $14,500;12 compare that with the $51,250 cost for my oil for13 the same building in the year 2005.14 My boiler for this building is seven15 years old and fuel-efficient.16 Although these costs have escalated17 350 percent over the course of four winters, a18 tenant who signed a yearly renewal lease during19 this time period had a rent increase of only 14.520 percent.	And if someone signed a two, two year21 renewals, his increase was only 13.5 percent.22 My real estate taxes for the year23 2002 for one building were $43,000, up to $61,00024 last year, an increase of 41 percent.	But25 remember, that tenant only had an increase of2 
 2 14.5 or 13.5 percent. At times I feel like the3 Welfare system.4 The Rent Guidelines system is broken5 and I'm here to offer a couple of suggestions.6 Suggestion one, raise rents so that7 no studio apartment in Manhattan rents for less8 than $600 monthly;9 All one-bedrooms should have a10 minimum base rent of$ 800;11 Two bedrooms, a minimum base rent of12 $1,000 and a three-bedroom, a minimum base rent 13	of $1,200.14 Suggestion two, for rent stabilized15 tenants who have been in their apartments for six16 years there should be an automatic bump up of ten17 percent plus the guidelines' allowance for the18 renewal of that year.19 I have a tenant in place for 2420 years who pays rent of $568 for a three bedroom21 apartment.	He' s - -22 A VOICE:	Open your books.23 MS. GALE STEIN-WEINSTEIN:	He's 4524 years old and he's not going to be moving any25 time soon, would you?	However, his rent was $32314 
2 in '86. Based upon my model, his rent would now3 be $813 and that's not gouging either.4 In 1988 my real estate taxes for5 this building were $11,500.	The tenant' s rent6 was $344 for his three bedroom apartment.	Today7 my real estate taxes for that building are8 $67,000	and his rent is $568.	His rent hasn't9 even doubled in eighteen years.10 If his rent stayed commensurate with11 my tax increase, he would now pay $1937 for a12 five room apartment in Manhattan and that isn't13 gouging either.14 Small property owners are not given15 relief on any level.	I do urge you to be16 equitable and realize that small property owners17 need to make a reasonable profit to keep, and18 more importantly, maintain their buildings.19 Thank you.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 Where' s your building?22 MS. GALE STEIN-WEINSTEIN:	In the23 East Village off of B.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	East Village?25 MS. GALE STEIN-WEINSTEIN:	Yes.2 
2	DIRECTOR LUBELL:	Go ahead,3 question.4 That three bedroom apartment that5 you mentioned, is that building in the East6 Village?7	MS. GALE STEIN-WEINSTEIN:	Yes.8	It's on 4th Street between A and B.9	DIRECTOR LUBELL:	And what was the10	rent again?11	MS. GALE STEIN-WEINSTEIN:	His rent12 now is $568 month for - -13 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	And how many14 units in that building?15 MS. GALE STEIN-WEINSTEIN:	That16 building has 28 units.17 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 James Jones.20 MR.

A little louder,24 please.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You can start24 
2 over.3 MS. KRISTEN MORRISSEAU:	My name4 is Kristen Morrisseau, and I'm an Assistant Vice5 President of Government Affairs of the Real6 Estate Board of New York.7 On behalf of our over 11,000 members8 which include owners, builders, managers and9 brokers of high rise residential property, I urge10 the Rent Guidelines Board to set reasonable11 guidelines that reflect not only this year' s12 increases in operating costs, but uncompensated13 cost increases from the last few years as well.14 We agree that this years15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.17 MS. KRISTEN MORRISSEAU:	We agree18 that this year's PIOC is not a realistic number.19 Led by significant fuel price increases and high20 property taxes, apartment owners' expenses have21 continued to grow while rents rose only modestly.22 The Rent Guidelines Board own Income23 and Expense Study shows that 11.6 percent of24 buildings are in distress with costs in excess of25 gross income. Our members have experienced much2 
2 greater increases.3 A sample of our buildings over the4 past five years indicates on average, an increase5 of 37 percent for operating costs.	Those6 operating costs include a tremendous increase in7 fuel prices.8 Our members tell us that the real9 increase in oil costs is roughly 30 percent and10 natural gas is even higher.	Utility expenses are11 also taking a toll on owners.	Water will jump12 from three to 9.4 percent this year.13 Building employee costs under the14 32BJ contract rose nearly seven percent this year15 as a result of increased benefit costs.	The16 construction boom also put a great deal of17 pressure on sub-contractor and vendor costs.18 It is very apparent that operating19 costs are rising substantially and will continue20 to do so.21 For all of these reasons, we urge22 the Rent Guidelines Board to pass a substantially23 larger rent increases for the coming year than it24 did last year.	At the very least, increases at25 the top of the range under consideration are2 
2	essential to maintain our housing.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4	Any questions?5 (No response.)6 (Applause.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Susi Schropp.8 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	Good morning.9	My name is Susi Schropp and I speak10 to you today as a Board Member of the Cooper11 Square Committee, a local housing organization12 that has fought for affordable housing since 1955 13	- - '59.14 Our catchment area spans from the15 Bowery to the East River and from 14th Street to16 Delancey.17 Every year our organization reports18 on the housing conditions in our area.	With19 great concern we are coming to realize that our20 ownhousing survey findings are being confirmed by21 more official sources regarding the rapid loss of22 affordable housing.23 We particularly refer to the 200524 Census Report and the 2005 State of the City25 Report conducted by the Furman Center and we ask
2 the Board to include these findings when3 considering the increases.4 The message is clear: "In the past5 three years, the combination of falling real6 incomes and rising rents has significantly7 increased the burden of housing cost imposed upon8 the city' s household."9	In contrast, there is no data that10 supports the claims by owners made in these11 testimonies that they are facing severe hardship,12 an increase in abandoned properties or a slowdown13 in sales.14 According to the report,15 foreclosures fell slightly and tax delinquencies16 fell significantly. In other words, property17 owners are doing great.18 The issues of greatest concerns to19 us is the decline of available housing, available20 affordable housing to low and moderate income21 households.	Available units for housing22 households earning just under 60 percent of the23 city' s median income, which is $24,000 a year,24 fell by 91,652 units between 2002 and 2005,25 leaving only 26 percent of the City' s household
2 units affordable to such households .3 Available units for households4 earned almost eighty percent of the median income5 which is $32,000 a year .	And firefighters fall6 into that category, fell almost by 205,000 units,7 leaving only 48 percent of available housing8 stock for units left .9 When these units become vacant, the10 twenty percent vacancy allowance, the long time11 occupancy increase and increases from individual12 apartment improvements make the rents for these13 units unaffordable and remove them from14 regulation .15 While new construction added tens of16 thousands of units to the rental stock, the17 number of rental units in New York City grew by18 only 0.4 percent in the past three years, and19 only a small fraction of that rental housing was20 "affordable" to people earning less than 8021 percent of median income .22 The RGB has played a vital role in23 these devastating numbers through the yearly24 steep increases while income has decreased . How25 much longer is this Board going to demonstrate
 2 such irresponsible behavior, which ultimately3 results in taxpayers' footing the bill for a4 growing problem?5 The system employed by the Board is6 not working and the data confirming this is out.7 We are asking the Board to freeze rents in all8 regulated housing, a zero vacancy allowance and9 no increases for long- time occupancy.10 At Cooper Square we see and monitor 1112 (Audience participation.)13 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	the many14 red flags going up - -15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap16 up, Susi.17 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	We deal with18 tenants of all kinds on a daily basis and would19 be more than happy to share our alarming findings20 with you.21 Thank you for your attention.22 (Audience participation.)2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I have a25 question.24 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.3	Adriene.4 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you for5 your testimony.	Thanks for coming this morning.6 Can you tell me about the findings7 that you all have made and how this is affecting8 you and your neighbors?9 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	Okay.10 Particularly at Cooper Square I mean we have11 increased our catchment area as a result of it12 because we only used to go to First Avenue, but13 we see an over twenty percent growth in intake of14 tenants coming in and requiring our help.15 We see a particular problem with16 elderly people and people of fixed incomes having17 problems paying there rents.	And, in fact, I18 want to point out in today' s New York Times19 there' s an article that talks about the dwindling20 middle class which also confirms what has been21 happening in our community.22 And we've have long a long time to23 monitor that.	As you know, we've been around24 since 1959.25 And, you know, another thing that we4 
2 see, we had a lot of deregulated tenants coming3 in asking for help and they, of course, have no,4 virtually no legal resource.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 (Audience participation.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Andrew Hoffman;8 Followed by Regina Shanley;9 Followed by Arnold Fine;10 Followed by Ann Cunningham.11 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	All right.12 My name' s Andrew Hoffman.	I am the13 Chairman of the Community Housing Improvement14 Program CHIP, a property owner's advocacy group.15 I'm the owner/operator of rental housing New York16 City.17 I thank the Board today for the18 opportunity to come and speak to you.19 And it's interesting, we're sitting20 here listening to the prior testimony, and we all21 agree, at least us on the industry side, agree22 with everything this woman said, but the bottom23 line is it's not our fault. We can't subsidize24 housing.25 Our expenses go up and we need to10 
2 maintain housing and there's got to be another3 way to do this.4 This year our expenses have5 skyrocketed.	The increases this year were much6 more than last year.	Our fuel prices remain7 very, very high.	Real estate taxes are going up.8 Our labor increases went up dramatically last9 year primarily due to the high cost of the health10 insurance for all our employees.	And, of course,11 the lead paint that we all talked about over the12 past couple of months with you guys, is not13 included in the PIOC.14 What makes matters worse for us is15 the constant bombardment in the press concerning16 the high value of real estate and the flipping of17 buildings and how much apartments and building18 are going for.	That has nothing to do with the19 people like me who manage and own real estate and20 don't want to get out of the business.21 It doesn' t matter that coop22 apartments are selling for extraordinary high23 prices, it matters what happens on the day to day24 with my expenses and my income.25 I took a look at the speeches over2 
2 the past fifteen years and I keep talking the3 same thing, you guys have heard it for fifteen4 years now.	The PIOC is high.	Rent increases are5 low. It's not keeping up with our expenses.6 During the past year, in addition to7 the high cost of coop, you've been reading a lot8 about the rental buildings that are being9 converted and the Mitchell- Lama buildings that10 are being converted to coops.11 It's the Board's job to give us fair12 and reasonable increases to keep buildings like13 mine in the rental sector to provide affordable14 housing to Manhattan' s middle class. If you15 continue to pass low increases, the only thing,16 the only option that' s going to be available to17 owners like me is to sell to one of the firms,18 and you guys all know about the Extell, the only19 thing that' s going to happen is the apartments in20 my building are going to be converted to21 cooperative housing.22 Thank you.23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 Question, Mr. Schleider .2 
1	662 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for3 your testimony.4 I'm going to say this again, what5 point does it get to where you're going to sell6 your property to property manipulators who spec7 this who have no intention of remaining in the8 rental system.	It's one thing for people to say9 sell your building, but as you pointed out, once10 you sell it you doubt that it will stay in11 rental.12 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	Yes.	My13 buildings are all in the core of Manhattan, all14 right.	I'm one of those guys I got the core of15 Manhattan.	About twenty percent of my buildings16 are deregulated but the other eighty percent are17 all rent regulated.18 As you guys know, I've got a couple19 of thousand apartments that are rent regulated.20 A perfect building that I have is on 89th and21 5th.	I've talked about this over the years.22My bottomline hasnot movedin five23years.My expenses aregoing uplike thisand my24 income' s going up the exact same way.25 The only reason I still have the24 
2 building is because I'm third generation and I3 want to pass something along to my kids that are4 fourth generation.	You know what, I'm getting to5 the point where I'd rather just pass along cash6 to them, you know, you know what - -7 (Audience participation. )8	MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	- - you know9 what, I'm about to.	And what's going to happen10 is every one of my apartments is going to be a11 coop.	That' s the bottom line.	It's happening12 all over the City.	And I don't want to do that,13 I'd rather pass the building along to my kids14 than the cash.15 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	Mr. Chairman.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, Mr. Lubell.17 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	Mr. Hoffman,18 many of your members are not in core Manhattan;19 is that correct?20 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	Yes.21 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	And many of your22 members are in areas of the City which may not be23 susceptible to being to converted; is that24 correct?25 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	You know what,9 
2 there aren' t many places in New York anymore that3 aren't susceptible to coop.	All over they' re4 being - - they' re cooping in Queens. They' re5 cooping in Brooklyn.	They' re cooping in the6 Bronx .7 Yes, there are some areas that are8 not susceptible and those people are having the9 most difficult time with it.10 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	Well, those are11 generally the lowest income areas; is that12 correct?13 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	That is14 correct.15 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	And what are16 those people, what do those owners do if when17 their expenses exceed their income?18 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	Well, the19 first thing you do is start cutting back the20 services which is a scariest thing because once21 you start cutting back on services you have a22 spiral.	It's a downward spiral where you'll23 never catch up.24 You know what, if you can't pay for25 a plumber to fix - - to replace something, you2 
1	6 9 2 have them fix it, all right .	And he puts a Band3 Aide on it and instead of spending ten hours on4 replacing a section of pipe you put a clamp on it5 and you do a lesser repair .	And then, of course,6 what happened is a year down the road it gets7 worse and worse and worse and you never can catch8 up.	And then what happens is you either have a9 problem or somebody' s going to sell .	And once10 they sell it's going to be worse because you 're11 going to have some guy who has no idea what' s12 going on, buying the building.	They're going to13 step into the owner' s shoe and the building, it's14 going deteriorate worse and worse.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you.16 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN :	Thank you .17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Regina Shanley 1819 (Applause.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	- - followed by21 Arnold Fine;22 Followed by Ann Cunningham .2 3	Go ahead .24 A VOICE:	Can you call out the25 numbers, please .24 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The number for3 tenants is nine.	And the number for owners is4 four but it's all based on what you signed in and5 we alternate so the numbers doesn't necessarily6 prove anything.7 Go ahead.8 MS. REGINA SHANLEY:	Good morning.9	My name is Regina Shanley.	I'm a10 rent stabilized tenant living in the11 Woodside/Sun nsyide part of Queens.12 Once again it's Rent Guidelines13 Board time and once again the media is asking how14 big will rent increases be.	It is assumed there15 will be a rent hike.16 Silly me, I was under the impression17 that the Rent Guidelines Board was supposed to18 impartially consider the issues of rent and19 decide whether an increase or a decrease is20 justified or if rents should be frozen.21 Instead, tenants are forced to fight every year22 to try to keep rent increases reasonable. So far23 the fighting has not been successful.24 The Rent Guidelines Board is a25 political entity.	It shouldn't be, but it is.10 
2 The Mayor appoints all its Members after all.3 The Public Members are meant to be impartial.4 Last year one Public Member actually5 voted with the Tenant Members.	He's no longer6 on the Board.	His vote did not change the7 outcome but he was removed.8 We need to ask then how impartial9	the Public Members are allowed to be.	How10 impartial is the Mayor who appoints them, for11 that matter?12 Think, a Public Member votes13 tenants, an extraordinary event and the Mayor14 replaces him.15 One solution to this lack of16 impartiality would be the passage of Home Rule in17 New York City.	Among other things, this would18 make it possible for members of the Rent19 Guidelines Board to be appointed by or approved20 by the City Council.21 This Board, as it exists today,22 rudely refuses to discuss Home Rule.	I wonder2 3	why.	In the meantime I ask the Public Members24 of this Board not to blindly follow the25 recommendations of its notoriously anti- tenant24 
2 Chairman, but have the courage to truly listen to3 tenant' s testimony.4 We come here because we are being5 financially drained and rent is the most serious6 culprit.	Telling us, as has been said, if you7 can't afford to live here, move, is not an8 answer.	For one thing, the City needs its9 dwindling middle class.10 Having a roof over one's head is a11 necessity, a right, not a privilege.	The cost of12 housing is a moral, as well as social issue.13 So again, I am asking the Public14 Members, particularly the two new members, to not15 just follow by to lead, be brave.	You can help16 tenants who are depending on you.	We are17 fighting for our homes.	Please let us stay in18 them.19 Thank you.20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Arnold fine.	Mr.22 Fine.2 3	MR. ARNOLD FINE:	Yes.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Followed by Ann25 Cunningham;24 
2	Followed by Richard Steiger.3	Mr. Fine.4 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	My name is Arnold5 fine.	I own a building in Brooklyn.	I've owned6 it since 1973.7 After 25 years of finishing paying8 the mortgage and everything, I thought I'd be in9 better shape.	In fact, it turns out I'm getting10 in worse shape year by year.11 From 2001, which is the Trade Center12 incident, the City raised the taxes 18 and a half13 percent plus an additional assessment on the14 building which came out to like 23 and a half15 that year.	So now my taxes from 2001 to 200616 have gone from 3,000 to six thousand a year.17 My heating bills have gone up from18 under $400 two years ago to almost $600 a month19 now.	My electric has gone up.	Everything goes20 up.	Water and sewer has gone up nine and a half21 percent this year.22 There is no end to the increases23 that I am facing.	And my rents go up, but24 they're not covering the increases.	So now every25 year I make less money.4 
2 So when you asked a gentleman before3 when are you going to sell your building, I 'm4 telling you, I'm going to sell it . My kids don't5 want anything to do with it .	They see what goes6 on in the City here .	They want nothing to do7 with it .	They don't want to touch it .8	I am going to put the building up9	for sale next year .	The tenants will have10 (Audience participation .)11 MR. ARNOLD FINE :	a wonderful12 landlord that won 't do anything for them because13 I did all the work in my building.	I ran the14 electric .	I ran all the plumbing from the15 basement all the way through the building .	I16 sheetrocked every wall, every ceiling . Put in17 steel doors.	I did the painting.	Nobody else18 did.	It did it myself .	That's the only way to19 make money on a small, six- family building .20 And I'll tell you right now, anyone21 that wants to do it is welcome to do it, because22 it's no fun.	It's a lot of work and it takes up23 a lot of your time.24 Thank you .25 (Audience participation. )10 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where' s your3 building, Mr. Fine?	Where in Brooklyn?4	MR. ARNOLD FINE:	McDonald Avenue5	and Church.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	McDonald and7 Church.8 Any other questions?9	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Yes.10 So your mortgage is paid off, you're11 free and clear.12 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	I'm free and clear13 now.14 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And you're15 making less money each year.16 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	From 2001 to now17 every year with the increases, the expenses have18 gone up higher than the rents therefore I am19 making less money.20 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And your21 average rents are what right now?22 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	My rents right23 now are approximately $5,100 a month.24	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	That' s for25	all six.
1	762	MR. ARNOLD FINE:	For all six.3	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	All right.4 So it's very affordable for your neighborhood.5 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	Yes.6 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And you're7 feeling, and you can express to this whoever's8 telling you to sell the building, you're feeling9 that once you sell out this building what's going10 to happen to those tenants with that type of rent11 roll?12 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	Once I sell the13 building the tenants are not going to have - -14 first of all, I don' t try to get tenants that are15 going to stay there for a year or two.	Most of16 my tenants are there ten to fifteen, and twenty17 years.18 I do not want a tenant that' s going19 to move in and move out.	I want someone who' s20 stable, who will take care of the property, who21 will benefit by my work and I will benefit by22 them as the tenant.	I don't want a fly-by-night23 tenant.	I screen my tenants very carefully.24 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	So when you25 sell, what' s the next person going to do to these4 
2 tenants?3 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	The next person4 is going to empty that building.	I guarantee it.5 I guarantee it.6 (Audience participatio n.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank8 you, Mr. Fine.9 Ann Cunningham, please.10 (Applause.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Welcome back.12 You're ready?13 MS. ANN CUNNINGHAM:	Ready to14 roll.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let' s go, Ann.16 MS. ANN CUNNINGHAM:	Good morning.17 My name is Ann Cunningham.	I'm a18 housing specialist and tenant advocate for the19 past 29 years.	I am not a stranger to the Rent20 Guidelines Board, as you agree.21 Since 2001 I have been working for22 Councilmember Gale A. Brewer on the storefront23 District Office on the Upper West Side where24 seven days a week constituent tenants come for25 assistance with housing issues.2 
2 A   great majority of the tenants are3 rent regulated senior citizens with complaints of4 landlord and shareholder harassment, building5 violations and fuel pass-along overcharges.6 Furthermore, those who are not7 involved in the SCRIE program face dwindling8 finances when confronted with the prospect of9 even the smallest rent increase.10 In the packet presented you will be11 reading about the proliferation of illegal hotels12 that are going on and corporate housing groups we13 have created throughout the City.14 SRO and Class A residential hotel15 tenants are rapidly disappearing in number.	The16 few that remain in the hotels are victims of17 harassment and unlivable conditions imposed by18 greedy, unscrupulous landlords.19 In Cal Sedesco' s (phonetic) letter20 regarding the Temple Hotel, you will read that21 rent regulated rooms previously rented for 300 to22 400 monthly are now being rented to transients at23 this rate nightly.24 Income and expense in your memos25 were not reported in this category for hotels .
2 Note in the PIOC, page 17, parts and supplies,3 refrigerators and ranges are rarely supplied to4 tenants.	Moreover, tenants are not recipients of5 air conditioners, carpets, dressers, mattresses6 and box springs.7 These articles are given solely to8 tourists students and corporate occupants.9 The time to investigate this10 fraudulent reporting is long past due.	It would11 be seriously inappropriate and unjust to impose a12 rent increase effecting hotel tenants.13 In conclusion, I recommend that a14 rent increase should not be imposed on any15 tenants unless the Rent Guidelines Board receives16 an updated housing and vacancy survey and17 develops a viable plan to investigate data18 submitted by landlords that is valid income19 reporting, along with records of violations and20 considerations made for frequently Major Capital21 Improvement increases.22 Thank you for the pleasure of23 speaking.2 4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25	(Audience participation.)
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Adriene,3 question.4	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you, Ms.5 Cunningham for your testimony this morning.6 Can you explain to me why it is with7 the hotels being in the condition that they are8 in, why people continue to live in SROs or class9 A hotels units.10 MS. ANN CUNNINGHAM:	Okay. What is11 going on is the renovated rooms and the12 electricity that is upgraded is only done in the13 rooms that are rented out for two and three or14 400 a night.	And why the SRO, and I live in a15 hotel myself, I'm living there is because we have16 no other housing.	There's no other housing17 available.	There' s a shortage of affordable18 housing.19 At lot of the SRO tenants that have20 been helping the past 30 years or so down at21 Housing Court, I see some of them today on the22 street, they're homeless.	SRO is the last place23 for housing.	There's no place else to go really.24 We don't have sufficient counseling.	Also for25 the elderly we have seniors coming in everyday
2 that are look for housing to pay sixteen hundred3 and eighty five dollars rent a month.	Their4 spouse has died and they have other5 circumstances.6 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And then when7 you think about the seniors that you see, why8 aren' t they receiving SCRIE from the City?9	MS. ANN CUNNINGHAM:	Some of them10 are just caught in between the cracks and other11 people cannot live in SCRIE because of the DHCR.12 The policy ruling, 92.2, that these buildings13 would get the 421 A class abatements and they can14 no longer	they' re not regulated as regular15 buildings.16 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Richard Steiger.18 (Applause.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	After Mr. Steiger20 Chris Athineos;21 Followed by Carol Sue Muller.22 Mr. Steiger, go ahead.23 MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	Good morning,24 Members .25 New York City is hemorrhaging from
2 reasonably priced apartments according to City3 Controller William C. Thompson, Jr.	He noted4 that at least 59 Mitchell-Lama developments will5 complete their subsidized mortgages between 20056 and 2015, and more than 25,000 units have either7 left or filed to leave the Mitchell-Lama and8 Limited Dividends programs.9 New York City will lose almost10 one- third of the 150,000 units created under11 these programs, Thompson noted.12 In Stuyvesant Town, where I reside,13 3 , 000 rent stabilized apartments are now market14 rate. A one bedroom starts at $2,600 a month. Two15 bedrooms start at $3,500 a month.16 New York University said in a June17 16th report that the number of New York City18 apartments considered affordable to hundreds of19 thousands of moderate-income households plunged20 by seventeen percent between 2002 and 2005. The21 researchers found that the number of apartments22 affordable to households earning about $32,000 a23 year, or eighty percent of the median household24 income in the City, and roughly the starting25 salary of Police Officers and Firefighters, our2 
2 first responders, had dropped by 205, 000 units in3 just three years.4 As we lose affordable apartments by5 the thousands, the Federal Bureau of6 Investigation struggles mightily to recruit and7 retain agents to work in New York City, even8 though the agency offers an attractive salary9 premium to work here.	You have housing stipends10 being offered to teachers to entice them to teach11 in our public schools.	Police officers,12 Firefighters, teachers, EMS workers, nurses, home13 health aides cannot afford to live in New York14 City.	It is a recipe for disaster.15 Indeed, what we have is a tale of16 two cities.	Hunger and homelessness are at17 record levels while real estate profits18 skyrocket.	Things must be going well for19 landlords.	Jack Freund, of the Rent20 Stabilization Association had a big smile on his21 face before the Board' s May 8th preliminary vote.22 Is the RGB concerned about the loss23 of affordable housing?	Marvin Markus said the24 Board' s only responsibility is to vote increases25 on one and two-year leases as if a recommendation2 
2 from the RGB to Mayor Bloomberg to overturn the3 Urstadt Law is beyond its purview.4 With the notable exceptions of5 Adriene Holder and David Pagan, Board Members6 have historically bent over backwards to protect7 landlord interests.8 You are the Rent Guidelines Board,9 not the Rent Giveaway Board.10 I ask for a rent freeze - -11 (Audience participation.)12 MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	this year13 and that you fight for repeal of the Urstadt Law.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	Three year16 leases are done.	Harold Lubell has tried to17 eliminate - -18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 You're done. Thank you.20 MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	Thank you.21 (Audience participation.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Anybody have a23 question?24	DIRECTOR LUBELL:	Where are these25	200 to 300,000 lost apartments going, are they
2 disappearing from the universe of apartments?3 Where are they going?4	MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	According to5 what I've read, they have become market rent6 apartments.7	DIRECTOR LUBELL:	So they're still8 in the inventory.	It means that there are more9 people making more money or being able to rent or10 buy these apartments; is that correct?11 MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	I don't know12 who is making more money.	I can tell you about13 Stuveysant - -14 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	Wait a second,15 they' re not disappearing these apartments, they16 are - -17 MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	They are no18 longer affordable apartments to middle income,19 lower middle income and poor people.2 0	DIRECTOR LUBELL:	No further21 questions.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank23 you.2 4	MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	Thank you.25	(Audience participation.)
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Athineos.3	Mr. Athineos;4 Followed by Carol Sue Muller;5 Followed by Hal Brill.6 MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	My name is7 Christopher Athineos.	I'm a small property owner8 from Brooklyn.	And I am here today to emphasize9 the need for this Board to pass guideline10 increases that are commensurate with the11 increasing costs and expenses.12 This year fuel costs, lead paint13 abatement and repairs on our aging buildings have14 all increased significantly, whereby this Board15 should pass a guideline at least on the higher16 range of the scale proposed.17 This past year we have faced18 skyrocketing fuel costs which affect everything19 from the oil and the gas we use to heat our20 buildings to the costs of plastics for the21 garbage bags.22 Contractors and repairmen charge23 fuel surcharges on their bills.	The cost of24 steel, brass and copper also have risen25 significantly.	Just last week the plumber4 
2 charged me $430.79 just to change a flushometer3 in an apartment.	That same week it was $727.204 to change a leaking lead bend on the toilet bowl5 which leaked to the apartment below.6 These costs are real and they have7 not been reflected in past years' guideline8 increases the Board has passed.9 The greatest injustice in this10 complex housing market are the long term tenants11 who have rents drastically lower than recent or12 new occupants.	We are talking rents of 600 and13 $700.	These rents do not even cover one plumbers14 bill.	How can we keep up with these costs if15 rents are at such low levels?16 This Board is more relevant than17 ever.	Some owners, especially in the outer18 boroughs, have legal rents that are beyond what19 the market will bear.	This is usually because of20 vacancies where the statutory vacancy increase21 exceeds what the market will bear.22 I know there are some who say, well23 you can discontinue the preferential rents or if24 you have deregulated rents, you can increase them25 to whatever you want.	Theoretically, that is2 
2 true, but you cannot charge more than the market3 will bear.	Therefore, it is those long- term,4 low-rent tenants that are getting a break.5 I urge you to consider a longevity6 increase to bring some balance and equity to7 owners and tenants.	It's unfair to give those8 low- rent, long term tenants a break on the backs9 of new renters or deregulated tenants.10 In the broader picture of housing11 policy in this City, I believe we have arrived at12 the point whereby owners cannot keep pace with13 expenses .14 Local Law 1 is a perfect example.15 This law has costs me tens of thousands of16 dollars in testing apartments, abatement, and17 vacancies, and this money is never recouped.18 Nevertheless, we have to comply with the law.19 If legislative bodies pass laws just20 for the sake of passing laws, but cannot figure21 out a way to pay for them, that leaves us all in22 dire straights.23 Imagine if the Federal Government24 forced everyone to drive a Volvo or a BMW just25 because they are the safest. That would be great,2 
2 but who would pay for it?	This is exactly what3 the City Council did with Local Law 1.4 Perhaps we should demolish all of5 the older housing stock and build new, green,6 safe, and eco-friendly buildings. Sounds great,7 right?	That' s the direction the legislative8 bodies are headed, but I ask who will pay for it.9 This Board has the obligation to10 pass a guideline that keeps pace with the rising11 costs .	Whether or not an owner can pass on these12 guideline increases on now, or in the future is13 not the Board' s decision. Whether tenants can pay14 the increase is not the Board's problem.	The15 City should then step in with a SCRIE-based16 program to pick up the slack.17 Keeping such low rents at levels an18 owner cannot maintain a building19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Athineos, you20 need to wrap up.21 MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	is just bad22 housing policy.	It will force owners to either23 abandon their buildings or co-op or condos24 leaving the City with even less rental housing.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .2 
2	Questions, Mr. Schleider3 (Applause.)4 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you, 5 Chris .6 How would you expand or how would7 you see the SCRIE program being expanded to8 help - -9 MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	Well, I mean10 I have to admit, usually the City never takes a11 step in the right direction.	But this past year 1213 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Granted, but14 your take on it.15 MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	They took a16 step to expand the SCRIE program to the disabled17 so I think they - - you know, it shouldn't be - -18 this is like a major societal problem, not - - it19 shouldn't be born on the owner' s back.	So they20 should expand it and put income levels.	You21 shouldn't have to be a senior citizen.	You22 shouldn' t have to be disabled.	If people are at23 low incomes and they can't afford the rent, let24 the City step in.25 Or you don't even need that type of13 
2 program.	Lower the real estate taxes .	If they3 lowered our real estate taxes then, you know,4 that would be a significant break for owners and5 we could put that money towards repairing the6 buildings.	I mean you can structure it however7 you want, but the fact is our real estate taxes8 are sky high and the fuel costs, plumbing costs,9 lead paint abatements, these are all real costs10 so something has to give.11 And like I said, we're the last12 frontier of those low rent, long term tenants13 because you can have a studio that' s rent14 stabilized in Brooklyn for $825. You can have a15 legal rent that' s $1500 but a preferential rent16 where the tenant's paying 825.	Or you can have a17 deregulated apartment that is 825. But the fact18 is the market will only - - there's a limit to19 what people are going to pay.	It's the market.20 So if we can't do it with that - - those rents we21 can't afford to maintain our buildings, where22 else do we go?2 3	A VOICE:	Have you opened your24 books?25 MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	We do open our24 
2	books.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question. Go4 ahead, Mr. Lubell.5 Adele, you spoke twice and you're6 done speaking.7 Let's go, Mr. Lubell.8 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	Mr. Athineos,9 your buildings are in Brooklyn; is that correct?10 MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	Yes.11 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	And can you tell12 us how old your buildings are.13 MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	I have some14 buildings that are over 150 years old,15 brownstones.	And the youngest building is like16 75 years old.17 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	And does the age18 of these building require any additional costs?19 MR. CHRIS ANTHINEOS:	Absolutely.20 I mean in the buildings that are - - the youngest21 buildings, the ones that are 75 years old I mean22 the plumbing is beyond repair.	It's like Andrew23 said, we're just putting Band Aids on it because24 we can't afford to go and change all the risers.25 And, you know, to change a riser, it's not even4 
2 the plumbing cost, you have to break the walls3 and now the plumbers says oh, wait a second, now4 Local Law 1 is triggered, tenant notification,5 tenant relocation.	Sealing off rooms in - - with6 plaster any time you have to break a wall and7 disturb paint in a prewar building.8 So these are costs this these laws9 that they passed sound great but who' s going to10 pay for them.	So we put band aides on all the11 plumbing.	On brownstones, you have facades that12 are crumbling and these things are things that13 cannot wait, you can't postpone sometime in, you14 know, landmarks laws get triggered.	It's just - -15 it doesn' t end, it doesn' t end.16 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	Thank you.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, Mr.18 Athineos.19 (Applause.)2 0	MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	Thank you.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Carol Sue22 Muller, is that you?2 3	MS. CAROL SUE MULLER:	Yes.2 4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on one25	second.
2Hall Brill;3Followed by Paul Podhaizer;4Followed by Dave Whitmore .5Go ahead.6MS. CAROL SUE MULLER:	My name is7Sue Muller.And I work as a social worker in8Manhattan.9	And I will live in a rent stabilized10 apartment in the Bronx .	And I wanted to speak to11 you today because I was shocked at the amount of12 your proposed rent increases, particularly at13 five to eight and a half percent.14 My question is if a decision was15 based on fuel costs and other costs and how they16 effect landlords, why didn't you consider the17 rising costs that effect tenants?18 I would like to know why when19 landlords get more money, their services don't20 have to improve .	I know in my building I still21 won't be able to have packages delivered.	The22 stairs and lobby still won't be cleaned.	There23 still won't be security.24 My apartment was burglarized and I25 learned from the detective that the locks on my10 
2 doors were pickable which I had not been told3 when I moved in.4 And the Rent Guidelines Board told5 me that landlords only have to provide pickable6 locks so I had to pay $200 for better locks.7 I would also like to know why when8 landlords get approved for major capital9 improvements the rent stays at the high amount10 even after the equipment gets paid for.11 (Audience participation.)12 MS. CAROL SUE MULLER:	This policy13 creates a disincentive for landlords to properly14 maintain their equipment.	They know that if they15 get approved for an MCI, that the rent will go up16 and stay up even after the equipment is paid for.17 So they get more money just for needing something18 new.	And this policy makes no sense to me.19 I think that there's a tendency to20 look down on people who didn't buy property in21 New York years ago.	And you know, they should22 have brought row houses in Red Hook ten years ago23 and now we would all be millionaires, but, you24 know, we all - - we all couldn't do that.	And now25 we' re renting and I don't think we should be2 
2 punished because we can't afford studios in3 Manhattan for $500,000.4 And, you know, moving to the Poconos5 and commuting four hours a day is not an option6 for everyone.	And moving out of the City is not7 an option if you can't afford the car and gas and8 parking to get back into the City or the commuter9 cost.10 And I'm lucky.	I not on a fixed11 income.	I am getting a raise this a year of12 three percent.	If my rent goes up five to eight13 percent I'm going to be fighting an uphill battle14 to try and save everyday to buy.	And if I can't15 afford to rent or to buy I'm going to leave the16 City and work somewhere else but I know New York17 needs social workers because I am extremely busy18 every day.19 And, you know, you can't create a20 city just for the upper class and the tourists.21 And I wish more tenants were22 speaking at these hearings.	I understand why23 they would already feel defeated as soon as they24 heard your increases.	And the increases have me25 confused frankly about the nature of your Board2 
2 and who you represent and work for.3 I attended the MTA hearings last4 year.	And I've heard many, many speak to them,5 including some public official asking them not to6 raise fares.	And they did it anyway despite7 their huge surplus because they weren' t8 accountable to anyone.9 I desperately hope that these public10 hearing for your Board are different and that you11 are holding them because you are willing to12 consider other options before you make a final13 decision.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hal Brill. Mr.17 Bill.18 Mr. Brill will be followed by Paul19 Podhaizer;20 Followed by Dave Whitmore;21 Followed by Faith Steinberg.22 Mr. Brill.23 MR. HAL BRILL:	Hi. My name is Hal24 Brill.	I'm a small property owner from25 Manhattan.2 
2 I feel this year it is particularly3 important that the rent guidelines increase to at4 least 6 and 8.5 percent, with a $25 increase for5 rents under $600.6 Small landlords have had the burden7 of supporting the huge increases in their8 expenses, fuel, insurance, real estate taxes,9 water and sewer bills.	The guideline increases10 that have been granted by the Rent Guidelines11 Board have been historically well below these12 levels.13 These low increases are making it14 impossible to maintain services of our buildings15 under rent stabilization.	This situation cannot16 be allowed to continue.	This unfair regulatory17 environment has created this huge disparity18 between current market subsistence levels for our19 maintain housing and the income received.20 The operating costs in old tenement21 buildings are more than the rents for rent22 stabilized apartments.	The paperwork, the court23 cases that are a part of our life, the lead24 compliance laws, water and sewer bills, real25 estate taxes and the increases make it impossible2 
2 to continue to maintain residential real estate3 in New York City.4 Long-term rent stabilized apartments5 have the best deal in town, the have the lowest6 rents because the Rent Guidelines Board has not7 kept up with costs and it's reflected in the8 increases ..9 A system has been created where10 longevity gets rewarded, not merit, not need. So11 today a little step can be taken: Raise the12 guideline increase to 6 and 8.5 percent with a13 supplemental $25 increase for rents under 600.14 We need a vacancy allowance that15 allows apartment rents to rise to subsistence16 levels.	The setting of a minimum rent upon17 vacancy, for long time rent stabilized apartments18 of at least a $1,000 a month can be a start in19 the right direction.20 Thank you very much.21 (Audience participation .)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 Mr. Podhaizer. Mr. Podhaizer, go24 ahead.	You're cutting in to his time. Go ahead.25 MR. PAUL PODHAIZER:	My name is Paul2 
2 Podhaizer. I'm Chairman of Brightwater Towers3 Tenants Council located in Coney Island. I also4 represent 2940 and 3000 Ocean Parkway, two5 buildings of 1,000 families sold by Trump for a6 multimillion dollar profit.7 For over twenty years I have8 testified before this body and submitted yearly9 statistical proof that the high yearly rent10 increases were unwarranted and unfair to the11 tenants.12 The Board's continuous overstated13 decisions however, do not reflect consideration14 or attention to tenants' testimony.15 It is very frustrating to the16 millions of tenants to have the Mayor's appointed17 Public Members, who should be objective, make18 decisions that are overwhelmingly one- sided in19 favor of landlords.20 There' s a question I always have to21 ask, are these your decisions, or really is the22 Mayor giving the orders to give these decisions.23 Very important to us.24 I appreciate, Mr. Markus, that your25 decisions can only be based on statistics2 
2 provided to your Board, and that you are not3 privy to landlord' s books.	Perhaps my4 information for disagreeing with your overstated5 high one and two year proposals is incorrect.6 Mr. Markus, as this is a Public7 Hearing, will you be good enough to critique my8 information now so that I can better understand9 the Board' s decision?10 I state that landlord' s incomes have11 increased because of:	Liberal vacancy rent12 increases; overstated Rent Guideline Board rent13 increases.	Both have resulted in apartments lost14 to Rent Stabilization15 VOICES:	Louder.16 MR. PAUL PODHAIZER:	lost to17 rent stabilization because of reaching maximum18 allowable rent.19 Landlords expenses have decreased.20 The May 11th report of rental21 vacancies showed that they have decreased to 0.4322 percent, less than one percent vacancies. The23 authority for them is Ms. Phyllis Furman from the24 Daily News.25 The rate shows the landlords have no2 
2 loss of rental income,	no advertising expenses,3 no brokerage fees.4 Proof Of landlord profit is that5 there are no hardship applications being filed.6 The equity value has multiplied more7 than 20 times the original investment.	Can you8 dispute my statement?9 In light of these facts: Be fair to10 the renters.	This is your golden opportunity to11 correct the grave wrong of the many years you12 voted for overstated rent increases.13 Let me ask you a question, in light14 of the fact you're are here today, I do raise a15 question I want to give you the testimony, are my16 statistics fair, very accurate, 90 percent17 accurate?	Do the figures that I get any18 different than the ones that you have to propose19 that you go over for the last few months before20 you determine what kind of rent increase you're21 going to vote on?22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Thank you.23MR. HAL BRILL:Can you answer that24for me?25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Mr. Lubell.
2 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	Hey, listen, we go3 back a long time.4 Which ten percent of the information5 of the information that you get is incorrect?6 MR. HAL BRILL:	I'd like to know7 from if the ten percent - -8 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	Are you - -9	MR. HAL BRILL:	I'm asking if the10 information I have on the vacancies on the - -11 what the increases that have been given, the12 percentage that you're going on, that's what I'm13 asking.	Are my statistics correct?	In all the14 years I've submitted statistics from the same15 papers that you received and yet the increases16 have been higher than what the Labor Board and17 everybody else shows.18 Thank you for your time.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Dave Whitmore and22 then Faith Steinberg.2 3	MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	Good morning.24 I speak to you today - -25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Raise the mike.24 
2 MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	Can you hear me3 now?4	Good morning.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Tenants are6 small. Landlords are big.7 (Audience participation.)8 MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	I speak today9 as - -10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. It's11 all right. I couldn' t resist.12 Go ahead, Mr. Whitmore.13 MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	I speak to you14 today as a current small property owner and as a15 managing agent for other small property owners16 whose buildings I manage in Brooklyn.17 It is my understanding that each18 current RGB member is well educated, capable of19 reading and understanding statistics compiled20 from an impartial source and is very21 knowledgeable about the importance of a balanced22 budget.23 Putting aside for a moment your24 position on this Board, each and every current25 RGB Member I believe engages most of their
2 remaining professional time in another field of3 endeavor .4 In that other professional field I5 ask you, how many years do you expect to perform6 your job proficiently when asked by your7 superiors to increase output by a double digit8 percentage amount when you are only given a small9 single digit increase in manpower to do it?10 You can probably do it one year and11 maybe two. But after that your personnel will12 either quit or hang on for as long as they can13 before they burn out.14 The RGB' S expense data collected15 year after year in recent years clearly shows16 that property owners expenses are far exceeding17 their ability to recapture them with rent18 increases to match. Surely it should be easily19 concluded that their buildings will suffer20 because they cannot be properly maintained with21 increases that do not even come close to the22 expenses being incurred year after year.23 Another point, it appears to be24 overlooked or forgotten that the increases25 approved in any year only pertains to
2 approximately 50 percent of the tenants, because3 of the option to obtain a lease renewal of one or4 two years.	So inasmuch as the expenses cited are5 for the whole building for the whole year, the6 increases we receive affect considerably less7 than the expenses incurred for any given year.8 Therefore, if we were to receive an increase9 equal to the expenses incurred for any given10 year, we would in actuality be obtaining a11 percentage amount less than that because not12 every tenant is affected by it every year.13 What, in affect, has been happening14 here is the older, smaller properties are finding15 it more and more difficult to maintain their16 properties, let alone improve upon them.17 The smaller properties by and large18 tend to keep their tenants longer because19 everyone, including the small property owner many20 of whom live in their building, has a neighborly21 relationship, hence a feeling of warmth and22 contentment, which is good. But the negative23 impact however OF that nice, neighborly24 environment amongst the small owner and the25 residents is income that cannot be achieved nor2 
2 sustained by this crazy quilt income/expense3 logic imposed upon them.4 There are plenty of government aid5 programs here in new York City that will assist6 poor and destitute people who are truly in need7 of assistance - SCRIE, you have DREI, Section 8,8 Welfare, etc. Etc. But what has apparently become9 commonplace and accepted is for local government10 to expect the property owner to absorb expenses11 that should be proportionally shared by all.12 We have to begin to stop this13 practice14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 Where' s your building?
161718192021 Bensonhurst.
MR. DAVE WHITMORE:		Brooklyn. CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where?MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	Brooklyn.CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Brooklyn where? MR. DAVE WHITMORE:		Bay Ridge,
22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank you.2 3	Any questions.24 Go ahead.25 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	How many units do24 
2	you own?3	MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	It's not that I4 own.	I manage 15 buildings.	I own a two- family5 - - a three-unit, two-family store.6 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	You - - I'm sorry.7 MR. DAVID WHITMORE:	I manage8 fifteen buildings for other owners.9 I own a two- family building with a10 store.11 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Is it rent12 regulated?13 MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	Mine is not,14 no.	It was. It was rent controlled.	She had15 moved out.	It's no longer.	But the units that I16 manage are rent regulated.17 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	How many?18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How many units19 do you manage approximately?20 MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	About 400.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead, Mr.22 Schleider.2 3	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And the24 average rent in those apartments?25 MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	Well, it varies24 
1	1092 from location to location.	I have a small as3 eight rooms with $205 rent.	I have as high as4 2100 for five units.5	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And these are6 all rent stabilized?7 MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	Well, the 21008 is not.	It's deregulated so I have some9 deregulated units.	Not many, maybe five percent10 of the units are deregulated.11 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	So about 300,12 high 300s are rent regulated, 375, 380?13 MR. DAVID WHITMORE:	Almost all of14 them, yeah about 95 percent are rent regulated.15 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And say the16 average rent for those apartments would then be17 about what?18 MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	They really19 vary.	You're talking studios, one bedrooms, two20 bedrooms, it depends on - -21 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	600, 700?22 MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	I'd say23 anywhere from 600 to about 850 is a fair number.24 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And the areas25 that you said, Bay Ridge - -6 
1	1102 MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	Bay Ridge and3 Bensonhurst.4	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And those are5	fairly - -6	MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	Those are7	working class areas.8	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Working class9	areas.10 So that the rent levels that you11 have in those buildings are extremely affordable12 for that population.13 MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	Oh, yes,14 absolutely.15 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Any16 preferential rents in those buildings?17 MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	One or two,18 very few in those buildings.19 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And how much20 pressure - - excuse me, do you get solicitations21 to sell those buildings or broker those22 buildings?2 3	MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	All the time24 whether it's a good year or a bad year there's25 always someone looking to buy.24 
1	1112 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Any idea what3 would happen to those buildings if you sold those4 buildings?5	MR . DAVE WHITMORE:	I'm sorry.6	Repeat that.7	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Any idea what8 would happen to those buildings, to the tenants9 in those buildings if those buildings were to be10 sold?11	MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	Well, they'd12 be able to stay.	They're rent regulated.	You13 can't do anything with them.14 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Any pressure15 to increase rents?16 MR. DAVE WHITMORE:	Not above the17 legal amount.	You can't do it, it's illegal.18 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER: Thank you19CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank20you.21Faith Steinberg;22Followed by Richard Barr;23Followed by Andy Humm.2 4MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	Good morning.25Judging by the increases you have
2 recommended, it is apparent that the tenants have3 not gotten through to you.	I am addressing the4 majority of the Board throughout, not all.5 I was trying to decide what I could6 say that was different this year, not that I7 think it will help, but I'll try anyway.8 I have opted to use other people's9 words, words that I've heard on radio and TV that10 I thought were appropriate so here goes.11 One of Roosevelt' s Four Freedoms is12 Freedom from Want, Freedom. Our World War II13 solider fought and died for it.14 The late John Kenneth Galbraith on15 the real estate situation and the ridiculous cost16 of housing that only millionaires can afford17 while people are homeless said, "It's immoral. "18 And when I see the banners around the City that19 New York City is the real estate capital of the20 world, I want to grit my teeth but I really want21 to puke.22 We used to bring about - - we used to23 brag about being the cultural capital of the24 world.25 A few other phrases that sum it up2 
2 are, "Major collapse of conscience" and3 "Profiteering from suffering. "4 Also something I heard Al Gore say5 when he was being interviewed on the Charlie Rose6 show about global warming and the disasters we7 created. He said something to the effect that the8 powers that be are closing their minds to the9 warnings because they have personal interests at10 stake.11 To me the injustices perpetrated by12 the majority of this Board, that is the eroding13 of our rent regulations and the continual and14 unwarranted raising of rents, are complicit in15 creating a housing crisis and a disaster waiting16 to happen.	You are inflicting hardships on the17 people who are least able to afford it and worse,18 increasing homelessness.19 I predict history will not speak20 kindly of this Board.	By the way, have you ever21 contemplated being homeless?22 Also, I remember something about23 landlords getting tax deductions for the expenses24 they have incurred, just like any business, which25 is fair.	But they were not allowed to raise2 
2 rents in addition, No taking tax deductions and3 raising rents.	Whatever happened to that law4 already mentioned?5 I urge the Board to dig deep into6 their consciences and do the right thing - have7 compassion for those who are struggling and8 suffering, and I don't mean the whining9 landlords.10 We should also include middle- income11 people who are having to divest their life's12 earnings to gratify greedy landlords.	Think13 about it clearly and honestly.14 Oh, maybe you're against Home Rule15 because it may deprive you of the power you can16 exert in your present positions.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Barr.20 MR. RICHARD BARR:	Good morning.21 My name is Richard Barr and I'm a22 tenant in Manhattan.23 And what I'm about to say I've said24 here before and I also this year said it at the25 DHCR hearing on rent control increases because I2 
2 think the issue is pretty much the same.3 I think there is a need and in this4 current age of sophisticated information5 technology, certainly the ability to create6 something other than a one-size-fits- all approach7 to these rent increases.	Because a landlord who8 owns eight units in a poor, working class9 neighborhood and is struggling to even turn a10 profit, and those seem to be the only landlords11 who ever testify here, has one kind of impact12 from an increase in their expenses of five13 percent for this or eight percent for this or ten14 percent that.15 But somebody who owns a thousand or16 more units, many of them in neighborhoods that17 are more upwardly mobile in which market rents18 are high, and those kind of landlords never seem19 to testify here, have a different kind of impact20 because let's say - - let's take one of the21 buildings for example that maybe had 60 units and22 they've managed to bring six of them out from23 under rent regulations and go to market rent.	So24 that's a percent for the units in that building.25 Where if the market rent will sustain it, they're2 
2 getting a hundred percent more than they used to3 or two or three or maybe even more 400 percent4 more than the regulated rent.5 Is the impact of an eight percent6 increase in one of their costs the same for7 somebody who has a building that' s bringing in8 those kind of profits as it is for the guy with9 the eight units?	I don't think so and I don't10 think their increases should be calculated the11 same way.	You've got to take these things into12 account and it can be done.13 And instead of where somebody' s14 making huge profits in a portion of their15 building, why take the eight percent increase in16 cost out on an elderly or poor, long time17 regulated tenant who' s living there already18 paying perhaps forty percent of their income for19 their rent, even regulated rent.20 You really got to look at - - and I21 can't believe that it's not possible22 differentiating between profitable and23 unprofitable buildings when you calculate rent24 increase in light of the landlord expenses.25 Thank you.2

I'm Andy Humm9 from the London Terrace Tenants Association where10 I'm the Vice President .11 And I, you know, have some prepared12 remarks but, you know a, lot of it has been said13 and I don't want to repeat it.14 First of all, you heard from Andrew15 Hoffman, who is my landlord.	And he didn' t tell16 you that he' s charging $3,675 for one bedroom17 apartments now.	I mean, you know, so he is - -18 he has plenty of market rate.	And if he' s not19 making - I mean you didn' t even ask him, are you20 turning a profit, Mr. Hoffman, how are you doing,21 you know that kind of stuff to figure these kinds22 of - -23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. ANDY HUMM:	I don' t know what25 - - I don't want what to say .	You know, I served6 
2 on one of these public boards.	I was a Human3 Rights Commissioner in the City of New York.	I4 don't know what to say that would turn you around5 on this, would make you think a little6 differently about this.7 I'm not sure what would do.	But I8 sort of looked at the folks in this room and I'm9 going to ask you to really when you hear from10 them, just spend some time with them and sit with11 them.	Really	do any of you really think that12 the majority of the people in this room are going13 to be able to afford, in any way, shape or form,14 eight and a half percent increases on their rent.15 I mean be real.16 (Audience participation.)17 MR. ANDY HUMM:	I mean so when you18 are in your deliberations, when you're in your19 deliberations, in your heart of hearts, I want20 you to think about the real people that you're21 effecting, what you're going to be doing to the22 city.	I mean it has been said, but, you know,23 I'm trying to appeal to your self- interest, Mr.24 McLaughlin, Ms. Kaufman, Ms. Wright, Mr. Lubell,25 I'm sorry, Mr. Schleider, Mr. Markus, Mr. Kimmel,2 
2 Ms. Adams, Mr Pagan, Ms. Holder, to your real3 self-interest that you have to live here, that4 you rely on nurses to heal you, firefighters to5 save you, police.	You have rely on all these6 things.	You need these things.7 Think about yourself if nobody else8 if can't, you know, really identify with the9 folks who are here.	Think about yourselves and10 what it's going to take to keep this together.11 It is preposterous in this City that12 we have the Mayor calling press conferences to13 say we need more affordable housing and I'm going14 to build more affordable housing.	Build more15 affordable housing when we have a housing stock16 that could be kept affordable if only, if only we17 keep it for us.18 (Audience participation.)19 MR. ANDY HUMM:	You're not20 machines, I mean I know a lot of you think we21 have to go with some kind of formula, this, this22 and that.	You have power.23 I sat on one of these commissions.2 4	When you have a vote, you have power.	And you25	have the power to keep housing affordable in this
2 city .	And I beg you, I beg you to do it by, you3 know, after all the increases that we have4	suffered over the last ten years, you know, under5 these Republican administrations, to roll some of6 them back.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 (Audience participation.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Trina Semorile.10 MS. TRINA SEMORILE :	Can you hear11 me?12 As I am testifying earlier in the13 day than usual, I wish to remind this Board of14 their obligation to actually investigate the15 claims being made by landlords when they claim16 insufficient "profit" and/or actual "loss" to17 legitimize lack of repair and maintenance of18 buildings.19 At a minimum this requires asking20 anyone making this claim whether they have21 applied for a hardship increase and have opened22 their account books for review.	If so, what was23 the determination; if not, why not.	Instead,24 year after year, these claims are taken at face25 value without comment or query .10 
2 Please see that this does not recur3 today or in the future.	I ask that either Mr.4 Markus or the tenant representative make these5 inquiry each time such a claim is made, today and6 in every future hearing.7 I fully expect landlords to claim8 increased costs due to fuel costs, which, of9 course, has already happened this morning.	This10 also requires inquiry and evaluation.11 Although heat is required in New12 York from October 1 though May 31, landlords, as13 many will here testify, ignore this obligation,14 ensuring that fuel costs remain either steady or15 lower.16 In my building the heat was turned17 on October 20th and turned off mid-March.18 Further, there is no action by landlords to19 properly control costs through maintenance and20 adjustment, leaving tenants either freezing or,21 if the boiler is going full blast, to open the22 windows if the apartments overheat.23 Landlords have a duty in this area,24 also, to properly maintain buildings, not simply25 count on this Board to pass along all costs to2 
2 tenants .	Landlords have a duty to shoulder the3 cost of maintenance, not simply pass on these4 costs, and taxes, to tenants, while they reap5 windfall profits:6 Improper evictions;7 Poor maintenance;8 Rabid pursuit of loopholes however9 improper;10 Illegal conversions of stabilized11 housing into commercial spaces;12 And false claims to destabilize13 aided by " self-reporting" , a classic case of the14 wolf in charge of the hen house;15 Tourist spaces and harassment of16 tenants is at a record high;17 Denial of disability accommodations18 along with the poor maintenance and denial of19 services and an ongoing legal assault on their20 duty to abate lead and asbestos-laced buildings,21 for the safety of both tenants and workers .22 In my case, as I regularly testify23 at these hearings, my landlords, Yetta and24 Benjamin Rosen of Nesor Associates and their25 general manager, Gerard Rathmann, continue to2 
2 ignore requests for proper maintenance.	The3 super is illegally living in Brooklyn, as he has4 done for many years, with work "outsourced" to5 someone illegally living in a basement storeroom.6 Illegal work done without proper7 permits and regular abuse and harassment of8 tenants is ongoing.9 I would like to formally announce10 that, after eight years, disability accommodation11 was finally done in my apartment, but required12 filing a complaint in State Supreme Court which13 was argued pro se because I could not afford an14 attorney which resolution was negotiated with the15 judge.	Even there, the landlord's attorney16 continued to slander me as a "defense" of their17 illegal actions.18 In addition to the wear and tear, it19 cost several hundred dollars, creating undue20 hardship.21 The recommended increases are not22 only unreasonable but also add undue hardship for23 the disabled.	Small "cost of living increases"24 are mostly eaten up by the increased deductions25 for Medicare leaving "cash out of pocket" month2 
2 of $2 to $5 for the disabled, which hardly3 sufficient to cover rent increases.	And medicine4	costs have gone up due to that disgraceful5	giveaway - -6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap7	up.8	MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	I just want to9	say one more thing.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.	Go ahead.11 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	While the12 disabled have finally been included in a rent13 increase exemption program, we are now third14 class citizens without parity with SCRIE.	SCRIE15 recipients may have incomes of up to $25,212, but16 cripples are limited to $17,580, despite the17 reality that the disabled routinely have less18 income than the elderly retired.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 (Audience participation.)21 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	Do you22 actually read this testimony when you read them23 when it's unfinished?24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It comes in the25 transcript, yes.10 
2MS. TRINA SEMORILE:Thank you.3And do you read it?Does the Board4read the commentary so that those5CHAIRMAN MARKUS:The Board6 reviews the transcript. I don't know if everybody7 reads it from the Board or not, every word for8 word, but the Board reviews the transcript.9	MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	Thank you.10 Please read it word-for-word.11 (Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jerome13 Greenfield, lease.	Jerome Greenfield;14 Followed by Carol Bloome;15 Followed by Herbert Rock .16 Mr. Greenfield.17 Good to see you again.18 MR. JEROME GREENFIELD:	Yes.19 My name is Jerome Greenfield.	I'm20 an original tenant in Brightwater Towers.	I21 moved in 1966.	It was a Mitchell-Lama.	We were22 paying $150 a month rent.	Since that time the23 building was converted to a rent stabilized24 apartment.25 If you have - - over the years10 
2 because you people are not dong - - you have not3 done your job and continuing not to do your job4 properly, our rents have gone up 500 percent.5 Based on your proposal that you mentioned at the6 last hearing, our rent will go up from 150 to7 $750 a month in - -8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	In 40 years. You9 moved in in '60?10 MR. JEROME GREENFIELD:	It will be11	40 years, yes.	It's still 500 percent.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I understand.13 MR. JEROME GREENFIELD:	Divide14 that out, it's still a large amount.15 Now you people are supposed to16 represent the tenants also and not just supposed17 to represent the landlords.	It's not - - this is18 a rent stabilized Board19 (Audience participation.)20 MR. JEROME GREENFIELD:	not a21 rent increase board.	The word stabilization22 means to hold steady, not to continuously2 3	increase.	You must look around for other24 sources of income.	You should not put everything25 on the back of the tenants.	And you can tell24 
2 Mayor Bloomberg you five who are appointed by the3 Mayor, that the City of New York still has enough4 tenants to vote him out of office if he doesn' t5 do his job.6 (Audience participation.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Carol Bloome,8 please.9 Go ahead.10 MS. CAROL BLOOME:	I'm a tenant.11 I've been in the City Office since 1966 and in12 the same rent stabilized apartment for the last13 29 years.14 I've been an activist in my building15 and I've been an advocate for tenant movement16 till I was sick.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to speak18 into the mike.19 MS. CAROL BLOOME:	Okay.	So here' s20 my statement.21 The lie of corporate created oil22 shortages to price down to the American people is23 being used to perpetrate yet another cruel hoax24 on the renters of New York City.25 An examination of large, underline2 
2 large, landlord 's rate of profit would reveal no3 necessity for a whopping 8.5 percent rent4	increase for a two year lease.	This would be5 laughable were it not for the suffering that this6 would inflict on the vast majority of renters, by7 so dire a miscarriage of justice in public policy8 against the working majority in favor of the rich9 minority.10 Yet another myopic decision would11 follow in a long line of visionless and morally12 bankrupt decisions taking place within the format13 of a democratic forum without the reality of14 democratic equity and due process.15 The quaint medieval notions of16 Thomas Aquinos " fair pricing" the right to17 Livelihood, must be revised and given relevant18 elaboration.	For example, enumeration of the19 social cost of homelessness both for individuals20 and for the body politic and make a part of the21 debate exact analogous to Environmental Impact22 Statements on such significant public policy23 issues as the awarding of rent increases, that is24 the transferring of profits from tenants to25 landlords .5 
2 Ownership of land and real property3 not, is not an absolute, divine right or it4	should not be.	The economic exigencies of5 interest rate increases may - - here be a6 necessary consideration, but these types of7 monetary issues are not or should not be8 sufficient determinants or even the sole9 underlying motor of public policy ever.10 Drop the eight and a half percent11 increase of two year leases completely or make12 the increase very small.13 I'd like to in addition to respond14 to Mr. Lubell' s pointed questioning about the age15 of the housing stock and an issue in why rents16 should go and why the old buildings should go and17 be replaced by steel and towers, the vision of a18 city of steel and grass towers that' s promulgated19 by the larger landlord interests is only one20 vision.	And tenants and other people who live21 here should be included in the policy debate22 about the nature of the housing stock and the age23 of the housing stock.24 In many cases, housing stock that is25 supposedly very old is much cheaper to refurbish5 
2 and much more cost effective to refurbish than3 building completely new buildings.4 The aesthetics and the economics of5 a vision of steel and glass tower Manhattan has6 to be debated.	There shouldn' t be a foregone7 conclusion.8 (Audience participation.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead, Mr.12 Schleider.13 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for14 testimony.	It was very good.	Well, well15 crafted, very nice.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Herbert Rock;17 Hold on, Mr. Rock.18 Followed by Councilmember Jessica19 Lappin;20 Followed by Ralph Compton.21 Mr. Rock.22 MR. HERBERT ROCK:	I come here23 every year and talk to you.	It seems I talk to2 4	deaf ears.	Of course, you're constantly ready25	to - -	I compare this Board the same way as a
2 parole board.	They bring a prisoner in front and3 here we are the same here, the same year we come4 here year and year out and you never listen to5 us.	You always say raise the rent, why?	Why6 raise the rent, it's four walls.	You have to7 raise the rent for four walls.	There is no8 reason for a rent increase at all.9 Every year, year in and year out our10 landlords are big money.	I say you want to raise11 the rent, yes, let the landlords bring their12 books.	Let them bring their books and see what13 they have.	If they come here - - you know what14 happened, I'll tell you, you have a zero15 increase.	No rent increase.	Zero.	Make no16 increase to happen, because this is what the17 purpose is.	I speak to you year and year out and18 what happens is is nothing happens.	Never19 happens.20 You come here.	Why do you make us21 come here and talk to you with deaf ears?	Deaf22 ears.	You raise the rent.	Is there a zero23 time.	Is there a year that one year that you are24 going to be recognized as the greatest Board,25 zero increase, never going to get it.2 
2 And when that happens, sir you will3 remember year in and year out.	I live in a rent4 controlled house, rent control.	You hurt people5 when you raise the rent year in and year - - my - -6 will do - - give my income.	I will bring you my7 income tax.	And I give you half of my income8 because I'm a Veteran and I have no income.	I9 pay half of my rent for rent, is that fair?	Is10 that fair that a person who served this country11 who serve and served who did everything for  - -12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. HERBERT ROCK:	We get a raise,14 why?	There' s no reason for it.	Let the15 landlords who made rent increase, they're not16 going to come to you.	They' re afraid they come17 here and get the fair increase, which is right,18 they don't have to come to a Board like this and19 sit and make themselves fools and say I need rent20 increase.	But if they need a rent increase, give21 it to them.22 We don't need an increase. We are in23 a position now that we are in a war and we paying24 so much taxes every year, please give - - have  a25 heart.	Have pity on all the people that - - we're2 
2 forced to live in our housing.	We can't afford3 to buy our own houses so we live in houses that4 are rent, and rent, and rent, and rent.	Rent is5 enough.	Why do we have to have this increase.6 My landlord making so much money7 it's unbelievable.	Know what he did, he took8 half of the building and made it - - what was9 that?	Made condos and he' s making more money and10 you give him a rent increase he thinks you're a11 fool.	He says, hey, you don't see the big12 landlords come here.	You see little guy who come13 here and speak to you.14 I come to you and speak to my heart15 but I don't need books.	I come here year in year16 after year and the same thing happens.	There are17 - - am I talking to deaf ears, am I talking to18 people who aren't listening.	Am I talking to19 something that never could happen.	Why one time,20 one time, make this board well known all over the21 word the fact you never gave an increase.	Zero22 increase.	Zero increase.23 (Audience participation.)2 4	MR. HERBERT ROCK:	And you can do25	it. Yes, you can do it.	Believe me, you have the
2 power to do it and you will be remembered as the3 greatest group that ever sat.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 MR. HERBERT ROCK:	For me?6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.7 MR. HERBERT ROCK:	I'll finish.	I8	have two words to say to you.	I'm a Jewish man9 and I'm going to say two Jewish words,	(in10 Hebrew.) And not only that (in Hebrew.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let's see if you14 can follow that act, Councilmember.15 Go ahead.16 COUNCILMEMBER LAPPIN:	I was17 commending your passion and eloquence.18 My name is Jessica Lappin,19 Councilmember representing the Upper East Side.20 And I am here today to protest the21 range of increases that are being proposed for22	2006/2007.23 The initial findings of the 200524 Housing and Vacancy Survey revealed a vacancy25 rate of 3.09 percent.	The survey confirms what23 
2 tenants in this City already know to be true: We3 have a housing emergency.	Incomes are down, but4 rents are up.	Nearly 30 percent of households5 pay over 50 percent of their income for gross6 rent. And I brought with me from today' s New York7 Times, the story about rents of the City' s middle8 class are the thinnest in the nation, which goes9 exactly to our point.10 You are hearing from real people who11 are talking about real struggles.	The issue12 isn't about depriving landlords of economic gain.13 It's a simple matter of fairness and taking into14 account the reality of what tenants can and15 cannot afford.16 Given the high cost of living in17 this City and the number of people on fixed18 incomes, tenants are already being squeezed out.19 We don' t want this to become a City that turns20 its back on seniors, immigrants and working class21 people.22 (Audience participation.)2 3	COUNCILMEMBER LAPPIN:	When the24 rent laws were up for renewal earlier this year,25 I sent a notice to tenants in my district24 
2 alerting them to the issue and urging them to3 testify at the City Council hearings.	And some4 of them I see are here today.5 The response to that notification6 was startling.	Tenants called my office, wrote7 letters and showed up at our door panic-stricken8 that the rent laws would not be renewed; that9 they would be out on the street, and they would10 have nowhere to live . Some of them are unable or11 unhealthy enough to even come here today and12 testify.13 The vast majority of them were14 seniors.	The City Council heard their voices and15 renewed the rent laws. I ask you today to also16 listen to these voices.	Tenants should not have17 to choose between eating and paying rent. They18 should not have to scrimp on basic necessities.19 As I said, many are seniors who20 deserve to live out the rest of their lives in21 dignity.22 I ask today that as you make your23 final determination, consider the economic24 burdens tenants will face with any rent increases25 at all.2 
2 I am confident you will see that,3 this year, rents should be frozen and that no4 increase is warranted.5 Thank you.6 (Audience participation.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 Question. Councilmember, we have a9 question.10 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	I am in the same11 district as you are.12 There were things that' s been thrown13 up time and time again and that is the purview of14 this Board and what we can do and what we can't.15 One of the things that we're very conscious of is16 the landlords who have numerous violations17 against them.	Of course, this Board has no way18 of doing anything about that .19 (Audience participation.)2 0	DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Given what the21 City Council - - where is the City Council who has22 responsibility for that?	One of the questions or23 the answers rather, that we get informally is24 that because of the budget crunch the departments25 that have that responsibility cannot hire enough21 
2 people to do it, but, you know, the idea of not3 granting rent increases to people who have4 numerous, 50, 100, over a 100 violations is5 something that we can't do.6 But can you give me a better7 understanding as to where the Council is on that.8 COUNCILMEMBER LAPPIN:	Absolutely.9	I wish that you could create more10 affordable housing.	I wish that was in your11 purview.	But seeing that it's not I hope that12 you will do what you can to protect what exists.13 I am a co-sponsor of a bill that14 would prohibit the City from giving rent15 subsidies to landlords who are not good actors.16 That would eliminate the City' s power to give17 money to bad landlords.18 But as we go through the budget19 process this year which is happening, you know,20 over the next couple of weeks, we've been going21 to delegation meetings to discuss trying to give22 more money to certain mayoral agencies that would23 be - - who are responsible for doing that kind of24 work.25 At the end of the day I don't think10 
2 the City Council should have to give more to the3 Buildings Department or HPD or NYCHA.	I think,4 well, I think that they have mandates just the5 way City Council has a mandate.	And I think that6 the Mayor should fund them to a level that they7 can carry out their missions.	But if that8 doesn't happen, then we do what we can to step9 and try to help them.10 But I think that the administration11 should recognize our agencies who are falling12 short on their budgets lines and fund them13 adequately so they can fulfill their14 responsibilities.15 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Thank you.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 Ralph Compton, please;18 Followed by Kimberly Mortimer;19 Followed by Cassandra Dooley.20 Ralph Compton, are you here?	Yes.21 You're next.22 MR. RALPH COMPTON:	My name's Ralph23 Compton and I live on Lutheran Place, Riverside24 Tower for 43 years.25 I don't really have a great deal to2 
2 say.	In times past this building would have been3 threatened by a rent increase because it's an not4 essentially an SRO or perhaps the rules could5 change, needless to say they don't.6 He was overcharging for years.	When7 he found that he couldn't to do that anymore, he8 decided rent it to tourists .	There's no doubt9 in my mind that the landlords are making a lot of10 money.	Rents in Manhattan are enormous compared11 to the years past.	It's obvious that the reason12 is that tourists are willing and able to pay13 these huge amounts.14 And there's no need for the15 landlords to take money away from people who16 can't afford to pay.17 Conditions often are not good.	I18 hear of rat infestation, cockroach infestation.19 Repairs need to be made, which are not .	And the20 reason that tenants put up with these conditions21 is that they can't afford to move out.22 We' re not wealthy.	I'm living on23 Social Security myself.	Many of us are elderly.24 Some of us are infirmed.25 I guess that's about - - I guess2 
2 that' s about all I have to say.3 Thank you.4 (Applause.)5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6	MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Excuse me. There's7	a question.8	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I have a9	question.10 MR. RALPH COMPTON:	Yes.11 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you for12 coming to testify.13 Where do you live?14 MR. RALPH COMPTON:	Eighty, at the15 Riverside Drive.	I rent the building in16 Riverside Tower.17 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	How long did you18 live there?19 MR. RALPH COMPTON:	Oh, let's see,20 42 years I think.21 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And you're22 saying that you and your neighbors are finding it23 increasingly difficult.24 MR. RALPH COMPTON:	I'm sorry.25 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	You and your
2 neighbors are finding it increasingly difficult3 to live with the rents, with the increases in the4 rents.5 MR. RALPH COMPTON:	Oh, yes.6 There have been steady increase.	It's not7 however, it's not essentially an SRO now.	It was8 at one time.	And in times past it hasn't been9 threatened by increase because they're only a few10 permanent tenants left.11 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Well, how many12 permanent tenants are left in your building?13 MR. RALPH COMPTON:	How many?14 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Permanent15 tenants.16 MR. RALPH COMPTON:	I don't know17 the exact number.	About 19 I think.18 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	19? I can't hear19 you.20 How much do the rooms rent for for21 tourists?22 MR. RALPH COMPTON:	I think - - I23 don't know these figures.	I think certainly most24 of them are being rented to tourists.25 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Do you know how
2	much?3	MR. RALPH COMPTON:	No, I'm sorry.4 I think - - I haven't checked the figures in my5 building, but I think people paid 200, $300  a6 night.7	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Okay.	Thank8 you.9 (Audience participation.)10 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Thank you.11 The next speaker is Kimberly12 Mortimer;13 Followed by Cassandra Dooley; and14 Charles Ogunrinde?

Can we start the clock again?9	MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Just go ahead.10 We' ll start it.11 MS. KIM MORTIMER:	My name is Kim12 Mortimer.	I own a small brownstone on the Upper13 West Side.	I brought this property from my14 grandmother who was an integral part of the15 community for almost 40 years.16 I'd like to convey what our17 experience has been in the past several years18 from owning this property, and are convinced why19 high rent increases are absolutely necessary if20 affordable housing is to continue in New York21 City.22 In my building I have a mixture of23 perfect tenants and not so perfect tenants.	By24 perfect tenants, pay their rent on time, have a25 good relationship with us and keep their property10 
2 in good repair.3 Remarkably my not so perfect tenants4 have lived in the building the longest, paid the5 least amount of rent, and cause the most trouble.6 They do not pay their rent on time.	They create7 hazardous conditions in their apartment and then8 call HPD to claim inhabitability.9 They illegally sublet their flat for10 to six and seven people at one time.	As I said,11 these tenants have been there for a very long12 time and on average pay less than $795 per month13 for rent.	They are professionals with good City14 jobs making over $100,000 per year.	They have15 two and three homes.	Rather expensive $9000 cars16 and take extensive holidays four times a year.17 They even have income-generating18 properties themselves.	I have one tenant who19 makes so much money that he's asked my20 grandmother if she'd be willing to sell her21 brownstone to him, which she declined.	He22 personally vowed to sabotage our building.	He23 accosted us and fraudulently tweaked the24 impactibility claims.25 Imagine, a rent stabilized tenant
2 who makes so much money and lives so lavishly3 that he can afford to buy our brownstone when my4 grandmother is eating potato chip sandwiches and5 boiled rice because she's trying to make ends6 meet.7 I'm here to tell you that something8	is dreadfully wrong with the picture.	Our9 property has not generated a profit for the past10 ten years.	In fact, it has become a liability.11 Our costs have increased 37 percent12 and moreover for the past four years our Board - -13 this Board has rendered increases totaling less14 than eleven percent for the first three years of15 that year.16 I have personally injected over17 $30,000 of additional outside income because the18 operating costs of our building far exceeds the19 income that is currently being generated by the20 rental income of our flats.21 In 2005 I incurred $43,000 in lost22 rent, $25,000 in legal fees along and 38 thousand23 dollars in taxes.	$26 on food - -24 (Audience participation.)25 MS. KIM MORTIMER:	- - and legal
2 fees.3 I ask you, if the intention of this4 Board to is keep housing in New York City5 affordable, give the owners the eight and a half6 percent increases that they need to cover their7 operating cost.8 (Audience participation.)9 MS. KIM MORTIMER:	This is causing10 many owners to sell their property to - -11 (Audience participation.)12 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Let her speak.13 MS. KIM MORTIMER:	Okay. Please14 also make provisions for owners who are not15 taking advantage of these increases because all16 tenants' leases do not expire between the17 effective date of October 1st or the 6th of18 September of '07 or who have been unable to take19 advantage of vacancy rate increases because their20 tenants occupy the apartment for many years and21 never vacated and subsequently these rents are22 unfairly low because of that.23 We subsidize their buildings and24 with additional income upgrading25 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Wrap up, please.2 
2	MS. KIM MORTIMER:	This Board just3	does nothing and keeps the rents as they are.4 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	One second.	We5 have a question.6	Ms. Adams.7	DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Where is your8	property?9	MS. KIM MORTIMER:	West 91st Street.10	DIRECTOR ADAMS:	I'm sorry.11	MS.
