2 authorized by such subdivision shall be  blank.3 Title:	ADJUSTMENTS FOR LOFTS	4 ( UNITS IN THE CATEGORY OF BUILDINGS COVERED BY	5 ARTICLE 7 - C OF THE MULTIPLE DWELLING LAW.)6 The Rent Guidelines Board proposes 7 the following levels of rent increase above  the 8 " base rent," as defined in Section 286 , subdivision 9 4 , of the Multiple Dwelling Law, for units to  which 10 these guidelines are applicable in accordance  with 11 Article 7 - C of the Multiple Dwelling Law:12 For a one- year increase -- for 13 one- year increase periods commencing on or after 14 October 1 , 2008 and on or before September 30 ,15 2009 :	Blank percent.16 For two- year increase periods 17 commencing on or after October 1 , 2008 and on  or 18 before September 30 , 2009 : Blank percent.19 Title:	VACANT LOFT UNITS -20 PROPOSAL.21 There shall be blank vacancy 22 allowance.23 Title:	FRACTIONAL TERMS -	24 PROPOSAL.25 For the purposes of these 2 
2 guidelines, any lease or tenancy for a period up   to 3 and including one year shall be deemed a  one- year 4 lease or tenancy, and any lease or tenancy for  a5 period of over one year and up to and including  two 6 years shall be deemed a two- year lease or tenancy.7 Title: ESCALATOR CLAUSES	8 - PROPOSAL.9 Where a lease for a dwelling  unit 10 in effect on May 31 , 1968 or where a lease in  is 11 effect on June 30 , 1974 for a dwelling unit  which 12 became subject to the Rent Stabilization Law  of 13 1969 , by virtue of the Emergency Tenant Protection 14 Act of 1974 and Resolution No. 276 of the New   York 15 City Council, contained an escalator clause for  the 16 increased costs of operation and such clause  is 17 still in effect, the lawful rent on September 30 ,18 2008 , over which the fair rent under this Order  is 19 computed, shall include the increased rental,  if 20 any, due under such clause except those  charges 21 which accrued within one year of the  commencement 22 of the renewal date.23 Moreover, where a lease contained 24 an escalator clause that the owner may  validly 25 renew under the Code, unless the owner elects  or 2 
2 has elected in writing to delete such  clause,3 effective no later than October 1 , 2008 from the 4 existing lease and all subsequent leases for  such 5 dwelling unit, the increased rental, if any,  due 6 under such escalator clause shall be offset  against 7 the amount of increase authorized under this  Order.8 Title: SPECIAL ADJUSTMENTS UNDER	9 PRIOR ORDERS - PROPOSAL.10 All rent adjustments lawfully 11 implemented and maintained under previous  apartment 12 orders and included in the base rent in effect  on 13 September 30 , 2008 shall continue to be included in 14 the base rent for the purposes of  computing 15 subsequent rents adjusted pursuant to this  Order.16 Title: PROPOSED SPECIAL GUIDELINE.17 Under Section 26 - 513 ( b)( 1 ) of the 18 New York City Administrative Code, and Section 9 ( e)19 of the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974 ,  the 20 Rent Guidelines Board is obligated to  promulgate 21 special guidelines to aid the State Division  of 22 Housing and Community Renewal in its  determination 23 of initial legal regulated rents for  housing 24 accommodations previously subject to the City  Rent 25 and Rehabilitation Law which are the subject of  a2 
2 tenant application for adjustment.3 The Rent Guidelines Board hereby 4 proposes the following Special Guidelines:5 For dwelling units subject to  the 6 Rent and Rehabilitation Law on September 30 , 2008 ,7 which become vacant after September 30 , 2008 , the 8 special guideline shall be blank.9 Title: DECONTROLLED UNITS	10 - PROPOSAL.	11 The permissible increase for 12 decontrolled units, as referenced in Order 3 a,13 which become decontrolled after September 30 , 2008 ,14 shall be blank.15 Rents charged and paid in  excess 16 of the levels -- credits, excuse me,  CREDITS 17 PROPOSAL, title.18 Rentals charged and paid in  excess 19 of the levels of rent increase established by  this 20 Order shall be fully credited against the  next 21 month' s rent.22 Title: STATEMENT OF BASIS AND	23 PURPOSE.24 The Rent Guidelines Board is 25 hereby authorized to promulgate rent  guidelines 2 
2 governing apartment units subject to the  Rent 3 Stabilization Law of 1969 , as amended, and the 4 Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974 , as 5 amended.6 The purpose of these guidelines  is 7 to implement the public policy set forth  in 8 Findings and Declaration of Emergency of the  Rent 9 Stabilization Law of 1969 (§ 26 - 501 of the N. Y. C.10 Administrative Code) and in the  Legislative 11 Findings contained in the Emergency Tenant 12	Protection Act of 1974 ( L. 1974 c. 576 , § 4 [§ 2 ]).13 The Rent Guidelines Board is  also 14 authorized to promulgate rent guidelines for  loft 15 units subject to Section 286 subdivision 7 of  the 16 Multiple Dwelling Law.17 The purpose of the loft  guidelines 18 is to implement the public policy set forth in  the 19 Legislative Findings of Article 7 - C of the Multiple 20 Dwelling Law ( Section 280 .)21 Thank you.22 Mr. Languedoc.23 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Mr. Chair, and 24 members of the Board, I think there' s probably a25 tradition of fairly longstanding for  --13 
2 VOICES:	Can' t hear you.3 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Oh. Can you hear 4 me now?	Can you hear me now?5 VOICES:	Yes.6 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.7 I believe that there is  a8 tradition of fairly longstanding for one of  the 9 tenant representatives of the New York City  Rent 10 Guidelines Board to, at a preliminary vote, to  ask 11 the Board to adopt a rent freeze for the   coming 12 year.13 ( Audience participation.)14 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And I, once 15 again, consistent with that tradition, am  moving 16 the Board to do so.	In other words, that in  each 17 space in the proposed order that you just  read,18 that a " zero" be written in blank.19 And I make this motion in  all 20 seriousness and based upon the data that has  been 21 presented to us in the reports of the New York   City 22 Rent Guidelines Board, as well as the feedback  from 23 the constituent organizations that represent the 24 over one million rent stabilized tenants that  fall 25 into the jurisdiction of this  Board.2 
2 I just would like to point out  a3 few -- a few pieces of information from  the 4 studies.5 The -- for example, economic 6 growth in the City for 2007 was much slower than  in 7 previous years;8 The unemployment rate has remained 9 stable for the first time in three years  after 10 three years of a decrease;  and 11 That the household income of rent 12 stabilized tenants is woefully far below the  median 13 New York City household of over $ 46 , 000 , that for 14 rent stabilized tenants being the range  of 15 approximately $ 32 , 000 ;16 Somewhere in the range of  28 17 percent of tenants pay more than fifty percent  of 18 their income for rent.19 Tenants' electric bills have 20 increased 8 . 2 percent from May ' 06 to May ' 07 ;21 And the Community Service 22 Society' s 2007 unheard of third survey of low 23 income New Yorkers found that 23 percent of  low 24 income New Yorkers reported that they had lost  a25 job in 2007 while 26 percent fell behind in rent   or 2 

2	mortgage payments.3
At the same time, the amount  of 
4 cash assistance that' s been made available through 5 pubic assistance programs and the like for rent  has 6 continued to decline substantially over the  years.7 And with regard to Section  88 Housing assistance, while that assistance  increased 9 from 2006 to 2007 , we' ve also been informed that 10 there are reports that up to ten thousand of  those 11 vouchers could be lost later this year due  to 12 budget cuts from the U. S. Government.13 Also, as I think was  rather 14 eloquently stated by one of the panels on  Friday 15 May 2 nd, that cash assistance and subsidies often 16 do not reach rent stabilized tenants, many of  whom 17 are of limited English proficiency and foreign- born 18 and yet paying the same taxes as any other  citizen 19 of this City.20 And the funding that New York  City 21 expects to receive from the Federal Government  for 22 housing is set to decline by 7 . 3 percent this year,23 as adjusted by inflation.24 Homelessness is now up to  an 25 average of over 35 , 000 people per night staying in 4 
2 City shelters reflecting an increase of  eight 3 percent from ' 06 to ' 07 .4 And a very large -- as we know,  a5 very large portion of the population of  rent 6 stabilized tenants consists of low and very  low 7 income tenants without adequate cash assistance  of 8 housing subsidies who are paying a high  percentage 9 of their income for rent.10 In contrast, the Income and 11 Expense Study - I' m almost finished - the  Income 12 and Expense Study did not support the claims of  --13 that have been made to the Board, of  landlord 14 hardship.15 The average monthly gross income 16 for a rent stabilized units in 2006 was $ 1 , 009 per 17 unit per month.	And the DHCR Mean Stabilized rent 18 for 2006 was $ 1 , 053 per unit per month, with an 19 average monthly cost of $ 695 per unit per month 20 representing a substantial amount that' s available 21 to owners for profit, debt service  and22 improvements.23 The number of distressed buildings24 has decreased.25 And the net operating income  of 2 
2 rent stabilized apartments in 2006 was $ 314 per 3 month.4 We' ve not -- the Board has not 5 been given any adequate explanation as to  why 6 owners of rent stabilized buildings, who  are 7 experiencing financial difficulty, do not  get 8 sufficient benefit from such programs as Article 8 A9 and PLP loans, J 51 tax abatements and the like,  as 10 well as numerous forms of rent increases  available 11 to them already under rent stabilization laws  such 12 as increases for Major Capital Improvements,  which 13 has increased revenues by millions of  dollars 14 citywide to owners, as well as individual  apartment 15 increases, vacancy increases and hardship 16 increases.17 I could continue -- I  could 18 continue on.	But I think there' s ample data to 19 support the conclusion that this Board should  break 20 from previous history and should do  the 21 unprecedented thing of adopting a rent freeze  this 22 year.23 Thank you.24 ( Applause.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Just so we' re 2 
2 clear, technically your motion is in the  blanks 3 that I talked about, zero?4 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Yes, yes.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	A6 second on that motion?7 MS. HOLDER:	Second.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any discussion 9 on that motion?	Any --10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair?11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead,12 Mr. Schleider.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Ron, you said 14 that eloquently and you did bring up some  good 15 points.16 You' re not telling the entire 17 story.	And in citing the reports that you  cited,18 building operating costs have increased by  forty 19 percent over the last six years, not including  this 20 year' s 7 . 8 percent increase by the PIOC, and rents21 measured by the one- year rent guidelines have 22 increased by only twenty percent over the  same 23 six- year period.24 And even with income, in  addition 25 to rent, building income has not kept up  with 2 
2 operating costs increases and we' ve seen that in 3 the reports that the margins  are shrinking.	The 4 trends are discouraging for property owners  and 5 with operating costs increasing faster than  income.6 And that operating income has decreased in four  of 7 the past five years for which the data  was 8 available.9 Now, rent increases have failed to 10 keep up with building operating costs  increases 11 over the last six years and that' s been resulting 12 in deteriorating building economics.	And you can 13 say that there was a -- that distressed  buildings 14 are not as great as they were  last year.	But 15 that' s really disingenuous.	It' s a smaller amount 16 by a fraction of a fraction of a   percent.17 In fact, the overall trend for  the 18 past few years has been an overwhelming increase  in 19 the number of distressed buildings.20 MR. LANGUEDOC:	That' s not true.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I guess we' ll 22 have more points discussed as the meeting goes  on.23 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any additional 25 debate?2

22 of the Board.	And thank you to the public  for 23 attending this meeting.24 For the past five years I' ve 25 called on the local politicians to formulate  a22 
2 workable public policy to preserve the  housing 3 stock that' s the backbone of this City.4 Many have tried and few have 5 succeeded.	A workable public policy that  addresses 6 the realities for income enhancements to  support 7 housing affordability and housing sustainability is 8 desperately needed.9 To address tenant concerns, on 10 March 13 th, Mayor Bloomberg signed legislation 11 establishing penalties for tenant harassment that 12 tackles a variety of unacceptable and  improper 13 practices for both those landlords whose  actions 14 cause lawful tenants to vacate their  homes.15 I think everybody on this Board  is 16 an agreement that' s a positive step and that' s a17 part of a workable public  policy.18 Also, HPD and DHCR has 19 significantly stepped up housing code enforcement.20 On April 16 th, Mayor Bloomberg 21 announced that New York City will  receive 22 approximately $ 9 . 4 million to by administered by 23 the New York City Housing Authority, and  the 24 Department of Homeless Services to currently  house 25 more than 1 , 000 homeless veterans, continuing the 2 
2 work of NYCHA, the New York City VA Task Force   that 3 aims to end veteran homelessness in New York  City.4 That' s part of a workable public 5 policy.6 On April 9 th, Deputy Mayor Gibbs,7 Speaker Quinn, Commissioner Mendez Santiago and  a8 coalition of human services umbrella groups 9 announced broad agreement on senior service 10 enhancements.11 And in March, Mayor Bloomberg,12 with the United Way of New York City,  reminded 13 Social Security recipients, veterans and low  income 14 workers, that they may be eligible for $ 300 more  in 15 stimulus payments if they file their tax  return.16 In January, for the fourth 17 consecutive year, 1 , 700 volunteers took to the 18 streets in the dead of night to conduct an  estimate 19 of the street homeless population in all  five 20 boroughs of our City.21 By the end of the night,  the 22 volunteers had checked hundreds of parks,  inspected 23 more than a thousand subway cars and covered  more 24 than eight thousand miles of streets. What  they 25 found, or rather, what they didn' t find was 2 

2	encouraging.3
By their account, the number  of 
4 New Yorkers living on our streets has  dropped 5 twelve percent over the past year to  some 6 thirty- three hundred people.	That' s still too many 7 but it' s a 25 percent drop since our first  Citywide 8 count in 2005 .	And it means our rate  of 9 homelessness is now far below most other  major 10 American cities such is Chicago, Seattle and  San 11 Francisco.12 In December, Mayor Bloomberg 13 announced that during its first year of  operation,14 the Center for Economic Opportunity had  already 15 successfully implemented 31 of its 41 proposed  new 16 antipoverty programs aimed at breaking the cycle  of 17 intergenerational poverty among New York City' s18 poorest residents.19 Also in December, Mayor Bloomberg 20 and Deputy Mayor for Health and Human  Services,21 Linda Gibbs, announced that 1 , 431 families received 22 their first cash transfers from completing  specific 23 activities related to education, health  and 24 workforce participation and training as part  of 25 Opportunity New York City - the nation' s first 4 
2 conditional cash transfer program.3 That' s part of a workable public 4 policy.5 All that in addition to  Mayor 6 Bloomberg signing legislation to increase  SCRIE 7 eligibility and provide similar relief for  disabled 8 tenants in rent stabilized buildings.9 Also, New York City offers  housing 10 subsidies of up to $ 14 , 600 to entice new Math,11 Science and special education teachers to work  in 12 the City' s most challenging schools in one of  the 13 most aggressive housing incentive programs in  the 14 nation to address a chronic shortage of  qualified 15 educators in these specialities.16 This is what has been needed.  This 17 is what still is needed - a workable public  policy 18 to address housing affordability, your  local 19 government in action.20 The largest affordable housing 21 initiative ever undertaken by an American city  is 22 moving ahead on building and preserving 165 , 000 23 units of affordable housing, to be completed  in 24 less than seven years, providing enough housing  for 25 half- a- million New Yorkers.2 
2 This is being done without  raising 3 taxes and because the administration found  creative 4 ways to use the heated housing market for  the 5 greater public good to promote ethnically  and 6 economically diverse neighborhoods.7 This is what has been needed -  a8 workable public policy to address housing 9 affordability; a workable public policy to  address 10 housing affordability that puts responsibility 11 where it needs to be - on the shoulders  of 12 government and off the shoulders of  private 13 landlord.14 Tenants recognize the burden of 15 landlords.	They do.	They told us. And they  need 16 to work with landlords to petition the City  to 17 lower property taxes on rent stabilized  buildings;18 to petition the City to lower the water and  sewer 19 cost; to petition the utility and  insurance 20 companies to lower the cost of rent  stabilized 21 buildings, to do something positive.22 It' s time to step up.	Do not go 23 the easy way with just maligning the landlords  who 24 have been shouldering the cost of providing  what 25 has become an expensive public subsidy  program.2 
2 There are struggling tenants and 3 there are some landlords who probably don' t need 4 rent increases.	And in reality, there are 5 struggling landlords.	There are tenants with good 6 incomes who can afford to make way for a   less 7 fortunate tenant but won' t give up a very low  rent.8 Those tenants that can upgrade to 9 make way for those at risk in their community,  need 10 to answer to the tenant activists and explain  why,11 in a critical housing shortage, they won' t make 12 room when they can well afford to share the  burden.13 Of course, there are tenants  who 14 can' t afford to move and we all know about the  at 15 risk group one paycheck away from tragedy.  However,16 the vast majority of tenants can afford to pay  an 17 increase.	And based on past reports prepared  by 18 the staff, roughly twenty percent or one- in- five 19 rent stabilized tenants have real difficulty  with 20 expenses and may not be able to afford any  increase 21 this year. But almost eighty percent can afford  a22 rent increase.23 About four- out- of- five rent 24 stabilized tenants can afford an increase and  some 25 can well afford a large increase than others  to 2 

2	share the burden.34
( Audience participation.) MR. SCHLEIDER:	Let me put 
5 something out there from this Board' s reference 6 material.7 The findings of the City  Council 8 in enacting the rent stabilized --  Stabilization 9 Law of 1969 and the State Legislature in  adopting 10 the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974 ,11 clearly established that fair and  generally 12 affordable rents are a primary objective of  these 13 laws. The intent is clearly not to guarantee  an 14 affordable rent for every tenant. It can' t be done.15 Rather, it is to protect  tenants 16 against abnormal rent increases driven up by  the 17 chronic housing shortage. And that' s a good thing.18 That' s part of a workable public policy.	But 19 consideration for abnormal cost increases must  also 20 be allowed to play.	And certainly last year' s21 increase was inefficient and insufficient to  share 22 the burden.23 The vast majority of landlords,24 the large number of landlords own small  buildings.25 About forty percent of the regulated rental  housing 5 
2 stock is in buildings of less than eleven  units.3 And they do struggle to keep their property  from 4 deteriorating. The vast majority of landlords  have 5 been suffering the cost increases of real  estate 6 taxes, insurance, fuel oil, labor and services  for 7 years without commensurate increases in  rent.8 These landlords are the 9 gatekeepers of the existing affordable  housing 10 stock. These gatekeepers are the private  citizens 11 that the City has forced to shoulder a public  cost,12 with higher real estate taxes, water and  sewer 13 charges and now obscenely high fuel  costs.14 The tenants must share the  burden 15 of these cost increases. And the continuing  cost 16 increases on top of last year' s cost increase on 17 top of the prior years increase on top of  prior 18 years increase in operating costs must be  shared.19 The Board' s own calculation show 20 2008 commensurate rent increases averaging well 21 higher than last year' s increases.22 Landlords ask us, what can  the 23 Board do to help keep our properties from  ruin?24 We' ve seen the staff reports that show the 25 increased trend in distressed housing and it' s2 

2	frightening.3
The damage from inadequate rent 
4 increases has encouraged the sale of  rent 5 stabilized buildings from long- term stable 6 ownership to speculators that have no other  agenda 7 but to promote tenant attrition to achieve  higher 8 rents. This is done aggressively to remove  those 9 apartments from rent regulation without care  for 10 the fabric of those communities.11 Once those apartments turn over,12 the old, lower rent levels will be  lost.13 This Board must allow landlords to 14 protect New York' s affordable housing to share the 15 burden while this Board can and must respect  the 16 expectations of a reasonable return if the  market 17 is to maintain its investment in what is  referred 18 to as the largest inventory of affordable  housing 19 in the City.20 This Board cannot frustrate the 21 expectation of a steady and predictable  operating 22 even for landlords and expect them to preserve  the 23 housing stock called the backbone of this  great 24 City.25 Because of the few landlords who 4 
2 may not need much of an increase, are we as a   Board 3 not going to help the vast majority of  landlords 4 desperately needing the means to preserve  their 5 property? Are we as a Board just going to   ignore 6 that four out of five tenants can and should  pay 7 their fair share, to share the burden of  rapidly 8 rising costs and narrowing operating margins?9 That being said, and in the  spirit 10 of sharing the burden, I call for a vote for   a11 commensurate rental increase of nine percent for  a12 one- year renewal lease and a fourteen percent 13 increase on a two- year renewal lease or a  minimum 14 $ 60 per month rent increase, whichever is higher.15 ( Audience participation.)16 MS. HOLDER:	Could that be --17 excuse me. I' m sorry.18 Point of clarification.	Could I19 hear that, your proposed increases again?20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.

2 fourteen percent for a two- year ,--3 ( Audience participation.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	-- $ 60 minimum.5 So in other words, depending on where the  rent 6 break is, if your nine percent is less than $ 60 ,7 then it would be $ 60 .8 MR.

The Chair votes no.The motion fails seven- two. ( Audience participation.)MS. HOLDER:	I have -- I have  aCHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder has 
9	a motion. Go ahead.10 MS. HOLDER:	I don' t know, I --11 you know, I was -- I was prepared for some --   to12 make some written -- to make remarks that I   had 13 prepared earlier today.	But there' s just a couple 14 of things that I just kind of noticed and I   just 15 wanted highlight.16 First of all, I want to know  where 17 everybody is.	The tenants are here but not in  the 18 number that you would expect given how  important 19 the situation is and how dire this is to  what' s20 going to happen to tenants here in New York  City.21 And perhaps they' re not here 22 because they' re still working. Perhaps they' re not 23 here because they' re working their second job.24 Maybe they' re not here because they' re discouraged 25 and they' re disappointed.10 
2 ( Audience participation.)3 MS. HOLDER:	Maybe they' re not 4 here because they' ve become weary of a process that 5 guarantees there' s going to be an increase.6 But on the other side, I  wonder 7 where the landlords are also.	And I really do 8 wonder where they are.	Because we' ve been told how 9 extremely important and what a dire situation  this 10 is for them, that they are losing  money.11 We are being told that  the 12 landlords are suffering.	And we are being told 13 that it' s very hard for them to maintain these 14 buildings that we all live in and that  constitute 15 the neighborhoods of New York  City.16 And I' m wondering if they' re not 17 here because perhaps they are actually  satisfied 18 with the process that' s going to give them an 19 increase, but perhaps also indifferent  --20 ( Audience participation.)21 MS. HOLDER:	Hold on. But 22 perhaps also indifferent to a process that does  not 23 necessarily make sense for anybody.24 And while I appreciate my 25 colleague Steven Schleider highlighting some of  the 2 
2 victories that tenants have had, but when you  think 3 about all that we have lost in the struggle  to 4 preserve affordable housing, when you think  about 5 the resources that are going to be needed  from 6 organizations such as organizers and  community 7 groups, as well as legal services and the Legal  Aid 8 Society to enforce the gains that have been  made,9 it' s daunting for me sitting on this part of  the 10 whole debate and fight and think that tenants  in 11 any way are really going to be able to maintain   any 12 traction to keep housing affordable here in  New 13 York City.14 Increasingly what were are seeing 15 is two different cities.	We' re seeing a city that 16 is becoming increasingly rich and a city that' s17 becoming increasingly poor and a middle or  moderate 18 class that is moving away from this  City.19 We are increasingly seeing City 20 workers having to get waivers because they  cannot 21 afford to live in the very city where they  work.22 We are increasingly seeing people 23 coming to us, telling us that although they  still 24 qualify for Legal Aid and work two jobs, that  they 25 are being evicted and that they don' t know where  to 2 

2	go and what to do.3
We hear testimony from landlords 
4 who say that it' s increasingly becoming difficult 5 for them to make ends meet. And the same way   in 6 which the tenant has been trying to address  their 7 issues, I would assume the landlord community  is 8 trying to address them too.9 But I don' t know what it is that 10 this Board can do but to continue to push along   the 11 one size- fit- all process -- a process that seems to 12 be pulled by the two owner members and the  two 13 tenant members without any type of input, at  least 14 that we hear about openly in discussion, from  our 15 well- respected public members -- the idea that we 16 could perhaps understand what their issues  are.17 ( Audience participation.)18 MS. HOLDER:	Perhaps the idea 19 that we could understand what issues they' re 20 grappling with because we know too well the  issues 21 that the landlords and the tenants are  facing.22 However we come out in  this 23 debate, however we come out in this debate, I   would 24 hope that this Board could begin to try to  adopt 25 some other types of concepts so that we could  wrap 4 
2 our arms around all the information that we  have 3 and have a meaningful and open discussion as  a4 Board about what is supposed to happen  here.5 Ron and I discussed things 6 actually with the owner members today. And  although 7 not of any surprise to anyone here, we don' t  agree.8 We at least had a conservation that you continue  to 9 see playing out in the  hearings.10 You understand where we are  coming 11 from. You understand the constituencies that we  are 12 trying to protect and serve.	And I' d like to think 13 that we could see more of that from the rest of   our 14 very well respected colleagues on this  Board.15 I' m really concerned that if we 16 don' t get a handle, that what we' re going to notice 17 is this one- size approach, that does not help 18 anyone, is actually going to make us  truly 19 irrelevant to this process.20 This Board has a lot  of 21 responsibilities and we know, through the  Rent 22 Stabilization Law, that there a lot of things  that 23 we can do.24 Right now I would like to  talk 25 about some of the things that we can do,  although 2 
2 they are not going to be part of my   proposal,3 Chair.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.5 MS. HOLDER:	New York City' s6 Rent Stabilization laws indicate that in 7 considering rent increases for stabilized 8 apartments, a number of factors should be  taken 9 into account, including economic indicators, and 10 research on both the well being of real estate  and 11 the tenants - the laws expressly designed  to 12 protect.13 However, again, this 14 one- size- fit- all approach for determining annual 15 rent increases - because there' s never anything 16 about a freeze but these increases - does not  allow 17 appropriate consideration of all of the  relevant 18 facts.19 As many tenant and community 20 groups illustrate in testimony, there are a  number 21 of buildings in the state of severe disrepair  that 22 have undergone extensive deregulation or  whose 23 owners are noncompliant with rules and  regulations 24 yet they' re still granted increases year after year 25 after year.2 
2 We are hoping that we can  return 3 to the idea -- this is going to be the third   year 4 in a row that we' ve asked that we go and return  and 5 evaluate a concept -- that perhaps there can  be 6 provisos that will allow the Board to set  annual 7 guidelines that are not only more fair  and 8 balanced, but also more flexible, allowing for  the 9 identification of specific circumstances in  which 10 it is agreed that rent increases are not  warranted.11 I don' t think that this is a12 stretch for my colleagues that represent  owners 13 because all the owners that they always  introduce 14 us to are purportedly the good owners, the ones  who 15 are spending money on maintaining their  buildings,16 purportedly the owners who actually do want  to 17 remain in this business.	So they would not be  hurt 18 by such a concept.19 Also, when we' re considering these 20 -- these -- all of these factors and looking  at 21 these reports, the one thing that we' re missing is 22 really understanding what are owners' income.  We 23 only know from the Income and Expense Report  that 24 owners are able to make a -- are able to get   return 25 of 36 cents on the dollar to deal with debt   service 2 
2 and what ends up being their  net.3 I would like to think that  that 4 actually is a great return. But if it' s not, then  I5 still submit that what is it that we' re going to  do 6 about it and I don' t submit that it' s increasing 7 the rents.8 Tenants constantly, we' re seeing,9 have not gained any ground in what are  their 10 incomes. Incomes for rent stabilized tenants  have 11 actually remained flat and in some instances,  for 12 part of the tenant population, have  actually 13 decreased.14 And so what are we to do? I   think 15 that when we look at the concept of  establishing 16 some provisos or adopting some provisos similar  to 17 what we' ve seen when we' ve dealt with the hotel and 18 SRO and rooming house population, we can look  at 19 the issue of deregulation.20 It has long been argued  that 21 owners who deliberately deprive themselves of  any 22 additional rents by withholding units from  the 23 market should not complain that existing rents  are 24 insufficient to earn an adequate return on  their 25 investment and as a result have been denied  annual 2 

2	rent increases.3
Similarly, residential hotels in 
4 which a majority of the units are used  as 5 commercial hotel rooms have been denied  rent 6 increases based on the financial well being  that 7 commercial units provide.8 Likewise, if an owner has 9 deregulated the majority of the units in  his 10 building, the new market rent apartments  should 11 produce a return on the original investment that  is 12 more than adequate.13 As a result, such buildings  should 14 not receive annual rent increases due to both  their 15 demonstrated financial stability and their 16 contribution to the erosion of the  affordable 17 housing stock.18 I think that' s a concept --19 ( Audience participation.)20 MS. HOLDER:	-- that we should 21 have further deliberations on.	It is not enough 22 for me to think that because some parts of  Corp.23 Counsel may not feel that this is something we  can 24 grapple with, that we should say that we  abandon 25 the concepts altogether.4 
2 Maybe this Board should look at 3 other ways that we would feel comfortable  with 4 trying to adopt some kind of proviso that would  at 5 least try to deal with this concept that there  are 6 owners out there that are actually being  well 7 compensated, that their income is up because  they 8 have a mix of regulated as well as  deregulated 9 units.10 Building conditions.11 In addition, buildings with 12 immediately hazardous conditions, as documented  by 13 HPD, are both in violation of the  Rent 14 Stabilization Law and the New York City  Housing 15 Maintenance Code.16 The State Division of Housing  and 17 Community Renewal also recognizes that  when 18 landlords are clearly not upholding their 19 responsibility to provide repairs and required 20 services, tenants should not be required to  provide 21 full compensation and issue rent  impairing 22 violations to that end.23 Clearly, in buildings with 24 uniformly poor conditions, the increases being 25 granted each year by this Board to cover  operating 2 
2 costs are not being used for their defined  purpose 3 and therefore should be withheld until such  time 4 that HPD can verify, through its own  inspection,5 that the violations have been  corrected.6 Again, a concept that deals  with 7 what we see and what people continue to  testify 8 before this Board year after year after year,  the 9 idea that their rents continue to  go up.	Tenants 10 who live in Queens or the South Bronx are  paying 11 anywhere from $ 1100 to $ 2000 a month on apartments 12 that have rent impairing violations but  knowing 13 that they have nowhere else to  go.14 Clearly, those landlords or 15 slumlords are taking advantage of this system to  be 16 able to get that additional income that' s in  their 17 pockets, but not reinvesting in the building  where 18 they are supposed to provide decent housing  for 19 their tenants.20 Why should those landlords be 21 rewarded?	Again, a concept that I think that  this 22 Board should be able to grapple  with.23 I' d like to think that we might be 24 able to talk about this as the season proceeds.  But 25 right now, Chair, my -- my proposal for  this 2 
2 process now, I' m looking at the proposed 2008 3 Apartment Order.4 I propose adjustments for renewal 5 leases, zero percent for a one- year renewal lease.6 ( Audience participation.)7 MS. HOLDER:	Point -- point five 8 percent for a two- year renewal lease.9 Proposed Vacancy Allowance for 10 apartments:	There shall be no Vacancy  Allowance.11 Proposed Supplemental Adjustment:12 There shall be no Supplemental  Adjustment.13 Proposed Equalization Allowance:14 There shall be no Equalization Allowance.15 Proposed additional adjustment for 16 rent stabilized apartment sublets:	Zero percent.17 Adjustment for loft units in  the 18 category of businesses covered by article 7 C of  the 19 MDL:	Zero percent for one year, point five   percent 20 for two- year increases.21 There shall be no Vacancy 22 Allowance in the vacant loft units  proposal.23 Proposed Special Guideline:	Fifty 24 percent above the Maximum Collectable Rent or  the 25 MCR.2 
2 And for the decontrolled units 3 proposal, fifty percent above the Maximum 4 Collectable Rent or MCR.5 Thank you.6 ( Audience participation.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do we have a8 second?9 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Second.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Languedoc 11 on a second.12 Any additional debate?13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes, Mr.14 Chair --15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. Mr.16 Schleider.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- I really can' t18 let a lot of that just lay  --19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What?20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I really can' t let 21 a lot of that just lay out there without  any 22 comment.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Then 24 don' t.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I shan' t.2 
2 Look, the income figures, Ms.3 Holder, are based on -- that you cited, I   believe,4 come out of the 2005 HVS study which is based   on 5 income collected during 2004 . Our own report was 6 very thin on the income part because of that  fact.7 So you' re citing data that is well dated.8 However, on the expense side,  that 9 comes out of data that' s been vetted by the 10 Department of Finance and is based on 2006  filings,11 far more current, which still show an alarming  rate 12 of expense increase.13 In fact, the NOI, that  percentage 14 that you quoted, yes, that' s for one year. But  if 15 you look at the past four years, it' s about  31 16 percent which is fourteen percent lower than  what 17 you just cited.18 So it' s an interesting case that 19 you' re making. There are some valid points to it.20 But to be fair and balanced, to use your term,   it 21 should be properly vetted.22 As I said, there are tenants  that 23 are very close to, you know, tragedy with being  one 24 paycheck away from disaster.25 And though you recognize it, I2 
2 don' t think you do it enough credit that there  are 3 landlords out there that are struggling.	And we 4 agree that the one- size- fits- all is a limited, at 5 best, approach.	However, it is what we have  to 6 work with. And what we' re mandated to do is to  set 7 a generally affordable rate of increase.	That' s8 it.9 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Chairman, Mr.10 Chairman, I' d like to also make a comment,  please.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure, sure.	Go 12 ahead.	Did you want -- go  ahead.13 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Chairman, I just 14 want to reiterate for the Board that last year  the 15 provisos that the tenant representatives raised 16 were addressed by Corporation Counsel.	And 17 Corporation Counsel wrote a very detailed  memo 18 clearly explaining why this Board doesn' t have the 19 authority to enact the types of provisos that  Ms.20 Holder is proposing.21 And specifically on the merits of 22 the proviso, as to the conditions that Ms.  Holder 23 relays to the Board, I just want to point out   that 24 there are many, many remedies for tenants for  those 25 situations, and that not giving rent increases  --2 
2 ( Audience participation.)3 MS. CRUZ:	-- by isolating those 4 types of owners is certainly not a solution  and5 will not make the conditions in those buildings  any 6 better.7 And as to the second proviso  that 8 Ms. Holder is proposing, again, that' s something 9 that is beyond the scope of this  Board.10 MS. HOLDER:	I would just like 11 to respond.12 I did not --13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One second.14 Just to clarify, Ms. Holder  did 15 not offer those two.	Other than discussing her 16 statement, it' s not part of her motion.17 MS. HOLDER:	Yes.	I did not  --18 I did not make a motion of a proviso. I said   that 19 there were two concepts.20 And I would just like for us  to,21 again, think about these concepts. And to  the 22 extent that someone thinks, on this Board,  that 23 this is really a job that we' re supposed to  take 24 seriously, we are really trying to protect  New 25 Yorkers.2 
2 I represent tenants.3 ( Audience participation.)4 MS. HOLDER:	You represent 5 owners.	If we really think that we could  do 6 something to help our constituencies or the  public,7 however that' s defined in our own realm of nine 8 members here, what I am suggesting is that we   can 9 take those comments and you can refashion them  any 10 way you choose.11 But the idea is that we would  have 12 a discussion and that we would try to find a way   in 13 which to try to really address this issue and  make 14 this work relevant.	Because as it has always  been 15 pointed out to me, you all do not represent the   bad 16 landlords.	And if that' s the case, then I don' t17 know why this is not something that this  Board 18 cannot try to address, however you want it to  be.19 You don' t have to rely on me to 20 draft it. Other people can come up with versions  in 21 which they think might be useful, something that  we 22 can say that we are trying to make sure that   our 23 mandate, which is to look at all this data  and 24 actually to do our job, might involve us digging  a25 little deeper than just issuing for just  wholesale 2 
2 increases. But it is a one- size- fit all approach.3 I would like to also just add  that 4 to the extent of what my colleague Steven said,  the 5 Income and Expense Study of 2008 , which does work 6 with 2007 information, showed that the  landlords'7 net operating income increased by 8 . 8 percent from 8 2005 until 2006 .	And net operating income is  the 9 amount landlords have left over after paying  all 10 the costs of operation and  maintenance.11 So what we see is that from  2000 12 -- it went up 35 . 1 percent in 2005 , 36 . 7 percent in 13 2006 .	And again, what landlords are seeing is  37 14 cents for debt service and profit. This is  more 15 than a decent return.16 Now, to the extent that there' s17 hardships, the same way that my colleague  Magda 18 says that there are a lot of options out there   for 19 tenants, I say there are a lot of programs and   ways 20 in which landlords who are suffering can also  have 21 their suffering addressed.22 ( Audience participation.)23 MS. HOLDER:	The difference 24 though, the difference is is that -- is that to   the 25 extent that tenants have redress with HP  actions,2 
2 to the extent that we have the anti- harassment law,3 I' ve had a number of tenants come up to me  talking 4 about the idea of withholding their rent or  the 5 idea of reporting, you know, these violations  and 6 actually taking a landlord to court, makes them  in 7 fear of being blacklisted.	Meaning that if they 8 were to lose that apartment that they are not  going 9 to be able to get other  apartments.10 It' s a real phenomena. We saw it.11 We know it. It' s been litigated. It is a huge  issue 12 for tenants here in New York  City.13 We do not have the same  resources 14 for tenants that landlords have in which to  address 15 these issues.	But, again, my challenge to  anyone 16 on this Board and especially to my colleagues  who 17 are public members, is to say well, then  propose 18 something else.19 We have done everything that  we 20 can.	Ron and I represent a constituency that   is 21 moving to have rent reform, is moving to make  sure 22 that the City Council and the State  Legislature 23 hears what their pains are.24 And I submit that we can easily  do 25 the same thing and their might be easily  things 2 
2 that we can agree to do here at the City and   state 3 level for landlords.4 But until that time in which  we 5 can really have a fuller discussion about that,  I6 don' t know what it is that this Board wants to  do.7 We have made some proposals. We have some  concepts.8 The landlord representatives seem to have a  few 9 concepts. But I don' t hear anything else.10 So to the extent that we  really 11 want to push this debate, I would ask that we   all 12 engage in some meaningful conservation about  it.13 And then one other thing about 14 income and affordability.15 We all know that our 2008  Income 16 and Affordability Study was looking at the  year 17 2007 .	But we all know that the first quarter  of 18 2008 has been devastating to everyone who lives  in 19 New York City.20 We have seen a  significant 21 downward trend in our economy here. And what  you 22 find is that homelessness levels and evictions  are 23 up.	There is -- real wages are falling and  there' s24 an escalating gross rent to income  ratios.25 So what we' re seeing is that 2 
2 despite the fact that we may have had a   mixed 3 report that shows income affordability, we all  know 4 too well, we read the papers, we listen to  the 5 financial news and we know that these numbers  are 6 obsolete given the negative impacts on the  economy 7 in the first three months of 2008 . And we know  it 8 from all parts of New York  City.9 So, again, we can continue to  go 10 through this whole process and continue to be  truly 11 dissatisfied and we may still end up  very 12 dissatisfied with how it comes out.	But I' d like 13 to think that there is still enough will and  desire 14 on this Board, from my colleagues, that we can  have 15 a meaningful discussion and try to really dig  deep 16 and be creative about the ways in which we try   to 17 grapple this -- grapple and handle all of  this 18 information and do what' s right for New York City.19 Thank you.20 ( Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me repeat 22 the motion.23 ( Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sit down.25 Quiet.2
