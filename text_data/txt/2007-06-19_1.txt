1	112	P R O C E E D I N G S34 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good afternoon.5 My name is Marvin Markus and I'd6 like to welcome you to this public hearing.7 This is one in a series of public8 meetings and hearings held by the Rent Guidelines9 Board annually to determine, pursuant to our10 statutory mandate, the allowable lease guidelines11 for a one and two-year lease in rent stabilized12 apartments, hotel stabilized units and also loft13 stabilized units.14 A couple of announcements to the15 members of the Board and the individuals who are16 here.17 The final vote on adjustments is18 currently scheduled and will be held at the Great19 Hall at Cooper Union, 7 East 7th Street in20 Manhattan on Tuesday, June 26th starting at 5:3021 p.m.22 In addition, the Board members have23 drafts of the Explanatory Statement and Findings24 in your packets, which will also be voted on at25 that point.4 
2 I think three, four years ago it3 became the practice due to - unrelated to the Rent4 Guidelines Board of New York City - a lawsuit to5 publish the Findings and have the Board itself6 approve the Findings simultaneous with the vote on7 the guidelines.	So that will be happening.8 Any comments, changes and additions9 should be submitted to the staff by June 25th if10 you 'd like to make that.11 We're going to call, as we always do12 at the hearings, alternating owner representatives13 and tenant testifiers and we will also, as soon as14 practical, take testimony from elected officials .15 I would also point out that at this16 point we're starting the hearing without any of17 tenant reps present, but we want to make sure18 everybody gets a chance to speak and doesn 't have19 too long a time.20 It's now 4:20.21 The first speaker is Angel22 Villavicencio, Vani Realty Corp .23 Mr. Villavicencio.24 Hold on. I should also point out25 everybody will get three minutes to speak.	You 'll2 
2 see a light or something over here at 30 seconds3 and hopefully you can wrap up.4 Go ahead.5 MR. ANGEL VILLAVICENCIO:	Yes.6 Good afternoon.	I am an owner of7 nine units in Queens.	I think we are here to find8 a fair raise because we have a lot of raise in9 water, electric and heat and taxes.	And the raise10 that we getting in the increase is not enough,11 enough to cover all our expenses.12 You know, we have a hard time trying13 to hold the property in good shape and I hope14 there will be a fair increase this year.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How many units16 you said you own, nine?17 MR. ANGEL VILLAVICENCIO:	Nine18 units.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	In Queens in one20 building?21 MR. ANGEL VILLAVICENCIO:	Yes.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How long have23 you owned the building?24 MR. ANGEL VILLAVICENCIO:	Five25 years.	I just refinance to cover but - - because7 
2	they broke up the boiler.	Cost me $20,000 .3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do you live in the4	building?5	MR . ANGEL VILLAVICENCIO:	No, I6	don't.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any other  8 questions?9 (No response.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 MS . CRUZ:	I have a question.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We do have some13 other questions.14 MS. CRUZ:	Are all of your units15 occupied by rent stabilized tenants?16 MR. ANGEL VILLAVICENCIO:	Yes.17 MS . CRUZ:	And are they long- term18 tenants or are they - -19 MR. ANGEL VILLAVICENCIO:	Yes.20 MS. CRUZ:	They are long- term21 tenants.22 And approximately what is your rent23 roll right now for that building?24 MR. ANGEL VILLAVICENCIO :	About 25	$95,000 a year .8 
2	MS . CRUZ:	And - -3	MR. ANGEL VILLAVICENCIO:	I just4 refinance.	Cost me, just the mortgage, about 825 - - $8,200 a month plus expense come to - -6 sometimes I have to put money from my pocket to7 cover the building .8 (Audience participation.)9 MS. CRUZ:	And last year did you10 have to spend your own money over the rent roll  to11 cover the costs?12 MR. ANGEL VILLAVICENCIO:	Yes, I13 did, when I have to replace the boiler.14 MS. CRUZ:	Twenty thousand dollars15 you said it cost you to replace the boiler?16 MR. ANGEL VILLAVICENCIO:	Yes.17 MS. CRUZ:	What would you suggest18 and recommend for the Board in enacting a  fair19 guideline that would cover your expenses?20 MR. ANGEL VILLAVICENCIO:	Yes .21 That's what I'm saying looking for a fair22 increase .23 MS. CRUZ:	What percentage would24 be - - would enable you to cover your expenses?25 MR. ANGEL VILLAVICENCIO:	To break4 
1	162 even maybe you have five-and-a-half, nine percent3 to the two years.4 And the other problem is that right5 now the tenants subleasing the apartment to other6 people and we have no control of that.	They have7 put four, five, six people in the apartment.8	(Audience participation.)9	MS . CRUZ :	Do you know, when the10 tenants do that, do they charge whatever rent the11 market will bear?12 MR. ANGEL VILLAVICENCIO:	Yes.13 They charge you - - they say, you know, I have a14 lease, you know .	They complain to DHR but nothing15 they can.	That 's it.16 MS. CRUZ:	So your tenants are17 actually making more money on the rents than you18 are.19MR . ANGEL VILLAVICENCIO :	That' s20correct.21(Audience participation.)22MS. CRUZ:	Thank you, sir .23CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Any additional24questions?25(No response.)
1	172	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3 Okay.	Mr. Jones, James Jones.4 I guess - - I've just been informed5 that we do have to allow repeat speakers.

We' re23 going to start now.24 MR. JAMES JONES:	The Judge told me25 to cooperate with the Community Organization.	And16

23 Regina Shanley;24 Followed by Adele Bender;25 Followed by William Stanford.
2 MS . REGINA SHANLEY :	Good3 afternoon.4 My name is Regina Shanley .	I'm a5 rent stabilized tenant and live about a mile and a6 half from here in Sunnyside/Woodside.7 Thank you for coming to Queens8 finally.9 I've lived in Queens all of my life10 and I think it's a great place to have grown up.11 For the most part Queens has been a borough of12 middle to lower income working people. My13 neighbors have been Firefighters and Police14 Officers, clerical workers and construction15 workers, teachers and bookkeeper, no millionaires.16 Until recently, Queens has gone17 pretty much unnoticed except when the Mets play18 well or the U.S . open is being played . Even19 politicians outside the borough ignored us.20 Recently however, and unfortunately, developers21 discovered this borough and are building on every22 available lot.	What is being built is not23 affordable housing.24 I've already told this Board, as25 have many other tenants, that I pay more than 702 
2 percent of income for rent.	I don' t know anyone3 who pays less than 40 to 50 percent of their4 income for housing .	This is having a very5 negative effect on the City that will continue and6 worsen if something doesn' t change .7 A highly paid executive at a8 corporation, Goldman Sachs, for example, cannot9 understand, or an administrative assistant that' s10 concerned about reports that the Transit fare may11 raise to $3.	The executive is clueless that an12 additional $40 a month - - $40 a month can be a13 stress on the budget of someone earning $28,00014 year, $28,000 a year.15 The idea that the administrative16 assistant would decide to leave the job and New17 York City when a seven percent increase is passed,18 would not - - would no more occur to him than the19 fact that his personality, rooted in vulgar, made20 the decision just slightly easier.21 The departure of anonymous22 administrative assistant is a loss to the City.23 It could have been avoided.	A doctor I saw24 regularly as a patient, a young, bright, caring25 skilled practitioner, moved to Denver last year2 
2 because he could buy a house for less than he was3 paying for a New York City apartment.	The4 departure of this doctor is a loss to his patients5	and to the City.	It could have been avoided.6 No business is guaranteed larger7 profits every year.	Businesses that make bad8 decisions lose money.	Landlords, however9 including mine, can have uncorrected violations10 for years and no one knows what is going on with11 their books.	They still get their increases.12 This Board was not formed to ensure13 profits for landlords.	It would not be14 unconstitutional to give them small, or even15 better, no increases.	That actually would make16 sense for millions of tenants who could have a17 stronger chance of staying in the City and helping18 keep New York functioning and	stronger.19 This Board can and should vote for a20 rent freeze.21 As a protest, I am handing a key to22 my house because as - - I will represent people who23 will not be able to stay and will be leaving the24 City.	So take this.25 (Handing.)6 
1	222	(Applause.)3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any questions?4 (No response.)5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .6	Adele Bender.	Are you here, Adele?7 MS. ADELE BENDER:	I'll try to talk8 faster and meet the three minutes, so listen up .9 My name' s Adele Bender. I'm a10 resident of Queens and Queens borough Coordinator11 for JPAC, Joint Public Affairs Committee for older12 Adults.13 People are paying outrageous rents14 like $3,000 for a one bedroom and $4,000 for a15 two-bedroom in Upper Manhattan. In Queens and16 other outer borough, $1,400 for a one-bedroom,17 sometimes even a studio, and over $2,000 for a18 two-bedroom .19 Just some managed to pay - - just20 about managed to pay, but often several people  are21 forced to share an apartment .	Some people work22 two jobs to pay the rent . For working people rents23 rise faster than their salaries.24 If the Rent Guidelines Board adopts25 a high rent increase proposed at the  preliminary7 
2 hearings, it will create further financial3 hardships for tenants and add to New York City' s4 affordable housing crisis. The demand and supply5 of housing at rents that average working people6 and seniors can manage to pay is tilting7 alarmingly away from tenants and placing tenants8 in an unfair and difficult situation.9 Not all people on fixed incomes such10 as the elderly and disabled qualify for SCRIE and11 DRIE.	In addition, there are medical and health12 related expenses that are not taken into13 consideration when applying for these programs and14 many of these people fall through the cracks.15 Many renters have to use their16 credit card just to purchase necessities such as17 food, medicine, and sometimes clothes. High rents18 contribute to the maxing out of credit cards.19 As rents keep rising, many tenants20 who cannot manage to pay these increases are21 trapped since they have no other option. There is22 no place else to go for them. Any other apartment23 a tenant may seek will probably call for a higher24 rent because they all already have paid the25 constant increases plus vacancy decontrol, not to2 
2 mention major Capital Improvement increases that3 are factored into the rent when the rents are4 increased .5 People are doubling up, tripling up6 to make ends meet or simply because homeless -7 nearly five percent of all rent households8 containing more than 1.5 persons per room . Queens9 has the highest rate of severely overcrowded10 housing units in the city.	For unsubsidized low11 income rents, this rate is nearly 5 .5.12 Tenants are not given tax rebates or13 any other tax advantages, as recently given to the14 homeowners.	Tenants just receive rent increases .15 While the City claims a huge budget surplus, there16 are cuts in NYCHA housing .17 While this is a Rent Guidelines18 hearing, NYCHA, Mitchell-Lama and all affordable19 housing, as we know it, will end up on the20 endangered species list .21 The ball is now in your court and I22 ask that you please take all of the testimony that23 the tenants have made into consideration and feel24 some sense of responsibility that the tenants of25 this City and freeze the rents and make life2 
2 bearable for the tenants.3 Thank you.4 (Applause.)5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker6 is William Stanford, Jr.;7 Followed by Speaker Christine Quinn.8	MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:	First of9	all, Marvin, that's Mr. X to you.10 The first - - you know, it's time for11 you to go, okay.	I'm surprised you're still12 here - -13 (Audience participation.)14 MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:15 especially after what you did in 2006.	I'm not16 going re-mention it, okay.	I'm surprised the17 Mayor, or I should say Michelle Bloomberg,  allowed18 you to say, because if it were up to me, you  would19 have been out the door a long time ago.20 (Audience participation.)21 MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:	Okay?	I22 don't tolerate that.	If I - - if I was the Mayor23 and found out or witnessed you do that, I  would24 have given you a flying clothesline off the  top25 rope courtesy of the Legion of Doom.10 
2 I don't play that. I mean where do3 you get off doing that?	Where do you get off4 challenging an employee?	Says the former5 Executive Director to a cuss fight. I'm surprised6 you didn't get any Board members to a cuss fight.7 Where do you get off doing that?8	You have no accountability, no9	liability, no accountability.10 (Audience participation.)11 MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:	I'm surprised12 you're still here 'cause if it were up to me, you13 wouldn' t be here.14 I recently heard about - - some time15 in 2006 I met a Brooklyn resident who was16 illegally evicted from her apartment by a City17 Marshal.	She was prohibited by law to re-enter18 that apartment, get her possessions. She had to19 appear in court several times, particularly20 yesterday.21 I sincerely hope with the decisions22 you make - because you're going to make a decision23 next Tuesday - your decision, your future24 decisions don't put her back out in the street25 because she's a middle-aged woman. She's like a10 
2 mother to me. And I don't think she should live3 out in the street because of a decision - - because4 of your decisions which don't meet the criteria.5 So please don't put her out on the street, okay.6 (Audience participation.)7	MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:	Because, you8	know, each year you ask for me rent.	It's like9 the tenants aren't paying the building owners, the10 landlords, the superintendents. They're just11 paying you.	So I guess you're taking less from12 the MTA, or you need more money to buy your daily13 dose of smack. I take it that' s what it is. You14 ask for more money because you need - - you know, I15 guess you took some lessons from Bruce Ratner as16 well.17 Remember, recently I said you should18 get together with Peter Kalikow .	Better, you can19 get together with Bruce Ratner, too considering20 you're all in the same - - you're all three peas in21 a pod.	I forgot about Bruce Ratner. You might as22 well get together with him too since he's good at23 putting people out in the street. I think he's24 done it better than you and Peter Kalikow25 combined.9 
2 So I think what I'll do I'll bill3 him as Bobby Heenan and bill you too as King Kong4 Bundy and Big John Studd. Why not?	I think the5 three of you can fit the bill.	You and Peter are6 bigger than Bruce.	Why not?	You and Peter can7 pass for King Kong Bundy and Big John Studd.8 Bruce Ratner could pass for Bobby Heenan. This  is9 the 2000 version.10 So Marvin, as I said before, you11 don't need any more rent increases. I'm  sorry,12 okay, enough is enough, okay. If the Queens13 residents have to pay $3,000 for an apartment,14 then there's something wrong here. I'm sorry.  I15 don't care how bad or good that apartment looks.16 If they have to pay $3,000 for that apartment, no,17 I'm sorry .18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you wrap19 up, please.20 MR . WILLIAM STANFORD:	Yeah, yeah.21 I'm going to wrap up.22 But $3,000, that shouldn't cover one23 month. That should cover ten months.24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you.2 
1	2 92 MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:	Yeah, thank3 you.	And remember, it's Mr . X to you, okay .4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 (Ms. Holder entered the auditorium .)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker7 is Council Speaker Christine Quinn.8 (Applause.)9	COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Thank you.10 First, I want to thank Chairperson11 Markus and the members of the Board for allowing12 me this opportunity to testify tonight before you.13 I think we all are abundantly clear14 that there is a real and significant housing15 crisis in this City and that is a fact that the16 Board has to be mindful of as you weigh your17 decisions about proposed increases as you vote18 this year .19 Now, you know all the facts, but20 just for the record I'll mention a few others, a21 few additional ones.22 Households with annual incomes at or23 below the federal poverty level who live in24 apartments are now paying 55 percent, on average,25 of their monthly incomes for rent.	It's a10 
1	302 staggering amount.3 Between '96 and 2005, moderate4 income tenants, which for the purpose of this fact5 we've defined as 200 percent of poverty level, saw6 their share of income going for rent grow from 347 percent to 40 percent.	And between 2002 and 2005,8 if you adjust for inflation dollars, stabilized9 tenants, their rents rose by eight percent while10 their incomes went down by 8.6 percent.11 Now, these are facts that are12 relevant as you make decisions.	And they're some13 of the facts that lead me to urge you tonight not14 to implement the proposed increases that you've15 put out there as your preliminary sense of where16 you're headed.17 And I'd urge you to be mindful of18 the fact of how challenging it has become for19 people to find affordable housing in the city of20 New York and urge you to not implement those21 proposed increases.22 I'd also urge you to play a more23 active role in the steps that are going on in the24 City right now around housing preservation .25 We recently passed a very important2 
1	312 law, The Safe Housing Act, that I think will go a3 long way in preserving affordable units and4 getting landlords to bring them up to the5 appropriate level they should be in.6 I think if the Board was to prohibit7 owners from collecting the guideline increases if8 there are a significant number of hazardous units9 outstanding, would be an important step forward to10 compelling more property owners to do the right11 thing and abide by the code.12 (Applause.)13 COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Now, I want14 to be clear: I don't think - - this is a15 significant - - this decision or if you were to16 implement this would impact a significant amount17 of property owners, because I don't think it's a18 significant amount of property owners who are out19 there letting their buildings deteriorate into20 substandard, dangerous conditions.21 But for those who are, we need every22 bit of help we can to get them to be in lawful23 compliance.24 I would also urge you to take the25 most aggressive steps you can to get landlords to2 
1	322 register apartments with DHCR and to take steps3 through preventing people from being able to4 charge the increases or other actions that would5 really act as a carrot on a stick to get property6 owners to register apartments, which they're7 required to do by law, but is not happening8 obviously at the rate that we think it should.9 So thank you for the time tonight .10 Thank you for listening and I urge you not to move11 on the proposals that are out there and to12 consider those concepts of those other two13 proposals and certainly the goals of the other two14proposals.15Thank you.16CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Thank you.17(Applause.)18CHAIRMAN MARKUS:We have some19questions.20Go ahead, Betty.21MS. ADAMS:	Yes.22	Ms . Quinn, I want to thank you for23coming.24COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:I'm sorry,25ma'am, I can'thear you.
2	MS. ADAMS:	Can you hear me now?3	COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Yes. That's4	much better.	Thank you.5	MS . ADAMS:	Thank you for coming6 and thank you for your service as our Speaker.7 We, of course, agree with you about8 the housing crisis in the City.	And I was9 wondering if you could also share with us other10 things that are happening.11 One of the problems in serving on12 this Board is that we hear about all of the13 problems with Mitchell- Lamas, with public housing,14 with Section 8 and on and on and on, which, of15 course, we're not empowered to do anything about.16 COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Right.17 MS. ADAMS:	So we' re generally18 asking what's happening within City government19 about enforcing some of the things that are20 already there?	Because we are concerned about21 deteriorating housing, housing that is a victim of22 ongoing violations from time to time.23 So in addition to the things that24 you have outlined, I was wondering if you could25 share with us - -6 
2 COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Sure.3 MS . ADAMS:	- - other things that are4 going on in City government to deal with  this5 crisis .6	COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Sure.7	Let me mention a couple of things.8	One, I referenced the Safe Housing9 Act .	That's a piece of legislation that the Mayor10 has - - the Council passed .	The Mayor singed into11 law.	We worked on that for a year .	We worked on12 that with the City's Department of Housing, with13 folks from the Rent Stabilization Association  with14 an array of different tenant advocates .15 And I think that Bill is really a16 historic overhaul of how the City does  code17 enforcement and maintenance work in the City.  And18 I really believe it will help get more buildings19 to the level they should be at and really  preserve20 housing in the City of New York.21 Two22 MS. ADAMS:	And that 's effective23 when?24 COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	The Bill25 was signed into law last week and it's probably9 
2 effective in 60 or 90 days, but I don't remember3 the effective date. In the near future. We could4 get back to you .5 MS. ADAMS:	Okay.6	COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Second,7 last week we obviously passed the City' s budget on8 Friday.9 One part of the budget which didn't10 actually get a lot of media attention is a $2011 million allocation in the capital budget. Part of12 that money is going to target federally subsidized13 units in the City of New York, many of which are14 expiring and landlords can opt out, sell them, et15 cetera.16 We wanted to try to create an17 incentive for property owners who may purchase18 that building. The part of these capital monies19 will be available if you want to purchase those20 properties if you're willing to keep them in the21 same rent affordability guidelines that they were22 in the federal programs. You could then qualify23 for a very low interest low through this money in24 the capital budget.25 We hope that will get those7 
2	apartments and units, which some have fallen into3	disarray, up-to-snuff but also be an incentive to4 try to keep those units at the affordable level .5 We recently also passed two pieces6 of legislation which the Mayor has signed into law7 which his Department of Housing was helpful on8 which they are similar karats, if you will, around9 Mitchell-Lamas, allowing Mitchell-Lama owners, if10 they stay in the program, to qualify for11 additional tax breaks and benefits that they had12 before been exempted from.13 So those are some of those things .14 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 Risa.17 MS. LEVINE:	We've heard testimony18 and we've heard reports about the fact that19 Policemen, Firemen, first responders, teachers,20 librarians, et cetera, public servants, are unable21 to afford housing in the City, that the income22 levels start so low - -23 COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Right.24 MS . LEVINE:	- - that housing' s25 just not affordable to stay in the City.4 
2 Is there any consideration for tax3 credits for those people that we want to keep, for4 those professions that we want to keep in the City5 that service the City?6	COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	You know,7 the biggest example of this right now is I mean is8 Police Officers.	Some of the other professions9	I'm not saying they're making a lot of money, but10 thankfully we came to a contract with the UFT, et11 cetera.	But obviously the most glaring - -12 MS . ADAMS:	They say they can't13 afford it.14 COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	But the most15 glaring example of this is around Police Officers .16 I mean there's no doubt about that.17 Certainly, you know, we would, in18 the Council, be very open to exploring what we can19 do to try to help keep City workers in the City of20 New York because it's obviously I think better,21 the more City workers who can live in the five22 boroughs, A, it's great employment opportunities23 for folks.	You're not ending up competing with24 people from outside of the City.25 But B, it makes our diverse force10 
1	382 more - - makes our workforce more diverse and more3 representative of those people the workers are4 just there to serve.5 So we would be open to consider any6 ideas. I don't know, since the Police specifically7 is ending up, is in arbitration now, whether or8 not that is under consideration.	But it's9 certainly something we would being willing to look10 at and consider in the months or timeframe ahead.11 MS. LEVINE:	Thank you, Madam12 Speaker.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any - -14 Thank you.15 COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Thank you16 all.17 MS. CRUZ:	I have a question.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oh, wait. One19 more question.	Sorry.20 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you, Speaker Quinn21 and thank you for coming.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Bring the mike23 closer, Magda.24 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you for coming to25 speak before the Board.2 
1	392 COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Sure.3 MS. CRUZ:	It's a great honor to4 you have you here.5 You indicated a great deal of6 concern for tenants that have a high rent to7 income ratio and you indicated the concern of the8 City government about maintaining affordable9 housing.	And you advocate for low increases in10 the guideline.11 But what do you say and the Council12 says to the property owners that we have heard13 testimony from and we have documentation about,14 that are not able to cover their basic operating15 and building expenses without some kind of16 increase?	If everything else is going up, how can17 you reconcile that conflict?18 COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Well, I19 think there' s a couple of issues here.20 I mean one, you said you've been21 presented documentation. And that, I think is22 obviously useful and helpful to you at the Board,23 right? Because you can look and really see what24 the set of facts are. I'm not saying anybody would25 be dishonest or disingenuous of their presentation
2 of the facts, but you can consider it.3 You also, you know, yourself as an4 owner rep, could probably see in there whether5 there' s places the owner could be doing something6 differently to do, you know, a little better with7 how the budget of that building works.8 That's not actually - - that amount9 of disclosure and information is not something10 that is generally available to the public or even11 to the city Council as we debate rent increases12 and debate the rent laws.13 So if there was the ongoing ability14 of property owners to make those types of15 financial information clear and publicly open, I16 think we could - - you know, there could be a17 different level of debate because everybody would18 be informed with the same information.19 Now, that said, we are certainly, in20 the Council, mindful that times are not easy21 anywhere and you can't be cavalier and say only22 this group is not doing well and all these other23 groups are doing extraordinarily well.	That' s24 part of the reason why when we passed the budget25 last week.
2 The Council was quite committed to3 getting a property tax cut that was deeper  than4 the one originally proposed by Mayor Bloomberg.5 His was a great first step .	We were able, working6 with his administration, to take that a  little7 further and to get it to a point where I hope  and8 really believe through the vast majority of New9 Yorkers, they won 't see their property tax bills10 go up.11 You know, the reality, of course, is12 part of why we did things like this idea of a  loan13 program to try to make it possible for people  who14 are purchasing buildings to have them  remain15 affordable but also bring them up-to-snuff.16 But I certainly would welcome the17 opportunity to have a more specific detailed18 discussed of this and have the same type  of19 information that you've been able to look at .20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you.21 COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Thank you.22 MR. SCHLEIDER :	Mr. Chair?23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	No more24 questions .25 Thank you very much.2 
2	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair?3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oh, we do. I'm4	sorry.5	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you, Speaker6 Quinn.7 I have to just put something out8 there .9 The staff for the RGB puts together10 a tremendous amount of research that documents the11 operating expenses for these buildings.	So it's12 not just verbal testimony from the landlords that13 we're using to derive our decisions.14 But some testimony has also gone to15 the fact that it's an income gap which goes16 hand-in-hand somewhat with affordability.	But17 we've called for an increase in SCRIE and DRIE18 COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	And we19 agree with you on that.20 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Which is great,21 but we'd like to see that expanded - -22 COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	I agree .23 MR. SCHLEIDER :	to help close24 this income gap to be an assistance to25 affordability.6 
2	COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Can I just3 interrupt.4 We agree with you on SCRIE and DRIE5 and actually the phone call I was one right before6 I came up here was strategizing about what more we7 could be doing to try to achieve some of those8 SCRIE and DRIE increases in the two-and-a-half9 days that are left in the legislative session  in10 Albany.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That would be12 terrific and we applaud you for that.13 COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	I can make14 no promises • cause15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	We understand.16 COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Right.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And also we've also18 called for a tenant tax relief and I have to19 applaud for your tenant credit this year.20 COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Thank you ..21 Didn't get it but thank you.	But22 we're still working on it.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I understand that24 but promising to or attempting to increase the25 SCRIE or attempting to increase the DRIE, the3 
2 unfortunate failure to get the credits for the3 tenants, it seems to then be pushing the subsidy4 or the impetus or the onus to close that income5 gap on the private landlords.6 And the other thing I want to say is7 my review of the tax rates - though it did come8 down seven percent or so on the rate, but the9 assessments went up and for rental properties, it10 went up over 21 percent.	So it's not a cut or11 that type of relief for owners of rental12 properties.	All it does it just slightly temper13 that rate of increase that we're going to see next14 year.15 We' ll take it, but it's not to be16 misconstrued as any sort of credit against or real17 panacea say that's going to really drop the18 expense ratio for these properties.19 But I applaud your commitment to20 trying to close the income gap and anything else21 that you'd like to bring to the table of how22 you're going to close the income gap would be23 appreciated.24 COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	Well, let25 me say a couple of things.2 
2 We're obviously going to do3 everything we can in the days, you know, to the4 rest of today, Wednesday and Thursday to try to5	get the SCRIE and DRIE passed in Albany.	If we6 don't - - if we aren't successful this year, we7 will continue to work on that.8 We weren't successful this year with9 the renters tax credit but, you know, last year in10 our budget efforts we proposed a series of tax11 cuts for small business. We didn't get them that12 year, last year .	This year we were able to get13 the Mayor to support us in those . And we' re14 getting those small business tax cuts this year15 and we're going to keep working on the renters tax16 credit in the same year.	Sometimes these type17 same year.18 Sometimes these ideas take more than19 one year to get implemented and put in place. You20 know, the tax - - property tax changes we made,21 some have characterized them as if they're going22 to be huge decreases in people's bills.	And that23 is	I've never said that and I want to24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I didn't say you25 did.6 
2 COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	No, no, no .3 I know you didn' t, but I worry that4 that's gotten out there.5 I would love to have wiped out the6 whole 18-and-a-half percent increase but it just7 didn' t seem responsible to do that in one year.8 We need to make sure revenues are coming in at a9 level high enough that we could actually sustain10 even deeper cuts. Because the worst thing to do11 would be to give a huge cut and then have to raise12 it again later .13 Our goal was to try to, given the14 incredibly convoluted assessment process, keep15 people' s bills flat. One, we think we obviously16 have to do, you mentioned other things we can be17 doing.18 We think what we all have to do,19 tenants, property owners, elected officials, is20 find a way to reform the assessment process in21 Albany because it really is a part of a22 dysfunctional, I think, process that is continuing23 to get people to have to pay more most years .	And24 that's something that I don't know how long it25 will take to actually do that but something that2 
2 we are committed to working on in the long term to3 get that changed . And I think that will hopefully4 be helpful to everyone involved in rental5 properties and other properties in the City.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.	Thank you.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8	COUNCIL SPEAKER QUINN:	All right.9	I1 m going to finally leave now.10	(Applause.)11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me read the12 next three names:13 Yarrow Regan;14 Followed by Naomi Avigdor;15 Followed by David Robinson;16 Followed by James Anderson.	That 1  s17 four names.	Sorry.18 Yarrow?19 MR. YARROW REGAN:	When I told20 friends and neighbors that I was coming to testify21 at this hearing today, most of them said, why22 bother.	The word on the street is that the Rent23 Guidelines Board are hard of hearing and are deaf.24 They will not hear what tenants say .25 They refuse to hear us. They will12 
2 not listen to the harassment and abuse landlords3 subject tenants to in order to force us out of4 rent stabilized apartments. They will not hear the5 cries of homeless children, the homeless elderly6 and the disabled.7 They said that the Rent Guidelines8 Board are blind because they refuse to see the9 homeless individuals that they created by10 continuing to raise our rents. They will not see11 the suffering they cause for tenants in Queens.12 They also say that the Rent13 Guidelines Board has no sense of smell because14 they do not smell the unwashed homeless who sleep15 on public transportation in doorways and vacant16 lots.	So why am I here today?17 It is not appropriate for rents to18 be raised and for rents to continue to skyrocket.19 Any rental increase at all is another nail in the20 coffin of the communities and neighborhoods of21 Queens.	To continue to increase rents is22 criminal.	Yet each year this Board hands more and23 more money to slumlords with hundreds and hundreds24 of violations on their proprieties in Queens.25 Has the Rent Guidelines Board come
2 to Queens to bury the tenants, kill us off or will3 they finally do the right thing by decreasing the4 rents?	Can we expect a miracle today?	Can we5 expect the Rent Guidelines Board to come to their6 senses?7 Thank you.8 (Applause.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 Naomi Avigdor;11 Followed by David Robinson;12 Followed by James Anderson;13 Followed by Richard Barr.14 MS . NAOMI AVIGDOR :	Hello .	I am15 an SRO owner on the Upper West Side.	I have one16 building, 16 units. Half of them SRO units, half17 of them apartments.	Nobody is a daily tenant.18 Everybody is permanent tenant .19 I'm coming here to propose a change20 in the way you evaluate the rent.	The U.S.21 Government, the HUD organization publishes every22 year Fair Market Rent for apartments and that' s23 based on the economic conditions and based on24 specific geographic location.25 In Manhattan right now for 2007,
2 that number is $998 a month for a studio, $1,0693 for a one-bedroom and so forth.	So my tenants,4 who pay less than that amount, basically pay5 unfair.	If I had a rent control tenant and he6 vacated his apartment, then I would be allowed  by7 law to set the rent for that apartment to the fair8 market rent that is based on the HUD number which9 mean $988 per month.10 So if I have a tenant that pays less11 than that for a similar space, that means that the12 tenant is paying unfair rent .13 So I would like to propose that if I14 have a tenant that pays less than the fair market15 rent, that is a number published by HUD and is16 widely used by government agencies for rent,  then17 I should get a tax - - a property tax credit for18 the difference between what that tenant pays and19 the fair market rent for that apartment.20 So if I have a tenant - - I actually21 do have a tenant that has a studio apartment and22 pays $527 a month.	And the fair market rent for a23 studio is $988.	I should get a property tax24 credit for the difference of that amount because  I25 should not be responsible for that difference on2 
2 my own.3 I'm just a private citizen.4 Somebody else should be responsible for it which5 is the whole community of the City.	The City6 government and city agencies should share with me7 the cost of giving somebody an apartment, renting8 somebody an apartment for less than the fair9 market value of that apartment.10 In addition, I think that when11 apartments becomes vacant, then the rent that12 should be allowed for the new tenant should be,13 again, the fair market rent established by HUD,14 not 20 percent.	Because 20 percent added to $50015 is still only $600, which is way below what it16 cost to run an apartment.17 So I suggest that vacancies should18 be set at fair market rent established by HUD.19 I also would like to suggest that if20 a tenant pays less than the fair market rent, than21 his rent increase should be accelerated, let's say22 $100 per month so within five years - - or 2023 percent of the difference or some number that is24 reasonable so within five years every tenant that25 below fair rent should pay what is fair to the2 
2 landlord and fair to what a government agency3 decided that is a fair number.4 The other thing I would like to5 speak to about is the difference between SRO6 raises and apartment raises, rent increases.	And7 I think there' s no distinction.	I don't know why8 you find out - - why you think that SRO tenants9 should get slower rent increases than regular10 tenants. The cost to me is the same.11 My property tax is $30,000 a year12 for 16 units. My heat bill is the same regardless13 of how my building is configured. The water bill14 is the same. The maintenance is the same. Pest15 control is the same. There's absolutely no reason16 to give lower increases for SRO tenants than for17 apartment tenants because it's the same cost to18 the owner. So the rents should be increased the19 same way. Whatever percentage you decided, it20 should be increased the same way.21 And percentages - - actually in my22 opinion, percentage is not enough. It should be a23 dollar amount. If my property tax went up by24 $3,000 last year, it should be divided by 16 and25 the minimum increase should be that much .2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Have you3 because of your status as an SRO, have you been4 getting, for last four or five years, zero5 increases; is that correct?6	MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Yes - - no, last7 year there was two percent.	Twice before that was8 zero and I think there was three-and-a-half before9 that, something like that, I don't remember10 exactly the numbers .11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank12 you.13 Any questions?14 Thank you.15 MS. HOLDER:	Yes, I have one.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.17 MS. HOLDER:	I know you stated18 earlier - and I just want to apologize, I didn't19 hear what you said - how many units do you have  in20 your building?21 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Sixteen units.22 MS. HOLDER:	And how many of them23 are SROs?24 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Eight.25 MS. HOLDER:	And then the other12 
2	eight are rent stabilized apartments?3	MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Three are free4	market and five are rent stabilized .5	MS. HOLDER:	We heard your6	testimony last week at the7 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Yes, we did.8 MS. HOLDER:	Oh, okay.	Thank you.9	MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	You're welcome.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	And everything12 involved is on this paper .13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' ll get the14 staff to take it and send it up.15 Thank you.16 David Robinson;17 Followed by James Anderson;18 Followed Richard Barr;19 Followed by Maude Boltz.20 James.	Oh, sorry.21 MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	Good22 afternoon.	My name is David Robinson. I work23 with Legal Services for New York City.24 And I'd like to call you attention25 to the written testimony that was submitted last10 
2 week by the Legal Aid Society and Legal Services3 for New York City.4 In that we detailed the devastating5 impacts of rent guidelines increases on rent6 stabilized tenants, especially low income tenants7 around the City.8 Before going to my testimony, ,I'd9 like to perhaps follow up on a suggestion that the10 previous speaker made and perhaps calling11 landlords, when they' re charging above the fair12 market rent, to lower all their rents to the fair13 market rent.14 (Applause.)15 MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	And perhaps16 that could go into a fund to support low income17 housing around the City.	And I have the feeling18 that there' s a lot more tenants paying well above19 the fair market rent than those paying well below20 it.21 (Applause.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What' s23 interesting is it would have been useful if we had24 called you before Christine Quinn so she could25 hear all this, because these suggestions don't go2 
2	to the powers that we have. But go ahead.3	MR. DAVID ROBINSON :	Right.4 Well, they actually unfortunately5 don't go to some of the powers the City Council6 has either .7 The power that you have really is8 immediately to not pass along the rent increases9 that have been done in the past .	Landlords have10 been doing very well .	The thing that I'd like to11 emphasize is number one, is that Legal Services12 has seen, and the Legal Aid Society as well, has13 seen the impact of rent increases .14 We have a project at - - have had a15 project up in the PATH, the intake facility for16 homeless families up in the Bronx . And we've17 interviewed hundreds of families and close to half18 of those families are there because the rents were19 too high.	And those are tenants that are corning20 mostly from rent stabilized apartments.21 And the cost to the City in terms of22 homelessness is great . The City pays close to23 $36 ,000 a year for each homeless family, not to24 mention the tremendous hardship that each of those25 families suffers in their lives, the lives of4 
2 their families and the ripple effect that all of3 that has.4 And I'd really like you to consider5 that impact, that is, the impact of a few dollars6 more in rent on a lower income family is far great7 than the loss of income to a business	person who8 is doing quite well.9 And as we all know, the landlords10 have many, many other ways of raising their rents.11 We have individual apartment improvement12 increases, Major Capital improvement increases,13 the vacancy increases.14 I'd like to call your attention to15 the fact that years ago we used to be up here16 arguing why five percent vacancy increases were17 far too high and occasionally they'd go up to ten18 percent. Now the landlords automatically get a19 twenty percent vacancy increase on each vacancy.20 So they are not entirely dependent on the vacancy21 the guideline increases that you are setting22 each year.23 I'd like to encourage you to keep24 all these factors in mind and to remember the25 impact that' s felt by each homeless family up in2 
2 the PATH.	And if you can contribute to a few  less3 homeless families up in the Bronx, that  would4 certainly be helpful.5 Thanks very much.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7	Any questions?8	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair?9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on.10 Adriene, go ahead.11 MS. HOLDER:	No.	I think Steve12 was before me.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Steve. Go ahead.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Your comment about15 the fair market rent, the Rent Guidelines  Board16 material and the Furman Center from NYU,  show17 median rents well below the fair market rent.	In18 fact, these median rents would have to  rise19 probably in excess of twenty percent in order to20 meet this fair market rent threshold that you  put21 out there.22 MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	Median rents23 also include those in public housing - -24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You're the one who25 said that the landlord should bring all the  rents10 
2 down to this level. I think maybe you should3 rethink this, because the median rents are already4 below the fair market rent so.5	MR . DAVID ROBINSON :	Median rents6 include those in federally subsidized and public7 housing as well.8	MR. SCHLEIDER :	And the Rent9 Guidelines Board staff, which looks at rent10 stabilized rents is even lower than the $900,11 which is lower than the fair market rent number.12 MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	They're well13 above what the low income rent stabilized tenant14 can pay.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	There' s - - never16 mind.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Adriene, go18 ahead .19 MS. HOLDER:	Dave, thanks for20 coming in and giving us your testimony today.21 In terms of the work that you all22 have done over at the PATH centers up in the Bronx23 where people come in who find themselves homeless,24 what' s the demographic?	What are those clients - -25 what are their - - I'm sorry, people can't hear me .9 
2 I'm kind of sick . I'm sorry .3 What are the demographics? What are4 the income levels and what neighborhoods are a lot5 of those folks coming from that are coming through6 PATH?7 MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	The majority,8 overwhelming majority are coming from boroughs9 other than Manhattan.	So I think it's important10 to remember that, that the impact of the rent11 stabilized increases really go to boroughs like12 Queens, the Bronx and major parts of Brooklyn .13 The demographics are of people of14 very low income. I would say the average income is15 $10, 000 to $15,000 a year, families of often16 single mothers with two to three children and17 often, very often working families, although some18 on public assistance.19 MS. HOLDER:	And we have some20 people who tell us that it's not the Board, it21 should not be the Board' s concern for people who22 actually are so low income that some people who23 come to us would say that there's nothing that the24 Rent Guidelines Board can do for those25 individuals .	And so I'm just wondering how you2 
1	612 would respond and the people that you work  with3 would respond.4	MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	I would say5 the same to what the Board could do for every,  you6 know, landlord.	I mean I don't think you have the7 responsibility that everybody has success in  their8 business.9	I think that what - - you certainly10 have a responsibility; low income people make up  a11 substantial portion of rent stabilized housing and12 the median income is about $25,000.	So most of13 the people that you're dealing with are people of14 low and, at best, moderate income.15 It is really not - - there are not16 that many wealthy people left in rent stabilized17 housing thanks to a number of factors,  including18 the high income rent decontrol.19 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair?20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure. Risa.21 MS. LEVINE:	I would just like to22 know how you're defining families . Is that a23 husband and wife? Is that a single parent  family?24 Can you break that down a little bit .25 MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	I was defining10 
2 families in terms of the - - in terms of the intake3 facility in PATH is anybody other than single4 adults.	Well, it's actually really anybody with5 children so it's someone with children that6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So it's a7	household.8	MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	Household.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	As opposed to10 family.11 MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	One household12 in this case with children.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.14 MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	Although15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider.16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Just one more17 thing on the homeless situation, which is a18 horrible situation.	Nobody is discounting that or19 you're telling you that you're not spot on when20 you discuss it.21 But we had testimony before the22 Board that the, I believe it was about $35,000 a23 year is spent per homeless individual by the City24 which is well above the median income that you25 just cited for these at-risk rent stabilized10 
2 families.3 Do you see any further advocacy for4 your position to convince the City maybe it would5 be better spent as a transfer payment to these6 rent stabilized families rather than encouraging7 the perpetuation of the homeless shelter system or8 is there some way to mix these funds so that we're9 not spending as much on the homeless shelter10 because we're subsidizing the rent stabilized11 families in their homes?12 MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	Well,13 certainly an increase in subsidies and an increase14 in the availability of housing through15 construction of government supported housing would16 certainly go a long way.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, no.	I'm not18 talking about that. I'm just talking about what19 the City is spending now on the homeless, on the20 homeless shelter system per individual per21 homeless family is $35,000 a year roughly.22 You' re talking about an at-risk23 family that has a median of about $25,000 a year24 and who' s on, say the verge of homelessness,25 according to your testimony, unless I2 
2 misunderstood you.3 Instead of allowing that family to4 fail in a rent stabilized apartment, would you5 recommend that the City transfer some of those6 monies that would potentially be spent on them7 within the homeless shelter system to support them8 in site or on site within that rent stabilized9 apartment?10 MR . DAVID ROBINSON :	Well,11 certainly support when they're on site in the rent12 stabilized apartment would help.	But I think part13 of what I'm trying to convince you is that what14 you can do is do your little part in preventing15 them from getting there by keeping the rents - -16 (Applause.)17 MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	as low as18 possible. I mean there are - - there are obviously19 many, many factors that go into all of this many20 of which are out of your control.21 What' s under - - you know, the one22 thing that' s under your control is the level of23 rents that are set.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, I'm25 seeing2 
1	652 MS. HOLDER:	And I think - - just3 to add to that real quickly, Steve.4 And I think that the City' s argument5 - although it's necessarily one	I mean I do6 appreciate, Steve, your question.	I mean I think7 that it is true that government could be doing8 more.9 I think the City' s response might be10 that they're trying to do that through their HSP11 program which is supposed to be a supplement that12 I know as advocates we, you know, have some13 questions about the program and how successful14 overall it's going to be for low income families15 to maintain their housing.16 But the City would definitely say17 that they are making a huge investment in that18 program and I think the state would say that19 they've made a big investment through their PEP20 programs which is also a way in which they believe21 that they're helping to subsidize and keep low22 income New Yorkers in their apartments.23 And a lot of that was, I think24 provoked and through a lawsuit that the Legal Aid25 Society bought called Jiggetts, which had to deal2 
1	662 with the adequacy of the shelter allowance for3 people in public assistance.4 I think though that what Dave says5 is key though which is that, you know, we're6 talking about what the Board can do. But I'm not7 necessarily here to be an advocate for government8 but I think the government thinks that they've9 done some things . And I'm just hoping that as all10 parts of this whole process, that we will take11 responsibility for what it is that we can do here12 during this season in terms of the Rent Guidelines13 Board increases .14 But I do think that the City, if15 they were here right now - and I'm sure they'll be16 coming in later on - would argue that they are17 doing some things.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So they have an19 inadequate solution and so do we is what you're20 saying.21 Go ahead.22 MS. HOLDER:	I'm not going to be23 caught - - well, let me just say I didn' t say that24 they have an inadequate solution. I think that25 they have a solution - -2 
1	672	MR. SCHLEIDER :	It's adequate?3	MS. HOLDER:	that a lot of us4 are not finding to be completely adequate and it's5 not helping it. It's not helping6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Well, not7	completely adequate would mean inadequate.8	MS. HOLDER:	Well, yeah, but I  9 didn' t say that. But all I'm saying is that the10 City - -11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I said it .12 MS. HOLDER:	Okay. That's fine.13 And the City would say that they are14 trying to address the problem.	And I think that15 there are better ways in which we can all address16 the problem.	And I think we need to all take17 responsibility of the fact that we' re a part of18 the issue here in New York City and the Rent19 Guidelines Board has a role to play. 2O		(Applause.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.22 MS. HOLDER :	Even if that role is23 - - quite simply, even if there' s nothing else that24 people on this Board believe that they can do then25 to vote in lower guidelines this year, that is a21 
2 significant role that we play.3 (Applause.)4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any additional5 questions?6 (No response.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 MR. DAVID ROBINSON:	Thank you.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Anderson,10 James Anderson;11 Followed by Richard Barr;12 Followed by Maude Boltz;13 Followed by Ida Pollack.14 Mr. Anderson, behave yourself.15 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	I'm here again16 because I obey your power, authority and bosses.17 You appointed of the Mayor and if somebody blame18 you, just stop at him.	We come to bring facts,19 evidence and proof about anything wrong about  real20 estate business, not to blame nobody.21 If we blame, we must blame22 legislators of the City and state because they are23 lazy and different people.	City legislators do24 not make the law, change the law.	And state very25 busy to oppose the Governor and who' s criminal,10 
2 this Joe Bruno, this bum and other Sheldon Silver.3 They don't care nothing.4 The Mayor lost the election. Better5 to lost the election and wait to die. Or if they6 are here to keep in the neck of another to see who7 gets more ahead.8 Because we have discrimination.9 According to the Constitution, equal rights for10 the bum to the billionaire .	When the landlord11 want to give lease one year, tenant says two year.12 They says it should two year . So how take another13 man more power than other.	If they fight, divide14 the year in half. Not one year, not two year in15 half so .16 And we don't have homeless. Lot of17 people says all the homeless, 34,000 are in the18 shelters.	Man who is chief of the shelter been19 here and declare how many people.	And the City20 and state do not make anymore affordable houses.21 They rise them salary. They take vacation and22 appointed more Commissioners, Deputy Assistant23 Commissioners.24 We have in New York City 4525 Commissioners and United States, yes about 142 
2 departments, U.S. Government.	So we made need3 5,000, 6,000 more Commissioners.	And they receive4 $171,000 .	And majority crooks, stole the money.5 They don't working nothing anyway. And this6 problem go forever.7 And I hear lot of crazy story, open8 your books.	When we going to the court, judge has9 the books, District Attorney has the books. But10 the bum tenant to say open the books, doesn't make11 sense.	When the man buy the building, first12 paper, deed of the building. Insurance of the13 building, registration. Why do you want to  open14 the book? I cannot understand. If somebody tell me15 open the books, I tell him open your legs, case16 closed.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oh .18 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	I'm sorry.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I was waiting for20 that.	I know your line .21 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	I talking22 truthful.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.24 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	All right, all25 right, all right, all right.2 
2	(Audience participation.)3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	He doesn' t have4 a right to say that. You don't know what he's5 going to say.6	MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	I'm sorry.7 I'm stupid.	I'm sorry.	Ladies and gentlemen, I8 talk with accent.	I have wrong pronunciation.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No. It wasn't10	an accident.	We understand you.11	MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Maybe only12 this word or another be wrong.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. You done?14 Thank you, Mr. Anderson.15 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Ms. Zero, no16 question?	Mr. Zero?17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No, no questions.18 Thank you.19 MR.

2	MR. JAMES .ANDERSON:	That's easy for3	me .4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you, Mr .5	Anderson.6	MR. JAMES .ANDERSON:	Have a nice7	day and nice tight - - nice night.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Barr.9	MR . RICHARD BARR:	Good afternoon10 and thanks for taking my testimony.11 I was signed up last week, but I had12 to leave before you called my name.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sorry.14 MR. RICHARD BARR:	I firmly believe15 that you've got to get away from a16 one- size-fits-all approach to these rent17 increases.	The only landlords who come here year18 after year that you hear from are the ones who own19 five or ten units in low rent neighborhoods  and20 are struggling and maybe not turning a profit.21 And those people perhaps if they22 need a couple of points here or there to cope  with23 their own rise in expenses in order to make  a24 living, that' s one thing.	You never hear from the25 ones who own hundreds or thousands or maybe more10 
2 units in high rent neighborhoods3 (Applause.)4	MR . RICHARD BARR :	- - many of whom 5 are able, when tenants leave, to do what they  need6 to do take an apartment out from under rent7 regulation.	And once it hits market, depending  on8 the neighborhood, depending on the building, might 9 get 50 percent more in rent when it's deregulated, 10		100, 200, 300.11 I live in Manhattan . If I told you12 what my - - the difference in rent between the13 regulated units and what my landlord can get  when14 a tenant leaves and he deregulates, I think  your15 hair would stand on end and that would include  the16 landlord representatives.17 These people do not need that18 increase from their regulated tenants .19 (Applause.)20 MR. RICHARD BARR :	If their rents21 - - if their expenses go up two percent, three22 percent, four percent, five percent even,  they're23 making so much more in profits from the high  rent24 tenants and the deregulated tenants if they have  a25 significant number in their building. They don't11 
2 have to take it out of the hide of the struggling3 rent regulated tenants who are paying rent instead4 of buying food .5 And, please in an era of6 sophisticated computer breakdown, you do not have7 to approach this with a one-size-fits-all approach8 every year and give the person who' s not making9	any profit and the person who' s making huge10 amounts of profits the same rent increase every11 year.12 The latter does not need that13 increase from you.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 (Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Maude Boltz;17 Followed by Ida Pollack;18 Followed by Thomas Diana;19 Followed by Susanne Schropp.20 Ida Pollack.21 A VOICE:	Who' s first?22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Maude Boltz is23 first.24 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Good evening,25 Rent Guidelines Board.10 
2 I know you have your various lists3 for what oil is and what taxes are and so forth in4 terms of, you know, various charge and numbers and5 so forth .6 Well, I don't have any numbers. I7 don't know how much my oil cost this year. I know8 my insurance is going to go up. I don't know what9 I paid. I don't know what my water bills were and10 I don't know what some of my other contingencies11 were because I had cancer this past year and I had12 radiation and chemo.13 And the year before I had three14 double eye operations and I couldn't really see15 correctly until July when I got glasses and then16 they weren' t right.17 So I've had two years where I've18 been in this fog except to pay my bills which I've19 been able to do, thank God.20 Now, I have what I would call - - and21 I've become a little tougher every year I come22 here . I have what I would call an unaffordable23 building.	I don't know about unaffordable24 housing, but I know about unaffordable buildings.25 Unaffordable buildings are where you2 
2 don't have the money to keep a car or pay the3 insurance for it or where you can't pay health4 insurance or where you have to sort of sweat it5 out in case there's going to be some big major6 expense that you're not going to be prepared for7 because you don't have more than maybe $3,000 in8 the bank and this is for over 20 years.9 Now, I just happen to be tough10 enough because my background 1  s in the arts to know11 how to survive. And I had to live under12 circumstances as an artist where I had to pay13 unaffordable loft rents. So I know both sides of14 the coin.15 And I just want to say that the only16 thing that saved me for one were vacancy17 allowances because the person before - - who owned18 the building before me did nothing to these19 apartments and the tenants didn't do anything20 either.	So if I wanted to rent for anything, I21 had to fix them all up the best I could. And in22 the beginning all I could afford was paint.23 So now the building' s looking pretty24 good. But it's been like sweat equity almost. If25 you worry about how the City can afford to give2 
2 back to poor tenants, think about what the artists3 did in SoHo where they turned that whole community4 into a money-maker for the City with their own5 sweat equity.6 Think about what the artists are7 doing in Williamsburg and think about what the8 artists are doing in DUMBO where they can hardly9 afford the rents anymore and they have only been10 there a couple of years and they're like moving on11 because they can't afford it.12 But they attracted money to those13 areas and they attracted business to New York14 through the galleries.	And if you want buildings15 rehabbed, turn over more buildings to artists and16 they' ll fix them up.	And guarantee them a level17 rent and you'll also take care of low income18 people at the same time 'cause they're hard19 workers .20 Now, one of the main things we're21 talking about here today is taxes. I have a friend22 who's an artist that lives in SoHo. In 1968 he23 paid $168,000 for that building together with24 other people, and through their sweat equity fixed25 it up.2 
2	Several years ago he paid $168,000,3 together they did, in taxes.	Now that 's over 404 years. I think the City' s doing well and I think5 they can afford to take care of everybody, both6 the poor people and the small landlords.7 Thank you .8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you .9 Any questions? One question, Maude.10 MS . HOLDER :	Yes .	I actually - -11 I'm sorry .12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Boltz,13 Maude, Maude , we have a question.14 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	I can't answer15 too many.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The reporter,17 you need to sit down .	Reporter lady, you need to18 sit down.19 REPORTER LADY:	I don't have any20 other sound other than - -21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. But you22 can't ask questions until we're done .23 REPORTER LADY :	I just needed her24 name .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay . Thanks .10 
2	Go ahead.3	MS. HOLDER:	Hi .4 Thank you for corning today and I5 hope that you're doing better.	I had seen you6 during the season.	It's good to see you now.7 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	A little louder,8 please.9	MS. HOLDER:	I'm sorry.10	So how many buildings do you own?11	MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	I own one building12 and that's enough.13 MS. HOLDER:	And how many units are14 in that building?15 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	There' s eight and16 I live in one. In fact, there's another building17 - - I have a particular situation where I have an18 illegal tenant who moved in when his grandmother19 died.	And he's been there now for a year and a20 half because that' s how long the courts take to21 try and get somebody else.22 And he's paid no rent for ten months23 and he' s still there and he' s had two decisions24 against him and the rent is $400. Go figure  why25 this guy moved when his grandmother died when  he12 
2	hardly ever came to visit.3	MS. HOLDER:	And all your units are4	rent regulated?5	MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	They're all6 stabilized.	I'm not above market, you know, I'm7 not in a market, free market rent roll at all.8 And I've always been very kind and9 generous in terms of rent raises for the people10 who were in place and I always counted on the11 vacancy rents in order to cover what I thought12 would be my contingencies which always seem  to13 come up to be more to take my breath away than14 what I expected.15 MS. HOLDER:	And what part of the16 City is your building in?17 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Well, it was18 formerly Red Hook and now it's part of Carroll19 Gardens.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	They changed the21 name.22 MS. HOLDER:	Oh really?23 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Yeah. But when I24 moved in there, it was not what it is today. And25 you know, for me it's been a case of, you know,6 
2 how do I manage it, how do I survive, which I am  a3 survivor so I did.4 And only the past few years have I5 had a little bit of a cushion. But I don't - - i6 have had no big vacations, no fancy vacations,  no7 fancy clothes.	I used to dig in the bins on8 Chambers Street for clothes for the first 15,  209 years.10 MS . HOLDER:	And how long have you11 owned your building?12 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	It's been over 2013 years.14 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.15 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	And also, I can't16 leave New York because my fists have been up for17 forty years and I can't get them down to buy a18 ticket out of here.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you so much. It's21 good to see you. Thank you.22 MS. CRUZ:	Could you tell us - -23 excuse me.24 Could you tell us on average how25 long your tenants have been in your apartments.
2 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Well, I have two3 longer term tenants.	Now, the people - - the rent4 control people who were there, they were there for5 like 30, 35 years, you know.	And as they left, I6 could get the rents up.7 I just barely manage to stay a step8 ahead of things. In fact, when I first owned the9 building, they threatened to cancel my insurance10 if I didn't come up with $25,000 worth of11 electrical work in ten days. And I managed to12 finesse that by going down and getting a loan to13 my surprise. And they're paying two mortgages when14 the rent was paying - - getting passed paying the15 first one.16 So, you know, they have - - the older17 tenants have all left except this lady who died a18 year and a half ago and she was paying just over19 $400 a month rent.20 MS. CRUZ:	And now her grandson is21 paying zero.22 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	And everything is23 stabilized.24 MS. CRUZ:	And now her grandson is25 paying zero.
2	MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Pardon?3	MS. CRUZ:	Now her grandson is4	paying nothing. You said you have a - -5	MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	No, he paid6 when he moved in, when I first went to court, he7 had to pay four month's rent and he now owes ten8 month's rent.9	MS. CRUZ:	How does that impact you10 when you have to go to court with one of your11 tenants - -12 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Well, it impacts13 me in this sense, like the guy has people coming14 all night long.	He' s got two pit bulls and he's15 trying to lay claims for things that weren' t even16 his prerogative like the backyard.17 And he also had formerly been in18 probation and recently he had, like a month and a19 half ago, he had - - he decked somebody in the20 hallway and the Police came and cuffed him but I21 don't know that they're doing anything about that.22 Now, this is a guy who' s claiming23 that he lived there when he didn't live there for24 two years. I've had eight witnesses. And he' s25 getting all these breaks because of the courts.10 
2 MS. CRUZ:	But my question is how3 does - - taking a tenant to court or if a tenant is4 failing to pay you rent, how does that impact on5 your financial situation?6	MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	My contingency7 my contingencies fee is that I can't afford to8 rehab that apartment when he moves out because it9 costs me $10,000 so far for the lawyer and no10 rent.	So, you know, it's - - you know, this is a11 small landlord's perspective, and like when they12 said maybe there should be two measures and so13 forth.14 I'm glad I survived. I'm glad I'm15 there. I've gotten use to the neighborhood.	I'm16 finally getting back to some artwork. I'm having a17 ball doing that. And that is just like, you know,18 that' s like bringing everything up roses just the19 fact that I'm doing some work.20 But this thing is bringing - - this21 thing is obviously bringing me down because it's22 taking away, which, at this point, should be mine,23 just like in SoHo that I was talking about. After24 living there and fixing up the building and25 running it and doing everything and doing his7 
2 artwork and showing shows for free of other3 artists and so forth, they're not stuck with a tax4 burden that's making him crazy because he is not5 the billionaire who moved in and brought the6 stores and brought the fancy lofts and so forth.7 He's a settler. He's a pioneer. He's one of the8 original guys.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,10 Maude.11 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.12 (Applause.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We're going14 Ida Pollack;15 Thomas Diana;16 Then Susanne Schropp; and17 Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum.18 We had called the other people, Ms.19 Gotbaum, so we' ll take them.20 Ida Pollack .21 Thank you.22 MS. IDA POLLACK:	You know, I might23 ask the people on the Board to get close to their24 mikes because there are some people who have25 hearing problems and we don't hear you.10 
2 I'm Ida Pollack .	I come from3 Queens and I've been a tenant activist for many4 years and I've come here for many years .5 And the only face that looks6 familiar to me now is Marvin Markus . So you're old7 and Adriene .8 It's another year and it's another9 assault on the more than million rent stabilized10 tenants in this City .11 (Audience participation. )12 MS . IDA POLLACK:	This Board,13 which is made up of landlords, so-called impartial14 public members , and two tenant reps, all appointed15 by the Mayor, is responsible for the growing16 number of homeless people in this City.17 Thirty-five thousand is the18 estimated figure and that includes 9,000 families,19 many with children, of school age and younger.20 We' re not talking about good natured or bad21 natured little landlords .	We' re talking about a22 system of rent control and rent rate - -23 stabilization that' s sanctioned by law .24 These hearings take place only25 because the law says that there have to public2 
1	872 hearings before any rent decisions can be made.3 I wonder how many would be up there if there was4 not a law which demanded that you be here .5 Can anyone imagine the kind of rent6 gouging that would take place if they could get7 together quitely and some back room, maybe even in8 the Mayor's office.9 Nine people, really only seven,10 decide for hundreds of thousands of other people,11 how much of their minimum wage income or even low12 medium income should go to keep a roof over their13 heads.14 They vote to increase.	The vote to15 increase is always 7-2.	Only occasionally or16 maybe only once do I remember that a public member17 will suffer a twinge of conscious and vote so that18 the vote comes out 6-3. But never an equal vote or19 never a pro-tenant vote.	And anyway, the Chairman20 there, the Chairman can always make the vote come21 out the right way.	Okay.22 You know, the Controller of this23 City, William Thompson, in yesterday' s news there24 was a little item, just made a remark and called25 for a freeze on all rent.2 
1	882	(Applause.)3	MS. IDA POLLACK:	And incredibly4 the Mayor's office sent an answer to William5 Thompson.	And the Mayor's message was that we6 don't get involved in the Board' s business.	This7 is the Mayor who got involved up to his eyeballs8 in building a new stadium that most rent9 controlled and rent stabilized tenants could not10 afford to go to.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap12 up.13 MS. IDA POLLACK:	I'm wrapped up.14 There shall be no increase and there15 shall be a freeze.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 (Applause.)18 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Question .19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question. Ida,20 Ida Pollack. Ms. Pollack, we have a question  from21 one of the two.22 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I'd like to ask23 you, Ms. Pollack, you said you've been tenant24 activist in Queens.25 What have you heard from the tenants4 
2 about the effect of a higher spread between  one3 year and two-year increase?	Have you heard that4 that' s had an effect on tenants?5 MS . IDA POLLACK:	Talk closer to the6 mike.7 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Have you heard that8 the higher spread that the Board has allowed  in9 recent years between a one-year and a two-year10 increase, have you heard anything about  whether11 that's had an effect on people?	Are people -- do12 you know people that are choosing to opt for a13 one-year renewal lease because they can't  afford14 the increase for a two-year?	What has been your15 experience?16 MS. IDA POLLACK:	Most people that17 I know in the development that I live in and in - -18 I also belong to a Queens group, one would prefer19 a two-year lease because there's a sense of - - a20 greater sense of security that you have a  lease21 for two years .22 However, none of them talk about23 anything except the fact that there should not  be24 another increase.	The wages don't go up in the25 same way that does the tenants.	Every single year2 
2 there's an increase.	Every single year .	And you3 mean to tell me that they're always on the  brink4 of bankruptcy and they need this increase  to5 survive?	That 's a lie, you know .6	Any other questions?7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No thank you .8	(Laughter & applause.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thomas Diana;10	Followed by Susanne Schropp;11	Followed by Betsy Gotbaum.12 Mr . Diana.13 MR . THOMAS DIANA :	Thomas Diana .14 Hi .	There' s been two great events15 in the last 14 years or so that I've been on the16 Board. Ms. Adams provided one last year,  because17 Scott stringer came down here and he was  shooting18 his mouth off about getting even with  the19 landlords and he was going to teach them all  a20 lesson .21 And Ms. Adams started - just for the22 benefit of the people who weren 't there - turned23 around and asked him, well, what is your plan?  And24 there was silence. Scott Stringer didn't even  have25 a plan to stick it to the landlords . That is - - I
2 mean everybody in the street has got a plan . But3 when Ms . Adams put it to Scott Stringer to ask him4 what his plan was, he didn't even have a plan .5 How can you not have a plan, you know, for it.6 The other great event was, a few7 years ago I came here with a big stack of SCRIE8 applications.	This is a very simple application9 that the senior citizens put in. If your income is10 under, I think $26,000, the City will pay the11 increases for you.12 I've given away a total of three13 applications in seven years, okay. One time one14 public member asked a woman, who was giving15 testimony, why don't you fill out a SCRIE16 application.	She said I'm already on SCRIE. So17 she was paying no increases.18 The other thing is you keep talking19 about items that don 't come up.	Cheap apartments20 do not become vacant. If you have a $400 a month21 apartment or a $300 a month apartment, believe me,22 it is never becoming vacant . There will be a23 family member coming out of the woodwork who will24 move in there, okay .25 I have met tenants at the offices on
2 Beaver Street in Manhattan and she said, oh, every3 year I send a letter to my landlord to say that my4 daughter lives here.	And the other tenant told5 her, no, you can only pass the apartment on once.6 She says, okay, from now on I'll send a letter7 saying that my granddaughter actually lives in the8 apartment.9 Now, homeless is not caused by our10 apartment going up another $20, okay. It's caused11 by guys like this (indicating.)	You guys remember12 this guy?	He' s won the $100,000 from the City.13 He smoked up his $30,000 medical suit that he got.14 He got a medical malpractice suit and won $30,000.15 He lives in a Section 8 apartment16 with his girlfriend.	He just got $100,000 and17 he' s living in a Section 8 apartment.	That money18 should be going to working people, not to people19 like him.	And there are thousands more like him.20 There's where the money is going to, okay.21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. THOMAS DIANA:	When I watched23 the news one day, they spoke about some little old24 lady who' s saying that she couldn't afford her25 rent and they were fixing up the apartment and so2 
1	932 forth.	And as the camera panned through her3 apartment, I saw mountain bikes, i saw weight4 lifting equipment, i saw video game Atari  systems5 over there.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you wrap up,7	Mr. Diana.8	MR . THOMAS DIANA:	- - yet she's9 saying oh, she's a single	single10 B O - something-year old woman . You got to listen to11 what they say not always what they want you  to12 hear.13 Thank you.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .15 Thank you .16 (Applause.)17 Susanne Schropp.18 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	Honorable19 members of the Board, my name is Susi  Schropp.20 I'm a rent stabilized tenant at 821 Saint Mark's Place in Manhattan and a member  of22 the Shalom Tenants Alliance, a group of  tenants23 living in over 120 buildings owned and operated  by24 the Shalom, also known as Ohebshalom family .25 In the past seven years I've9 
1	942 testified about the conditions rent regulated3 tenants like me face. This year my income is at4 the same level as it was in 1997 .	For the past5 nine years I have not been able to afford health6 insurance .	I've begun to buy groceries with my7 credit card until I receive my next income .8 Last week I used savings set aside9 for a dental treatment to pay quarterly income10 taxes . It hasn 't always been this way and I have11 had to tighten my belt over the years .12 My market rate neighbors are facing13 the same issues.	Many of them complain of the14 unrealistically high rents and how they will not15 be able to afford to live here much longer.16 I'm also reporting on another17 milestone in the Shalom Tenants Alliance' s very18 successful campaign to preserve affordable housing19 while battling a notorious and vicious landlord20 family .21 This year Henry Shalom, who operates22 out of California, was sentenced with five months23 of jail time by the L .A. District Attorney .24 The State of California prosecutes25 the same harassment tactics landlords use here .2 
2 Harassment is a big issue today and directly3 connected with the RGB increases. Owners eliminate4 and decrease building - - eliminate and decrease5 building services and begin aggressive litigation6 against tenants to force them to move.	Three7 years ago Jon Shalom eliminated gas service in my8 building and left me without a working stove for9 over three years .10 It is deja vu all over.11 In Mach 2007, Nader Shalom purchased12 201 Sullivan Street and the tenants have been13 without cooking gas since April 18th.	Now, Shalom14 tenants have become savvy navigators of a very15 flawed system and have filed complaints, gone to16 court and filed harassment complaints. Still, the17 landlords get their increases.18 I appeal to the RGB to participate19 in making New York City a better place to live for20 everyone. I appeal to the Board to stop rewarding21 landlords with continued increases.	Landlords22 with HPD violations and harassment patterns do not23 deserve a dime.24 (Applause.)25 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	I appeal to2 
2 the Board to freeze rents.	Owners are receiving a3 seven percent tax cut this year.	Buildings with4 50 percent or more market rate units should not be5 subject to rent increases.6 I urge the Board to start looking at7 actual evidence of real landlord hardship and8 financial struggle.	In contrast, evidence of9 rising hardship and homelessness amongst tenants10 is overwhelming.	Why does the Board continue to11 ignore these red flags.12 The Board has the power to prevent a13 housing disaster and to develop and introduce a14 housing vision for New York City.	Hasn't history15 taught us anything?16 Diverse, balanced and healthy17 communities are the backbone of civilization.	We18 cannot continue to sweep the population with19 lesser means under the rug.20 The RGB has a great responsibility21 and has, in part, been instrumental in the demise22 of affordable housing and record homelessness we23 face today.24 In years to come they will have the25 responsibility fix the damage they have caused. It2 
2 has taken great courage - - it takes great courage3 to chart new territory and I ask the Board today4 to take the first step towards a more balanced5 society.6 Please find a better way because7 what you have done so far is not working.	Like8 every year I invite each and every one of you to9 explore the Shalom Tenants Alliance website and to10 meet with us to see what we're facing and look at11 the extensive documentation we have collected.12 Thank you very much.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 (Applause.)15 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Question.16 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have a18 question.19 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Hello.	Thank you20 very much for testifying.21 I'd like to ask you about, in your22 experience in working with tenants if you're23 familiar with any senior citizens who are not24 eligible for SCRIE because their income is more25 than $26,000, but nevertheless they have2 
2	difficulty paying their rent?3	MS . SUSANNE SCHROPP:	As a matter4 of fact - - I mean I'm a graphic designer . I'm not5 really a tenant - - I mean I'm a tenant advocate6 but I don't really work with tenants.	It's not my7 job.8 But through my involvement with the9 Shalom Tenants Alliance we have a lot of seniors10 that fit that profile and that are not eligible11 for SCRIE.	Some of them are but a lot of them12 aren't.	But even the ones that are, one of them13 comes to mind on Thompson Street .14 She's scared every single time and15 she's been to court a few times because of the16 problems with getting SCRIE money and, you know,17 trying to make the rent payments .	And the Shaloms18 are very quick at demanding these high rents .19 So she's been to court a few times20 and for an elderly person that's really21 devastating .	I've been to court with her and it's22 nerve-racking. And I've been to court myself23 obviously so I know what it's like.24 Thank you .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 
2 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.3 When you talk about Shalom4 properties, how many units approximately are you5 talking about?6	MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	It's hard to7 say.	I mean I know we have been looking at HPD8 records which are not exact.	But we're talking9 over 3,000 units that are owned by this family.10 And they employ the same harassment patterns in11 pretty much every unit, the newest one being 20112 Sullivan Street on the corner of Bleecker Street.13 And these tenants are facing a lot trouble.14 MS. HOLDER:	And what are the15 rents, just based upon your knowledge of the16 units, that you're talking about?17 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	In which18 building?19 MS. HOLDER:	In your - - in any of20 them or in your building.21 MS . SUSANNE SCHROPP:	Well, in my22 building almost all the units have been23 deregulated.	Average rents of $1,000 have gone up24 to over 3,000.	They are actually advertising that25 on their website. Just today another unit became7 
2 available for $3,295.	It's a 400 square foot3 apartment that used to be a large studio4 one-bedroom that's been converted into a5 two-bedroom. And it's basically rented to6 students. They like to make into dorms basically7 because the turnover is nice and fast they get8 quick money that way.9	MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum.12 (Applause.)13 PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Good14 afternoon, and thank you for allowing me to speak15 here once again.16 We all now that New Yorkers are17 facing an affordable housing crisis.	Rents are18 skyrocketing and we are seeing the consequences.19 This year's homeless population with20 approximately 35,000 people sleeping in New York21 City shelters each night this past year, including22 more than 9,000 families .23 The trend is clear: With each24 passing year more working New Yorkers are pushed25 out as rent prices rise and affordable housing10 
1	1012 options shrink.3 New York simply cannot continue to4 afford to lose low income and middle income5 workers. I1 m here today to call on the Rent6 Guidelines Board to preserve New York 1  s largest7 supply of affordable housing - our stock of rent8 regulated apartments.9 Rent stabilized housing is the best10 affordable housing resource left to most middle11 class New Yorkers . One-third of the City 1  s12 subsidized apartments - one-third - were lost13 between 1990 and 2006. How many will be lost in14 the next 16 years?15 It is time that the Rent Guidelines16 Board take an active role in stopping the17 affordable housing crisis by preserving the rent18 stabilized housing stock.19 I also urge the Board to adopt the20 recommendation of Tenants and Neighbors and other21 advocates, to use provisos to protect tenants from22 rent increases when the landlords fail to provide23 the services or make repairs and try to empty24 affordable units so that they can increase the25 rents .2 
1	1022	(Applause.)3	PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Today4 could be a turning point in New York history. As5 we prepare for another million people in this City6 by 2030, we must agree to stand together to7 protect our tenants.8 Thank you very much.9 (Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 We have some questions, Ms. Gotbaum.12 Sorry.13 (Audience participation.)14 PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Excuse me.15 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Diana,17 quiet.18 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you for your19 testimony and for your service.20 You talked about21 A VOICE:	Use the mike, please.22 MS. ADAMS:	the Rent Guidelines23 Board making sure that some of the violations were24 enforced and that sort of thing.25 Have you made other statements about4 
2 the departments that have that responsibility?3 Are you saying that we should call on them or  I4 wasn' t clear on what you meant.5	PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Well, I6 think for one thing, the City Council has just7 passed some legislation which will actually  begin8 to do that to force the landlords and - - to force9 the landlords to make repairs in - - when they must10 be made when there are violations.11 But what I'm asking you to do is for12 the Board to join with us and to insist that  this13 kind of activity happen, that when landlords  don't14 make repairs, when there are multiple violations,15 when they're not providing the tenants the16 services they must, then they don't get an17 increase. They absolutely should not get an18 increase. And that' s what I'm asking for.19 (Applause.)20 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure. Another22 question.23 Risa .24 MS. LEVINE:	Thank you so much for25 coming today .6 
2 We' re seeing an enormous revival3 Downtown, many new residential buildings going up4 or being rehabilitated Downtown and yet most of5 those or very little are actually affordable6 housing.7 What incentives do you think there8 should be to landlords Downtown to actually build9 affordable housing down there among the10 multimillion-dollar condos and co-ops that they're11 building?12 PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Well,13 certainly, absolutely 100 percent .	If any kind of14 tax abatement is given, it must come with a15 proviso that there must be affordable housing and16 there must be - - we must insist on that and we17 must implement that.18 In terms of what else is going on19 Downtown, I mean my understanding is there are20 some provisos where that is happening, in other21 words, where some residential buildings are22 getting tax abatements. There is some affordable23 housing. But I think we need to insist on much24 more and we need to be very vigilant and watch for25 that. Because I'm afraid that when all the2 
2 construction is going on, that just simply isn't3 going to happen, IE, that the provisos, the4 building of affordable housing will not occur and5 that' s what I'm worried about.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. One more7	- - another question.	Not one more.8	Go ahead.9	MS. CRUZ:	Ms. Gotbaum, thank you10 very much for coming and speaking to us today.11 I would like to understand how you12 believe that low guidelines or zero guidelines, as13 you - - I understood you to advocate, preserves14 affordable housing.15 How can a small property owner that16 is not meeting the basic expenses of the building,17 be with you in providing affordable housing?	If18 this Board gives that property owner zero or low19 increases, that will not enable the property owner20 to meet his or her expenses.21 PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Well, I22 understand your question and I agree with you that23 there are some cases where you have to - - I think24 you sort of have to take it almost case-by-case.25 Now, the example - - the question10 
2 that was asked her about Lower Manhattan where we3 see these enormous buildings rising and huge4 rents, market rate rents. There, I think, we have5 to absolutely insist on affordable housing.6 I think in a case where you have a7 landlord who is really suffering	and again, but8 you have to be able to prove that.	And I've heard9 many too many calls to our office where that is10 simply not the case where the landlord is just not11 providing the services, is not making the repairs12 and the landlord is living a lot better than the13 tenants.14 (Applause.)15 MS. CRUZ:	That is a case-by-case16 situation, Ms. Gotbaum.	I'm sure people that are17 doing well in your districts are under - - are not18 going to call your office.	Only the people that19 are not doing so well are going to call your20 office.	So - -21 PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Well, we22 get an enormous number of calls from tenants, and23 frankly many, many, many seniors because they are24 the ones who are suffering the most. And these are25 people on fixed incomes who can't afford to make2 
2 these payments.3 And we do provide, by the way, for4 those who asked earlier, we do help people get5 their SCRIE payments in a more rapid fashion when6 we can when they call our office and we can help7 them.8 And it is a huge problem. I mean I9 don't - - I think people don't call our office when10 they' re doing well. They don't have to. But it's11 the people that have nowhere else to turn that12 calls us . And we hear too much of it. And in the13 city of so much wealth I think we have an14 obligation, an obligation, especially with all15 this construction going, to insist, to absolutely16 insist that we do maintain a certain amount of17 affordable housing .18 And let me say, I want to be fair,19 but we should open the books.	Whoever yelled that20 back there is very intelligent.	We should open21 the books so we can see what is fair and what22 isn't fair.23 (Applause.)24 MS. CRUZ:	Would you say that to25 tenants that also would have to reveal what their2 
2	income sources are?3	PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Well,4 tenants already do.	A great many tenants already5 have to. That' s for sure.6	MR. THOMAS DIANA:	They do? Under7	what program?8	PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Sure .9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Not in rent10 stabilization.11 PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Well,12 often they do.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One more18 question.19 (Applause.)20 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you so much for21 coming to testify and also thank you for your22 service to the City .23 I think that this Board has spoken24 about the idea of whether we should continue  to25 take the one-size-fits-all approach that we  tend10 
2 to engage in as we go this through process every3 year.	And, in fact, there has been some proposals4 put out that look at perhaps treating landlords5 differently.6 You referred to one in terms of the7 conditions in a building.	Another such proposal8 involves landlords who actually have deregulated9 units in the building with regulated units that10 perhaps those landlords should not be entitled to11 an increase or a full increase.12 I was wondering how you felt about13 that and about the Board' s role in this whole14 housing debate.15 PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Well, I16 think you made a very good point that you are17 I'm glad to hear that you are not considering18 one- size-fits-all.	And however difficult that19 might be to implement, I think it's important to20 do it.21 And I do think for sure that if a22 landlord has multiple violations, and if, in fact,23 the landlord is not doing repairs when he or she24 should, I don't think they should be allowed to25 have an increase. And I think we must insist upon2 
2 that. And I don't mean just repairs. I also mean3 providing services.4 And that's - - it is true, those are5 the kinds of calls we get a great many of.6 (Audience participation.)7 MS. HOLDER:	What about owners8 that have unregulated or market rent apartments  as9 well as regulated units in their building?10 PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	I'm11 sorry.	Unregulated?12 MS. HOLDER:	Yes. The rent13 stabilized units in the same building along with14 unregulated units where they're able to  charge15 market rent.16 PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Of course,17 I believe that landlords who don't provide the18 basic services that they're supposed to provide  in19 the leases and the landlords who don't make20 repairs when they should be made, should not be21 allowed to make an increase. Absolutely.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.23 MS. HOLDER:	I guess, I guess24 I'm sorry.	Maybe I'm not clear because what I  was25 saying is that there's another proposal that  says2 
2 that for those owners that have unregulated units3 where they're able to charge the market rent, that4 the income that they derive off of that should5 offset any needs that they have in terms of being6 able to maintain a respectful net operating7 income.8 And so looking at those owners who9 have this combination of rental units, the10 unregulated or market rent units, as well as the11 regulated or rent stabilized or rent controlled12 units, that perhaps they should not be entitled to13 an increase or as high an increase as other14 landlords.15 PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Well,16 because I'm not a housing economist and I really17 don' t understand the - - I mean I don't know the18 answer to that question.19 What I do think we have to be very20 careful about is if you have a landlord who has21 unregulated or market rate apartments in the same22 building as those who have regulated, the one23 thing we want to make absolutely 100 percent sure24 is nothing happens to push those tenants out of25 the regulated apartment. That is one thing that I2 
1	1122 can tell you we should insist upon.	And if that3 ever happens, there should be severe penalties.4 (Applause.)5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair?6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Mr.7	Schleider.8	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for9	showing up today.10 Just a couple of things I'm trying11 to reconcile with your position. And I do realize12 that you're not a housing economist expert or13 economy expert.14 But if we're going to have another15 million added to the population of the City by, as16 you said 2030, and if we're not increasing the17 stock of rent stabilized housing that's extremely18 affordably, and if we don't have the turnover in19 this rent stabilized stock, where are you going to20 put these million people that are coming in?21 Second, how would you handle the22 tenant - - because there seems to be some life23 being breathed into something that is not really a24 proviso here - but how would you handle the tenant25 that has the income to afford a market rate unit10 
2 but is still in an apartment that may be3 affordable to a tenant at one-third of that4 income, would you suggest that that tenant  leave5 to make room for somebody who is more at risk?6	PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Well, I 7 think the answer to your first question is I don't8 want a City where market rate housing has  driven9 out the middle class and the lower income classes.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I don't think11 anybody on this Board disagrees.12 PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Right. So13 it seems to me that if you were to get rid of  all14 of the rent stabilized and rent controlled15 apartments, and they would all go to market rate 1617 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That's not what I18 said. I said where are you going to put these19 million people because there is no turnover  in20 these rent stabilized apartments that are21 extremely affordable.22 PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Well, I23 think we have to - - I think we have to provide24 incentives for landlords to build more affordable25 housing.	And we certainly have to encourage  in17 
2 boroughs other than Manhattan, although I'm not3 willing to give up on Manhattan. And we have to be4 creative in some of the ways that we do build5 housing because that' s - -6 But then the other thing we need to7 is we need to preserve the housing that we have.8 We need to make sure that the housing stock is9 preserved in a way that then can be rented.10 As far as a tenant who has more11 income or much more income than he or she is12 paying for the rent, that' s when - - my13 understanding is that in most rent regulated14 apartments, the income of the tenants is known and15 that is my understanding.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That is not - -17 just factually, it's not correct. It is18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But that' s19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	- - in subsidized20 housing.	But in rent stabilized housing unless21 your rent while in occupancy goes over $2,00022 PUB. ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	You're23 right.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	- - you don't have25 to prove any income. And only if your owner2 
2 challenges you to try to remove you do you have to3 show your income.4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So the question is,5 if this tenant is able to for afford a much more6 expensive apartment to make - - would you suggest7 that that tenant leave to make room for8 somebody - -9	PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	No.	I'm10 not going to suggest that to a tenant, because11 somebody has to prove to me that that is the12 truth.	Because in too many other cases it's the13 other way around where the person who doesn't have14 the income is being forced out because the15 landlord is capable of not providing the service16 or pushing that tenant out. And I think we've seen17 more of that than we've seen of your example .18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, of course,19 you've seen more of that than my examples because20 my example' s protected by politicians so that it21 wouldn' t be seen.22 So my question to you is, as a23 policy, if the tenant could afford a market rate24 apartment to come out of the rent stabilized25 housing stock to make to room for a tenant who10 
2 could afford a much lower rent, would you advocate3 for that?4 PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	No, I5 would not advocate for that because I would  repeat6 what I just said before.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you. We9	appreciate it.10 MS. CRUZ:	I have one more.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oh, one more12 question. Go ahead.13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. CRUZ:	Ms . Gotbaum, I just15 want - - I just want to make something clear about16 the owners that are not providing services as  you17 seem very concerned about that category of owners,18 and that tenants ought not to pay increases  when19 their housing is substandard.20 In fact, tenants have the ability to21 file a complaint with the New York State Division22 of Housing and Community Renewal .	And they - - if,23 in fact, their allegations are proven to be  true24 that the conditions are substandard, the  state25 will order a rent freeze and that tenant will  not10 
2 have to pay a rent increase until the conditions3 are cured.4	Why is that not sufficient?	Why are5	you advocating6	PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Because I7 can recite an example for you for something that8 I1  m working on and I 1 ve been working on for one9 year with a landlord, who shall go nameless at10 this point, because we have possibly - - we have a11 law firm that 1 s probably going to take them into12 court because this is a landlord who has an13 enormous number of buildings.14 There are all kinds of things15 happening with this landlord. And not only have16 the tenants been going to the state and to the17 City and to court, and they have been unable to18 get the landlord to make the necessary repairs, to19 fix things in the apartments. And they finally20 came to us and we are looking at this very, very21 carefully.22 The tenant Court, the state courts,23 believe me, they are not answering the questions24 of these many, many tenants and they are both in25 Manhattan and in Queens.
2 MS. CRUZ:	Right. But all I am3 saying as to a rent increase, the State Division4 of Housing has means that are relatively simple to5 tenants to cause a rent freeze until conditions6 are corrected.	What you're describing is where a7 tenant goes to Housing Court in order to compel8 owners to do repairs.9 What I am saying to you is as to10 rent increases that you are advocating for this11 Board to order no increases for owners that are12 not providing services, well that is already13 available to tenants.	That is already available .14 PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Well, I15 beg to differ with you because I think that16 process takes so long and many of the tenants17 (Applause.)18 PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	And many19 of the tenants who contact us don't have the20 capacity to do that .	So that's been our21 experience.	That's been my experience for the22 last six years .23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you .24 PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Thank you.25 (Audience participation .)
2	PUBLIC ADVOCATE GOTBAUM:	Anybody3	else?4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 (Applause.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'm going to7 call - -8 (Audience participation. )9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Call three10 names:11 Jumaane Williams is first;12 Steven Chabra; and13 Chris Athineos;14 Followed by Anne Borel.15 Jumaane?16 MR. JUMAANE WILLIAMS:	Good17 evening.18 My name is Jumaane D. Williams and I19 come to this Board as a small homeowner/landlord.20 So I completely understand the21 workings of my high property taxes and how my22 electric bill and insurance went up again this23 year. I also understand how that effects my bottom24 line . Yet and still I am appalled at how tenants25 are treated as second rate in the City second  only10 
2 to profits and greed. This is the only conclusion3 any sane person could come to.4 How could anyone hear the testimony5 of tenant advocates and housing experts repeatedly6 discussing dire situations in affordable housing7 and turn a deaf ear .	Everyone knows and agrees8 that economic times are rough . That as why as a9 homeowner I am blessed that I will more than10 likely receive another tax rebate and an11 additional reduction .	While I am grateful, I12 wonder where tenants will get their relief. And13 adding insult to injury, this Board will vote for14 an increase .15 You will, like a fair imbalanced16 imposter, vote for higher rents. There will be17 numbers touted by the RSA and research to defend18 it . However, for all your research and numbers I19 can show hundreds of thousands of tenants who are20 being slowly priced out of their - - as their21 landlords get richer. I can show you tenants who22 live in squalor conditions as their landlords23 continue to raise and collect rents. I can show24 you homeless children whose parents cannot afford25 the rents you set year after year . And your new2 
2 tactic of range of numbers is see-through to make3 it seem as though are you contemplating some fair4 number in that range.5 As the Mayor likes to say, if both6 sides are upset, then a good job was done. I think7 on this issue the Mayor and the Board need a8 high-fiber diet . The mere fact that you would9 never seriously debate a rent freeze, as suggested10 recently by the Controller of this City who has11 access to some of the same info you have, proves12 you are a charlatan Guidelines Board here to13 pacify tenants into thinking their voice will be14 heard. It is an insult to the work being15 impartial.16 According to the Housing & Vacancy17 survey of '05, nearly 30 percent of tenants pay18 over 50 percent of their income on rent. Rent19 stabilized tenant' s income went down 8.6 percent20 as their rent rose eight percent .	In addition, at21 least 10,000 units are lost every year. These are22 facts.23 And another fact is there has never24 been tenant relief . Trends are getting worse.25 Still since 1969 and the inception of the Rent2 
2 Guidelines Board, there has never been a rollback3 or rent freeze. Tenants are the backbone of this4 City. They deserve some help just like us5 landlords do. They deserve a rent rollback or6 freeze. They deserve Home Rule in New York City7 over rents and evictions. They deserve a real Rent8 Guidelines Board or a system that can truly be9 fair and not an imitation. They deserve some10 relief.11 I, for one, will be keeping my12 tenant's rent the same.13 Thank you.14 (Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me just16 indicate that Mr. Williams signed up as an owner17 and effectively jumped the line.	So all of you18 who are going to sit here waiting19 MR. JUMAANE WILLIAMS:	I'm an20 owner.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I know you're an22 owner, but you certainly didn' t testify as an23 owner.24 So all you of sitting here waiting,25 he jumped ahead of you because he listed himself2 
2 as an owner.3 (Audience participation.)4	MS . HOLDER :	He is an owner.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	He testified as6	an owner.	Yes, he definitely did.7 MS. HOLDER:	But he is an owner.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Give me a9 break, okay .	I don't care what he owns.	This is10 outrageous.	He jumped the God damn line by11 becoming owner No. 8 as opposed to all the people12 in this audience who are sitting and waiting their13 turn.	That' s what happened .14 MS . HOLDER:	But he is an owner .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That' s what16 happened .17 MS. HOLDER:	But he is an owner .18 We' re not here19 (Audience participation .)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr . Chabra. Mr.21 Chabra.22 MS . HOLDER :	We' re not here to23 censor what it is that people say . He is an owner .24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We have a25 system, right?	We have a system which we call on9 
2 people based on when they come and how they sign3 up.	He jumped the line.4 We have - - just to be clear, in5 terms of tenants, we have people who are No. 426 and he was able to go as No. 8, 8 on the owner7 side.	He jumped ahead of many, many tenant people8 who are in this audience.9 (Audience participation .)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to11 understand that.12 MS. HOLDER:	But he' s not a13 tenant.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oh, please.15 Let' s go.16 Mr. Chabra.	Mr. Chabra.17 MR. STEVEN CHABRA:	I wrote to18 Mayor Bloomberg in April when I heard he'd19 appointed Magda Cruz to the Rent Guidelines Board.20 I apologized that in my agitated state I neglected21 to copy the RGB.22 I can't read the entire letter in23 three minutes, but this is the gist of what I24 wrote:25 Dear Mayor Bloomberg, I am deeply2 
2 concerned that your appointment of Magda Cruz will3 intensify questions about the RGB's neutrality and4 further undermine the public' s confidence in the5 Board.6 As you know, Ms . Cruz is a partner7 of the law firm Belkin, Burden, Wenig & Goldman,8 specializing in real estate law for property9 owners . It 's clear to me that BBWG has a history10 of cynical bias against tenants that is plainly11 stated in their newsletter articles .12 Loosely quoting from the DHCR13 Demolition Application and Overview, September14 2004, owners with rent regulated apartments are15 often unaware of the tools at their disposal such16 as certificates of eviction against rent17 controlled tenants and permission to refuse to18 renew leases against rent stabilized tenants where19 the owner' s intention is to demolish the building .20 These cannot only result in the21 vacating of a building as a result of a DHCR22 order, but also frequently serve as the trigger23 event for bringing tenants to the bargaining24 table.25 Directly quoting from the2 
2 disdainfully titled article: Let's get ready to3 Rumble, DHCR Grants Demolition Application without4 Holding a Hearing, January 2005.5 The fact that hearings are no longer6 mandated by statute has made the demolition7 application a more attractive option for owners8 seeking to recover possession of rent regulated9 buildings.10 Clearly, BBWG is promoting11 demolition as a weapon for landlords to use12 against tenants of legal tenure.	The interesting13 thing about using demolition as a weapon is that14 DHCR says it's just fine to evict tenants who have15 done nothing to warrant eviction and nothing has16 to be demolished. An owner can use demolition as a17 threat that, as BBWG advises, bring tenants to the18 bargaining table. Once they're sufficiently19 intimidated or worn down over time they're cheaply20 bought off and the owner simply withdraws the21 demolition application, or the tenants leave under22 pressure and the owner just renovates the intact23 building.24 Because nothing is demolished, this25 tactic has become known as the "phony demolition. "ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC. , 212- 840- 1167521 Fifth Avenue, 17th floor, New York, New York  10175
2 All this concerns me greatly because3 I am a rent stabilized tenant facing eviction by a4 phony demolition.	My landlord claims he has to5 demolish my building when all he intends to do is6 evict us forever destroying 14 affordable rent7 regulated apartments and replace them with seven8 deregulated, luxury apartments that have two9 bedrooms, libraries, three full bathrooms and10 balconies.11 He is using the very same phony12 demolition weapon that BBWG touts as an attractive13 option for owners.	Appointment to the RGB comes14 with an obligation to judge facts objectively.15 Because of Ms. Cruz' position as a partner in a16 law firm that advocates using phony demolitions as17 a weapon against tenants of legal tenure who have18 done nothing to warrant eviction, I have no19 confidence in her ability to be objective.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you wrap21 up, please?22 MR. STEVEN CHABRA:	I am.23 I insist that you immediately24 rescind Ms. Cruz' appointment.	As of today I have25 received from the Mayor's office neither a reply
2 nor an acknowledgement of my letter.3 Thank you for the opportunity to4 speak.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 (Applause.)7 MS. CRUZ:	May I8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me.9 Just to respond in general.	The10 Mayor makes appointments.	Everybody makes11 appointments. There are two owner reps.	There are12 two tenant reps. Both - - there are three13 litigators among the four that are Board members.14 And each one of these litigators has litigated on15 behalf of their respective sides.16 Ms. Cruz, Adriene Holder, and Mr.17 Languedoc are advocates for their side. Mr.18 Schleider is also an advocate, but he's not an19 attorney. There' s nothing wrong with this20 particular situation on both sides.21 Both sides have been involved in22 litigation.	Either way, the Mayor goes out of his23 way, in terms of the public members, to make sure24 there is no such issue for public members. But25 these are advocate members. That' s the way the
2 statute is put together and therefore there is3 absolutely nothing wrong, on either side, of4 having advocates.5 Thank you.6 Chris Athineos, please;7 Anne Borel;8 Sadie Foy.9 MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	I'm a small10 property owner from Brooklyn and I am here today11 to urge the Board to focus on their mission which12 is to preserve and maintain rental housing stock13 in New York City.14 Each year more and more units are15 being lost to conversions because small owners,16 such as myself, cannot make ends meet with the17 ever increasing operating costs compared to the18 small guideline increases the Board passes each19 year. Each year I'm faced with having to make20 decisions on what building component needs to be21 replaced.	And in the last few years I noticed22 that I'm forced to forego replacing the item23 because we just can't afford it.24 We have to put Bandaids on the25 building to keep it going.	If the parapet wall
2 needs to be torn down and rebuilt, we point it. If3 the roof needs replacing, we patch it with tar. If4 the elevator controllers need to be replaced, we5 repair them.	And if the risers need to be6 replaced, we wait for them to leak before changing7 them.8 The fact is buildings are getting9 older and older buildings cannot keep up with10 these costs. The PIOC does not consider the age of11 a building when looking at the costs just the12 incremental increase in that cost or service.13 Older buildings require more14 maintenance. It's a fact.	Contractors are15 charging more and more these days because of their16 increased costs.	The plumber doesn't want to17 break the law because Local Law 1, the led paint18 law, requires a strict protocol.	The roofer19 doesn' t want to remove a roof because it becomes20 an asbestos abatement job not a roofing job.21 Recently the plumber charged me over22 $900 just to change the trap on a bathtub and this23 doesn't even include the damage to breaking and24 re- tiling the floor.25 The costs of Local Law 1 are never
2 taken into consideration in the PIOC and this is3 grossly unfair. We must stick to the strict4 protocols laid out in the law and there is no one5 in City government that can tell an owner how to6 pay for it.7 Our real estate tax assessments keep8 going up and single family homeowners and co-op9 and condo owners get a rebate. And I want to make10 it clear 'cause one of the other speakers said he11 was an owner and he got a rebate. Owners of12 multifamily apartments don't get any rebate from13 the City.	We pay our real estate taxes. They14 increase the rates . They increase our assessments15 but we don't get any rebate.16 When I - - and when I testify at a17 City Hall hearing on real estate taxes, they18 always point to this Board to seek compensation.19 It's a typical city bureaucracy, pass the buck.20 Well, let me tell you, owners aren't21 going to be able to take it anymore. And I've22 heard many times why don't you just sell your23 building, real estate values are so high now.24 Well, this is disappointing and an insult to25 owners and tenants because we're not in the
2 business of selling our buildings. We're in the3 business of maintaining our buildings and renting4 them. And it's just as insulting to a tenant to5 say to them, well, if you can't afford the6 increases, move out of the City.7 We need to come up with a new8 approach on maintaining and preserving the rent9 stabilized buildings, not just the rents and make10 housing affordable.	But what about the buildings?11 Because if you maintain low rents, you're not12 going to be able to maintain a quality of life for13 the tenants that are living in them.14 So I would propose that this Board15 consider a longevity increase to compensate owners16 for those long term tenants who are in occupancy17 for more than eight years and have rents that are18 significantly below what it costs to maintain an19 apartment.20 As I've said in the past, just21 because this Board passes an increase doesn't mean22 we collect it from every tenant. And herein lies23 the greatest injustice. For many market rate rent24 stabilized tenants they receive preferential rents25 and sometimes - -
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap3 up, Mr. Athineos.4 MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	- - no5 increases at all.	And then for a tenant who' s6 maybe paying $500 on a two-percent increase they7 get a $10 increase. So I would ask you to consider8 the longevity increase.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10	MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	Thank you.11	MS. CRUZ:	Question.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question, Mr.13 Athineos.14 MS. CRUZ:	Where is your building,15 sir?16 MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	My buildings17 are in Brooklyn.	In Bay Ridge, Park Slope.18 MS. CRUZ:	And approximately how19 many - - how many do you own?20 MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	We own - -21 we're a family business. We own ten buildings.22 About 150 apartments.	And we have many long term23 rent stabilized tenants whose24 (Audience participation.)25 MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	- - rents are
2 below $600.	And these are people who are well3 within - - have well within the means to pay much4 more rent, but they just don't move. These are5 people with homes in the Hamptons, the Poconos,6 Connecticut, driving luxury cars.7 (Audience participation.)8	MS. CRUZ:	One other question9 about - - you say that your properties are in10 Brooklyn in Bay Ridge and in that area.	Do you11 have many deregulated apartment?12 MR . CHRIS ATHINEOS:	Yes, we do13 have deregulated apartments.14 MS. CRUZ:	What is approximately15 the percentage of your stabilized housing stock16 versus your deregulated?17 MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	I would say we18 have about 20 percent deregulated apartments and19 the rest are rent - - mostly rent stabilized20 apartments and some rent controlled apartments.21 MS. CRUZ:	Does the fact that you22 have some deregulated units in any way cause a23 significant dent in your expenses, in your - - in24 the way you operate your buildings?	Just 2025 percent of your housing stock is deregulated.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212- 840-1167521 Fifth Avenue, 17th floor, New York, New York  10175
2	MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	Well, let me3 tell you, at some point maybe in the last five,4 six years whether the apartment is deregulated or5 the apartment is rent stabilized with a6 preferential rent, it has no impact.	Because the7 tenant with a preferential rent and the8 deregulated tenant for all intents and purposes,9 they're paying the same rent.10 If the market is $1,100 for a11 one-bedroom apartment in Park slope or in Bay12 Ridge, whether they' re deregulated or stabilized13 with a preferential rent they're paying the same14 thing.15 And for many instances - - I mean16 today I renewed a tenant. I won' t say his name but17 he' s paying $1,100. He' s been living there for six18 years. He came from California. I've never19 increased his rent. And his legal rent is above20 $2,000. He moved in before it was below $2,000. He21 kept renewing his increases and legally I'm22 allowed to take the guideline increases, but I've23 never charged him a rent increase for the last24 five or six years.25 And this is the injustice. I just3 
2 want the Board to be clear, just because you pass3 whatever increase you pass, doesn't mean4 necessarily that we get that two percent or four5 percent from all of our stabilized tenants.6	MS. CRUZ:	But it helps you with7	the low rent tenant; is that correct?8	MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	It helps - -9 it helps us, but you know what, we've come to the10 point - - we've come to the point now where that' s11 not enough when they keep passing these laws12 inundating us.	The Local Law 1 is just13 devastating, devastating.	We lose two or three14 month's vacancy just to turn over an apartment15 because we have to do led abatement work in the16 apartment. And, you know, if you lose two or three17 month' s rent, lost rent is something that we can18 never recoup.19 So yes, it helps us but now it's not20 enough.	And the only place left is for those long21 term rent stabilized tenants. And if we don't get22 it, you're going to see many owners, especially23 the smaller owners, that are just going to sell24 out.25 And who are they going to sell out9 
2 to? The co-op and condo converters and that' s3 what's going to happen. And there' s going to be no4 rental housing stock in New York City. We' re going5 to be a City of co-op and condos.6 And, you know, I hope the Board7 just takes into consideration that and let's avoid8 the crisis now.9	MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 (Applause.)12 MR. CHRIS ATHINEOS:	Thank you.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Anne Borel;14 Sadie Foy;15 Followed by Thomas Siracuse.16 MS. ANNE BOREL:	All the buildings17 on our side of the street have been purchased by a18 single developer.19 They have been evicting people and20 paying tenants to move with low buyouts and21 converting a series of apartments in one blow for22 high rentals.23 It appears that about 20 percent of24 the apartments in all of the buildings have been25 emptied to date .	Various harassment tactics have
2 been used to frighten people, including legally3 baseless eviction notices with three-day notices4 to vacate; misuse of cameras purportedly installed5 for tenant security whereby the landlord reports6 to the tenant its observation of tenant activity7 through camera surveillance, and having the U.S.8 Post Office clerk illegally provide landlord9 access to the mailbox of each apartment so that10 the landlord can transcribe whatever information11 it can garner from the mail found therein.12 Tenants report that landlord is no13 longer responding to tenant requests for services14 and repairs.	All of the landlord's manpower15 appears to be directed at renovating empty16 apartments.	We anticipate that the remaining17 tenants will have the burden of MCI increases once18 the landlord seeks to upgrade the common areas to19 accommodate the higher rentals.20 And I think that ultimately it might21 be condo conversion that they're driving at. But22 anyway, I wanted to share that.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where do you24 live?25 MS. ANNE BOREL:	On the Upper West
2	Side.	The upper, Upper West Side.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Upper, upper.4 Okay.5 Thank you.6 Any questions?7 (No response.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 Sadie Foy.	Is that you, Sadie10	coming to the mike?11	MS. SADIE FOY:	Yes.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thanks.13 MS. SADIE FOY:	Thank you.14 Hello.	My name is Sadie Foy.	I am15 a rent stabilized tenant from the Bronx.16 I'm here to ask the Board for once17 in a lifetime to give the tenants a rent freeze .18 Give us a chance to get back on our feets - - on19 our feet.20 (Applause.)21 MS. SADIE FOY:	Landlords get22 increases in insurance, electricity.	The tenants23 get the same increases.	A lot of tenants pay24 rental insurance.	That increases with the same as25 the landlords .	Renters insurance were increased
2 just the same as Con Edison.	We' re getting double3 whammied.	We get our increases and the tenant' s4 increases.5 The landlords are not losing any6 money otherwise they would not continually buy7 building after building.	Everything needs to be8 updated.	When you buy a home, you invest money in9 it to improve it.	You can't expect to get rich10 the first five years when you purchase anything.11 As far as insurance is concerned, I12 pay rental insurance. I did anyway.	I had to let13 it go because I could not afford it.	I live on a14 fixed income.	I am retired and disabled.	I15 barely get by.	Thank God I am able to.	But if16 you continue with these rent increases, I won' t17 be.18 You have people leaving shelters19 everyday to go to work because they cannot afford20 their apartments.	Working people, they leave21 their jobs after a hard day's work to go back to a22 shelter and that' s not fair, because they cannot23 afford their rents.24 Power is a wonderful thing.	And25 you, the Rent Guidelines Board, have the power to
2 do the right thing for a change.	Give the tenants3 a break. Let us get back on our feet .4 (Applause.)5	MS . SADIE FOY:	These landlords are6 not losing any money.	It's us, the tenants in the7 Bronx, in New York, the City of New York, the8 greatest country in the world where you have9	homeless people that work every single day.	Give10 us a chance to get back on our feet .	Do the right11 thing, please .	It 's time for a rent freeze.12 Thank you.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you.14 (Applause.)15 MR. LANGUEDOC :	Question.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question,17 question.	Ms. Foy, question.18 MR . LANGUEDOC:	Thank you for19 coming .	I appreciate hearing from you .20 I'd just like to ask you a question21 that I asked someone else earlier which is about22 the spread between a one-year and a two-year23 renewal .24 Well, first of all, I appreciate25 as a tenant representative, I appreciate your10 
2	remarks about advocating for a rent freeze.	But3 in the event that the Board is going to look into4 an increase, what do you know - - or from people in5 your community that are rent stabilized tenants or6 from your own experience, what do you know about7 people choosing a one-year or a two-year lease?8 Are people able to afford the9 increase for a two-year or are they signing for a10 one-year?11	MS . SADIE FOY:	People are signing12 for one-year lease because they have no choice.13 Excuse me.	We would prefer to be able to sign up14 for a two-year lease but it's unaffordable to15 people like me on Social Security and pension,16 it's unaffordable.	It's unaffordable for people17 that get subsidies because a lot of these18 landlords refuse to accept the subsidy from the19 tenants like Section 8 or this new program that20 the government has.21 We would appreciate an affordable - -22 if you're not going to allow us a rent increase23 a rent freeze for a change, we would appreciate an24 affordable two-year lease. My lease is up in25 September. It will be time for me and I'm sure12 
2	most of New York, to sign another lease .3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You're actually4 under last year' s guideline if you're up in5 September.6 MS. SADIE FOY:	Yes, yes .	And like7 I say, in the greatest country in the world you8 have working people that leave a shelter to go to9 work everyday and after a hard day' s work come10 home to a homeless shelter because they cannot11 afford the rent.12 Two percent is a lot of money for13 some people.14 Thank you.15 MR . LANGUEDOC:	Can I just ask you16 another thing?17 (Applause.)18 MS . SADIE FOY:	Sure .19 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I know you20 mentioned that you're disabled and you're retired.21 And the City Council speaker, Christine Quinn was22 here a little while ago talking about efforts in23 the State legislature to increase the maximum24 income - - the minimum income to qualify for DRIE.25 Do you know people that are disabled4 
2 that their income - - and they have low income but3 yet they can't get or qualify for DRIE because4 their income is a little bit over the threshold?5	MS. SADIE FOY:	I don't qualify for6 neither one.7 MR. LANGUEDOC:	You don't.8	MS. SADIE FOY:	No.	But that does9	not mean that I can afford an increase.10 My medical - - my secondary medical11 insurance cost me $488 every single month. So I12 know people that - -13 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I'm sorry to cut14 you off.15 You've looked into it yourself to16 see if you're eligible and you're not?17 MS. SADIE FOY:	Yes, yes. I18 personally called 311 to get an application for19 one of my neighbors because she's beside herself.20 She does not know what she's going to do. She is21 also disabled. So I called to get an application22 for her. They told me that	I even have a23 confirmation number.	She should be getting it by24 next week.25 She just received Section 8. She
1	1452 applied for it 15 years.	She just was accepted3 for it. The landlords will not accept it from her.4 She's losing her mind now.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.6 MS. SADIE FOY:	So even with the7 subsidy from the City, from the Government, the8 subsidized help, that does not matter because9 these landlords don't want it.10 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Right. So that' s11 an important too, that a tenant can get a Section12 8 voucher but then it's up to the landlord to13 choose to accept it in many cases, right?14 MS. SADIE FOY:	Yes, yes.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thomas Siracuse.18 Hold on.19 Followed by Council Member Helen20 Sears.21 Go ahead, Mr. Siracuse.22 MR. THOMAS SIRACUSE:	I represent23 the Committee to Protect Rent Controlled Tenants.24 We urge you to vote to eliminate the25 "special guideline" or the HUD fair market rent
2 increase for vacated rent controlled apartments.3 These increases are putting rent4 control under a virtual mode of vacancy decontrol5 by making it easy for vacated units to reach the6 $2,000 a month threshold for vacancy decontrol.7 According to the New York City8 Housing and Vacancy survey, over 16,000 rent9 controlled units, or 27 percent of the total were10 lost from 2003 to 2005.	Today there are fewer11 than 50, 000 rent controlled units left in New York12 City.13 Landlords already get hefty14 increases from an outmoded Maximum Base Rent15 formula, plus Major Capital Improvements and fuel16 pass-alongs.	In fact, rent control tenants face17 the highest increases of all categories of18 regulated tenants.19 In the last 35 years, while20 inflation rose 382 percent, rent control rents21 rose 527 percent.	These increases are not22 reflected in the Housing and Vacancy survey23 average rent figures because most rent controlled24 tenants are seniors and many are on the SCRIE25 program .	Nevertheless, landlords still get these
2 increases from the City.3 The special guidelines also may4 motivate unscrupulous landlords to harass rent5 controlled tenants, many of whom are elderly and6 vulnerable to move out so that their apartments7 so that their apartments can be deregulated.8 It is not uncommon for these9 apartments to increase more than 300 percent from10 their former rents.	Crain' s New York Business11 reported that rent regulated real estate is ''one12 of the hottest segments of the rent - - the real13 estate market." And despite increased costs such14 as fuel - according to your own figures, the RGB' s15 Income and Expense Study - landlord profits have16 increased almost every year since 1989.17 The RGB must not exacerbate the18 hemorrhage of the loss of affordable housing19 caused by vacancy decontrol. How can prospective20 low and moderate income tenants such as teachers21 and other City workers find affordable housing in22 this fast-shrinking market?23 We urge you to vote to eliminate24 this special guideline completely.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.
1	1482	MS. HOLDER:	Question.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure. Question.4	(Applause.)5	MS. HOLDER:	Thank you, Mr. Siracuse6 for coming this evening to Queens.7 Could you explain to us the8 difference between Maximum Collectible Rent versus9 Maximum Base Rent.10 MR. THOMAS SIRACUSE:	Well, that is11 determined by state law through the State Division12 of Housing.	And every two years they increase the13 maximum possible rent, called the Maximum Base14 Rent.	And sometimes those increases are not as15 high as seven-and-a-half percent every year.16 So if that' s the case, but that17 hasn' t been the case lately, rent controlled18 tenants are subject to a seven- and-a- half percent19 increase every single year.	That' s called the20 Maximum Collectible Rent.21 So that' s why rent controlled22 tenants are really getting a terrible squeeze.23 By the way, rent controlled tenants24 of all rent regulated tenants, have the lowest25 median income of all tenants and yet - - I think
2 it's something like $25,000 a year. And yet they3 have the highest increases.4 Now, you may say well, what about5 the SCRIE program?	Well, in order to be eligible6 for the SCRIE program, your rent has to be over a7 third of your income.	And many rent controlled8 tenants by the time they - - their income is - - I9 think it's what, 26, $27,000, they're already10 paying 40 or 50 percent of their income in rent.11 And, of course, then you have all12 those other rent controlled tenants.	Most of us13 are seniors under fixed incomes whose incomes are14 somewhat over $26,000 a year and we're getting hit15 by seven-and- a-half-percent increases every year.16 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, Mr.18 Siracuse.19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Council Member21 Helen Sears.22 MR.
