JEANIE DUBNAU:	I'm coming.11	Hello!12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	H , I13 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	My name is14 Jeanie Dubnau and I'm speaking and  represent ing15 RENA, that 's Riverside Edgecomb Neighborhood16 Associat ion, and the Citywide Tenants Coalit ion.17 I would like - - oh, there' s18 nobody here. Where are all the  RGB Members?	I19 think I should wait until they  come.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No.21 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:·	Well ,2 2	(Audience participat ion.)2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let 's go.24 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	I have to25 wait until all the Members are there. This   is24 
2 I only have two Members and a Chairperson.  We3 can't speak. Where are they?4 (Audience participation.)5 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	This is6 supposed to be a public  hearing.7 (Audience participation.)8	MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	This is9 supposed to be a public hearing. Where are  the10 Members of the RGB?11 (Audience participation.)12 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	We got one13 and we lost one.14 And my timing, I'm not going  to15 count my timing yet because the RGB is not  here.16 And so the clock must be17 stopped.18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let 's go.20 Ready?21 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	I'm waiting22 for the Members of the RGB to be there.  There' s23 only half the vot ing Members there.24 (Audience participation.)25 (There was a brief pause in the9 
2	proceedings.)3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let 's go.4 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	Okay. Thank5 you.6 Now 1 would like to ask  the7 Members of the RGB if they ever wondered why   the8 Chairman is an investment banker. Marvin  Markus9 is from Goldman Sachs,10 (Audience participation.)11 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	- - one of12 the most mammoth banking institutions in  the13 world. Isn't that odd that such a person  is14 considered to be a neutral part icipant in the15 Board whose purpose is to ascertain whether  the16 rents of a million rent stabilized tenants   should17 be increased , rent stabilized tenants or low to18 moderat e income?19 And they have two20 representatives on the Board whose Chairman is  an21 investment banker. Are we surprised then  that22 rents are always increased regardless of  the23 landlords' costs, regardless of the  employment24 situation, regardless of  wages?25 Could there possibly be a5 
2 chairman or a chairwoman who  is, God  forbid ,  a3 home attendant earning $7 an hour? Would that  be4 possi ble?5	The RGB Chairman, Marvin  Markus,6 has already determined that rents must go up.  He7 suggested and it was agreed against the vote  of8 the tenant reps, who have no power  whatsoever,9 that one- year leases would be increased between10 3 .5 to 5.5 percent and two- year leases would be11 increased between 5.5 and 7.5  percent.12 Could this be due to the  reality13 that our testimony is totally irrelevant to  the14 decisions made by the RGB?15 I know a law exists in New  York16 City which actually guarantees  landlords a17 profit , it ' s amazing, given that an  entrepreneur18 in our society is supposed to be willing to  let19 the market determine their profits.  Nonetheless,20 a mechanism exists to raise rents in the  case21 that landlords do not make what is considered  a22 fair profit. Why is this mechanism not used  you23 might ask? Why do we need an RGB if we  already24 have such a law in place you might  ask?25 The answer is landlords would6 
2 have to submit their records individually to  a3 City agency which would decide on a case-by- case4 basis whether a given landlord could raise  rents.5	No landlord is willing to do this. This is  why6 the City set up an RGB whose job is simply  raise7 rents across the board.8 This is why the RGB must be9 controlled by an investment banker who  can10 understand what real estate  wants.11 (Audience participat ion. )12 MS . JEANIE DUBNAU:	The tenant13 reps, the public hearing is just a show, a   show,14 designed to make us tenants think this is  a15 democratic process.16 (Audience participation. )17 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	In my18 neighborhood , Washington Heights, most people  are19 surviving by working several jobs, doubling  and20 tripling up families in  apartments.21 Given  the  real estate market	-22 translation, more money can be made in  Washington23 Heights - -24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to25 wrap up.6 
2 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	- - with3 higher income tenants - families who have  lived4 in their apartments for years, mainly people  of5 color, are being evicted by various  means,6 legal - -7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma' am, you8	need to wrap up.9	MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	- - and10 illegal.11 But this not a matter for  the12 RGB. You' re nothing but a collection agency for13 real estate.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 (Audience participation. )16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right.17 We switch to two minutes.18 The next speaker is Zoila19 Almonte.20 A VOICE:	Why two minutes?21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Because we22 have a lot of people to go.23 (Audience part icipation.)24 MS. ZOILA ALMONTE:	Why I have25 two minutes? Why? What happened?10 
2	(Audience participation. )3 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Let ' s go.4 MS. ZOILA ALMONTE:	I want my5 three minutes like everybody else.6 (Audience participation.)7	MS. ZOILA ALMONTE:	What 's the8	difference?9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What 's the10 difference? A minute.11 And there are forty or  fifty12 people more.13 A VOICE:	You' ll stay longer.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You got three15 minutes because you have a translator. That 's it .16 Then we go to two minutes after  this.17 That 's it.18 (Audience part icipation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ready, ma' am?20 Ma' am.21 MS . ZOILA ALMONTE:	(Through an22 interpreter)	My name is Zoila Almonte. And  I23 live in a rent stabil ized apartment .24 Due to the landlord' s negligence25 my child was lead poisoned. In my apartment  there10 
2 was peeling paint and water filtration all  over3 it .4	And the public areas were in  the5 same condition.6 When the landlord make  the7 repairs sooner, he almost immediately,  the8 conditions were the same.9 I'm very sad because due to  the10 landlord ' s negligence my child was lead   poisoned11 and he has dif ficulty learning. And this problem12 could have been avoided .13 What the Board is doing to  poor14 people is a disgrace. Lead poisoning	is affecting15 us. It makes me angry that the Board and  the16 City, I mean the City and the landlords say  that17 poor families cannot live in affordable  housing,18 either affordable housing or safe housing but  not19 both.20 It makes me angry.21 Local Law #1 and landlords,  they22 don' t go together. What works is Local Law #1 and23 responsible landlords.24 MS. ZOILA ALMONTE:	Thank you.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 
2	Gracias.3	MS. ZOILA ALMONTE:	Gracias.4	MS. HOLDER:	Where exactly do5 you live in New York?6 MS. ZOILA ALMONTE:	In7	Washington Heights.8	MS. HOLDER:	Is your apartment9	rent stabilized?10 MS. ZOILA ALMONTE:	Yes.11 MS. HOLDER:	How many units in12 your building?13 MS. ZOILA ALMONTE:	Twenty- four.14 MS. HOLDER:	And how long have15 you lived in the apartment?16 MS. ZOILA ALMONTE:	Twenty- two17 years.18 MS. HOLDER:	And how is your19 child now?20 MS. ZOILA ALMONTE:	He is21 trying. He is trying to go  ahead.22 Today is twenty years  old.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell.24 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell.10 
2	MR. LUBELL:	Have you sued the3 owner by reason of the lead paint poisoning  of4 your child?5 MS. ZOILA ALMONTE:	No.6 MR. LUBELL:	Well , you should7 certainly consider that and consult  - - there   are8 a number of attorneys that specialize in that  and9 consult one of those attorneys.10 MS. ZOILA ALMONTE:	For me it is11 very important the emotional health of my  family,12 my children, and I was concentrating on  that.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Frank Lowe.16 MR. FRANK LOWE:	Thank you.17 I own a small building in18 Chelsea. In the year 2000 I was paying $2800  a19 year for insurance and I had an excess  liability,20 umbrella policy. It cost me $700 a  year.21 Three years later I've been22 quoted $6700 for the basic policy with  fewer23 benefits and the excess liability policy that  I24 had three years ago was quoted to me as $7000  a25 year.7 
2 My taxes since 2001 have  gone3 from  $11,000 to  $21,000 a year and , frankly,4 neither rent stabilization nor the market  will5 allow significant increases in rents to maintain6 a level of return.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.8 Thank you.9 MR . PAGAN:	Quest ion.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question .11 Sir, Mr. Lowe, question.12 Mr. Pagan .13 MR. PAGAN:	Question, quickly.14 What  is your primary insurance cost?15 MR . FRANK LOWE:	Pardon?16 MR. PAGAN:	Your primary, not17 the excess.18 MR. FRANK LOWE:	The primary19 insurance costs, it was quoted by my  current20 carrier at $6700 a year, up from  $2800.21 MR. PAGAN:	And the excess22 liability?2 3	MR. FRANK LOWE:	The excess24 liability, last year when I declined to take  it ,25 was offered to me at $7000 versus  $700.24 
1	4682 MR. PAGAN:	I'm just wondering.3 Usually the excess tends to be a lot cheaper  than4 the primary.5	MR. FRANK LOWE:	When I was6 part , it was a pooled policy  that gave  - - you7 know, it started as a pool policy in excess  of8	$100 million in the pool.  And eventually	and9 that was $700. 1he following anniversary the   pool10 was cut to $50 million and then the  third11 anniversary that I was involved in the  program12 the premium was raised to $7000, at which point   I13 dropped out and said I have to do something  else,14 which is to also cut back my umbrella  liability.15 MR. PAGAN:	Thank you.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Doris17 Weisberg.18 Is she here?19 A VOICE:	What number?20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	114, Tenant.21 Is she here?22 (No response.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Julio Munoz,24 115 Tenant.25 MR. JULIO MUNOZ:	Thank you for9 
1	4692	giving me the opportunity to address you .3 THE REPORTER:	Not so close.4 MR. JULIO MUNOZ:	Not so close.5	Okay. Thank you.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' re the7	first one who said that .8	MR. JULIO MUNOZ:	I'm a tenant9 in the Bronx. And I'm also a district leader  up10 in the Pelham Parkway area .11 And for the future, Mr.12 Chairman, perhaps we could have a hearing  like13 this in the outer boroughs. And I would  strongly14 suggest the Bronx County be considered . We have a15 lot of tenants that are affected by this Board' s16 decisions that live outside of  Manhattan.17 The second observation I  would18 like to present , and that is that I understand19 your position having to front for  Mayor20 Bloomberg' s decision. But please consider that we21 have presently the same conditions that we had   in22 the 1970s where the price of milk, the price  of23 gasoline, the price of goods are going up and  any24 increase to the tenants will mean a sacrifice  on25 some part.9 
1	4702	I'm also asking you, this  is3 what I would like to ask my fellow tenant  leaders4 and people who are here, I would like you to  pick5 up the phone and dial 311 and use that  to6 communicate with the Mayor and tell him  how7 outraged we are at any increase this year or  next8 year on our rent.9 Thank you very much.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11	(Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Julie Hyman.13 Julie, are you here?14 Qiao- Zhu Lin.15 Are you here? Okay.16 And then Elsa Pickering.17 Is she here?18 Okay.19 Mr. Andrews.20 MR. ANDREWS:	Good afternoon,21 ladies and gentlemen.22 My real estate tax went up  $500.23 My insurance went up $450. My utilit ies are up24 $200. Fuel costs went up $500 and the  water25 increase $750 in the last year alone, makes  an12 
1	4712 average of $150 every year for the last  three3 years.4	My average rent is $600. So  at5 least I should get $50 increase per year.  I6 didn't get it. I got $30, $30 and now I'm  waiting7 for the other $80.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where is your9	building?10 MR. ANDREWS:	At Wallington11 Avenue  in the Grand Concourse.12 All right?13 So but that 's only part. The14 worst part is that tenants cannot go much  higher15 either. The City is raising everything and  the16 problem is that the tenants who live there  can't17 go over $650 or $700 or else they can't  live18 there anymore. But there' s no place else to go.19 So there' s a squeeze between the20 landlord and the tenants by the  City21 unconscionably  raise everything and push the22 utilit ies for $500.23 So, guys, you make up your  mind.24 You want to go back  in the	'70s where people25 walked away from buildings, say good - bye, the10 
1	4722	City take over,  it 1    s up to you.3	You should go to lower the  water4 taxes, lower the real estate tax or go to Bush  to5 lower the nat ional tax prices.6 Thank you .7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 (Audience participat ion.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Julie Hyman,10	please.11	MS . JULIE HYMAN:	My name is12 Julie Hyman. I 'm the senior policy analyst at the13 Center for Independence of the Disabled in  New14 York . Thank you for this opportunity to testify .15 I 1  m here to talk about how rent16 increases are going to affect some of our City 1        s17 most economically vulnerable people, people  with18 disabilities.19 Many of the consumers served  by20 CIDNY, my agency, who are fortunate enough  to21 even have a rent controlled or rent  stabilized22 apartment rely solely on Supplemental  Security23 Income or SSI which gives them a monthly  income24 of less than $700 or on SSD, Social  Security25 Disabil ity, which provides them with a little12 
2 less than $1000 per month.3 These individuals are forced  to4 spend an increasingly great er percentage of their5 income, often over seventy- five percent , on6 housing and are frequently forced to  choose7 between paying rent and eating, taking  medicat ion8 or getting much needed medical  supplies.9 Many of these individuals  have10 occupied their homes for a decade or more.  These11 are people with physical  disabilities, cognitive12 disabilities, visual , hearing and mental health13 disabilities.14 The stress of what 's going to15 happen to them when they are priced out of   their16 apartments and end up in nursing homes  or17 shelters that don' t accommodate their18 disabilities  is devastating to their health.19 The situat ion is made even worse20 because people with disabilities under age 62   do21 not benefit  from the SCRIE, the Senior Citizen22 Rent Increase Exemption Program, which  prevents23 the increase in rent from being passed on to   the24 tenant if you are a senior over 62 below  a25 certain income.2 
2	People with disabilities  whose3 incomes are exactly the same, they are  fixed,4 they do not have the option, do not have  access5 to SCRIE. We've been working to expand  the6 program.  The Mayor  - - the former Mayor, the7 current Mayor have never dropped their opposit ion8 to a program that makes so much economic  sense9 and would help so many people.10 That ' s about all I have to say.11 My time is almost up. You've heard all of  the12 reasons why rents should be  frozen.13 People with disabilit ies will14 end up on the street , they will end up in nursing15 homes and they will never get back into  the16 community again.17 Thank you.18 (Audience participat ion.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Qiao- Zhu Lin.20 Is Elsa Pickering here?21 (No response.)2 2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.2 3	After Ms.  - - hold on a second.24 Is Yvonne Tyson here?25 A VOICE:	She already test ified.24 
1	4752 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	She what? She3 already testif ied.4 Dorothy Wilson.5 MS. DOROTHY WILSON:	Hello.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.7 You' ll be after Mr. L i n.8 MR. QIAO- ZHU LIN:	Thank you 9	for giving me the opportunity to speak  in front 1O	of you.11 This is my first t ime to be12 testifying here.13 I've been owning this  apartment14 since 1997 and the tax, the insurance and  the15 labor costs are constantly going  up.16 Just from last year to this  year17 the insurance I have for this property which  was18 $1500 per year, and this year the bill go up to 19	$3000.20 And it get to, you know,  no21 longer be able to afford for this  liability22 insurance. So I had to drop it. There is no way  I23 can afford this insurance.24 For the labor costs I mean  it 's25 going up to - - I'm constantly working  in   the20 
2 building, but from time to t ime I need handyman3 help. I used to be able to get peopl e around $804 a day. Now I have to pay somewhere $120/$150  a5 day to help me to work on  it.6	So the increases is very  much7 necessary. And the tax last year to this year  was8 a twenty percent increase. And for all this,  you9 know, we should have some incentive for,  you10 know, every year to go up.11 Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 (Audience participation. )14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Dorothy15 Wilson, followed by Joseph Porto, and then  Maria16 Candelario.17 Go ahead.18 MS. DOROTHY WILSON:	I live19 right over there on 9th Street , between Second20 and Third. I moved into the neighborhood  in  1981.21 In 1983 , new landlords took over my building.22 The majority of the building  was23 harassed out of their apartments. Everything  you24 hear, the heat , the hot water, there was even  one25 woman who said construction workers fell   through7 
2the roof and robbedher apartment. They did  that3in my building to alittle old lady who was in4the hospital at thet ime. I mean their footprints5 were all over the place.6 The landlord used people  from7 God knows where to do construct ion without8 permits on our apartments. There were  drug9dealers becausethe locks were constantly10malfunctioning.He want ed us out.1112And then gentrif ication set intothis neighborhood. You just have to look  outside13andsee the monstrosity that is going up  across14thestreet. They want ed this neighborhood to be15thenext Times Square practically.16Then on September 25, 1994  my17	apartment building, my apartment , mysteriously18burned down in atwo- alarm fire, cause unknown19according to theFire Department. Yet by law  my20landlord and hisevil despicable lawyers  were21 allowed to falsely accuse me of one thing  after22 the other for eight years.2 3	I was insured. I had money  to24 replace the content of my apartment. It went   to25 the lawyers .24 
2 Then I ran out of the money  to3 pay the lawyers. Then I handled the case  by4 myself. They kept suing me . I lost in civil5 court. I had to appeal in Supreme Court.  All6 three Supreme Court judges ruled in my favor,  but7 I didn 1   t get a penny back  in my  legal fees8 because it costs money to prosecute for  those9 fees.10 And now the landlord 1  s new11 thing, he keeps slicing up the remaining -  there12 are only three people left , twelve units in my13 building from when I moved in. I was the  only14 white English- speaking person and the man who15 talked about the race card, I 1  m a white Anglo-16 Saxon Protestant , the guy with the stupid signs.17 So these people who are here today, these  senior18 citizens,  I don 1    t how  they deal with the19 complexities of the court system. I 1  m an expert20 in the English language and you read these  legal21 documents.  If you try to handle your own things,22 it 1  s impossibl e.23 And your eyes are glazing  over24 here today because most of these people  are25 senior citizens. The men and women who  are2 
1	4792 toiling all day at work, the don' t have time  for3 this.4 The only reason I'm here  is5 because this whole ordeal made me so sick, I  have6 a non- visual ailment disability. And this7 happened all during my court  cases.8 Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11	MS. DOROTHY WILSON:	If I have12 a couple of seconds left.13 I just don' t how14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' re15 actually - -16 MS. DOROTHY WILSON:	I got17 through this twenty years of this  horror.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' re19 actually over.20 MS. LUSSKIN:	Before your21 building burnt down,22 MS. DOROTHY WILSON:	Yes.23 MS. LUSSKIN:	was it a24 regular rent stabilized apartment or SRO  type25 building?12 
2 MS . DOROTHY WILSON :	No . It 's3 not  - - rent stabilized. Most  of the people  were4 rent control .5	When I moved in, I took a  reni6 stabilized lease. And hardly anyone' s left and7 they've sliced all of the one-bedrooms into  three8 bedrooms.9	And my landlord , they can afford10 to because I know what the new people are  paying.11 I'm very act ive in my building.12 And I 'm telling you that the13 whol e building burnt down . I was on an overseas14 business trip. I had to ruin my career because  it15 was mostly international work I did. But if  I16 hadn' t had flammable arts and crafts material in17 my closet , the fire would have spread to the18 entire building.19 As a result of my zip strip  and20 wood furnishing stuff it all focused and blew  up21 and really torched my apartment and the next  door22 apartment , who is a starving East Village artist23 and penniless. They bought him out for like  a24 dime. It was more money than he had ever  seen.25 (Audience part icipation. )10

MARIA CANDELARIO :	He' s9	ahead of me?10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	What?11	MS . MARIA CANDELARIO:	He 's12 ahead of me?13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, yes.14 You' re next after this gentleman.15 Go ahead , Mr. Porto .16 MR . JOSEPH PORTO :	Hello!17 Thank you for allowing me  to18 speak .19 Okay. I'm here to give you  a20 picture of my cost increases in the last year  and21 along with the details of tenancies that I  have22 been dealing with and maybe I can get  some23 understanding from bot h sides.24 My oil bill is so large that  I25 have to charge it on my credit card . This year it12 
2 easily doubled  from last year.  I used to - -  to3 give you an example, I used to pay 80 cents  a4 gallon during the winter mont hs. It was $1.60 a5 gallon. It has come back down to about $1.30  a6 gallon.  That ' s about  $12,000 a year for me.7 The insurance has more  than8 doubled. It used to be $3700 a year. Now it 's 9	$8700. Ever since 9/11.10 It ' s interesting.  There was a11 fire in my building . The Fire Department got12 there only moments before I did. I helped  them,13 you know, to save the building and prevent  the14 tenants from getting, you know, their apartments15 burned .16 But that hasn' t stopped tenants17 from suing me.18 The taxes have increased  twenty19 percent , from $9000 per year to $12,000 per year.20 I have rent stabilized tenants21 in my building in three- bedroom apartments paying22 $350 a month. Come on! Three bedrooms paying  $35023 a month.24 Two of the tenants in my25 building, one is twenty- eight years old. He10 
2 inherited the apartment  through succession3 rights. I know	e didn' t live there before he4 inherited the apartment , but he produced these5 tax returns that showed he lived there. And  that6 was good enough for the  judge.7	As a result he is living in  a8 three - bedroom apartment  for $233 a mont h.9 It 's unbelievable but it 's true.10 He arbitrarily stops paying  the11 rent whenever he feels like it. He  claims12 repairs. He' s creating the problems himself. He13 doesn' t allow me to get inside to do the repairs.14 This is going on all the time.15 I've taken him to court.  Talk16 about legal fees. For the last three years  I've17 been in court with this guy. I must have  spent18 about $12,000 just trying to get $200 a  month19 from him.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to21 wrap up.22 MR. JOSEPH PORTO:	That 's it.23 I'm done.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where' s your25 building?8

I'm14 a tenant living at University Avenue in  the15 Bronx.16 I'm not  - - okay. Thank you very17 much, sir.18 I say no to another rent19 increase.20 (Audience participation .)21 MS. MARIA CANDELARIO:	No, no,22 no. No mas, no mas	(speaking Spanish) . Enough is23 enough. Basta.24 (Audience participation. )25 MS. MARIA CANDELARIO :	As I12 
2 tried to say before, my name is Maria  Candelario.3 As you see I have gray hair. Okay? I'm a   senior4 citizen going into seventy- three years old.5 Okay? I'm proud of my  age.6	But my low income, my  Social7 Security check does not go up every t ime that you8 people there, sitting there, feel like  increasing9 the rent .10 (Audience participation.)11 MS. MARIA CANDELARIO:	My12 government does not increase my rent , my Social13 Security.14 You think it 's fair that every15 time you feel like raising the rent , you think16 government  is going to fix my  - - increase  my17 Social Security?18 All the people who work in  those19 factories they are going to increase  their20 salaries? Or for the disabled?  No.21 But it 's good for you because22 I'm sure your income must be about $100 , 000 a23 year.24 (Audience participat ion.)25 MS. MARIA CANDELARIO:	It's7 
2 maybe more.3 So what about us?4 As you all know, because you  are5 very professional , well - educated people, you  will6	know that the homeless population in New  York7 City is very, very high. Don't you think it 's a8 shame for us New Yorkers that the police have  to9 route all these people off the trains  every10 winter? Don't you think for yourself how  could11 you sleep at night when all of these people  are12 living in misery in the train?13 (Audience participation. )14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 MS. MARIA CANDELARIO :	Okay.16 Let me tell you one thing.17 (Audience participation. )18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.19 MS . MARIA CANDELARIO:	Let me20 tell one thing.21 I'm seventy- two years old. I22 maybe one day, soon  (unintelligible) leave New23 York. And I refuse to do it. I refuse to be  a24 burden for my children. And I refuse to  be25 homeless.9

TERENCE O'LEARY:	Sorry.14 My wife and I are small  property15 owners in Ridgewood , Queens. We have a rent16 controll ed apartment in one of the buildings. We17 spent about $2000, as one of the other  speakers18 said , trying to get a holdover action completed19 on one tenant on the same  floor.20 We got him evicted  successfully.21It cost about$2500. He moved in with the  rent22controlled.23A VOICE:	Bravo!24CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet .25MR. TERENCE O'LEARY:	These are
2 the types of headaches that you run into as  a3 landlord as opposed to the increases that we  get4 with the insurance , the water bill , the taxes   and5 all the other raises.6	Those numbers cannot be met  with7 the small increases that you are considering.  We8 really need a signif icant increase.9 And I would recommend the10 smallest  - - the lowest number to be the  last11 increase that you gave. When we could do  that12 legally with the last increase, we were able  to13 keep the operation running. Otherwise, we may  be14 forced to sacrifice the  building.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 MR. TERENCE O'LEARY:	Thank17 you .18 (Audience participation. )19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Stewart20 Holmes.21 MR. STEWART HOLMES:	Good22 evening, Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Members  of23 the Board.24 On Thursday, June 17th, this25 Board will conduct the final vote on  matters7 
2 which will impact upon the economic future  of3 millions of New Yorkers. The elderly,  the4 disabled, peopl e on fixed incomes and workers5 making minimum or near minimum wage will be  the6 most severely affected. Many will be forced  out7 onto the streets.8	Middle income families, already9 struggling with the high cost of housing,  will10 have their budgets stretched to the  breaking11 point forcing them to consider the wisdom  of12 remaining  in City residence.13 The Rent Guidelines Board  was14 established many years ago with the mandate  to15 prot ect affordable housing while ensuring that16 property owners made an equitable  profit.17 Unfortunately, in years when18 owner operating costs were unchanged , as has19 happened three times in the last dozen years,   the20 Board has approved increases anyway. Year   after21 year the Board has approved rent  increases22 greater than justified by the facts of your   own23 annual studies.24 These increases have become  part25 of the base and are compounded with each  lease9 
2 renewal . This Board has ensured that landlords3 are making a very equitable profit. The  question4 seems to be what has become of  affordable5 housing.6 Studies on housing affordability7 will tell you that once a family spends more  than8 thirty percent of its income on housing,  it9 becomes unaffordable . Yet over fifty percent of10 New Yorkers spend more than thirty percent  for11 housing,12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. STEWART HOLMES:	many14 paying as much as fifty percent of their  income15 on housing, some of which is substandard  housing.16 With the rising rate of17 unemployment currently at 8.4 percent , a 518 percent decline in real wages and record  numbers19 of families in City shelters, one thing is clear .20 Any increase will be a devastating blow to  the21 low and moderate- income New Yorkers who are22 already reeling from the post 9/11 fallout .23 Dist inguished Members of the24 Board, I ask that this year you turn a deaf  ear25 to the powerful landlord lobby crying wolf .2 
1	4912 Reject another unaffordable  rent increase and3 give tenants the relief they need and  deserve.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 (Audience participation.)6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Janet Bulan.7	MS. JANET BULAN:	Good evening.8 My name is Janet Bulan and  on9 leaving the building	I got my tax bill. And I got10 so upset I forgot my speech. So bear with  me.11	Coming down here every year is12 very painful. It 's like having your teeth13 extract ed. But I do year after year because I14 think it's so important that you understand  what15 it is to be a small landlord in  Manhattan.16 My average regulated rents are  a17 little bit over $325. And my taxes have gone  up18 unbelievably this year with the increase of  the19 18 percent and the reassessment of  property.20 Fuel ,  insurance,  everything has21 gone up. And one thing that was so important to   a22 small owner was the low- rent subsidy allowance23 for people with rents below a certain  amount.24 Now we don' t have that anymore25 and I don' t understand why, because a lot of12 
2 people that live in my building could well  afford3 an increase.4	For example - - it 's an owner-5 occupied building. We've owned it since 1920 .6 It ' s 125 years old. It is very costly to  make7 repairs and to maintain the building but we do  so8 and have done so since my grandparents  lived9 there.10 The increases that we need  to11 maintain the building have gone up so much.  But12 the people who have lived there since 1975,  like13 this one gentleman I have  - - he moved  in  '75 at14 the age of twenty. He' s now fifty and he has his15 own business. He' s making well over $100, 000 and16 he is paying a very low rent . He could afford to17 pay and he wouldn' t go somewhere else because he18 loves the building. He loves what we do for  him,19 he loves the neighborhood, which is  fine.20 But we should somehow, with  all21 your studies and your programs, maybe there is  a22 way that you could figure out , people who really23 deserve a rental apartment could live there , but24 people who can afford to pay more, if they  are25 there, they should help put in the amount  of5 
2 money needed  - -3 (Audience participat ion.)4	MS . JANET BULAN:	- - to keep5 the building going .6 (Audience participation. )7	MS. JANET BULAN:	I think my -89	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, it is.10 MS . JANET BULAN:	Okay.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 (Audience participation .)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hilda Chavis.14 MS . HILDA CHAVIS:	Coming.15 She'll be followed by Arnold16 Fine, and Mr . Fine will be followed by Stanley17 Michels.18 MS. HILDA CHAVIS:	My name is19 Hilda Chavis. I live in the Morris  Heights20 Sect ion of the Bronx .21 As you can see, I am a  senior22 citizen, disabled and , therefore, I am living on23 a fixed income. But my role here tonight is  not24 just for myself. I am a member of the  Northwest25 Bronx Community & Clergy Coalition.10 
2	I co- chair its housing3 committee. We are made up of nine  neighborhoods4 and at last count we had a membership of  55005 tenants.6 In the Northwest Bronx two-7 bedrooms currently now are commonly rent ing at a8 minimum of $800 a mont h rent , and three- bedrooms9 at a minimum of $1100 .10 The rents in my neighborhoods11 are getting higher and higher because they  are12 being fueled by the high rent deregulation,  the13 vacancy bonus allowance and the MCI  increases14 that landlords are allowed, and recently  the15 recent legislative change which allows  landlords16 now on renewal lease to increase rents in   certain17 cases $200, $300, $400 a month  rent.18 And now we are facing  another19 rent increase. This is the pending rent  increases20 that you will be voting on on June  17th.21 Without a doubt it w i l l cause a22 hardship for many people in our community.  Many23 of our community members are low and  moderate-24 income people and they are paying now, many  of25 them, forty to fifty percent of their income  in3 
2	rents.3	Now this is with conditions in4	the Nort hwest Bronx5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to6	wrap up.7	MS. HILDA CHAVIS:	- - with many8 buildings in poor condit ion. They are living  with9 falling ceilings, rats and roaches, mold  and10 mildew and poor repairs, with lack of heat  and11 hot water.12 For these reasons that I  have13 mentioned we tenants are demanding a rent   freeze.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 (Audience participation. )16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Fine.17 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oh, sure.19 There is a question.20 MS. HILDA CHAVIS:	Yes.8 
21 MS. HOLDER:	Hl'  .I22 coming this evening, Ms.  Chavis.
Thanks for
23 The tenants that belong to your24 Coalition, are they all rent stabilized  tenants?25 MS. HILDA CHAVIS:	Yes, they8 
2	are.3 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.4 And you testified as to what  the5 apartments are renting for. Have you seen  an6 increase in the number of , within your membership7 the number being affected by MCis?8 MS. HILDA CHAVIS:	Actually9 right now the thing that ' s raging  in our10 neighborhoods  is something that I alluded to11 earlier, and that is the recent legislat ion that12 allowed landlords to  take preferential	rents and13 raise them to the legal regulated rent on  lease14 renewal.15 We've seen tenants receive  $230,16 $330 , $400 rent increases  in their rent .17 MS. HOLDER:	You' re talking18 about what the change in the law last  year19 allowed.20 MS. HILDA CHAVIS:	Exactly.21 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.22 And just one other  question.23 With the conditions that  you've24 seen, are you seeing a lot of vacancies in  the25 Bronx?5 
2 MS. HILDA CHAVIS:	No. I'm sure3 there are some, but we don' t see a lot of4 vacancies. We see people fighting to get  their5 buildings brought up to code and  landlords6 raising their rents.7 Like last year when they  got8 that nice rent increase, they did not  make9 repairs. We have to take them to court and  we10 have to fight in ways that I will not even  bore11 you with tonight.12 MS. HOLDER:	Are tenants having13 any success getting rent reduction  orders?14 MS. HILDA CHAVIS:	Not so far.15 There are some pending, but  not16 so far.17 MS. HOLDER:	Okay. Thank you so18 much.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you. I20 appreciat e it.21 (Audience part icipation.)22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Mr. Fine.23MR. ARNOLD FINE:Yes.24My name is ArnoldFine. I have a25six- familybuilding  in Brooklyn.
2 I used to speak at these3 hearings when they were at Police Plaza,  but4 frankly I've pretty much given up because I don' t5 think this Board does anything whether it 's for6 the tenants or for the  landlords.7 (Audience participation .)8	MR. ARNOLD FINE:	These9 increases are ridiculous . The costs are10 skyrocketing.  Taxes have gone up  - -  last year I11 paid $24,277. This year it 's going to fifty- one12 eighty- one with the tax increase, plus the13 reassessment which I haven' t seen yet. And I14 don' t know how much that is going to be.15 So that cost is going up  over16 $1000 . I mean where am I going to get this?17 Last year I got two rent18 increases of 7.5 percent. I was so lucky. It  came19 out to $1255. Meanwhile my bills went up  last20 year $3436. So where did I make out on  this?21 The tenants are all crying  here22 they can't afford it. Well , let me tell you23 something. Where were these tenants last  year24 when they raised the taxes 18 percent? They  got25 to pay this increase. They don't complain  about9 
2 that.3 (Audience participation .)4	MR. ARNOLD FINE:	I never heard5 one tenant complain about that. Why don't  you6 come out and complain about the tax  increase?7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mr. Fine, you8	need to talk to us.9	(Audience participation.)10 MR . ARNOLD FINE:	The taxes11 the gas	water and sewer went up from  $2200 to 12	$2390.13 (Audience participation. )14 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	Insurance is15 up now from $2500, they raised me to $2900.  They16 took away my umbrella of $10 million. They  took17 away the lead paint . They eliminated that and18 they wanted me to pay $2900 .19 I got it down where I got a  $220 million umbrella and I got the insurance down   to21$2300. But thiscan' t go on . I mean these costs22keep increasingexponent ially year after year23after year .24(Audience participation.)25MR. ARNOLD FINE:	And on these
1	5002 increases, where I get $1255, with four  leases3 coming up this year, and you are not going  to4 give me the same increases I got last year,  I'm5 losing money.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 (Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Michels.9 MR. STANLEY MICHELS:	Good10	evening.11	I'm Stanley Michels. I used to12 be a Councilmember.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I know.14 You see, even with term limits15 you're still with me.16 MR. STANLEY MICHELS:	Well , I17 had said I wasn' t running. But that 's another18 issue.19 Let me say this. I was  for20 twenty- four years a member of the Housing and21 Buildings Committee of City Council. In fact ,  I22 was the senior member. And the title I liked  the23 most was defender of rent control and  rent24 stabilization because I think it  needed25 defending.12 
2 The fact of the matter is  that3 the legislation that required this hearing,  these4 hearings, was passed by me. It was  my5 legislation. I'm very proud of that. And I  thank6 you for your attending and being here and  doing7 what the law says you should be doing,  listening8 to the tenants and the  landlords.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I think I'm10 going to ask the Mayor to appoint you to  the11 Board here so we can  - -12 (Audience participation.)13 A VOICE:	Good idea.14 MR. STANLEY MICHELS:	A lot of15 people  would  like that .16 (Audience participation. )17 MR. STANLEY MICHELS:	Let me18 say this. The real issue here today, Marvin,  the19 real issue here today is affordabl e housing.20 We have all read The New  York21 Times real estate section. We know how  much22 housing  - -  the cost of housing,  what apartments23 are going for with the rentals. The rentals  are24 out of this world.25 The average co-op in New York  is10 
2 $1 million in Manhattan. And all the  other3 boroughs are suffering as  well.4 And we have to make sure  that5 housing is affordable because we cannot afford  to6 pay for people that are homeless .7 (Audience participation.)8	MR. STANLEY MICHELS:	We have9	to shelter our homeless  people.10 For many years	for many years11 this Board has sat and many t imes, as mentioned12 here earlier, and you gave increases when  no13 increases were warranted.14 This is a time when we have  to15 keep tenants in their apartments and we have  to16 keep apartments affordable.17 Landlords used to come here  and18 complain that they weren' t making it , they were19 losing  their buildings.  They  just wanted  to stay 2 O	even.21 Now they seem to be coming  here22 and saying I need a bigger prof it. That 's what I23 hear today.24 (Audience participation.)25 MR. STANLEY MICHELS:	I don't21 
2 think any landlord is losing money in this  City.3 And if they are, it 's their own fault because4 they are not running a decent  building.5	(Audience participation. )6	MR. STANLEY MICHELS:	Not every7 landlord  - and I think some of the - - not   every8 landlord has to be a millionaire.  They should9 make a comfortabl e living. Tenants should be  able10 to live there with affordable prices and  we11	should be able to have good stocking stock and12 continue  to have people  - -  affordable  housing for13 everybody to live decently.14 And if these rents keep going  up15 as I understand that you are thinking of  doing,16 and I hope you don' t , you are going to put more17 people on the street and more people are going - 1819 (Audience participation. )20 MR. STANLEY MICHELS:	to be21 in homeless shelters and we are going to have  a22 terrible problem in the City.23 So I would think that you  would24 look at your staff reports, look at the  staff25 reports in the past , and you will see that19 
2	affordability is the big issue . We have an3 obligation to the peopl e of this City to make4 sure that their housing can be affordable  and5	everybody can live and we don' t have to put6 people in homeless shelters.7 And that ' s what 's going to8 happen.9 Landlords are making a lot of10 money . You know how they are making it? Through11	vacancy decontrol.12 We don' t have any idea how many13 apartments are being vacated. And when they  get14 near that  $2000 mark  - - hopefully  they don't get15 vacancies . But  once those apartments  are vacant ,16 no matter what the rental was in  most17 neighborhoods,  they become vacancy decontrolled18 and the sky is the limit is what they can  charge19 because they are now decontrolled .20 The problem - -21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to2 2	wrap up .23 MR . STANLEY MICHELS:	I 'm24 wrapping up right now.25 The point is the landlords  are23 
2 making money.  They should consider  - - you  know,3 they can work with tenants and they can work  with4 tenants if the landlords would understand  that5 tenants have to be able to afford the  apartment.6 Thank you very much.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,8 Mr. Michels.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Good to see11 you.12 Loren Renz . Loren Renz.13 MS. LOREN RENZ:	Good evening,14 Members of the Rent Guidelines  Board.15 My name is Loren Renz . I am  here16 to tell you about my house on the Upper  West17 Side. I've owned it for twenty- four years. It 's18 my home, my only property. The house has  eight19 stabilized units including four that have  been20 continuously occupied for more than twenty- five21 years.22 Due to long - term  tenancy, two-23 year leases and a decade of unfairly  low24 increases, the rents for these  apartments,25 between $523 and $578, are extremely low for  my8 
2 neighborhood  and really for all Manhattan.3 As experts in housing, you  know4 that these rents don' t cover costs. The City5 charges more for publ ic housing. And as one of6 the earlier speakers said , people in these7 apartments are not poor and they are not  not8 working. They are couples, professional  working9 couples, paying $523 for a one- bedroom apartment10 on 80th Street on the Upper West  Side.11 For years I've managed  to12 support these low rents with my own salary  and13 income from the other four units, which  have14 experienced recently in the last ten years  the15 normal turnover and  increases.16 I figured if I waited long17 enough, I would get back an apartment every  five18 years. That was okay as long as costs also  went19 up gradually. But just in the last two years,  my20 taxes jumped almost $6 , 000, that 's thirty- three21 percent , my gas heat and electric bills22 skyrocketed.23 Here are my bills. I'm  leaving24 them for your attention. I hope you' ll look at25 them.2 
2 In January	'02 , gas heat c6st 473 cents per therm. One year later I paid 60   cents4 and this past January the price was 75 cents, up5 sixty- five percent in two years.6 El ectricity was seven percent7 this year - - this past January - - I'm sorry -   it8 was 7 cents a kilowatt  in January	'02. This9 February it was 13 .7 cents or double. If  you10 don' t believe me, please do look at the bills.11	One last figure , next month when12 I renew my insurance policy, the premium  will13 rise they told me a minimum of twenty- five14 percent or about $1000.15 So what is a regulated owner  to16 do? I myself have become increasingly  frustrated17 and angered by low rents.18 They can't be justified in  this19 economy. I am asking you to impose a surcharge   on20 the rents of long - term tenants until they start21 to cover a fair share of operating  costs.22 I also ask you to vote for  an23 eight percent increase for two- year leases and24 four percent	for a one- year lease to help25 compensat e us - -12

LOREN RENZ:	- - that9started lastyear.10Higher increases are  especially11 important for two- year leases since these tenants12 have not yet paid a nickel toward the 17  percent13 cost hike that owners had to bear last  year.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 MS. LOREN RENZ:	I ask you to16 be fair .17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,18 Ms. Renz.19 (Audience participat ion.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next four21 speakers are - - is Maryanne Little   here?22 MS.

WILLIAM CLARK:	Here.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You here?4 Myron Steger or Steger?5	A VOICE:	What number are you?6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Myron is 142.7 A VOICE:	Yes, he' s here.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	He's here.9 Then Richard Faulkner .10	Okay.11	Go ahead, Maryanne .12 MS. MARYANNE LITTLE:	Good13 evening, Rent Guidelines.14 My name is Maryanne Little.  And15 I'm from the Bronx. I'm also part of  the16 Northwest Bronx Coalit ion.17 Okay. Thank you. This is  the18 first time I'm speaking now on my  own.19 First of all, in 1987 I became20 ill, lost my job and I had to get Section  8.21 Section 8 paid most of my rent because of  my22 illness. Plus I became ill.23 I feel like if these rent24 guidelines  are passed ,  I feel that senior25 citizens, disabled should receive increase  of12 
2 twenty- five percent of their income, and also3 retire. Also people with a maximum, that  are4 making $6.50 an hourly rate, that should be  also5 an increase for them also.6 I can't afford to pay anything7 higher unless  I get part - time job. That 's one8 thing I do know.9 Okay.10 If these increases are passed,11 the 5.5 to the 7.5 on the increase , it's  passed ,12 we , as citizens of the Bronx cannot afford these13 increases due to the fact that most of us  are14 low- income and middle - income people.15 With all of the rats that are  in16 the Bronx, also building maintenance not  being17 done, which should be done properly to  standard,18 which is not done, how we citizens of the  Bronx19 are going to be able to keep up our  health20 insurances and things like  that?21 I feel that if the rent22 guideline is passed, the Bronx will not be  an23 affordable place to live anymore.24 That 's all I have to  say.25 MS. KAUFMAN:	Thank you.2 
2	William Clark.3	MR . WILLIAM CLARK :	Members of4 the Board:5 I'm going to address my  comments6 especially to those Members of the Board  that7 represent the public as opposed to the owners  and8 the tenants.9	A VOICE:	Can' t hear .10 MR. WILLIAM CLARK:	Right now11 it is virtually impossible to find a studio  in12 Manhattan that 's less than $1200. Then when you13 go to rent one, you find out the legal rent  is14 actually around $1800 and there' s a rider that15 you have to sign that , because the market won' t16 bear the legal rent , but the landlord is entitled17 to raise the rent by whatever, up to the  legal18 rent the next time it becomes  vacant.19 So - but the problem is you  move20 in, you find out that your neighbor is  paying21 $500 or something equally ridiculous for a  three-22 bedroom apartment .23 That 's what we've created here24 is a two- tier system where what ever percentage is25 decided on tonight is going to affect very few   of10 
1	5122 the people who are paying  $1200 to $1800 for  an3 apartment  that ' s small and it 's going to be4 virtually meaningless in the pockets of  the5	landlords or to the benefit of the buildings  for6 people who have these very large  apartments.7 And so what I propose at  this8 point is just that , instead of simply passing  the9 straight line percentage increases, as what  used10 to be done in the past , there was a surcharge for11	ridiculously cheap apartments. So that people who12 are paying humongously  cheap  - - and have  huge13 apartments and are paying ridiculously low  rents14 would bear more of the price of your  increases15 and fees like oil and insurance and  taxes.16 Because - -17 MS. KAUFMAN:	Quiet.18 MR. WILLIAM CLARK:	- - what is19 happening is that rent stabilization has  turned20 into this situation where they are not  just21 protected  from landlords, they' re protected from22 everything in life that goes up in  price.23 And so I would ask24 (Audience part icipat ion. )25 MR. WILLIAM CLARK:	- - as12 
2	somebody - -3 MS. KAUFMAN:	Quiet.4 (Audience participation. )5	MR. WILLIAM CLARK:	- - as6 somebody who represents those who are now  going7 from their  full - time day job to their part - time8 job so that they can pay $1800 a month for  a9 studio and can't be here to speak, to give  them10 some relief and at the same time allow  landlords11 to take care of their  buildings.12 (Audience participation. )13 MS. KAUFMAN:	Myron Steger.14 MR. MYRON STEGER:	My name is15 Myron Steger and I am seventy- eight years old  and16 I am a tenant at the Empire Hotel on West  63rd17 Street , an SRO building, where I have lived for18 many, many years.19 And I am here to speak  for20 myself and on behalf of the other  stabilized21 tenants.22 Whil e I am fortunate and still23 active, in the foreseeable future this will  not24 be so. My peers at the SRO hotel are elderly   and25 not able to pay market  rents.6 
2 Subsistence in some instances3 depends upon a Social Security check which  hardly4 covers their current rent and food needs.  Any5 increase cuts into their ability to  sustain6 themselves.7	Landlords are enjoying a one8 hundred percent occupancy rate, in many,  many9 instances getting much, much more than  the10 apartments are worth. Some of their good  luck11 should be passed along to those who do not  have12 such a healthy cash flow.13 (Audience participation. )14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How many15 units are there in the Empire that  are16 MR. MYRON STEGER:	There are a17 couple of hundred units.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.19MR. MYRON STEGER:But these20arethelast- -the hotel has beensold.21CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Right.22MR. MYRON STEGER:And we' re23just the last oneshanging on who they are  trying24to get rid of. Andknowing the housing situation,25you know the f ightthat ' s going on.
1	5152	Okay?3 (Audience participation.)4 MR. ZAK:	I'm also in the Hotel5 Empire. There' s 514 doors. There are about twenty6 people left. There' s one guy they put out a  few7 weeks ago. They told him they were going to   start8 working on his floor. They told him they  were9 going to gut the building and they got him  out.10 Now he' s sorry.11 He paid $5000 living in an  hotel12 in order to find an apartment . He' s paying $160013 a month and was paying $400 a month. After  about14 a year- and - a- half he' ll be dipping into his own15 savings.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 MR. ZAK:	This is the Hotel18 Empire.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 Mr. Faulkner, Richard  Faulkner.21 MR. RICHARD FAULKNER:	Hello,22 everyone.23 I'm Richard Faulkner and I'm  a24 Brooklynite, went through all the schools,  public25 schools, grammar school and high school , Brooklyn5 
2	Tech, Polytechnic  Institute, all in Brooklyn.3	I married in '54	well , I was4 in the Navy for a year in the middle of that.  And5 I married  in  ' 54 and my oldest  son was born in6 '55 , in February.7 In December,  I bought  my eight -8 family building and , of course, at that time it9 was rent controlled. That was forty- nine years10 ago.11 Since then we have gone  from12 rent control to rent stabilization. During  that13 time	well before actually that , I have to14 mention that when rent control started  and15 especially just after the war, there were  court16 cases complaining that the rent system was  a17 taking of property without just  compensation.18 The only figures I can give  you19 that might  demonstrate  that would be that  - - this20 is not Manhattan, this is Brooklyn, like  Queens,21 the Bronx and other places away from  Manhattan.22 We have a local market  rent23 which is below that HUD rent which is  for24 destructive people. But it turns out to be a  rent25 that allows a property to be occupied by  people8 
2	at affordable rates.3	On the other hand, that  market4 rate is also high enough to give the landlord  a5 minimum  profit  bordering  on six percent .6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to7	wrap up, Mr. Faulkner.8 MR. RICHARD FAULKNER:	Okay.9 My rents when I started  were10 $40. Now they are around $1000. The  difference11 between the local market rent and the rent that  I12 have been able to collect amounts to  $1,434,72013 over the forty-nine years.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. You15 need to wrap up.16 MR. RICHARD FAULKNER:	The17 amount I collect ed was $1,152,000. And the market18rent yieldedtwo million nearly six  hundred19thousand .20CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21Thank you.22(Audience participation.)23CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' re at No.24144.25We have Elizabet h Negron. Is she
2here?3MS. ELIZABETH NEGRON:	Right4here.5CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Elsa6Pickering.Youback? Yes?7A VOICE:	She's coming.8CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	She' s coming.9Are you Elsa?10Go ahead , Elizabeth  Negron.11MS. ELIZABETH NEGRON:	This12seems a littlehigh.13My name is Elizabeth  Negron.14People in New York City are  not15 saving to buy a house. We are apartment  dwellers.16 We make our lives here.17 Ask what the landlords  are18 gett ing now? My young neighbors next door  across19 the hall are paying $4500 a month to live in  a20 two- bedroom apartment. Providing they never miss21 a day at work, it takes three strong  healthy22 people to make the monthly rate. That 's $1500  per23 person.24 For $4500 a mont h my neighbors25 get none of the expected amenities. We have   no15 
2doorman,noelevator, not even a dumbwait er. We3are justanold East Village tenement.4The average hole- in- the- wall5 studio gets $2200 a month . Yet landlords would6 have you believe that $1500 a month would  have7 you living in luxury.8 When our landlord decided  to9 rent his commercial space, our building  was10 disrupted, loud music rocked the building.  Still11 the tenants were afraid to complain and  their12 fear was not unfounded.13 Each year new tenants must  sign14 a new lease. Each year the rent goes up.  Last15 year my new neighbors had a $900 increase  over16 the year before. And the new leases do  not17 include an option to renew which means  the18 landlord can order new tenants to relinquish19 their homes on a whim.20 Finally, there' s the landlord' s21 cash cow. Unlike the suburbs, many if not most  of22 New York City' s resident ial buildings include23 tremendously  lucrative commercial  spaces. One24 East Village landlord has two commercial   spaces25 on the ground floor of one of his  residential5 
2 buildings.  Together the two restaurants occupying3 those spaces pay at least $50,000 a month. Is  it4 any wonder that the restaurants must charge  $105 for a bowl of rice.6 For a while this landlord  and7 others like him found themselves  doing8 exceedingly well. But soon the landlord' s9 contractors began eating at those restaurants  and10 realized that their money isn't going as  far.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to12 wrap up.13 MS. ELIZABETH NEGRON:	So the14 contractors informed the landlord that they  are15 going to need more money to pay for that $10  bowl16 of rice. And that is when the landlord  lobbies17 the RGB to discuss the rising cost  of18 maint enance.19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 Elsa Pickering.22 MS. ELSA PICKERING:	Well , I'm23 not a speaker and I'm really nervous.  But I	my24 name is Elsa Pickering and I lived in a  rent25 stabilization apartment owned by Fips Houses  and2 
2 I'm a grandmother of two lead poisoned  children.3 And  I really  find it , you know,4 terrible that besides these landlords  or5 slumlords, whatever you want to call  them,6	(Audience participat ion.)7	MS. ELSA PICKERING:	they' re8 not the ones that are going to fix  their9 apartments because they are always going to  be10 like that.11 The rent increase is not  going12 to help them change.13 I'm just too nervous to talk.  I14 just wanted to say that I find it ridiculous  that15 everyt hing that I have gone through, that I would16 have to pay a rent increase  also.17 Thank you.18 (Audience participation. )19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma' am.20 Just a quick question.21 Are you saying your22 grandchildren got poisoned at Fips Houses, or   are23 you - -24 MS. ELSA PICKERING:	Yes. I'm a25 Fips Houses tenant.8 
1	5222	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And they live3	with you, the grandchildren?4 MS. ELSA PICKERING:	Yes, they5 do.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And which7	building is this?8	MS. ELSA PICKERING:	It 's 6419	West 169th Street.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.11 Go ahead. You have a  question?12 Go ahead.13 MS. HOLDER:	Yes.14 You are saying 169th Street  in15 Manhattan?16 MS. ELSA PICKERING:	Yes.17 Between Broadway and Fort  Washington.18 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.19 And I'm really sorry to  hear20 about the grandchildren.21 What kind of conditions did  you22 or do you currently have?2 3	MS. ELSA PICKERING:	Well ,24 there was peel ing paint and there was, you know,25 water leakage. I don't know which it was  from.24 
  2 But we went  for a test. It ' s what  the children3 have to go through after this is found in  their4 bodies.5 And they are only four and  five6 years old. And if you think that you worry  about7 it when you first found out about it , you have to8 wait until they are teenagers to find out  how9 they developed, if they develop properly or  not.10 MS. HOLDER:	Have you been able11 to get the lead abated and have the  conditions12 been corrected?13 MS. ELSA PICKERING:	They moved14 me out of that apartment into another  apartment.15 It has	the children' s have gone down but not16 enough.17 MS. HOLDER:	I wish your18 grandchildren well. Thank you.19 MS. ELSA PICKERING:	Thank you.20 (Audience participation. )21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Wasim Lone?22 Is he here?23 A VOICE:	Yes.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on one 25	second.2 
2 MR. WASIM LONE:	I'm a tenant3 organizer4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on a5 second.6 The next speaker is  Malikah7 Sherman, Ken Rumments and Willa  McKever.8 MS. WILLA McKEVER:	Kever .9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Kever. Okay .10 Sorry.11 Go ahead.12 MR . WASIM LONE:	Yes. Thank you.13 I'm Wasim Lone and I'm a tenant organizer  with14 the Good Ole Lower East , GOLE .15 And the last thing  the16 neighborhood needs is a rent increase in  my17 opinion. I've been organizing for over ten   years.18 And I'm sure many people have talked about  it ,19 but the face of the neighborhood has changed.   I20 mean the systematic harassment of tenants  is21 going on, from deprivation of services,   illegal22 rent hikes and so- called legal increases as well23 as RGB increases, MCis, things that people  have24 talked about that.25 And  it ' s really killed the10 
2 neighborhoods in terms of there' s been a steady3 decline of the Puerto Rican community over  the4 last fifteen years. There' s been a fifteen5 percent decline of the African- American6 population in the neighborhood.  So it has been7 replaced by upscale corporate culture, yup  people8 and it has really destroyed the  neighborhood.9 The high rents - - on a  daily10 basis at GOLE and other agencies we are  bombarded11 by people coming with non- payment petitions,12 holdover protections. And often these  are13 frivolous litigation. Another  form of harassment14 is to litigat e a tenant until they are exhausted.15 And senior citizens on fixed incomes are  deprived16 of services. And it doesn' t take much to harass  a17 senior citizen. Sometimes you just have to  hang18 up on a senior citizen and the blood  pressure19 goes up and they end up in the hospital and , you20 know, it cannot be documented what has  happened.21 So I want to emphasize there' s22 serious harassment going on in the neighborhood23 to get the low- income tenants out to accommodate24 high rents for landlords who are making a lot   of25 money .2 
2 (Audience participation. )3 MR. WASIM LONE:	And they4 shouldn' t be given an increase. There should be5 no rent increase and preserve affordable  housing.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 (Audience participation. )8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Malikak9	Sherman.10 MS. MALIKAK SHERMAN:	Good11 evening.12 My name is Malikak Sherman  and13 I'm here tonight as a New York City resident  and14 a tenant of a rent stabilized  apartment.15 Because the onerous rent16 increases that have been proposed affect  me17 directly and hurt almost all New Yorkers, I  felt18 compelled to come here tonight and urge you  to19 reject these increases.20 There appears to be a  perception21 at times that rent increases only hurt the  very22 poor or at the very least low- income people23 generally. Some believe that these tenants  are24 just complainers and that they have milked  the25 system for far too long and are not paying  their10 
2	fair share.3	The belief is that the  rent4 stabilization system can no longer support  these5 lower- income people and that they must simply6 move with the times.7	Of course, there are bad8 tenants, but these attitudes are pat ently9 unfounded and the reality is that  rent10 stabilization increases affect vast classes  of11 peopl e.12 I have a degree from an  Ivy13 League school and I have always had well - paying14 professional positions. I've had the benefit  of15 leading a good life with some disposable  income16 with no mouths to feed but my  own.17 Despite this, however, I  now18 find it increasingly burdensome to pay my  own19 rent . It is not only lower- income people who are20 priced out of their apartments in  neighborhoods .21 And I make this point to address the scope of   the22 problem.23 In a city where many peopl e do24 not make six figures and where the median   income25 is under $50 , 000 a year, I am hard -pressed to8 
2 understand how much more you want from  us.3 (Audience participation. )4	MS. MALIKAK SHERMAN:	Judging5 from many of the comments I have heard  landlords6 make  in connect ion with rent increases, there7 appears to be significant resentment  towards8 tenants who are perceived as being undeserving  of9 lower rent.10 I have heard tales of tenants11 who take whirlwind vacations, make a ton of  money12 and make much more money than their landlord.  No13 one is supporting a system where  billionaires14 live in $400 a month apartments. But if  a15 landlord' s complaint is that his or her tenant16 makes more money than them, that is  completely17 unjustified.18 There is nothing wrong with  a19 tenant making more money than his or  her20 landlord. We are not living during the  medieval21 period where landlords could expect to be   actual22 lords and tenants were mere  serfs.23 (Audience participation. )24 MS. MALIKAK SHERMAN:	Landlords25 should not expect property ownership to be  an5 
2 automat ic windfall . I am not opposed to landlords3 making profitable businesses.  But landlords4 assume risks when they decide to buy, lease  and5 manage properties. And while this risk  is6 opt ional , housing is a necessity .7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 (Audience participation. )9 MS. MALIKAK SHERMAN:	Okay.10 Lastly, increasing rents  and11 gradually pricing people out of their homes  not12 only hurts people' s wallets, but harms the social13 fabric of New York City. To think that  increasing14 rents does not affect class and  racial15 stratification in this City is  naive.16 I was born and raised in this17 City and have watched many neighborhoods  change.18 Some peopl e move to the City as young people,  sow19 their wild oats, pay exorbitant rents and plan  to20 eventually leave, move to the suburbs and   settle21 into the quiet life their parents  lead.22 Others of us are lifers,  we23 intend to stay here. Manhattan,  for all practical24 purposes, has been gentrif ied , and increasing25 numbers of people are commuting into the City   not10 
2 out of choice.3 I have lived in cities where  one4 race or class lived downtown and another lived   on5 the outskirts. And  it is not pl easant .6 I implore the Board to allow  us7 to keep New York City a thriving and diverse  city8 and allow us to enjoy the neighborhoods that  we9 call home.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11	MS. MALIKAK SHERMAN:	Thank you12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ken Rumments.14 Is Mr. Rumments here?15 MR. KEN RUMMENTS:	H , I16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	H , I17 MR. KEN RUMMENTS:	Actually it18 seems like you guys have  an easier time  - -  or19 Solomon had an easier  time.20 You asked what a fair rent  hike21 would be. During a famine what would a  fair22 market rate be for a loaf of bread? During such   a23 disaster governments step in to  stop24 profiteering.25 As you've noticed here,  the12 
2 problem also seems to be a problem between short -3 term and long- term people, people who have been4 in their apartments for a long t ime, and5 landlords seem to be losing money .because of  this6 long- term residency, while other people seem not7 to be able to live because they've come fresh  and8 new and have too high a  rent.9 But let me stress what  landlords10 get as a benef it of this long thing that they. 11	don' t get  in their pocket .12 Stabilization  and reasonable13 rents build communities as people stay and  become14 an integral part o{  the places they 1ive in .15 Landlords should not be the only ones to reap  all16 the prof it in the investment of time and others17 risk by increasing their rental income and  their18 future equity at the expense of people who  by19 being good community members made that  all20 possible.21 In my neighborhood the only22 common faces I see are those with stabil ized23 rents and we all say hello to each other  because24 many of us have been there for more than  ten25 years.12 
2 The candy store on the corner3 still has  the bulletproof  glass and the little  -45 I only have that much time .6 sliding glass and little7 sliding windows to purchase things and  prevent8 robbery left over from a scarier  time.9 So does the local liquor  store.10 We stayed because the rents  were11 maintained	low enough that we did not have to  go12 to an even worse place. Now things are  better.13 Those who stayed because of stabilization -  the14 old , the single, the immigrant famil ies, and the15 poor - are now just start ing to reap the benefits16 of the risks we took to live in these places  and17 to make them our home.18 If we had  fled , the landlords19 would have lost all their money and  investments20 as has happened in Newark in the past .21 Now that we 1   ve made this  a22 bett er place because we stayed and cared ,23 increasing the rents more to force us out is  an24 injust ice .25 We have pension checks and5 
2 support checks and low salaries. We entered  out3 leases when we moved in in good faith.  The4 landlord knew this was the law when he  was5 willing to sign us and buy the building.  We6 believed that the law would prot ect us and  in7 some way we still do.8 As tenants of  stabilized9 apartments we want to stay. Each t ime you raise10 the rents some of us have to leave as  our11 salaries and our pensions don' t keep up with the12 raises.13 While new tenants move in  and14 out in two to four years, we want to stay  and15 keep this our home and make this a  community16 despit e the fact that we don' t get equity from17 our apartment. We get a  community,18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to19 wrap up.20 MR. KEN RUMMENTS:	something21 we lose when we are forced out of our  homes.22 Being forced out is being  forced23 out and there is no nice way this  happens.24 Raising rents sends the  message25 that  it ' s okay to push out the founders of a2 
2 community if the landowners can replace them  with3 higher paying residents, that people who build  a4 community have no place to live in the  community5 that they have built with their presence  and6 commitment if its value becomes greater than  it7 was when they settled into  it.8 When  the taxes were  increased ,9 there was no exodus of landlords due  to10 unprofitability,	just a cry that profits  would11 not remain what they have  been.12 Allow this change and13 communities will not remain what they  have14 become.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where do you16 1 ve?17 MR. KEN RUMMENTS:	I live in18 Astoria, Long Island City,  Queens.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thanks.20 (Audience participat ion.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Willa22 McKever.23 MS. WILLA Mc KEVER:	Hello!24 My name is Willa McKever of  192025 Walton Avenue in the Bronx. That 's an 84-unit2 
  2 building.3 I'm here to ask that you  deny4 any rent increase this year on the grounds  that5 it really isn't needed in stabilized  apartment6 houses.7 Our rents have increased on  a8 bi - yearly basis since the early	'80s or before.9 The average rent in my building is $650 for  a10 one - bedroom apartment and $1500 for three rooms.11 Many families are using  more12 than half of their income to pay rent and  find13 that with some rents they have to choose  between14 ConEd , the phone bill  or eating.15 We in the Bronx are  always16 borrowing from Peter to pay  Paul.17 My landlord bought his  building18 for $900,000 in '97 and sold it for $2.5 million 19	in 2004.20 (Audience participation. )21 MS. WILLA McKEVER:	Where' s his22 hardship?23 Operating costs have not24 increased excepting for gas prices. Do car owners25 get to raise anything because the gas went up?  I20 
2 think not.3 When a landlord is only4 collecting rents and not maintaining  their5 building, where are the profits going? Only   in6 their pockets.7 I live on $460 a month budget.8 That doesn't change from year to year. But I  have9 to pay a rent increase every two years .10 In large unit buildings where  a11 landlord does nothing the apartments are moved  in12 and out of more than four t imes a year, which13 with the five percent increase makes that rent  go14 up for each apartment over $200 a  year.15 The landlords are getting  more16 money and we are getting nothing for  it.17 Stop this now. Freeze  these18 things.19 If there' s no big landlords20 here , ain' t nothing here but these little people,21theyneedtosell their buildings and get a  big22one.23CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24(Audience part icipation.)25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Richard Barr.

Sorry.10 147 is where we are . Go ahead.11 MR. RICHARD BARR :	Good12 evening.13 My name is Richard Barr and  I14 live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in  the15 West	'80s .16 And  I 'm sure some of you at17 least are trying to do an honest and fair  and18 impart ial job here. But this is a terribly wrong19 format for these kinds of decisions to be made  in20 my view .21 First and foremost , the Erstadt22 Law has got to be repealed .23 (Audience participation. )24 MR . RICHARD BARR :	New York City25 rent regulat ions have to be made by City10 
2 of ficials who are accountable to their3 constituents.4 (Audience part icipat ion.)5	MR. RICHARD BARR:	The only6 reason - -7 (Audience participation.)8	MR. RICHARD BARR:	The only9 reason why State government would retain  control10 of this is so that participants	in State11 government can be in line for contributions   from12 New York City' s landlord lobby. Otherwise ,13 (Audience participation. )14 MR. RICHARD BARR:	- - we should15 have  - - we  should have home rule.16 Secondly, for the Mayor to  make17 all of the appointments to this Board rather  than18 it to be divided among City Council , Borough19 Presidents, means in my view that it 's not as20 representative of all of the constituents in  New21 York.22 (Audience participation. )23 MR. RICHARD BARR:	And thirdly,24 for you to make decisions based upon just  some25 costs, like rising fuel costs, and not take   into9 
2 account that some landlords, when they  decontrol ,3 and making ten times the rents they made on  the4 controlled apartments, to treat this as if it 's a5 one- size- fits- all where somebody who has three or6 four units in South Jamaica and needs an increase7 gets one and so does someone who owns a  thousand8 units, some of which he' s renting for ten  times9 what he used to after decontrolling makes  no10 sense. It 's unfair.11 (Audience participat ion. )12 MR. RICHARD BARR:	And, lastly,13 I just want to say that some small businesses  are14 in as bad and sometimes a worse situation  than15 small landlords and we need commercial  rent16 control as well.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Joseph19 Siegel , 151.20 MR. JOSEPH SIEGEL:	Thank you21 for letting me speak.22 I live at 45 First Avenue.  It's23 an 80- unit building. Since the very early	'70s,24 it was a building that was converted to  all25 electric. Every tenant in their apartment has  a2 
2 hot water tank as well as electric  baseboard3 heat ing with a thermostat in every apartment.4 I need not to tell you the price5 of electricity these days. I live in a two- room6 apartment and I can just tell you, if  you7 wouldn' t mind looking, our rent bill , our CoEd8 bill is $159. 17 for two small rooms.9 We also go up $179.59, which  was10 in March.11 I'm asking the Board to approve12 some kind of guidelines where the  landlord13 provides no services to the building other  than14 interior lights.15 Every apartment has a hot  water16 tank next to its sink as well as a  thermostat17 that is controlled by the tenant with  electric18 baseboard heating. It 's not fair	it 's an 80-19 unit building	- that the tenants in that20 building, some of them that are on fixed  incomes,21 should be  - -  get the same increases as a  building22 where a landlord is providing heat and hot  water.23 It 's just not fair to the people who live in that24 building .25 I 've also made copies, if you2 
2 wouldn' t mind looking at it , you can look at the3 ConEd bills from the building, from the  separate4 apartments and you can see for yourself that  what5 I'm saying is very true.6 There is no reason for a7 building where our landlord does not provide   any8 services, where he should be allowed to get  the9 same increases as a landlord who is  providing10 heat and hot water as well as other services to   a11 building. He provides none of these services  to12 any of the tenants.13 So I'm just asking if you  would14 not mind, please look at  these.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, we' ll16 look at them.17 (Audience participat ion.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	There' s a19 question, sir. Mr. Siegel , a quest ion.20 MR. ZELNIK:	Actually this isn't21 so much a question to you as it is to my  fellow22 Board Members, but it 's relevant to what you just23 said. And I just would like to get some  feedback24 from the Board because I think this is  an25 appropriat e time to talk about it .2 
2	I don' t know how pervasive	it3 is, buildings that are all electric, ut ilities4 for heating and wat er and so on. But it seems to5 me that if that is the case in fact , there should6 be a different standard in terms of the  guideline7 for that versus a landlord that 's actually paying8 for these.9	I just wonder if that is10 something we can talk about at this point  because11 I don' t know when else we could talk about it.12 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Well , we can13 talk about it right now, but we will talk  about14 it at the meeting.15 A VOICE:	Why not now?16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It's17 perfectly	- -  because  this is a public hearing.18 It ' s perfectly valid at the public meeting   to19 discuss and make a motion for a change for  units20 that have  - - we do it on lofts. Because  it  was21 actually the rationale for lofts as to why  we22 have  a lower number .23 So it ' s ent irely rational to24 discuss  it and raise it at this  point .25 MR. JOSEPH SIEGEL:	If I may10 
1	5432	answer that question.3	This is - - there are maybe three4 buildings in all of the City that are heat ed with5 electric heat.6 (Audience part icipat ion. )7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I think the8 issue is where utilities - and we would have  to9 def ine utilities	-10 MR. JOSEPH SIEGEL:	Well ,11	CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	- - are12 provided  by  - - you know, the tenant now in  many,13 many circumstances,  electricity  is paid directly14 by the tenant. Your situation sounds a  little15 different. Electricity  in the apartment is paid16 by the tenant. Because of the hot wat er17 situation, which is  obviously18 MR. JOSEPH SIEGEL:	And heat.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And heat.20 MR. JOSEPH SIEGEL:	Yes. We21 have a thermostat in every apartment that  you22 have electric baseboard  heating.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I understand.24 MR. JOSEPH SIEGEL:	So if you25 wouldn' t mind, please look at those. It 's 4512 
2 First Avenue. And you can see for yourself  what3 the ConEd bills are for two small  rooms.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I understand.5 We' ll take them. Okay.6 (Audience part icipat ion. )7		CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Irene Rukaj, 8	R - u- k- a- j.9	MS. HOLDER:	Are we going to be10 able to get copies of those  bills?11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.12 MS. IRENE RUKAJ:	Good evening.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good evening.14 MS. IRENE RUKAJ:	My name is15 Irene Rukaj. I live at 2019 Wallace Avenue in  the16 Bronx and I'm here to entertain you  today.17 You are invited to my  building.18 You' re invited to my party. You' ll see the lack19 of service in my apartment when you come in,  and20 the landlord' s lobby you have the dirty floors21 that are never mopped. Our walls are  disgusting,22 have never been painted  for ten years.23 I have an elderly man that  just24 moved from one apartment to another because   his25 apartment was condemned. If I wasn' t an activist10 
2 and I was not his neighbor, I would not know  the3 conditions that this elderly man had been  living4	in.5 When we moved this man to  his6 apartment , his apartment had not been renovat ed7 for fifty years. The walls were coming down,  the8 ceiling was coming down, no sink, mold  everywhere9 and anywhere. How unhealt hy is that for our U.S.10 citizens who at one time served us wherever  they11 worked at one time and paid their  taxes?12 I'm here to tell you as  an13 advocat e to decontrol the landlords. The hell14 with them. Do they care about us? We don' t care15 about them.16 The landlords are quick to  raise17 our rents, but they don' t service our needs.18 The fair market killed the19 tenants. You raise the rents and the living  wage20 stayed the same.21 The landlords have a lot of  risk22 for their profit	- the poor, the homeless  and23 disabled. They have a lot  of accountability.	So24 if you think the gates of heaven are open  for25 them, they have a  surprise.5 
2 Our landlord received a loan  to3 do home improvement and never did it.  The4 electrical wiring is going to be a hazard to  our5 building.6 Because I invite you to  our7 building,	I will tell you, it has never  been8 serviced for more than twenty years. And  this9 does not give our children no dignity. As a  youth10 advisor and youth advocate, I tell them to  be11 proud of where they live.12 How can I tell them to be  proud13 of where they live if their conditions are  nasty?14 I'm here to tell you about  our15 immigrants that live in our building. We  welcome16 them. But our landlords on a regular basis,  they17 rape them. They increase their rents and they  do18 not service them and they are  scared.19 You cannot give them any more20 money because they are not deserving of  this21 money . Until you come to my party and see the22 conditions of my apartment and my building  at23 2019 Wallace Avenue , that is the example of the24 five boroughs and we are  suffering.25 I went to court with the2 
2 landlord to repair my apartment. It took him  not3 thirty days as the judge had subpoenaed him,  he4 took nine months.5 The landlords continuously  like6 us to live in filth. And I'm here to tell  you,7 because you are appointed , because  I don' t  know8 how Mayor Bloomberg is, but you were  appointed.9 You have a lot of judgment in your hands when  it10 comes to the people of the City.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to12 wrap up.13 MS. IRENE RUKAJ:	I only tell14 you one thing. I encourage you to listen to  us15 today, or I will encourage all the five  boroughs16 as an advocate for a rent strike in September  and17 maybe someone will go ahead and say, you  know18 what , we' ll listen to the tenants and then the19 landlords can go ahead and take somebody' s milk20 money.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 MS. IRENE RUKAJ:	Thank you.23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Registration25 has ended upstairs . So there is nobody left to12 
2 register you.3 Linda Zoblotsky.4	MS. LINDA ZOBLOTSKY:	My name is5	Linda Zoblotsky. I live on the Upper West  Side.6	Marvin, have a heart. We do  not7 make six- figure incomes. We do not work for8 Goldman Sachs. I'm unemployed. If you have   any9 jobs, please help us out.10 A lot of your landlord  friends11 are building beautiful	luxury apartments in my12 neighborhood. We cannot afford them. Where  is13 this affordable housing? You want us to  leave14 Manhattan? You want us to leave New York  City?15 Where is it? It 's not in New Jersey because most16 of us don' t have the money for the17 transportation.18 I live from paycheck to  paycheck19 and I borrow from my credit card because I  just20 don' t want to lose my home.21 I've looked and I can't  find22 something that 's cheaper and nicer than the23 apartment I live in with the cracks in the  wall ,24 the mold on the wall and the water  damage.25 Most of us are living on  less7 
2 than $25,000 a year. Tell us - you're  from3 Goldman Sachs - how to manage our money,  where4 should we go. Walk in our  footprints.5 (Audience participation.)6	MS. LINDA ZOBLOTSKY:	Live on7	minimum wage, Marvin.8 (Audience participation.)9 MS. LINDA ZOBLOTSKY:	The City10 is losing SRO units and it ' s losing  rent11 stabilized apartments thanks to luxury  decontrol.12 I know married  couples who13 choose not to have children because they don' t14 want to lose their rent stabilized leases.  They15 can't lose their apartments. There is nowhere  to16 go. Where is the affordable housing for those   of17 us who don' t make a six- figure income?18 Landlord income, it 's going up.19 Rent  - - tenant income is going down.   Homelessness20 is at an all - t ime high. Unemployment	is 8.421 percent.22 Live in our footsteps, those  of23 us who are unemployed. Live from day to  day,24 rejection letter after reject ion letter. And you25 tell me where to go. I can't figure it  out.10 
2	You work for Goldman Sachs.3 You' re so smart. Tell us who are unemployed and4 living on minimum wage what do we  do.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6	(Audience participat ion. )7	MS. LINDA ZOBLOTSKY:	No rent8	increases.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10	(Audience part icipat ion. )11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next four12 speakers are: Walter Gambin, Doris  Charpentier,13 Trina Semorile and John  Stanley.14 A VOICE:	Can you give us an15 idea of what number you are  on?16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. We' re on17 156 and we are just gett ing to the numbers of18 people who didn' t preregist er, which begins on 19	163 .20 We' re at 156. And then everybody21 else that I have left is a handwritten  number.22 And it goes all the way up to 220. That  doesn' t23 mean everybody is here , but it goes up to 220.24 And we are at 156.  Okay?25 Go ahead, Mr. Gambin.20 
2 MR. WALTER GAMBIN:	Okay.3 I'm Walter Gambin. I live at  3454 West  86th Street , the Dexter House ,  in Manhattan.5 It ' s a Class A, Section 248 SRO.6 I had open heart surgery  about7 one year ago. I am now significantly  handicapped8 as to work and physical activity. I get odd  jobs9 here and there and earn an average of $25 to  $3010 a week. I've had to live mostly on savings  this11 last year and they are running  out.12 I am also concerned about  other13 people in ways that do relate somewhat to  my14 needs. I have something of a community of  friends15 at the Dexter House in my neighborhood , in SRO16 Tenants United , my tenants organization, and the17 SRO Law Project which helped develop the  SRO18 Tenants United.19 People are having a hard  time20 making ends meet. In my view a major  factor21 causing this is the hording of money by  greedy22 business people. By and large New York  City23 landlords are, to my knowledge, a good example  of24 this.25 In my building this greed  is2 
2 exemplified in my view by my landlords  taking3 vacat ed rooms illegally away from rental by4 residents in order to illegally renovate  them5 without work permits for illegal rental  to6 transients .7 So now to address the  important8 issue. I cannot afford a rent increase and in  my9 view the landlords, especially those as  compared10 to the ones who do provide services,  the11 landlords who are negligent and wealthy, many  of12 them, they don' t deserve a rent increase.13 And now, lastly, do New  York14 City landlords like to consider themselves to  be15 a relatively law- abiding  lot , living and  working16 at least in synchronicity with the common  good,17 perhaps some of them even contributing to  it?18 If so, then let them  accept ,19 maybe even favor, a law requiring the opening   of20 their books to public scrutiny once a year or   so.21 (Audience participation.)22 MS. KAUFMAN:	Doris Charpentier.2 3	MS. DORIS CHARPENTIER:	Hl• .I24 Good evening.25 My name is Doris Charpent ier and24 
2 I live on the Upper West Side in a  residential3 hotel for women, or it used to be. For  fifty4 years it was the Simmons House Residential  Hotel ,5 Class A, permanent  residents only.6	Then it went downhill.  Then7 suddenly the owners convert ed it illegally to a8 tourist  hotel. It 's an R  zoning, absolutely  no -9 -  it 's totally illegal to have tourists   there.10 They were brought to court. They signed  a11 stipulat ion. They were brought back to court12 because they were violating	it.13 They are still renting  to14 tourists.15 My landlord does not need  any16 increase whatsoever.	If you vote for any increase17 for hotels, SROs and rooming houses - and I  urge18 you to vot e zero increase for them in general -19 but if you insist on having any increase , you20 must include that proviso. If it 's not seventy-21 five percent permanent tenants, they don' t need22 the damn increase.23 My landlord is getting  hundreds24 of thousands of dollars a month on his  illegal25 business. He does not need my  money.7 
2 He' s getting more money from me3 than he' s supposed to anyway. He' s getting twice4 the legal rent from me because  - -  I'm not  going5 through that story.6	Anyway, I'm also a tenant7 counsellor with the Upper West Side, with  the8 West Tenants Union. And we see over a  thousand9 tenants a year. And I have to tell you that  we10 have seen a dramatic increase in the past  five11 years of tenants being pushed out of  their12 apartments by landlords so that they can re- rent13 them for higher prices.14 In fact , a tenant called today.15 The previous rent on her apartment was  under16 $600. Her landlord cut it into two apartments  and17 between the two apartments is now  collecting18 $5000 a month.19 This is what 's going on all over20 town.21 If these landlords really  need22 an increase to cover their costs, let them file  a23 hardship application. Let me tell  you24 (Audience part icipation. )25 MS. DORIS CHARPENTIER:	I7 
2 have spoken to almost five thousand tenants  in3 the past five years and not one of those  tenants4 came in from a pure rental apartment asking  for5 help with a hardship application from  their6 landlord , not one.7 We get MCis. We get - -8 MS . KAUFMAN:	You have to wrap9	up.10 MS. DORIS CHARPENTIER :11 deregulat ion, we get everything.12 Let them file a hardship13 application. Don't give any increases this  year.14 MS. KAUFMAN:	Thank you.15 MS. ADAMS:	Where exactly is16 your building located?17 MS. DORIS CHARPENTIER:	I'm18 sorry?19 MS. ADAMS:	Where is your20 building located?21 MS . DORIS CHARPENTIER:	It 's on22 the Upper West Side in the West 80s,  Riverside.23 MS. KAUFMAN:	Thank you24 (Audience part icipation. )25 MS .

2	MS. TRINA FEBORELLI:	My - - can3	you hear me?4 A VOICE:	No.5 MS. TRINA FEBORELLI :	Can you6 hear me now?7 I'll try. How' s that?8 ,MS. KAUFMAN:	Fine.  Thank you.9 My name is Trina Feborelli.  I'm10 a rent stabilized. I live at 445 West 46th  Street11 in Hell ' s Kitchen, between Ninth  and Tenth12 Avenues.13 My landlords are Nessor14 Associates  and their lawyers are Bora Altschuler15 (phonetic), one of the largest pro- landlord law16 firms in the City.17 My apartment burned down in  199718 and before they rebuilt it , which they did19 without permits, by the way, or City  inspection,20 a direct violation of the law, I requested  that21 they put in disability accommodations which  they22 still haven' t done seven years later.23 I have an open complaint to  the24 Human Rights Commission, and instead of  putting25 in lever carpet handles, an intercom with a  push10 
2 button instead of a handset so that it 's easier3 for me to use, and adjustable light ing, they are4 paying a partner at the law firm to stop  from5 doing it just to show me they don' t have to.6 They have spent years  harassing7 me. I have lived there come next February   for8 fifteen years and I am subject to constant  almost9 daily harassment.10 I started my day this morning11 with the super running a hose through my  open12 window and then saying, oh, I didn' t not ice it13 was open, ha, ha, ha, ha , ha. You know?14 There is no maint enance in the15 building.	I have to call the City to get  the16 garbage taken care of. I have a deep  and17 meaningful  relationship with my District18 Sanitation Department because of the  filthy19 garbage.20 The managing agent , whose name21 is Gerard Rathman	(phonetic), because I want it22 on the record, when I call him, either refuses  to23 speak to me, screams at me and says, fuck  you,24 you're crazy, and hangs up on me, or tells me   to25 call the City because he knows that Bloomberg  has2 
2 fired half the City.3 In point of fact the belligerent4 Mr. Castellano would have you believe and all  of5 us believe that in reality HPD and DEP and  lack6 of maint enance and lead poisoning have nothing  to7 do with the RGB. But that 's not true. Your8 responsibility is to take into account  everything9 that has an impact on  rents.10 The landlords do not need  this11 rent increase. They don' t have any appreciable12 increase in costs.13 And we are bleeding to death.  I14 live on disability and much of my income goes  to15 pay the rent.16 Mr. Lubell is it?17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you18 wrap up, please.19 MS. TRINA FEBORELLI:	Yes, I20 will.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 MS. TRINA FEBORELLI:	Your23 remarks on lead are very disturbing. I  am24 outraged that landlords are asking for a pre -25 emptic huge rent increase because  they might	-2 
2 oh, tell her more - be asked to abate the lead   in3 their building. It should have been abated  twenty4 years ago. To tell a poor woman   - -5 (Audience participat ion. )6 MS. TRINA FEBORELLI:	I'm almost7 done.8 - - who speaks no English  and has9 a lead -poisoned child - and you can't imagine the10 labor involved in that - who' s simply trying to11 desperately survive, to hire a lawyer that  she12 can't afford and sue a rich landlord , is a13 disconnect  from  reality .14 It is the duty of this City  and15 the duty of landlords to abate lead   - -16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to17 wrap up.18 MS. TRINA FEBORELLI:  - - and  for19 the RGB to take that into  account.20 If you are not going to  stop21 landlord harassment , if you are not going to22 demand safe and healt hy and maintained buildings,23 you have no right to set  increases.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 (Audience participation.)2

I 'm a tenant  in a rent stabilized11 apartment in Manhattan.12 When  I was present  this morning ,13 I heard a young tanned gentleman offer  testimony14 about the hardships he was enduring as  a15 landlord , complaining  about  costs. Yet  later as I16 was leaving, I asked him about his prof it. And he17 replied about $5 million, plus or minus  $118 mill ion.19 As well today I 've heard20 testimony from the elder landlords who own  small21 buildings. I as well had an elderly landlord , a22 seventeen- unit building , where I 'm a rent23 stabilized tenant. She sold her two  buildings24 this summer for $5 to $6 million  each.25 When I moved into my apartment6 
2 in August of	'97, she demanded $1850 per month.3 That' s one thousand eight hundred and fifty per4 month. I later learned that I was renting a  rent5 stabilized apartment and the State determined  the6 legal rent as $880 per mont h.7	She stated to me that she  has8 had several , quote, irregular situations like9 mine. She tried to get out of the situat ion by10 demanding that I sign a back- dated lease to  cover11	up the prior fraud.12 She appealed twice. She  hired13 two law firms. But in the end it took a  Supreme14 Court Judge three days to render the,  quote,15 guilty verdict against  her,16 (Audience participation.)17 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	- - a cheat18 and a liar.19 The new owners are an Inc.  They20 are a couple or they are a group of , quote,21 investors. What they are doing is  repairing22 and/or making  improvements and charging $1500,23 $1800 , $1900 for apartments once renting for $500 24	to $700.25	As well in my building they  are
2 currently working on combining two  adjacent3 apartments on two different  floors thus rendering4 them two deregulat ed apartments.5	How many apartments are  being6 deregulat ed each year? Why are they not being7 prot ected? Affordabl e housing needs protection.8 If landlords want to make  money,9 they should invest in a prof it - making  business,10 not rent stabilized  apartments.11 (Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you13 wrap up, please.14 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	Any further15 increases are oppressive. Tenants can't  afford16 any further increases, but landlords can  adjust17 to the small cost increases each  year.18 I am not privy to the  financial19 information you've seen recently. However,  if20 your guideline  increases are oppressive this21 Thursday, anything above zero percent ,   it 's22likely thatyouand the City will be held23accountableandthe matter - -24CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	- - will go
2	into the judicial  system .3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 (Audience part icipation.)5 MR. JAMES JONES:	There is an6 intrinsic, inherent difference between  an7 apartment rental and a single room  rental.8 Perhaps the Chair can share publicly why  he9 deemed it necessary to combine discussion of   the10 two.11 Some apartment buildings  were12 conceived to be apartment rental and are  operated13 as apartment rentals; that is to say, when  they14 were erected.15 Some greenstone, brownstone,16 etc. buildings conceived to be privat e homes have17 been re- expressed as single room rental , drug18 programs; that is to say, physically  sectionally19 divided into single rooms .20 The events of September 11,  200121 may have persuaded Judge S.E. Frank  into22 retirement from the bench. Judge Frank vot ed23 against a certain entrepreneur.  The entrepreneur24 racially attacked or ambushed HPD  plumbing25 mechanics  assigned to James Jones.6 
2 Judge Frank subsequently told3 Jones to take out something referred to as  an4 illegal lockout petition against  this5 entrepreneur.6	Deutschbank, formerly Bankers7 Trust building, Lower Manhattan, heavily  damaged8 on 9/11, 2001, but only one of many side  issues.9	Jones' case has been off icially10 sent to the Investigat ions Section of the Mayor11 Bloomberg Board on Police .12 Judge S.E. Frank specif ically13 told Jones to cooperate with  community14 organizations.15 I wish godspeed to United  States16 military forces.17 This racial attack or ambush18 perpetrated by the entrepreneur on the  HPD19 plumbing  mechanic ,  albeit  disingenuous, this20 disingenuous racial attack apparently  achieved21 the desired  result , Central Harlem.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 3	(Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I appreciate25 it . Good to see you again .24 
1	5692 (Audience participat ion.)3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Alec4 Harrison.5 And Mr. Harrison will be6 followed by Councilmember  Gerson.7 Let me read some other  names.8	Robert Weisberg, are you still9	here?10	MR. ROBERT WEISBERG:	Yes.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.12 Lisa Amato for State Senator13 Eric Schneiderman.14 (No response. )15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ricardo16 Parento, 175?17 (No response.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.19 Go ahead.20 MR. ALEC HARRISON:	Good21 evening, Board.22 I'm interested to see that my23 speaking time has gone down from three minutes   to24 two minutes. Could we drop my rent thirty- three25 percent as well?12 
1	5702	(Audience participat ion.)3	MR. ALEC HARRISON:	So - - thank4	you. I wonder why you set the  time.5	Anyway, as many people said,  I'm6	not opposed to landlords making a prof it.7 A VOICE:	Louder.8 MR. ALEC HARRISON:	I'm not9 opposed to landlords making a prof it. But an10 egregious greedy over- the - top prof it is11 ridiculous.12 Is there no proviso to  actually13 see profit/loss statements? I mean let 's be real.14 My rent has doubled in the  time15 I've lived in my apartment. My salary hasn' t16 doubled. The cost of living hasn' t doubled I17 don' t believe and certainly the minimum wage has18 not doubled.19 How is it that the  landlords'20 rents are able to keep going  up?21 All right.22 And my point which is  something23 you've heard earlier and I'm sorry for the   tired24 story, and I'm sure you're all paying  attention,25 and that 's a good thing - -9 
12	A VOICE:	Yeah, right.
571
3	MR. ALEC HARRISON:	is that4 I am in the percentage of the building that  is5 really for tenants who supply their own heat  and6 hot water, to get back to what you were  saying7 earlier. It was the ConEd pilot program in  the8 late	'60s and it offered substantial  tax9 incentives for the landlords who  availed10 themselves of this opportunity to  create11 basically stand - alone units thereby releasing12 themselves from the burden of central heating   and13 hot water - -14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you in15 the same building	- -16 MR. ALEC HARRISON:	I beg your17 pardon?18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	- -  as this19 other gentleman?20 MR. ALEC HARRISON:	Yes.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.22 MR. ALEC HARRISON:	There are23 many more than three. It was  a late	'60s ConEd24 pilot program. You can look  back25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.4 
1	5722	MR. ALEC HARRISON:	- - at the -34	Anyway, so obviously he  is5 passing on the expense of no boil er, no central6 heat ing and hot water onto us, the tenants.7	So my question simply is why is8 it that we, who are in the costly position  of9 having to provide their own heat and hot wat er -10 - I get another minute by the paper  - - with  our11 own baseboard heating and electric hot  water12 heats, obliged to pay the same rent increase   as13 those tenants for whom these services  are14 provided by the landlord?15 What 's the deal?16 Anyway, it goes. I did  leave17 this for you. Why don' t we have, you know,18 something similar to Westchest er where there is  a19 greater preponderance	of tenants who have the20 electric by the apartments? And there  are21 separate rent increase guidelines for  those22 tenants that have the electric by apartments  as23 opposed to where the landlord pays for  it.24 And can we borrow a page  from25 their, you know, rent guidelines book where they8 
2 obviously have established it? It 's been going on3 for quite a while.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Maybe we can.5 MR. ALEC HARRISON:	That would6 be lovely.7 Thank you8 (Audience part icipat ion.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10	Go ahead.11	COUNCILMAN ALAN GERSON:	I was12 waiting for the off icial word.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. You got14 it.15 COUNCILMAN ALAN GERSON:	Good16 evening.17 First of all , let me thank each18 of you for the vital public service which  you19 perform in your role as Members of this  important2 O	body.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You just lost22 a hundred vot es.23 COUNCILMAN ALAN GERSON:	No,24 no, no, no, no .25 But because  I said that , they21 
2	are going to freeze the  rents.3	I represent	I'm Alan Gerson,4	City Councilmember, District #1.5	I'm going to summarize the6 written testimony which will be  submitted.7 My district includes all of  the8 communities of Lower Manhattan including  the9 communit ies surrounding the Ground Zero vicinity.10 My  district , along with11	virtually all districts of this City, faces an12 affordable housing crisis. The renters of  my13 district are wondering disproportionat ely where14 they will be able to afford to  live.15 The diversity, people of  all16 income levels in all locations and walks of  life,17 living side-by- side, sharing communit ies, sharing18 neighborhoods, which makes our Lower  Manhattan19 district and our City truly great , is threatened20 by the loss of affordable  housing.21 (Audience participation.)22 COUNCILMAN ALAN GERSON:	For23 this reason and the humanitarian reasons  facing24 the renters still reeling from the impact of   9/1125 on the City, I urge in the strongest  possible12 
2 terms this Rent Guidelines Board to freeze  rents3 or, at the last , certainly minimize to the very4 minimum any increase and to vote against  any5 longevity tax or surcharge for rents  of6 stabilized apartments, lofts, SRO units  and7 hotels.8 Any longevity surcharge  would9 hit hardest those who are probably least able   to10 afford the increase and must be  protected.11 (Audience participation.)12 COUNCILMAN ALAN GERSON:	Again,13 I'm going to summarize . I would point that our14 affordable housing crisis is being compounded   by15 the virtue freeze in the awarding of Section  816 vouchers for new applicants as acknowledged in17 this Board' s findings.18 (Audience participat ion. )19 COUNCILMAN ALAN GERSON:	We are20 facing a crisis which requires rethinking.  And21 this is not the time, as we undertake  this22 rethinking process,  to allow rents to increase.23 I get a moment to turn off  the24 cellphone .25 In any event , Mr.  Chair, again,2 
2 I will summarize. And I will point out  that3 draining renters of vital income is both  a4 humanitarian wrong and unacceptabl e imposition  on5 the individuals. It also drains the  economic6 vitality of our communities as these people  who7 patronize  our neighborhoods and our community8 establishments have less and less  disposable9 income as it is eaten up by rents beyond  any10 percentage of incomes which peopl e recognize  as11 acceptable.12 I'm going to make two  concluding13 points.14 One is I'm aware of the  concerns15 that owners have expressed as to costs imposed  on16 owners by legislation passed, being considered   by17 the City Council and other legislat ive bodies.18 In order to point out that we19 are not insensitive and unaware of that , I want20 to inform you that as we are preparing  current21 legislation, which would require the installat ion22 of grab bars and other anti - slip devices in23 apartments occupied by senior citizens or  persons24 with special challenges, as we go forward  with25 that , we are currently negotiating with the State2 
2 to allow a tax writeoff for that incremental  cost3 against the property taxes of owners. So we  are4 not insensitive to owners' s needs and we do5	recognize that we need to avoid imposing  new 6 costs on owners.7 But by the same token we need  to8 avoid imposing unacceptable,  untenable rent9 increases on renters.10 I would point out , in conclusion 1112 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you13 filibustering City Council?14 COUNCILMAN ALAN GERSON:	No,15 sir.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No? Are you17 sure?18 Go ahead.19 COUNCILMAN ALAN GERSON:	I will20 point out that owners have access through  the21 state regulatory system of DHCR to file  hardship22 increases where they can substantiate  it.23 (Audience participation.)24 COUNCILMAN ALAN GERSON:25 Renters do not have a commensurate outlet . The12 
2 little forms of assistance to renters  in3 financial hardship are dwindl ing as our4 affordable housing crisis is  growing.5 This is not the time to  allow6 for an increase. We should freeze rents,  we7	should	or minimize. We should vote against  any8 longevity tax increase or  surcharge.9 Let us together rethink the10 housing crisis, solutions to the housing  crisis11 in our City, and come up with solutions  that12 preserve our diversity, allow renters to   continue13 to be part of our City, and make sure owners   can14 continue to perpetuat e their ownership with a15 reasonabl e return.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 COUNCILMAN ALAN GERSON:	Thank18 you very, very much.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Weisberg.22 The order is Robert  Weisberg,23 Betty Lloyd,24 Is Betty Lloyd here? Did I  call25 that name before?8 
1	5792 A VOICE:	No.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No. Is she4 here?5 {No response. )6	A VOICE:	What number?7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	She' s 177.8 Susan Slocum.9 MS. SUSAN SLOCUM:	Here.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You here?11	MS. SUSAN SLOCUM:	Yes.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.13 Ant hony Winters.14 MR. ANTHONY WINTERS:	Yes.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. You' re16 here.17 Let ' s go. Mr. Weisberg.18 MR. ROBERT WEISBERG:	My name is19 Robert Weisberg.	I am the President of the20 Tenants Group at 145 East 92nd Street and  I21 represent them.22 I thought it might be helpful  to23 tell you about our apartment house which  has24 forty- five units. Twenty of these units have25 become availabl e during the last five years .12 
2 Is there a problem, Mr. Markus?3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. I'm4	sorry.5	MR. ROBERT WEISBERG:	Was that6 directed to me or - -7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No.8 MR. ROBERT WEISBERG:	Okay.9 Twenty out of the forty- five,10 Mr. Lubell , have been vacated during the last11 five years and the rent increases in  these12 apartments have amount ed to a total of $720,00013 additional  each year.14 The original rents averaged15 $1500, the new rents average $4500.  The16 additional $720, 000, which the landlord is now17 making, at a multiple of twelve is an addit ional18 $8 million total for the  building.19 The building was up for sale  at20 $4 million only ten years ago. But  this21 additional  revenue  is $8,400 , 000, plus an22 addit ional $4 to $12 million building.23 The reason I mention that  is24 simply that I've heard small landlords - and   they25 do have a problem - talk about no net  return.6 
2 Well , here' s a landlord who has enormous net3 return.4 And what we' re wondering as a5 tenants group is how do you come up with  your6 numbers. Are you taking into account the  revenue7 numbers or are you just taking into  account8 expenses? We know that mortgages are  down9 dramatically. We know insurance is way  up.10 Property taxes are up.11	But what we don' t hear about is12 the revenue side. Where is the revenue  figure13 taken into account so that we know that you  know14 what you are doing in terms of  rent15 stabilization?16 (Audience participation. )17 MR. ROBERT WEISBERG:18 Sometimes - -19 (Audience participat ion.)20 MR. ROBERT WEISBERG:	Sometimes21 I think that  - - you know, we've been here   since22 early, late in the morning.	I think the only23 message I can come back to my group with is  that24 I made a speech in front of a proforma  group25 which listens solidly, doesn' t ask any12 
2 interest ing questions of the speakers. I've3 heard, hardly heard any questions  today.4	And it seems to me that it ' s5 almost a fruitless endeavor on our part  unless6 you show differently.7 Please give us the result  of8 your intelligent thought and process, think  about9 the revenue side, and let 's come up with a fair10 figure , be it zero or two or four, whatever the11 figure is . Let 's know why you come to that12 figure.13 Thank you.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 (Audience participat ion. )16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Susan Slocum.17 Aft er Ms. Slocum, we' re going to18 take a break for stenographer of five  minutes.19 Go ahead, Susan.20 MS. SUSAN SLOCUM:	I'm Susan21 Slocum.22 Since last September I've  been23 the Director of a Senior Center on East  22nd24 Street and I have a weekly housing clinic for   the25 folks.5 
2 A lot of my seniors are  already3 doubled up. Because they' re doubled up, their4 income is slightly over SCRIE with the  two5 incomes because it 's household income. They're6 ineligible for SCRIE. They're hardly making  it.7 Most of them - - a lot of them can't even   pay8 their dollar- a - lunch day. They come in. We give9 them free lunch because they don' t have the10 money.11 Our funding is cut from  the12 Department of the Aging. The folks that work   for13 me haven' t had a raise in six years.14 So the rents have got to  stop.15 Something' s gotta stop or these folks are going16 to be out on the street.17 Is that how we repay our  senior18 citizens? I don' t think we should. Something has19 to be done.20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 (At 8:30 o'clock p.m. there was23 as recess in the proceedings.)24 (At 8:40 o'clock p.m. the25 proceedings  were resumed.)2 
2CHAIRMANMARKUS:Okay. We' re34going toget going here.The nextone is Gina Cuevas.5Gina? Isthat you?6MS. GINACUEVAS:Yes, that 's7me.8CHAIRMANMARKUS:Okay. Good.9MS. GINACUEVAS:Hi! Good10evening.11 My name is Gina Cuevas and I  am12 a rent stabilized tenant and I'm also a  tenant13 advocat e for Citywide Task Force on Housing14 Court.15 I would like you to vot e zero16 rent increase.17 I know it will probably not18 happen, but I would like you to consider a   lower19 amount than 3 .5 percent for one- year and 7.5 for20 two- year.21 I see how this increase will22 greatly affect me as a single mother of four   who23 has to pay more than fifty percent of my  income24 in rent , plus  childcare  and increasing25 transportation costs.11 
2 There are others like me who  I3 see in court every day. I just recently had  an4 MCI increase for electrical work that was  done5 two years ago. I collect ed signatures from the6 tenants and we tried to fight , but we lost.7 The majority of tenants in  my8 building are seniors and low- income tenants.  The9 MCI increase really affected us. And the   landlord10 is getting the increase and we are  still11 encountering problems with the  electricity.12 My neighborhood  is a gentrifying13 neighborhood near City College. In the last  two14 years I have seen many neighbors lose their  home15 from frivolous holdover cases such as  claiming16 senior citizens are nuisances, tenants don' t live17 there or the owner needs the  apartment.18 What all the tenants have  in19 common are that they are long- term tenants who20 are paying, according to the landlord, too  low21 rent.22 The rent has drastically gone  up23 so much in my neighborhood	it is outrageous. My24 renewal lease is coming up soon. That means  more25 money for the rent , less money for my children2 
2	and I.3	Whil e the landlord makes more4 money and we get decreases in  services,5 violations are not correct ed , we get harassed6 because we live in a rent stabilized  apartment7 that has tenant prot ections .8 (Audience part icipation.)9	MS. GINA CUEVAS:	Our senior10 citizens and disabl ed tenants will also be11 affected more than anyone else. They live on  a12 fixed income of $600 or less. They usually  have13 to make a choice between either paying the  rent14 or buying their medication. They are forced  to15 live in horrendous conditions. Some of them  are16 not even able to make it to court , and when they17 do make it to court , it is just so depressing  to18 see the things that they have to put up  with.19 I am just asking you before  you20 make your final decisions stop at any of  the21 housing courts in the boroughs and see how  the22 landlord is using the courts and the legal  system23 to harass tenants out of their homes so they  can24 triple the rent , or bett er yet , deregulat e the25 apartment.10 
1	5872	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3 (Audience participation.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Anthony5	Winters, Bob Grossman and Doris  Weisberg.6	Are you Mr. Winters?7	MR. ANTHONY WINTERS:	Good8	evening.9	My name is Anthony Winters.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	H . I11	MR. ANTHONY WINTERS:	I am an12 SRO tenant at the Morningside	Inn, formally known13 as the Uptown Hotel , on 107th Street.14 About five years ago, my15 landlord forced all the permanent  tenants, there16 were only about fifteen left in the back of  the17 building, and he spent hundreds of thousands   of18 dollars renovating the front of the  building.19 None of the tenants can pay one-20 tenth of what he' s asking. All they did was fix21 the  bathrooms  back  in their backrooms	- - excuse22 me.23 All he fix was the broken- down24 bathroom  and the kitchen.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Closer to the12 
1	5882	mike.3	MR. ANTHONY WINTERS:	But he4 increase  - - but  he actually had an MCI  increase5 for $90 a mont h for all permanent	tenants.6 None of the tenants could  afford7 that , not  even one- tenth of it.8 There' s four permanent tenants9 all working. The others are on disabil ity or10 Social Security.11 Legally he can't actually12 increase because eighty percent of the rooms  are13 rented to tourists and students, legally  since14 it ' s an SRO.15 I'm asking, please, don't16 increase. Don't give the SRO owners a  rent17 increase. They don't need it .18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 MR. ANTHONY WINTERS:	They20 don' t need it. My landlord , he make about $1200 a21 month for a little 10 x 10 room and they have  a22 shared bathroom and  kitchen.23 A little bigger room is $1400  to24 $1800 a month.25 My floor - - my building  is six4 
1	5892 floors, a one room with privat e bathroom, and3 they are renting that for I don' t know how much.4 So they are trying to use the5 fact that the RGB give some of the landlords  a6 rent increase so they could raise the  rent7 illegally to the tenants who don' t know better.8 Thank you.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10	(Audience participation.)11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Please try to12 keep to two minut es because it 's very important.13 Mr. Grossman.14 MR. BOB GROSSMAN:	Yes. My name15 is Bob Grossman. I'm an SRO tenant living in  the16 Riverside Tower Hotel , Manhattan,  80th Street and17 Riverside Drive for seventeen years.18 I've a single room which is  ten19 feet square.20 I'm sad , I'm shocked,  shocked,21 by the pit eous stories I've heard from the22 landlords today. I've been moved to copious  tears23 by their tales of their horrendous expenses.   I24 cried over them so much I can't cry any  more.25 (Audience participation. )12 
1	5902 MR. BOB GROSSMAN:	I pity our3 miserable  landlords and their tremendous4 sacrif ices, nay their martyrdom on behalf of us5 all.6 (Audience participation. )7	MR. BOB GROSSMAN:	Now we all8 know that it 's in the great American tradition to9 exploit the poor and the downtrodden. Should  we10 object to landlords trying to get rich at  the11 expense of puny tenants?12 Our great country was built  on13 slavery and greed and oppression of the poor  and14 the powerless.15 (Audience participation.)16 MR. BOB GROSSMAN:	After all ,17 our landlords are lords and their tenants  are18 nothing but peasants and they should expect to   be19 treated as peasants and  underlings.20 My own landlord has done  some21 questionabl e things, overcharging me and other22 tenants in our hotel by many tens of thousands  of23 dollars, assault ed female tenants, illegally24 locked tenants out of their rooms,  stolen25 tenants' rent receipts and then evicted them  for8 
2	not paying the rent , et cetera.3	But , heck, no one is perfect.4 It 's only what we should expect form the lords of5 the land and the would - be lords of the  land.6 I have noticed that the7 landlords today have spoken today only  about8 their expenses, but have not said anything  about9 their income. And I'm puzzled by this. I  am10 puzzled by this omission.11 But I think the reason is just12 that landlords are being modest and don' t want to13 brag about how much money they are losing  because14 landlords can easily prove they are always  losing15 money on their buildings by the simple act  of16 opening their books and reveal ing their17 expenses - -18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you19 wrap up, pl ease.20 MR . BOB GROSSMAN:	- - and21 income.22 The SRO hotel where I live  has23 had the same owner for over twenty- five years and24 I'm sure that the landlord would not have  kept25 the hotel for so long if he thought he wasn' t4 
2	going to make any prof it from it.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you4	wrap up, please.5	MR. BOB GROSSMAN:	We know from6 the landlords' test imony today that they have7 never made a penny of prof it from their buildings8 and ,  in fact , we know from the landlords  that9 they have been bankrupt every year for the  last10 fifty years.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You've made12 your point .13 MR. BOB GROSSMAN:	And that is14 the reason - -15 (Audience participation. )16 MR. BOB GROSSMAN:	- - they have17 stayed on as our landlords.18 Let 's give our landlords a big19 hand in the shape of a fist  perhaps.20 Thank you.21 (Audience part icipation.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Doris23 Weisberg. Doris Weisberg.24 MS. DORIS WEISBERG:	I'm Doris25 Weisberg and I live in a rent  stabilized12 
2 apartment at 145 East 92nd Street , and I can3 afford to pay the increase.4 So why am I here?5	I'm here to speak in this hall6 where Abraham Lincoln spoke and I'm sure  he' s7 turning  in his grave - -8 (Audience part icipation.)9	MS. DORIS WEISBERG:	- - over the10 kind of inequality that some of you have vot ed  to11 perpetuat e and the unfairness and the bad public12 policy.13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. DORIS WEISBERG:	I'm here15 because I read in the paper that the pol itically-16 appoint ed chairman of this committee proposed  a17 5.5 to 7.5 percent increase in rents. And  while18 making the rich richer may be good in  your19 privat e life at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Markus,20 (Audience participat ion. )21 MS. DORIS WEISBERG:	- - you are22 act ing here in public life. And you are trying  to23 put forward something that I consider to be  bad24 public policy, which is to break apart   families,25 make peopl e feel insecure about their housing,10 
2 and exacerbat e the already huge, huge gap between3 the have' s and the have not 's.4 (Audience participation.)5	MS . DORIS WEISBERG:Furthermore, I think you put this committ ee at a7 real disadvantage by proposing,  spearheading the8 proposals for these exorbitant  increases before9 this Committee even came to  meet.10 Now, this morning I heard  that11	the core inflation rate for the month of May was12 .2 percent. So there' s no inflation. Let 's get13 rid of that old canard.14 Mayor Bloomberg has just  said15 that he is going to issue a $400 million  tax16 rebate. So let 's get past the taxes.17 And let ' s talk about the18 blatant , deprived disregard for working people19 that these outrageous  increases suggest.20 (Audience participation. )21 MS. DORIS WEISBERG:	And let 's22 talk about good public  policy.2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 MS. DORIS WEISBERG:	No, I'm25 not finished. I have one more  thing24 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You are3 finished.4 (Audience part icipat ion.)5	MS. DORIS WEISBERG:	No, I'm6	not finished.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Your time is8 up.9 MS. DORIS WEISBERG:	We have a10 vot e and it 's going to be a one- issue vot e. It ' s11 going to be how this administrat ion deals with12 housing.13 Thank you.14 (Audience part icipation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 Arnold Bredefeld.17 (Audience participat ion.)18 MR. ARNOLD BREDEFELD:	Thank19 you for - -  I appreciat e being  able to say a few20 words.21 And I just listened to a lot  of22 thoughts and I think that since the Yankees  are23 winning and since we are going to have a  big24 tourist event with the Republican convention,  I25 think that maybe that some of that could go   into10 
2 our pockets too by having a big break on the  Rent3 Guidelines Board.4 Thank you.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 (Audience participat ion.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Michelle8	Masucci.9	Aft er Michell e is Anthony10 Feliciano, then Charles Davis, then  Sheila11 Robinson.12 MS. MICHELLE MASUCCI :	H ,  I13 Good evening, Mr. Chairman  and14 Board Members.15 I know it 's been a long day for16 those of us here and for you folks as  well.17 I'm asking respectfully for  you18 to seriously consider the low end of the  raise19 that has been proposed	for rent increases.20 My name is Michelle Masucci.  I'm21 in a rent stabilized apartment . I'm going to make22 this brief.23 The landlords have  complained24 that their expenses are rising and they need  this25 money to meet their expenses. I've spent half   of10 
1	5972 my career in the private sector and the  second3 half in the public sector. Never once has  any4 firm that I've worked for or City agency can I  go5 to and say I can't meet my expenses, you need  to6 raise my salary. Okay?7 (Audience participation. )8 MS. MICHELLE MASUCCI:	I don' t9 see why there should be this blanket  exemption10 for the landlords.11	Nobody is in business to lose12 money, and even the IRS will not let you go  more13 than three years showing a loss. So for  the14 landlords who have been in this business for   four15 years it 's unlikely that they are taking a loss16 every year.17 Many years ago when the  three-18 year lease collapsed into a two-year lease,   this19 was a gift to the landlords. They received  rent20 increases more frequently and, of course, it  was21 a burden to the tenants who paid increases  more22 frequently.23 There are the luxury  decontrols,24 there are vacancy increases, and the MCis, I  have25 very many on my current rent bill , which are12 
2 avenues that the landlords can continue  to3 collect profits. The MCis are cash cows. The   law4 allows it. But  this is money  that the  - - profit5 that the landlords continue to take long  after6 they have been compensat ed for their capital7 investment.8	This is my first time here.  I9 appreciate the opportunity to speak before  you.10 You folks are a very powerful group. I haven' t11 been here before because I always figured  that12 your minds were made up and this was just kind  of13 a public relations fluff.14 Please, I beseech you, prove  me15wrong.16CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17MS. MICHELLE MASUCCI:	Thank18you verymuch.19CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20(Audience participation.)21CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Anthony22Feliciano.2 3MR. ANTHONY FELICIANO:	Good24evening.25My name is Ant hony Feliciano.
  2 I'm the Male District Leader on the Lower  East3 Side. I serve a large community that is not  just4 racially  and ethnically  diverse , but also5 economically  diverse .6 And I am here to say how  once7 again that my community and I are outraged  by8 your proposed  rent  increases .9 Real affordability is a  central10 challenge we face in the City and I do not  mean11 af fordability as you may think of it , as the City12 may think of it. I mean access to  and13 preservation of affordable apartments for  low-14 income families, moderate- income families and15 individuals,  seniors, youth, peopl e with16 disabilities and communities of  color.17 The challenge is made more18 urgent because of affordable housing crisis   in19 our City and our country has worsened despite   new20 housing policy and the so- called economic boom in 21	the 1990s.22 Housing is more than  just23 affordable shelter . It is also about the health24 and vitality of neighborhoods and the access   to25 neighborhoods of choice for low- income and22 
2 moderat e- income communities and most especially3 for communities of color who  are4 disproport ionately affected by rising costs in5 rents.6 And I'm not just speaking  for7 communities of color. I have single whit es and8 families who are white who are struggling to  keep9 a roof over their heads.10 The proposed  increases will11 continue to exacerbat e the clustering of low-12 income households  into poor or distressed13 neighborhoods.  Their  access  to educational ,14 economic and social opportunities  is severely15 limited when they are forced out of  their16 community because they cannot afford the  rent.17 In my view knowledge of  the18 disparate impact the increases would have  and19 failure to take steps to reduce impact is a  form20 of intentional  discriminat ion.21 You may think what 's proposed is22 a small percentage , but families, single people,23 Latinos, Blacks and Chinese, people  with24 disabilities and seniors who are on a  fixed25 income in my community spend more than half  their2 
2 income on rent . A slight increase is still3 devastating because low- income households and4 moderat e - income households may not have enough to5 pay for food, health care or child care , and a6 missed paycheck or any unant icipated emergency7 may push them into homel essness.8 It is not surprising why we  have9 high rates of10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to11 wrap up.12 MR. ANTHONY FELICIANO:13 homelessness and overcrowding. We are just  making14 it more possibl e for rent stabilized apartments15 to be destabilized.16 It makes me angry that young17 people have to still live with their  parents18 because they cannot afford to live alone  because19 the rents are so ridiculous.20CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to21wrap up, sir.22MR. ANTHONY FELICIANO:	I will23in two minut es .24Intelligent	- -25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You don' t have
2 two minut es.3 MR. ANTHONY FELICIANO:4 minds move  out of the community  - -5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You don' t6 have two minut es.7 MR. ANTHONY FELICIANO:8 whereas they could be a valuabl e asset to the9 community if they would be able to maintain  or10 afford the rent.11 All I'm asking is to  really12 real ize who is hurting here and who we will13 cont inue to hurt here if you propose those rent14 increases.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 (Audience participation. )17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Charles18 Davis.19 MR. CHARLES DAVIS:	I'm Charles20 Davis. I'm Co- Chair of the Brooklyn Wat erfront21 Club Working Families Party. I'm a retiree, but   I22 am still active in my union, Public  Employees23 Federation, AFL- CIO.24 (Audience part icipation.)25 MR. CHARLES DAVIS:	I am a6 
2 tenant . I am not a tenant in rent controlled or3 stabilized housing. I have at present no  personal4 complaint about my own housing  situation.5	However, it should be  apparent6 to you and to the leaders of our City that  since7 they have done very little to correct the  problem8 of a lack of affordable housing for a  large9 number, a very large number of our fellow  New10 Yorkers, that they have an obligation, and  you11 have an obligat ion, unt il our City leaders do12 their job and our State leaders do their job  and13 our Federal leaders do their job, of  providing14 the necessity of decent , affordable housing for15 our American citizens.16 For you at the very least to17 hold the line of no rent  increases.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 (Audience participation.)20 MR. CHARLES DAVIS:	For those21 few landlords that can prove that they have  a22 hardship situation where they are losing  money,23 the law provides for helping them and they  can24 very easily implement that law and I'm  certain25 they will.6 
2 But it 's up to you and the Mayor3 and the other leaders of this City to do  their4 job of providing	for the citizens and not5 providing  for themselves.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 MR. CHARLES DAVIS:	Thank you.8 (Audience part icipation. )9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sheila10 Robinson.11 Followed by Alvin Doyle,12 followed by Natasha Missick, and followed by  Dana13 Escoffier.14 MS. SHEILA ROBINSON:	I second15 what the last man just  said.16 And as we have virtually  no17 inflation and the reports that we get from  the18 media that the landlords have said they  are19 making plenty of money, tons and tons of  money,20 over fifty percent if I 'm not mistaken, there21 should be no increases.22 And certainly Mr. Markus  at23 Goldman Sachs where you probably make over  a24 million  dollars, it ' s not six figures, it ' s25 seven, you know, think about the people who  are10 
2 retired and don't have money. And these  landlords3 are certainly not withering away. And they  can4 get their hardship increases, if  necessary.5 So I'm glad you made a face  at6 me while I was saying that .7 (Audience part icipation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Alvin Doyle.9 MR. ALVIN DOYLE:	Hl• .I10 My name is Al Doyle. I'm a  life-11 long resident of the Stuyvesant Town- Peter Cooper12 Village community, which is owned by  the13 Metropolitan  Life Insurance Company.14 Over fifty years ago, MetLife15 embarked on an ambit ious program to bring16 af fordable housing to New York City . Aided by17 City and State government , MetLife created an18 affordable housing community, praised  for its19 inspired urban planning.20 The opportunities offered  by21 affordable housing helped renew and rebuild  New22 York City after the end of World War II.  Tenants23 in Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper  Village24 became part of the solid middle- class tax-paying25 base from New York City.10 
2 However, over the past  thirteen3 years residents have been battered by  Major4 Capital Improvement rent increases.  These5 increases are in addit ion to lease renewal6 increases granted by the Rent Guidelines  Board.7 MetLife has spent over  $1208 million on property  improvements for which we9 received permanent  rent increases.10 Families need to be able  to11 feed , clothe, educate and provide for their12 health care and housing needs. Rents are  rising13 faster than incomes and when you factor  in14 increased taxes	it becomes tougher and  tougher15 to live in New York.16 Stuyvesant Town and Peter  Cooper17 Village is home to firefighters, teachers,  police18 officers, nurses, off ice workers, construction19 workers and thousands of others who may no  longer20 be able to live in the City they serve . The acute21 shortage of affordable housing makes life in  the22 City more difficult and limits New York' s23 economic recovery and future  growth.24 And what about our seniors?  Many25 seniors live on a fixed income and find  it2 
1	6072 increasingly diff icult to pay MCI rent increases3 and lease renewal increases along with  the4 increases in sales taxes and the spiraling  cost5 of prescript ion drugs.6	We in Stuyvesant Town- Peter7 Cooper Village are calling for relief from  this8 constant rent increase blitz  krieg.9	Please freeze rents.10	Thank you.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Natasha14 Missick.15 And Dana Escoffier and  Hector16 Yambo.17 MS. NATASHA MISSICK:	H , I18 My name is Natasha Missick.  I19 grew up on the Upper East Side and was  eventually20 pushed out of there .21 I grew up overcrowded, but now  I22 live in Harlem and my rent is $738. I have  also23 college loans.24 In this economy many people  are25 facing layoffs. We have a lot of people who  are12 
1	6082 unemployed. Right now if I were to get laid  off3 and  I were  to get unemployment ,  I still wouldn' t4 be able to make rent.5	If I were to try and go to6 publ ic assistance, I wouldn' t be able to get7 enough support to be able to maintain  my8 apartment.9	So, you know, one paycheck away10 is a real situat ion for a lot of people.11 I work in a settlement house.  I12 deal with a lot of clients who are coming in  and13 it may seem like rents are low because of  the14 fact that it ' s, oh, it ' s $500 a month, let 's say15 for example, but if peopl e are working at minimum16 wage, if people are on public assistance,  they17 still can't make these rents.18 And so, you know, you are still19 raising it higher and higher and higher all  the20 time. And, you know, - - well , we just had a hard21 wint er, but the previous three wint ers that were22 not as harsh, we still went up. I mean the   costs23 for the tenants are always going up and up  and24 up .25 And so I'm hoping that you  guys10 
2 can try and tone down this time. Vot e for a zero3 or one percent , you know, something that people4 can deal with when you know that there is  such5 unemployment.6 And we are really  still7 struggling from September 11th. New York  is8 really hard  hit . People are still trying  to9 recover. We have so much homelessness. We have   no10 Section 8 anymore. Even NYCHA, even if you  want11 to get into NYCHA, they want working  people.12 So what are poor people  supposed13 to do? What are working class people supposed   to14 do when nobody can afford to live  anywhere15 anymore?16 People are just getting  pushed17 out of every single  neighborhood.18 So just reconsider.19 Thank you.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 (Audience participat ion.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Dana23 Escoffier.24 Followed by Hector Yambo,25 followed by Vera Lafarga.2 
2 MR . DANA ESCOFFIER :	I 'm not3 here to offend anyone.4 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Okay.5 MR . DANA ESCOFFIER :	And I 'm6 not here to patronize  anyone.7 But what	I do want to say - -8	VOICES:	Can' t hear.9	MR . DANA ESCOFFIER :	I 'm not10 here to patronize or to offend anyone. But I  want11 to make a point about the turnout .12 And I bel ieve the reason the13 wal ls are not burst ing at the seams is because14 the tenant s are aware that your minds are already15 made up.16 (Audience part icipat ion. )17 MR . DANA ESCOFFIER :	They are18 aware of this, keenly aware of this. I 've heard19 it in the landlord/t enant court . I 've heard it20 around town.21 I 'm not here to bounce the  ball22 for anyone to play catch. I want to get right  to23 meat	in the coconut . And what I want to say about24 what ' s going on here and what ' s going on around25 the world , and I see that as a repeat here ,  when10 
2 Reagan gave Saddam Hussein all the money he  did3 to defeat Iran and did what he did in  Nicaragua4 for the Sandanista' s, it ' s now the war on terror,5 which is just a pret ext for intervent ion abroad.6 I see the Rent Guidelines Board7 as a pret ext for gentrif icat ion with a landlord8 base.9 (Audience part icipat ion. )10 MR. DANA ESCOFFIER:	Gina11 Cuevas hit the nail right on the head .   She12 provides and her colleagues with the  Citywide13 Task Force an invaluable service , as does  Tenants14 and Neighbors.15 Ms. Adams is not here right  now,16 but I want ed to draw an analogy with Ms. Adams.17 That ' s the lady who was wearing  the green coat .18 If they had not devised19 wheelchairs, how would she thrive , how would  she20 get around?2 1	Analogous  to that , if tenants22 are forced out of their apartments, how are  they23 going to thrive? How are they going to survive   in24 this town?25 We are here in the flesh. Those22 
2 of us who are here now in the flesh, you  can3 either hold the door open or you can let it  slam4 in our face. And if that 's the case , my5 suggest ion is that all rent stabilized , all rent6 controlled and all market tenant s go on a7 citywide rent strike.8 (Audience part icipat ion.)9	MR.  DANA ESCOFFIER :	And that10 wi ll open everyone' s ears and eyes as to what ' s11 going on.12 (Audience part icipation. )13 MR.  DANA ESCOFFIER :	That may14 be difficult to do, but that is my point .15 Your minds are made up.  But16 thank you anyway.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 (Audience part icipation. )19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hector Yambo.20 (No response. )21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Vera Lafarga22 after that , Josephina  Ventura.2 3	MR.

I work about ten years there,6 last year  the Commander  Hotel .7 Now I 'm going to go to  the8 Dexter House.

Want me to move out because I  get13 sick.14 So I go to the SRO. I give a15 couple of calls over there and he set my  rent16 again. So upgrade because the new money is  there.17 He' s breaking the wall . I live on the second18 floor and he' s gett ing close to me , right in the19 room there everything  is coming  in for the next  -20 - I'm afraid for my future because now I  got21 sixty- two years old.

VERA LAFARGE:	Okay.7 I 'm a senior retiree on  fixed8 income living in a rent stabilized apartment  on9 the Lower West Side and I'm going to  intersperse10 my comments with those I received from  those11 handed out by Liz Krueger dated today, June  15th.12 There' s just certain point s she's making that I'm13 making also. Maybe hers are a litt le bett er.14 Mr. Markus, at the init ial Rent15 Guidelines meet ing this May, he said that he16 want ed more debat e before a final vot e. I hope he17 was sincere.18 Is he really interested in an19 open debat e where owners' books are open to the20 publ ic , where - -21 (Audience part icipation. )2 2	MS. VERA LAFARGE:	- - their23 prof it s, not just their costs, are visibl e to the24 all? Then you woul d support Christ ine Quinn' s25 bi ll for open books.23 
2 Anot her step towards3 implementing democracy is to have the M embers of4 the R ent Guidel ines Board , now appoint ed by Mayor5 Bloomberg, vot ed upon by the City Council who are6 represent at ives of the peopl e of the City of New7 York.8	You, Mr. Markus, as the Chair  of  9 the R ent Guidel ines Board , you know, you are an10 investment banker at Goldman Sachs, hardly  the11 representat ive of the millions affected by your12 policies on the Board.13 (Audience participation. )14 MS. VERA LAFARGE:	The last15 vot e , Mr. Markus,  resulted in the highest total16 increase tenants have been hit with since  1989.17 That 1    s in fourteen years.  That was  last year.18 Okay.19 Add Ms. Krueger 1    s point . This20 study that was made reveal s that owners average  2 1	net operat ing income increased by 18 percent from9 
2	MS. VERA LAFARGE:	Okay.3	It is understandable	- - all4 right . I'll cut out  certain things.5 Other important poi nt s involve6 vacancy  decontrol ,  the real goal of this Board.7 As hundreds of thousands of currently regulat ed8 apartment s will be deregulat ed by 2 011, it would9 be a fool ' s parad ise to think we could do  nothing10 unt il then believing we are protected by rent11 stabilizat ion.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to13 wrap up , ma' am.14 MS. VERA LAFARGE:	Okay.15 Just a couple of points.16 Does Mr. Markus feel the owners'17 increase is warranted? Not according to the  May18 2004 report by Attorney Timot hy Coll ins or by Liz19 Krueger  in today' s report .20 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	You have - -21 next.

JOSEPHINA VENTURA :	My name  9 is Josephina Ventura and I represent RENA,  which10 is the R iverside Edgecomb Neighborhood11 Associat ion in Washington Heights.12 And the purpose of me being  here13 tonight is the increases in our rent s.14 Enough is enough. We have  sales15 tax increases, t ransportation increases, all16 kinds of increases. Where are we going to end  up?17 In shelters where they are not18 accepting homeless anymore?19 Please, do not  increase our  2 0	rent .2 1	We also have a lot of  increases22 in child care , medical  care that we cannot  afford23 anymore.24 Anot her increase means that the25 landlords wil l gent rify us from our22 
2	neighborhoods.3	Please do not increase our4	rents.5 Thank you.6 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Thank you.7 (Audience part icipat ion. )8 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Jo-Ann9	Polise.10 MS.

I t ry in the ways23 that I can and to the best of my abil ity to24 contribut e to the good health of my  community and 25	the neighborhood  at large. That ' s what  I try to22 
2	do.3	I live in my apartment . I look4 out after my neighbors.  I ' d like to be able to5 cont inue to live in that apartment wi thout having6 to live paycheck to paycheck	and hand to mout h.7	I 'm a frugal person.  I live8 alone. And yet I find that my income is  somehow9 stretched. And I don' t run around after high-10 priced	cars, expensive vacat ions. So I 'm at  a11 loss at to why this is happening.12 And this Board is contribut ing13 to this escalat ion.14 But I have a question?15 Why is it the owners of co- ops,16 condos and homes, who live in the same  residence17 for year after year, are credited wi th creat ing a18 stable community, but rent regulated tenants19 specifically are criticized and labeled  as20 freeloaders for want ing to stay in their21 neighborhood	and community,22 (Audience part icipation. )23 MS. JO- ANN POLISE:	- - the one24 that they worked to create , the ones who are ,  in25 fact ,  responsibl e  for the  landlords now being8 
  2 able to rent the one - bedroom apartment	for $23003 because	I helped through my years there to make4 it a desirable community, and wil l continue to do5 so because  this is my home ,  this is where  I was6 born and raised.

I l ive 2 0	in a rent stabi lized apartment at 188 Norfolk21 Street on the Lower East Side.22 I 'm one of the tenant s that some23 of these small owners have spoken  of because	I 've24 lived in my apartment	for twenty years. And they25 seem to think I 'm one of the probl ems because	I 'm21 
2 in the way of higher rent paying tenants when,  in3 fact ,  I have guarant eed them a steady income  for4 the last twenty years.5	And I 've done the mat h and I 've6 made them about a quart er of a mil l ion dollars7 for one tenant in one apartment in a  very8 dangerous neighborhood at the t ime when I moved9	in.10 I brought myself to this11 neighborhood . I was a responsibl e t enant . I have12 upkept my apartment  in my building . I 've looked13 after my neighbors in my neighborhood. And  what14 do I get to show for it?15 I get harassed by my landlord16 now . And the environment	for rent stabilized17 tenant s right now is harassment . And you guys are18 furthering that by allowing these high, high19 rents to cont inue.20 Every t ime you pass an increase ,21 it get s compounded. So if you do a four percent22 increase , it is much more  than a four  percent23 increase would be for me ten years ago.  Every24 year your increases are compounded on  past25 increases .10 
2 You seem to think that two and3 four perc ent is a small amount , but every year4 our rent s are higher and higher and less and less5 af fordable.6 My neighbors are disappearing7 because they can no longer af ford to live in my8 neighborhood. And it is not high- income tenants9 who are moving in . There are three and four and10 five peopl e living in an apartment because the11 rents are so high they cannot af ford to live in a12 decent place for themselves.13 They need three and four14 roommat es just to afford the rent .15 You need to look at not  only16 freezing our increases, but fighting the17 landlords  and making  sure that  they don 1   t get18 increases  if they don 1    t provide  services and that19 they illegally increase their rent s.20 You need to look at ways to  keep21 our apartments affordabl e instead of keep piling22 money into the landlords 1	pockets.23 That 1    s what  I ask you to do.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 (Audience part icipat ion. )2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ani ta3 Carmine.4	MS. ANITA CARMINE:	H .  I5 I live in Queens. Nine years ago6 I almost lost my apartment and everything else  in7 my life.8 I could not stay in New York  and9 I was very, very, very ment ally disturbed. I went10 to Nevada with my family and I wasn' t in the11 apartment for a hundred and eighty  days.12 So that was the beginning. When13 I came back  and I went  to the doctor here ,  which14 is the Worker' s Comp doctor, they told me that I15 am not allowed to sublease my apartment where  I16 needed to get some income so I could go back  and17 l ive in Nevada.18 I live very, very minimal. I had19 a wonderful job that 9/11 has dest royed. I was a20 project manager in construct ion management	and21 design.22 So it ' s not that I don' t have -23 - my ability right now is I can't work.  I    cannot24 stay that long in New York. I feel like  I'm25 dying. I'm afraid to go on  trains.5 
2 The reason I 'm saying this is  I3 want ed to sublease my apartment and my landlord4 sent me back a denial and told me that if I don' t5 stay in my apartment for a hundred and  eighty6 days and if I dare , dare sublease ,  they  wil l7 evic t me immediat ely.8	So now I 'm up against an9 evic t ion. Is this fair? I mean I literally don' t10 know how to go about anything.11	I would even pay the increase if12 it had to be , but to lose  an apartment	for13 thirty- f ive years that  I lived there as a stable14 tenant , and  I was affec ted by  9/11 ,  I think that15 is ludicrous and it is disgust ing that landlords16 want to do this so they can have a $700  apartment17 for $2000 a mont h.18 (Audience part icipat ion. )19 MS. ANITA CARMINE:	I ask you to20 please give me some advice , what I can to do to  2 1	have my apartment and still live there and  afford22 what I have.23 I only have Social Security24 Disabil ity and Worker' s Comp. I am not capable of25 going back to work.22 
2 Is that fair that they should3 take somebody that is not capable from  something4 that happened out of context and to make me  pay5 for this?6 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Thank you.7 (Audience part icipation. )8 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Alison Colby .9 Al ison, are you here?10 (No response. )11 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Eric12 Rodriguez?13 Eric Rodriguez,	followed by14 Derek Shelton, followed by Marguerit e Vancook.15 Okay. Go ahead.16 MR . ERIC RODRIGUEZ:	I 'm Eric17 Rodriguez.	I 'm a rent stabilized tenant and I 'm18 also the Staten Island Borough Coordinator  for19 the Citywide  Task  Force on Housing  Court .20 I find that I 'm standing here21 looking at a broken wall of interest , one where22 the peopl e on the Board are very much pro- tenant23 and realize that so much is at stake. And  the24 other half of the Board  sit s here and doesn' t 25	realize that what you are going  - - about to  do10 
1	626  2 wi th these increases is you are going to make3 people homel ess.4 You are going to take away  one5 of  the  fundamental  basic  human  necessit ies -6 food , wat er and  shelter - bec ause you bett er7 beli eve that . If you don' t have housing	in New8 York City, you are not going to have wat er and9 you are not going to have shelter, bottoml ine.10 We are looking at peopl e ending11 up on the street ,  thousands of peopl e out on  the12 street with no plac e else to go.13 And I know about Mayor14 Bloomberg ' s plan where he is supposedly going   to15 end up get t ing rid of  - - el iminat ing homel essness16 in ten years. I remember when Bloomberg  proposed17 a plan to stick homel ess peopl e on boats in the18 middl e of the Hudson River.19 I think that we are missing the 2 0	main point here, that families, single peopl e,21 worki ng families, middl e - income famili es who are22 now finding themselves in housing court  after23 losing their jobs, after September 11th, who  were24 living in apartments that have been  illegally25 marked  up , have been  illegally overcharging , just21 
2 so the landlord can get up to $2000  and3 deregulate them.4	And this is happening al l over.5 It ' s happening  in every housing court . Landlords6 are illegally marking up apartments, are let t ing7 their apartments go to crap. Lead paint in  East8 New York,  lead paint  in Carnegie , ceilings  caving9 in in Bushwick. Manhat tan is fal l ing down, petty10 holdovers  lef t and right . This is absolutely11 ridiculous.12 And I beseech you to put an  end13 to this because if not the blood is going to  be14 on every one of your heads for all of  these15 tenant s who are going to end up on the street .16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 (Audience participat ion. )18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS: Derek  Shelton.19 Mr . Shelton?20 Margueri te Vancook, are you21 here? Yes?22 MS. MARGUERITE VANCOOK:	Yes.2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.24 Af t er Marguerit e is Danielle25 Cataldi - M icca.24 
2	Go ahead.3	MR . DEREK SHELTON:	Good4 evening.5 Thanks for t aking the t ime to6 listen to me. I realize you have a very  important7 task to do. However,  I 'm quit e concerned that8 that task may have already been done and  speaking9 here is merely a perfunc tory measure.10 I think you should t ake time11 listening and evaluat ing what we have to say.12 I think that , you know, one  of13 the outcries tonight has been, perhaps if not14 listening  to, perhaps  not understood , that is,15 what is the cost of homelessness, what is  the16 cost to the City, what is the cost to the   State ,17 what  is the cost to human beings .18 I say that as a preambl e only to19 set the mindset . As rents go up, part icularly for20 those most distressed in our society, we  will21 have a proport ionate increase in homel essness.22 I think you ought to think about23 what the cost to society is bot h in our t ax24 dollars, in our resources and in the t ime and25 ef fort we have to spend to deal with those4 
2 homel ess peopl e who are , in fact , now in their3 apartments.4	Having said that , moving  on to5	the key issues.6	I 'm a t enant at what	is,7 depending on who you talk to, either  the8 Commander Hotel or the Tempo Hotel . It is one and9 the same facility.10 It is managed by PMG and owned11 by Mr. Zeil Felder	(phonetic) and his other12 investors. They own approximat ely eight een hot els13 in this City and have a record of doing  things14 like what  I 'm going to call allegedly  harassing15 tenants, because	I know that all of the cases16 have not yet been proven in court .17 I am one of those tenants who18 allegedly has been harassed. As a mat ter of fact ,19 since I 've proven it in the court , I have  been20 harassed.2 1	As recently as last week, I  was22 assault ed by the concierge in our buil ding ,23 called  an MF  five t imes,  struck ,  my property24 knocked out of my hand and broken. Why? Bec ause25 it is a hot el , an SRO hot el , Class A, I called22 
2 for a wakeup call . I was told that I wasn' t  going3 to get a wakeup call .4 I don' t want to go into all the5 details, but suffice it to say that most of  the6 building  has been  - -  most  of  the tenants, the7 tradit ional tenant s, have been removed. Those8 tenants have been  - -  those apartments have been,9 suites have been upgraded ,  renovated and  the10 prices  have gone up  seven/eight  fold ,  in  the11 average range of $1700 to $2200 per mont h. Again,12 this is an SRO unit where the average space  is13 less than 3 00 square feet .14 Now the empty apartment15 originally went to a new tenant at the  increased16 rent and they were told that  - -17 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS :	You have to18 wrap it up.19 MR . DEREK SHELTON:	- - they had20 a one - year lease.21 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	You' re going22 to have to wrap up.23 MR . DEREK SHELTON:	I 'm trying24 to do that just now, sir .25 They were told they had a  one -2 
2 year lease. They leased those apartments. Some  of3 those new tenants were actually disabled.  Then4 they were denied a renewal of the lease.  They5 were told  - -  they were actually rent stabilized6 apartments but they were in market  rate7 apartments. Of course there is no market  rate8 apartments in hot els.9 So they were denied the lease10 and then they were const ruct ively evict ed to make11 way for the new corporate tenant and  the12 transient foreign tourists, mostly from  Europe,13 who rent on a nightly basis.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Shelton,15 you have to wrap up.16 MR. DEREK SHELTON:	Yes, sir.17 You 1   ll f ind the l ist ing at18 sublet .com and yourst ay.com where this landlord19 in this building is rent ing out those apartment s.20 And who knows if they are paying the real  taxes21 there.22 I want to tell you that he has23 not done the repairs we deserve , but  I 1   ll  just24 say this.  I 1   ve been in court with them  four25 t imes,  three t imes in ten years. I 1   ve got three2 
2 court orders to repair my apartment . Several of3 the repairs have never been done including  the4 paint ing of my living room even though it has had5 three  floods ,6	CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Mr. Shelton,7	your time is up. Thank you.8 (Audience part icipation. )9 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Marguerit e10	Vancook.11	MS. MARGUERITE VANCOOK:	Good12 evening.13 I 'm  Marguerit e Vancook.	I 'm on14 the Board of Directors of the Federat ion of East15 Village Art ists, FEVA. We put together the16 fest ival last summer and we will be doing it17 again this summer. And I am the arts organizat ion18 off icer for that organizat ion.19 I worked very hard start ing one20 of the alternat ive schools in this neighborhood 2 1	which is a model for many schools around  the22 City. I 'm very interest ed in my community.23 I simply would like to say  it 's24 not merely that I don' t want to pay an increase25 on my rent . It ' s also that I don' t want to pay22 
2 higher taxes because somebody else is prof iting3 from creat ing homeless which eventual ly leads4 back to the City' s budget .5 I really resent somebody else' s6 bad management of their property creat ing a7 climate of homelessness which inevitably leads  to8 unemployment , which  leads to a health   crisis,9 which the taxpayer has to pay  for.10 It ' s very, very simple. It ' s11 bad government , it ' s bad business .12 No other business is allowed  to13 cry and charge - - well , maybe Wal - Mart ' s, but14 nobody el se is allowed to bill the taxpayers when15 their business is failing. And I don' t see why16 landlords should be able to  either.17 Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 (Audience part icipation. )20 Danielle Castaldi - Micca.21 Followed by Dawn Jones,  followed22 by Meryl Stein.23	211 now, 212 and 213 .24 Go ahead.25 MS.  DANIELLE CASTALDI - MICCA:24 
2	Good evening.3	My name  is Danielle  Castaldi -  4 Micca.  I 'm here to test ify on behalf of State5 Senator Tom Duane who represent s the 29th6 Senatorial District in Manhattan. This  district7 includes the Upper West  Side , Cl inton, Hell  ' s8 Ki tchen,  Chelsea,  the  West  Village , Greenwich9 Village , the East Vil lage, Stuyvesant Town, Peter10 Cooper Vi llage and Wat erside. It includes11 thousands of tenants, many of whom are  rent12 stabilized.13 And on their behalf and for14 tenants citywide I urge the Board to impose  an15 immediate freeze on rent increases  for16 apartments, lofts and SROs.17 (Audience part icipat ion .)18 MS.  DANIELLE CASTALDI - MICCA:19 We  are in the midst  of very  diff icult economic 2 0	t imes. According	to the Board 's own studies, the21 unemployment	rate is high, above 8 percent . New22 York City has lost 55 , 000 jobs in the past  year23 alone.24 Wages have gone down, 25	homelessness	is on the rise.21 
2 And  our district , as in many3 areas throughout  the City,  it ' s not uncommon for4 rent to account for half or more of  an5 individual ' s or household ' s income.6	When I graduat ed from college, I7 was told that good financial planning said to  set8 aside a third of your income to housing. That  is9 virtually impossible in this City.10 Wit h each subsequent rent11 increase, the gap between registered rent  levels12 and market rent in shrinking, deregulating  unit s13 at an alarming rate.14 As the Board is well  aware,15 these units leave regulat ion forever, permanent ly16 reducing the stock of truly affordable housing  in17 the City.18 This ever increasing divide19 between tenants and landlords const itut es a2 0	serious crisis, and it is irresponsi bl e and cruel21 for the Board to ignore these facts and pass  yet22 another increase on to  tenants.23 I also urge that the Board pass24 a similar freeze for SRO t enants, approving the25 zero percent increase at the bot tom of the21 
2 proposed range.3 This Board has an opportunity  to4 shape the future of New York City as a  truly5 diverse and habitabl e plac e. You have the power6 to preserve housing for middle and working  class7 peopl e.8	Conversely, you also have  the9 power to further divide New York City into  the10 have ' s and have not ' s. The importanc e of this11 vote cannot be overstated. The only acceptabl e12 outcome of this Board' s vote is no new rent13 increase.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 MS.  DANIELLE CASTALDI - MICCA:	I16 would also just like to add in my job for  the17 past two years not a day has gone by when I18 haven' t spoken to a minimum of five peopl e in19 just our small part of the City who are terrif ied20 of losing their homes.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 (Audience part icipat ion. )2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Dawn Jones.24 MS. DAWN JONES:	Good evening.25 My name is Dawn Jones and I'm  a24 
  2 rent stabilized tenant residing in 10 West  135th3 Street in the Village of Harlem.4 I was re- elect ed the Recording5 Secretary of the Lenox Terrace Associat ion of6 Concerned Cit izens.7 Since last time we met , my rent8 has been raised from $825. 10 to $914.80. I have9 been promoted to supervisor within the  Fair10 Hearing Unit and I still need two paychecks  to11 pay my rent.12 I'm an elected delegate of13 Social Service Employees Union, Local 3 71,14 District Council #3 7, AFSCME.15 Whi le we have ratified our16 contract , eighty- nine percent of our members17 voted in favor, I was one of the eleven  percent18 who vot ed against it as soon as I heard the19 Chairman of this Board propose a 7.5 increase.  2 0		What is not being said that21 there is one job t itle, Job Opportunity22 Specialist , who will not receive this  3 .523 increase  in this  Friday' s paycheck.	I 'm one of24 them.25 I see another sister has been21 
2 added to this Board , but unt il the  structure3 changes ,  things will  remain the same.4	It has been said that my5 neighborhood	is regentrif ied , lack of affordabl e6 housing. In my complex our lobbies have  been7 finally wheelchair accessible and we have  to8 start with another Major Capital	Improvement .9 All these years peopl e should10 not have had to go to the basement	to go upstairs11 wi th their wheel chairs.12 Fifty- one percent of our black13 mal es are unemployed. My co-workers and neighbors14 are struggl ing to pay their rents.15 I work at a so- called Jobs16 Cent er where we have to assess rents, and most of17 our co- workers cannot pay their own rents. We18 give one- shot deals and so on.19 I'm appointed to the Community20 Board in my neighborhood	and I do not always vot e21 the same way the person who couldn' t be there.22 When projects come before the Board and I  cannot23 af ford , even though the person that appointed me ,24 I do not vot e the way they do. And I encourage25 you all to do the same.5 
2Freeze our rents and no3increase.4Thank you.5(Audience participation. )6CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Meryl Stein,7followed byYardena  Nameri ,  followed by Arlene8Geiger.9MS. M ERYL STEIN:	Good evening.10My name is Meryl Stein. I've11been a rentstabilized tenant for twenty  years.12 I can' t afford my rent , but , you13 know, I have come here for many years after  work.14 You know, as a result of that , I only get   two15 minutes instead of three minutes because I  have16 to work. I can' t come here during the day.17 And  I think that this Board18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Next year19 everybody is getting two minut es.2 0	MS. M ERYL STEIN:	Excuse me?21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Everybody is22 gett ing two minut es. Go ahead.23 MS. MERYL STEIN:	I think this24 Board is ignoring the working poor people in  this25 community. I work for DC #37 Municipal  Employees21 
2 Legal Services. I represent working peopl e, the3 largest municipal	employees union in the City  who4 just rat if ied their contract as the speaker5 before me said.6	The peopl e that I represent earn7 between $11,000 and $35 , 000 a year and  they8 cannot af ford their rents. And I am not talking9 about Manhattan. Most peopl e here, a lot of10 peopl e here talk about Manhattan.	I represent11 peopl e in Brooklyn, in Queens. My off ice12 represents peopl e in the Bronx and all over the13 City.14 And I am seeing apartment s now15 in Bedford Stuyvesant , studio apartments,	$900 a16 mont h, two - bedroom apartments $1200 and $1400  a17 month. This is a result , a direct result , of   the18 guidel ines' increases, the vacancy increases, the19 MCI increases, the 1/40th increases that  come20 with the improvements.21 And this is leading to the22 harassment	of tenants who are in the low- rent23 apartments. The landlords are bringing  holdovers24 because  they can doubl e or triple the rents. I 'm25 t alking about in the outer boroughs.7 
  2 My clients who have to move  out3 of unregulat ed apartments cannot find places to4 live with their famil ies. They are working peopl e5 and they cannot afford to live in any borough  in6 the City of New York.7 We are facing a huge housing8 crisis and you are going to have a homel essness9 and housing crisis on your hands the likes  of10 which you have never seen if these rents  continue11 to go up the way that they are going  up.12 Bec ause the landlords are13 gett ing so many increases from so many quarters.14 And  I am just  - -  I don't know15 what  to do for my  clients anymore.	I 'm telling16 you this . This is going to be a real probl em.17 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Thank you.18 (Audience participat ion .)19 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Yardena20 Nameri .21 Arlene Geiger?22 MS. ARLENE GEIGER :	Yes . My23 name is Arl ene Geiger . I 'm a rent stabilized24 tenant on the Upper West Side. I 've l ived there 25	since I moved as an adult to New York City  and2 
2 called the Upper West Side my home and  helped3 build it into a community.4	When I moved in to 98th and  5 Broadway, it was called the DMZ. And I teach  at6 the City University as an adjunct . And my income7 is about $20 , 000 a year. I lost my second job8 about two years ago and I 've not been able to9 find addit ional income.10 I live in fear of rent  increases11 and another MCI being ef fect ively evic ted from12 the neighborhood that is my home.13 And we helped build this14 neighborhood.15 When my landlord bought the16 building	in the early	' 70s, I moved	into that17 apartment . It was vacant	for about six mont hs.18 There were  lots of vacant  units.  He moved	- - he19 bought  the building  at a price reflect ing the 2 0	fact ,  that is, the price of the building  he21 bought , reflect ing the pric e , reflect ing the fact22 that it was a regulated apartment . So he bought23 the buil ding cheap because	it was a regulated24 apartment that af fected the price that he  was25 paying for the building.21 
2 He owns huge numbers of3 bui ldings. This is not a small landlord. Like4 typical landlords they own large numbers of  huge5 bui ldings.6	In any case, currently about7 half the units have been vacat ed by stabilized8 and controlled tenant s. They are not market9 rents. He is earning a fortune. Hardship is  a10 joke. The man has an unbelievabl e amount of money11 roll ing in.12 There is no need to put peopl e13 who built neighborhoods under this kind  of14 stress, to have to, you know, make  ridiculous15 choices about how to pay their bills when  the16 landlords just reap enormous benefit s for doing17 nothing, really just doing  nothing.18 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Thank you.19 Thank you.2 0	(Audience part icipation. )21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Diana Lapson.22 Diana Lapson.23 Diana is going to be followed  by24 Maureen Silverman.

DIANE LAPSON:	And I 'm also15 a Secretary for the Worl d Trade Cent er Residents16 Coal it ion.17 Well , it ' s very  sad to me that18 the middl e class and the lower middle class are19 sort of considered the worker ants that are  sent20 into neighborhoods	to develop them so that future21 real estat e killings can be made.22 But what  I want to talk about ,23 which is kind of emotional	for me, is I came when24 I was twenty. And  I 'm fifty- four. I came from25 Brooklyn to New York.10 
2 It was a big struggle, but3 somehow it was possibl e.4 The part that ' s emot ional for me5 is that my daught er and all of her friends have6 no place in New York City anymore. There' s no7 pl ace for the future of New Yorkers.8	I 'm crying because my own  9 daughter has to leave New York City and so do  all10 her friends.11 (Audience part icipat ion. )12 MS . DIANE LAPSON:	How  can we13 allow this to happen? This is the greatest  city14 in the world. And I go to Europe and people  are15 laughing at me. This is your city?  My16 neighborhood  survived  9/11 , the Tal iban could not17 destroy us. We live three blocks from the  World18 Trade Cent er.19 But my family can't stay in New20 York? What kind of country have we become?  2 1		And is your conscience not22 strong enough that you can see that you  are23 causing a legacy for the rest of the Unit ed24 States for New York for the future.25 I hope you can really open your22 
2 heart s. This is not an act. I am crying because  I3 love New York, but New York doesn' t seem to love4 me , my  family, my  friends and these tenants.5 Thank you.6 (Audience part icipat ion. )7 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Maureen8 Silverman, followed by Diana Schneider, then  Joan9 Paylo.10 Maureen.11	MS.

  2 I 'm here to speak on behalf of3 the New York City Coalition to End  Lead4 Poisoning. And I wasn' t planning to speak because5 the parents who came here are the most	important6 people to hear from.7 But I've been working on  lead8 issues for over ten years. And over  the weekend	I9 was so outraged to think that landlords  think10 they deserve a rent increase based on the  new11 lead law.12 Now,. Matt hew Shushari	(phonetic)13 and Andy Goldberg at the internal meet ings14 already d ispelled the myt hs about  the cost .15 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Stand back.16 He can't hear you.17 MS. MAUR EEN SILVERMAN:	Okay.18 I want to say that it is a19 travesty of just ice for the Rent Guidelines Board 2 0	to claim that they deserve a rent increase  based21 on Local Law #1 in 2004 and all the  other22 reasons.23 It is because of the historic24 negl ect ,  the gross negl ect ,  of  slumlords that 25	there are over 3 0 , 000 lead poisoned  children   in21 
2 New York City who have suffered  irreversible3 permanent brain damage.4 Responsi bl e landlords don' t5 poison children. They mai ntain their bui ldings.6	Now we have Local Law #1  in  7 2004. It says slumlords are held  accountable.8 They must maintain their  buildings.9 It says slumlords can no  longer10 get away with poisoning  children. Well , that ' s11 not too much to ask. And that doesn' t warrant12 rent increases to tenant s.13 Many parents	- - a parent14 recently e - mailed me and she said publ ic15 of ficials and landlords have made  them feel , have16 made parents feel like they are part of  the17 problem. And that ' s what the Rent Guidel ines18 Board is doing by their rent increases,  punishing19 tenants and making them feel like they are part  2 0	of the problem instead of  slumlords.21 Well , i f anything , the slumlords22 of this City owe a payback for al l the hardship23 and all the suffering they have inflicted on  over24 3 0,000 lead poisoned children in New York City.25 Furthermore ,  they owe a payback21 
1	6492 to all the taxpayers. Doctor Philip Landesman  of3 Mt . Sinai School of Medicine  est imates that  the4 long - term social cost of special educat ion,5 medi cal , mental heal th costs, lost earning6 potent ial and product ivity of lead poisoned7 children when they become adult s is over $18 bi llion a year.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to10	wrap up.11	MS. MAUREEN SILVERMAN:	And12 that ' s caused  largely by slumlords.13 If anything, the slumlords14 should pay back those bi llions of dollars to the15 taxpayers of the City.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 MS. MAUREEN SILVERMAN:	No way18 do we want to pay for rent  increase.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 If anything , the slumlords  owe21 back money to the 30,000 lead poisoned  families22 of this City.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 MS. MAUREEN  SILVERMAN:	3 0 , 00025 families who have lead poisoned children.12 
2No rent increase. We won' t pay.3We won' t pay.4CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Thank you.5(Audience part icipat ion. )6CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Diana7Schneider.8 MS. DIANA SCHNEIDER:	H .  I9 My name is Diana Schneider  from10 the Upper West Side. I thank you for holding  this11 hearing, although I think your minds are made  up.12 I hope you prove me wrong .13 I just want to paint a pict ure14 for you. When  I moved  into my neighborhood ,  it15 was back in 1962. Okay. Picture this. We' re going16 out to dinner . We go out shopping. Uh- oh, we17 can' t walk down our street. On my God you get18 mugged. We' d better wait unt il someone comes to19 side us. Uh- oh, bett er not . Oh, my God , someone' s20 gett ing dragged down the street by your - -  oh,21 there' s a chain .22 Oh, we go out to dinner. What  do23 we talk about over dessert? Which way should  we24 go home? Maybe by the precinct.25 Oh, my God , did you hear about10 
2 that eighteen year old girl who got shot . He just3 jumped into the store at the tail end . Oh,   my4 God , the peopl e in the liquor store , they' re all5 tied up in the basement .6 Oh, my God , the poor bart ender7 held up by gunpoint five t imes at Dobson' s.8 We bui lt that neighborhood. We9 went through this. And now we've got  greedy10 landlords moving in from all over the  place11t akinga $400or $500 apartment and they wantto12charge$3000.13	But what ' s happening?	The14diversity the City thrives on,young art ists,the15Barbra  Striesand , the upcomingart ists, the16upcoming singers, the  upcomingsculptors, allof17 them are moving on. So people will have to go  to18 Boston or they will have to go to Ireland  or19 they' ll have to go England. New York won' t have 2 0	this anymore because none of our young  performers21 will be able to afford to be here. And  that ' s22 what you're doing.23 One increase after the other,24 and the homelessness	and losing our diversity,25 why people	from all over the world come to  visit21 
2 us.3 Now what we have moving into  the4 neighborhoods, we have revolving contract  workers5	that don' t take part in the neighborhood. They6 don' t care about the neighborhood.7 And they are redoing building8 after building after buil ding. All my neighbors9 are being forced out. And where the heck are  we10 going to go?11 We can' t live in Rego Park. We12 can' t live in Brooklyn because  it ' s the same13 situat ion all over.14 Keep the tenants. Don't raise15 the rent . Be fair to us. We made this City   and16 it ' s why people  come here because of tenants  like17 us.18 And the art ists, don' t force the19 art ists out . Be fair. Make the landlords open20 their books. Be fair and vote with your  hearts,21 not with your heads .22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 (Audience part icipat ion. )24 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Joan Paylo.25 MS. JOAN PAYLO:	Hello!6 
2My name is Joan Paylo. I'm  a3rent stabil izedtenant on the Upper West Side of4Manhatt an. I 'vebeen in my present apartment5since 1973 . AndI'm also a Democrat ic District6 Leader in the 69th Assembly District . Roughly7 it ' s a jagged district  that goes from 85th  Street8 and Central Park West to about 98th and  Riverside9 Drive.10 As  Councilman Gerson  said , my11 district ' s rich diversity  is also  endangered.12 Many of you have seen the Ric13 Burns documentary about New York. It  describes14 how the Cross Bronx Expressway sliced  through15 communit ies permanently dislocating neighbors and16 friends and destroying a sense of security,  a17 system of community  and the culture , mores  and18 support for children and respect for the  elderly19 that went along with it .20 Well , friends, the same thing  is21 happening in Manhattan . And I'm not referring to22 the trumpeted pl ans to reconf igure Hell ' s Kitchen23 to accommodate  a publicly - financed  stadium for24 the Jets.25 It ' s bei ng done by rising rents6 
2 and vacancy and luxury decont rol. The slicing and3 dicing of our communit ies is happening on the4 Upper West  Side, in the 80s, 90s and l O O s, where5 given enough t ime and a long enough leash,6 landlords wil l eventually convince peopl e who7 want to live in Manhat tan that what is now NYCHA8 housing, like Wise Towers or Frederick  Douglass9 Houses, is actually luxury condo mat erial.10 On Amsterdam  and Columbus11 Avenue ,  rows of high- rises  line the avenues. They12 were built thirty or forty years ago for  working13 peopl e  - postal  workers,  teachers, nurses,14 transit workers  - under the Mitchell - Lama and15 urban renewal programs.16 But it ' s changing. Park West17 Village , which was  envisioned  as a middl e- class18 rental complex with its own village square is  now19 split , divided between  co- op buildings  and rental20 buil dings.21 Clare Dockery and Vivian  Dee22 earl ier told you that long - t ime leaguered renters23 have in recent years withstood despicabl e24 landlord harassment . They fear their homes will25 be co- oped from under them.2 
2	And also in my district is  the3 notorious, formerly Mi tchell - Lama, Westgat e4 complex. As Jean Dorsey and Sonia Garcia  will5 tell you, long - t ime residents have been6 threat ened with 250 percent rent increases.7	I'm running out of time. I8 mysel f live in a building where there are $9009 apartment s now. And I was on an elevator that10 fell , et cetera , et cetera.11	But in the last few hours, the12 last few minutes actually of the people who  came13 after work, the hearts of women spoke. We  did14 build this City. We have pride in the City.  This15 is our home. There are artists, there are  single16 peopl e , there are families.17 And now the people that  can18 af ford to live on the Upper West Side are more19 t ransient . But  I have stayed and given to my20 community as have these  people.21 Thank you for listening.2 2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 (Audience participation. )24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Flora Solarz,25 220. Is she here? Flora Solarz?  No?23 
2	Douogbeu Touzl?3	And after that is Beverly Clark-4 Griggsby.	Is she here?5 Do we have anybody else that6 want s to speak besides those?7 A VOICE:	Here.8 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	What we ' re9 going to do is after this gentleman and those  two10 ladies, we are going to line up, finish  everybody11 up who want s to speak and be done.12 Go ahead.13 MR. DOUOGBEU TOUZL:	Good14 evening!15 My name is Douogbeu Touzl . I16 live at 564 West	16lst Street , Apart ment #4,17 Manhattan,	since 1999. It 's in a rooming house.18 I pay forty percent of my  income19 for rent . And  the  Federal government  report that20 thirty percent	is the affordable  level of rent .21 A VOICE:	Closer to the mike.22 MR . DOUOGBEU TOUZL:	I hear23 that .24 I said I pay forty percent of  my25 income for rent . The Federal government report4 
  2 that thirty percent	is the af fordable level of3 rent.4 During the past two - and - a - half5 years, my landlord has not provided services  to6 my building.7 No . 1, there is no longer8 exterminator service in the building.9 No.  2 , my ceiling is dropping10 of f in the kitchen and the bat hroom.11 No.  3 , the walls are showing12 tearing signs at different area of my  building.13 No. 4, it has not been paint ed14 over six years.15 No. 5 , Its basement	and backyard16 need a complete cleanup.17 No. 6 , the heat and hot  water,18 we 've been cut off a number of t imes.19 And No.  7, most  recently, 21st 2 0	of May, 2004, the electricity has been shut  down.21 West SRO Law Project and  New22 York HPD represent at ives are working hard to get23 the light restored back.24 I address to them a humble and 25	warm thanks.21 
2 You are pl eased and welcome3 anytime to check out the  fact .4	Therefore , my  landlord  does not5	deserve a rent increase.6	Moreover, he should pay  money7 back to the tenant s involved in this miserabl e8 and decreasing house renting  situation.9 Thank you for your t ime.10 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Thank you.11	MR . DOUOGBEU TOUZL:	And I am12 grat eful for this present podium.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 (Audience participat ion. )15 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Beverly16 Clark- Griggsby, and the other lady is going to be17 wi th you or separate?18 MS. BEVERLY CLARK- GRIGGSBY:19 Separate.2 0	CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Okay. Go21 ahead.22 MS. BEVERLY CLARK- GRIGGSBY:23 Good evening.24 My name is Beverly Clark-  25	Griggsby.	I 'm a guardian ad litem for  the21 
2 Administrat ive Housing Court .3 And I come here tonight  on4 behalf  of my  son. My son is Robert  Griggsby. He ' s5 on active duty with the U. S . Army. He is  a6 Sergeant . He 's on combat duty.7	And before my mot her died , my8 son lived with her for two - and- a- half years. At9 that time the landlord , realizing  that she had  a10 major heart attack and a stroke, took her  to11 landlord/t enant court to try and get her evict ed12 from the building.13 She was  oxygen dependent ,14 wheelchair  bound , incont inent . She had some minor15 dement ia, hypert ension and diabet es.16 He dragged her through17 landlord/t enant court for almost one year t rying18 to prove that she lived in Queens, drove with  a19 suspended  license  - by the way,  she was eighty-20 one at that time, she had never driven in  her21 life - and she had not had any knowledge at  all22 about what he was talking  about .23 After 9/11 she went to stay  with24 my son for approximat ely ten days and there she25 had a massive heart attack and they would not  let8 
2 her travel back on the airlines with  oxygen.3 It had just become a nightmare.4 It was horrendous. And they traversed us  from5 courtroom  to courtroom  to try and  find ,  quot e, a6 landlord friendly judge who would evic t this7 eighty- two year old woman to the street whil e she8 was wheelchair bound with twenty- four hour home9 attendant service because she was sublett ing10 supposedly her apartment to her grandson  who11 lived with her, who took care of her, who had  her12 as a U. S. Army dependent .13 No mat ter what letters came from14 the Unit ed States Army, nothing was recognized by15 New York City Housing Court . I ask you in all16 fairness, my son is on combat duty. He  cannot17 represent himself .18 On June 21st at two p.m. they19 are  threat ening ,  Carboneau  and Fleichel20 (phonetic), a law firm that has done some2 1	horrendous things to tenant s in New York City.22 As my mother  laid dying , they23 were stamping not ices on her door saying , oh, you24 didn' t tell us your mot her is dying. So we don' t25 beli eve she ' s really dead. We think you've hid22 
1	6612 her and you' ll bring her out of hiding after your3 son gets the apartment.4 This is the mindset of a City5	and I 'm a native New Yorker. I was in City6 government	for twenty- eight years. I served as a7 City Administrator  under Wagner, Beame, Koch,8 Lindsay, straight on to the  Giuliani9 Administrat ion before I retired.10 I cannot even beli eve what is11 going on in New York City at this t ime. And as12 the lady before me said, your children can' t even13 live here. We' re nat ive New Yorkers, born in14 Harlem Hospital . Our children were all born here.15 And they have to flee to other states to  find16 places to live where they can af ford to pay rent.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 MS. BEVERLY CLARK- GRIGGSBY:	I19 ask you, please do not create another situat ion20 with a homeless veteran.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 MS. BEVERLY CLARK- GRIGGSBY:	My23 son is fight ing everyday for this country.24 Please, please help us.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 
2 (Audience part icipation. )3 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Please come4 up one at a t ime. Okay.5 You have to state your name  for6 the record so we have it  all .7 Okay.8	MS. FLORENCE M. RICE:	My name9	is Florence M . Ric e.10 The Honorabl e Rent Stabil i zation11 Guidelines  Board ,  ladies and gentlemen  of the12 audience and fellow tenants:13 My name is Florence M. Rice.  I14 have been a tenant of 540 West	158th Street since15 1943 . I lived in a rent controlled apartment on16 the sixth floor of this walkup building.17 As of 1984, I moved down to  an18 apartment on the second floor under the  rent19 stabilizat ion renewal guidel ines.2 0	From 1984 to the present	I have21 been a vict im of landlord fraud , as I have never22 been given a rent stabilized renewal lease  or23 lease or rider. Vac ancy leases given under this24 system were registered with DHCR as though the 25	t enants agreed aft er choice. This is not true.21 
2 From 1993 to present	I was given3 a preferent ial rent by the prior manager William4 Hodges without a lease.5 Most of the tenants of  my6 building do not speak English or are elderly  like7 myself .8 The tenants were frightened9 because if they did not sign they were  afraid10 they would  lose their apartment .11 The government agencies I went12 to for help did not seem to know the  difference13 between a vacancy lease and a rent stabilizat ion14 renewal lease, elect ed off icials and SCRIE.15 Please help us as we have had16 our rents raised at percents unknown to  us.17 I am currently facing evict ion18 if I do not pay illegal rent arrears in excess  of19 $3000. I am eighty- five years old.20 These illegal increases are  in21 spite of over two hundred and twenty  HPD22 violations	in a thirty - unit building.23 Thank you for every24 considerat ion to this mat ter.25 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Thank you.2 
2	(Audience part icipation. )3	CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	State your4	name for the record , pl ease.5	MR. MITCHELL REDMOND:	My name  6 is Mitchell  Redmond  and I 'm a rent stabilized7 tenant.8 Rent stabil ized apartment s are9 by far the largest source of affordabl e housing10 in New York. If you take all of the  subsidized11 housing we have and combine  it ,  it is nothing12 compared to rent stabilizat ion.13 Mayor Bloomberg wants to  solve14 the probl em of homel essness by contribut ing15 60 , 000 apartments.  That 's very nice. But how is16 he going to replace the one million  apartments17 that are slipping away now .18 Between the rent increases that19 you keep piling on and the vacancy decont rol that20 we see now and the kind of incent ive - -  the21 environment	is one of tremendous incent ive for22 landlords to push people out and push for  that23 vacancy decontrol . They can see that $2000 mark.24 They can see one more MCI and they can get peopl e 25	out .6 
2 It ' s not far away. It ' s really3 happening. This is a disast er.4	I grew up in New York. The  only5 reason I was able to grow up in a  nice6 neighborhood	- - my father was a bart ender.  I grew7 up in a nice neighborhood because of  rent8 stabilization. We were able to stay there. I  grew9 up in Riverdal e. It was $80 a mont h because10 nobody would pay two fares to go up  there.11 Now the apartments go for12 thousands of dollars.13 There' s no way I can move back14 to Riverdal e.15 This City is going to turn  into16 a suburb, into a mall.  I mean it 's very  nice ,17 peopl e	I live in the West Village now, which18 is the Gold Coast. I live in an old tenement  with19 toilets in the hall that they are charging  $130020 a month for, for a one - bedroom apartment wi th a21 toilet in the hallway.22 It ' s turning into the Gold23 Coast . Everybody  is celebrat ing. Article	- - cover24 articles on The New York magazine.  For who?  For25 these people, these rich peopl e that want to come5 
2 in and take advantage now of what  - -  as  everybody3 said , the dues we paid.4	It ' s crazy. People will be5	devastat ed by it.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 (Audience participat ion .)8 MR. STEVE SELTZER:	My name is9 Steve Seltzer. I live in a rent  controlled10 apartment .11 But I want ed - - a number of12 peopl e have point ed out that the landlords can13 apply as hardship cases if the rent control  or14 rent stabil ization really squeezes them.15 It has not been point ed out that16 in order to apply for these exceptions, they  have17 to open their books.18 And I wonder how many cases  the19 Guidelines  Board  knows of ,  how many hardship20 appl icat ions have there been in the last year or21 what ever.22 That ' s it . Thank you.2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 MR. STEVEN SELTZER:	And I want25 to say I appreciate your lett ing some people t alk24 
2	even though they hadn' t signed up to register.3	CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	No problem.4	Thank you.5 (Audience participat ion. )6 MS . FREDERICA NATHAN:	Good  7 evening. Thank you.8 I went to the wrong place9 because Channel 7 said you were at Union   Square.10 So I was all over Union  Square.11 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Well , they' re12 all confused. They're not from New York,  you13 know.14 MS. FREDERICA NATHAN:	Anyhow, I15 have been in New York since high school .16 Can you hear me?17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.18 THE REPORTER:	Your name.19 MS. FREDERICA NATHAN:	I'm20 sorry. Frederica Nat han is my name.21 I live on the Upper East Side.  I22 am in a lower East Side apartment on the  Upper23 East Side. The tub is in the kitchen,  the24 bat hroom' s in the hall. And I 'm paying six times 25	the rent that I paid when I moved  in.7 
2 My ceilings are fall ing down and3 I cannot bring my mother to stay because she' s on4 a walker and the bat hroom  is in the hall .5 And I think it ' s disgraceful6 that , you know, paying  these kinds of   increases7 year after year after year and the only people  in8 my bui lding who will have anything fixed right9 away are the people who are paying  $2000.10 So, you know, if you have  a11 problem,  you're just stuck with it. I mean  I 'm12 not a mechanic.	I can't fix the ceil ing. I can' t13 fix the floors.  I see through to the  basement .14 This has been going on for  a15 long t ime. Like the lady in her eight ies there16 who spoke before , I was faced wi th fraud. I had   a17 person impersonating	my landlord who had me  in18 court for ten years.19 I eventually spent the last  four20 in the appeals  court where  I wrote my own  brief .21 And I got to stay with the22 ceil ing fall ing down because that flood came23 after I won the case.24 And it ' s a hopeless situation25 where people who are stuck in - -  I had  to give  up2 
2 my career because of the ten years fight ing in3 court .4 And one of the judges on my  case5 got demot ed to the Bronx.6 But  still , you know, the person7 who was impersonat ing the landlord got away wi th8 everything and still does the same thing .9 And I think that something has10 to be done about the way both sides here  are11 relating to one another because we all need  a12 place  to live . That  is not  something of a market .13 That is really a basic human  need.14 And peopl e in the City who have15 lived for thirty/forty years should not now  be16 l iving in shelters. Whil e I fought for ten years,17 f ive of my friends, women in the art s, over18 forty, landed up homel ess.19 One of them had Hodgkins20 lymphoma and is now dead because she landed  up21 homeless.22 She was evicted in April last23 year and died in September. I think it 's an24 outage that the people of this City are  treated25 this way.2

CARL ARTZEL:	Good evening.14 My name is Carl Art zel15 (phonetic) , an architect  art ist.16 I was doing a film about this   -17 -  I guess - -  I just started it tonight.18 Something that Mr. Bloomberg19 will understand is the next election. And if  the20 Green Party, the Working Families Party and  the21 Democrat ic Party get together, we can make this a22 huge issue.23 This is an absolut e bread and24 butt er issue. And if	well , I hear various 25	figures. But 1.5 million peopl e who are rent12 
l	6712 stabilized , that ' s one - fifth of the New York3 population.  That ' s a huge vot ing block if we can4 get people out to the polls.5 So you should remember that  this6 coming elect ion, and I hope he does.7 Thank you.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience part icipation. )10 MR. HARRY GRIMSMAN:	Harry11 Grimsman.12 I have a few notes here.13 Open books, three rooms,  real14 est ate agent s, fees, vacancy, upgrade, legitimate15 registrat ion, off - the- books apartments,16 uncreat ive plumbing.17 These are just little notes.  I18 don' t know that I will t ime to talk about all of19 them.20 But upfront the open books  theme21 has been around for a long t ime. It ' s a very22 obvious shall we say way of addressing some  of23 the injustices which have been perpetrat ed in the24 name of providing homes and housing and so  on25 l ike that. It 's a very simple  thing.9 
2	Now, if it can't be done  across  3 the board , if there is a situat ion in which  a4 part icular buil ding or particular landlord with a5 string of buildings or maybe one or two, what ever6 it is, comes into contention about  something,7 then there should be a law which then under  a8 judge' s jurisdict ion can look at the books.9 Looking at opening the books becomes, shall  we10 say, an aspect of possibl e penal ty, but it11 becomes also a way of gaining real insight   into12 the situat ion.13 Now, my own situation, I'm in  a14 rent stabilized apartment. I just moved in  here15 about a half - a - year ago. And at that part icular16 t ime the lease did not state the apartment was17 rent stabilized , but  I 've been told  it was rent18 stabilized. I went up to 125th Street and  checked19 on it . And  lo and behold , my one room studio, not  2 0	very big ,  is listed in the rent control  off ice  as21 consist ing of three rooms.22 What the hell happened?  Three23 rooms? Where did they evaporat e to?24 Well , the theory that I have  is25 that the very thin wall on one side of  my21 
2 studio - it ' s so thin that you can hear  the3 coughing in the next room - at one t ime had   been4 a three- room apartment ,  registered  as such, but5 then subdivided.6 Which comes up to the thing of7 of f - the- books apartments. How many landlords - -8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to9 wrap up , please.10 MR. HARRY GRIMSMAN:	Right.11	- - have taken - - the number is12 13 0 on the West Side. Down here is the washing13 machine break was converted into an apartment  off14 the books .15 Now.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One more17 point.18 MR. HARRY GRIMSMAN:	One more19 point is the very, very arduous relat ionship20 between real estate agents and their  fees21 relat ing to the rent .22 Why should real estate  agent23 fees have anything to do with the size of  the24 rent? Why? They should be a service  independent25 of the amount of the  rent .12 
2CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Well , take it3up withthem.4(Audience part icipat ion.)5CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there6anybodyelse?7We know your position.8Go ahead.9MS. GLORIA GILBERT:	Good10evening.11My name is Glori a Gilbert and12 I 'm a rent stabil ized tenant . I 'm also the13 President of the 24 Fifth Avenue Tenant s14 Association which is a mixed building of  being15 co-op and rent stabilized tenant s.16 I'm also a community healt h17 advocat e. I got into that because I met a lot of18 retired people who were having probl ems after19 they were on fixed income paying the rent here  in20 Greenwich Village.21 It is very distressing to me22 that we have ex- teachers, ex- sanitation workers,23 peopl e who have given their l ife to the City and24 now they are on fixed incomes and they are  having25 terribl e , terribl e problems  in making decisions12 
2 on how they are going to spend their  money.3 And a lot of their money,4 particularly of the ones that I know that  are5 here  in Greenwich Village , has to go to pay  rent .6 So I 'm here this evening to  ask7 you to pl ease keep that in mind because the8 increases that I heard about earli er are really9 going to hurt a lot of people that I 'm   working10 with through the First Presbyterian Church  Senior11 Community Center.12 Thank you.13 (Audience part icipat ion. )14 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Just raise15 your hands if you want to  talk.16 All  right . We've got four.17 That 's it . I'm count ing.18 Go ahead. It 's the stenographer19 we ' re killing. I just want you to know that .20 MS.  MARINA  M ETALIOS:	Board ,21 hello! Thanks  for being  here still .22 My name is Marina Metal ios . I 'm23 a rent regulated tenant . I live in   Stuyvesant24 Town.25 My day job is putt ing together2 
2 housing finance for low- income buildings. And I3 put this out to suggest that I have  some4 understanding about the subtlet ies of housing5 finance in New York.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Who do you7	work for?8	MS. MARINA M ETALIOS:	I work9	with a non- profit  called UHAB , the Urban - -10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Okay.11 MS. MARINA METALIOS:	- - Home12 Saving Assistance Board.13 And I also want to  challenge14 you, Board , because  I think you don' t  understand15 the role that you play in preserving  affordable16 housing in New York City.17 And I know that your charge  is18 to broker a relat ionship between tenants and19 landlords  that ' s somehow fair.  I have witnessed20 you do that every year.21 But my typical witness is  that22 you don' t do this fairly. And I ask you to think23 carefully about the decision that you are  going24 to make on Thursday bec ause there is a lot at25 stake.10 
2 I do agree landlords need to  be3 able to cover their costs and you have a role  in4 making that happen. But when I see it  happening5 with tenant s nailed to the wall , I shutter  and6 wonder the way in which you are able to meet  your7 charge and your mandat e.8 So I thank you for doing what9 you are doing. And I urge you to think  carefully10 about what ' s ahead of you on  Thursday.11 There are myriad ways to  play12 this relat ionship out that doesn' t tack tenants13 to that column.14 Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 (Audience part icipat ion. )17 MS. HOLDER:	I have a quest ion.18 I 'm sorry, Chairman.  I have a quest ion.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oh, sure.20 Sorry. Question.2 1	MS. HOLDER :	Thank  you for22 coming and I know it 's late for everyone.23 We have a publ ic member  - - Mr.24 Zelnik has been looking at and has asked all  of25 us to consider looking at different ways in   which22 
2 to apply increases, perhaps to different  size3 buildings or to diff erent boroughs.4	Based  upon your background , and5 you and I have known each other for a long   t ime ,6 I 1   m actual ly very interested in what you   would7 think about that .8	MS. MARINA METALIOS:	The size9 issue is something that I need to take the  Fifth10 on because the buil dings that I work with become11 low- income co- ops that distribut e their costs12 evenly across the building.13 However, let me say that for the14 buildings  I work with that are self - managed , they15 increase their maint enance fee two percent16 maximum a year. And if they do run the  building17 well , two percent more than covers their costs,18 plus helps them make their reserves healt hy.19 So as I look at the  increases20 that you are contemplating for this year, but ,  in21 fact ,  generally,  I see the  only difference22 bet ween what might be a percent - and - a - half or two23 and what passes for increases is prof it and24 prof iteering.25 It doesn 1   t have to do  with9 
2	covering basic building  operating.3	And even, because this is on  my  4 list of important things, making sure that  the5 reserves are heal thy, the operating reserves and6 the replacement reserves, plus what ever might be7 needed for vacancy.8 Does that answer your quest ion?9 MS. HOLDER:	Yes.10 There' s al so the issue of the11 boroughs, the disparity or the  perceived12 disparity with expendit ures in the various13 boroughs.14 MS. MARINA METALIOS:	I haven' t15 seen a di fference. I haven' t seen a d ifference in16 operating borough to borough. I see  the17 diff erence when we are talking about a very big18 building versus  a small , which  is why,  in fact , I19 understand  the cutoff at six units. And , you  2 0	know, there are small property owners who  come21 and speak before you with a dif ferent twist.22 But between boroughs I just23 don' t see a diff erence in operat ing cost s. If a24 building is wel l run, which means there is a25 manager who cares, there is a landlord who  is21 
2 around , and by my def inition there' s a tenant s3 associat ion, organized  and involved , then the4 increases that are appl ied to low- income cost can5 work also.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you. I7 appreciat e it.8 (Audience part icipat ion. )9	MR. A.D. KAUFMAN:	H ,  I10	My name is A.D. Kaufman.11	And the luckiest thing that ever12 happened to me was gett ing a rent stabil ized13 apartment ten years ago.14 I'm an art ist. And I think15 during the economic expansion, we know what  kind16 of prof its the landlords have been making.17 And I just think I need to  say18 that I think these people will never be  satisfied19 unt il all the musicians, the elderly people, the20 veterans, the people in the armed forces,   even21 the cops - - there' s going to be no cops living   in22 Manhat tan because the landlords are just waiting23 for everybody to drop dead so they  can24 destabilize apartments.25 And I think maybe you all  have12 
2 to think of like a new tomorrow. You got to  fix3 things somehow.4 And you can't forget about the5 one mill ion tenants who are rent stabil ized.6 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Thank you.7 (Audience part icipat ion. )8 MS. ELIZABETH HOOVER :	Good9	evening.10 My name is Elizabeth Hoover.  I11 live on the Upper East Side.12 I 've been a tenant , a stabilized13 tenant , and I came to New York  in the	'60s. And14 in the	'60s there was no homelessness.15 Now there is more homel essness16 than there was in the 1960s. And what are  we17 going to do about it?18 I mean we should - - in ten  years19 they want to end homel essness. Where are we20 going? Something should be done. And I don' t21 think we should have  - -  I think we should have22 zero increases.23 Plus I know peopl e, Catherine24 Woods, she lives in a rent controlled  building25 and she want ed to move to an apartment	in her10 
2	buil ding on a lower floor. And the landlord3 want ed to raise her rent and she's been there for4 years and she lives in the same building,  and5	that should not be allowed.6 And then also Lucill e Strong,7 she lives in a stabilized building and  the8 landlord , when peopl e move  in now,  if they die,9 they hike the rents to $2000 a mont h rent in a10 twelve - story building. And that ' s another11	situat ion.12 And then I heard tonight  that13 there was no way that the owners could make  their14 money on low- income homeowners. And I think you15 should take that into considerat ion also and16 something should be done about that  also.17 Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 (Audience part icipation. )20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One more21 gent leman who raised his hand.2 2	No?2 3	A VOICE:	No.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You change25 your mind?24
