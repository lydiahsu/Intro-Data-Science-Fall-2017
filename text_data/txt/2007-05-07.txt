2	P R O C E E D I N G S34 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good afternoon,5 everybody.6 My name is Marvin Markus.	I'd like7 to welcome you to a meeting of the Rent Guidelines8 Board.	This is one in a series of meetings and9 public hearings held to determine the allowable10 lease increase for rent stabilized apartments,11 hotel stabilized apartments and loft stabilized12 apartments to take effect October 1, 2007 and run13 until September 30, 2008.14 I have a couple of announcements for15 the people at the Board and in the audience .16 Following the action tonight there17 will be some public hearings held to comment on18 the proposed rental adjustment that's determined19 this evening.	They will be held right here on20 Tuesday, June 12th from 10 a.m. in the morning21 scheduled to go until 6:00 p.m. , although as is22 our tradition, we will take everybody there is to23 speak until there' s nobody left to speak on that24 day.25 And Tuesday, June 19th we will hold
 2 a hearing beginning at 4 p.m. in Queens at3 LaGuardia Community College in the Performing Arts4 Center, which is 31-10 Thomson Avenue.	People who5 are interested in coming should use the entrance6 on Van Dam Street just north of 47th Avenue.7 It's in Long Island City.8 Pre- registration to speak at these9 hearings will begin tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.10 And anybody who would like to speak can sign up by11 calling the Rent Guidelines Board office at 12	212-385-2934.13 In addition, there will be a public14 meeting of the Rent Guidelines Board held on June15 5th at Spector Hall at 22 Reade Street.	At that16 point it's expected that Deputy Commissioner17 Torres of the State Division of Housing and18 Community Renewal will be addressing the Board.19 A list of Board members' questions20 for last year for DHCR are in the folders of the21 Board members. These questions will be sent to22 DHRC for response prior to the meeting of23 Commissioner Torres.	Deputy Commissioner Torres24 will be at the meeting to answer those and other25 questions.
2 Any additional questions that anyone3 of the Board might have, please let Andrew know so4 we can add them to the packet.5 As most people in the audience know,6 this is a voting meeting of the Rent Guidelines7 Board for a preliminary guideline upon which we8 will take the testimony, as I just indicated.9 We - - in terms of our agenda, we10 will first be dealing for the proposed rent11 stabilized apartment and loft guidelines, both the12 one and two-year lease renewal, the supplemental13 adjustment, if any, sublet allowance, if any, and14 any other proposals, and a special guideline that15 we promulgate in order for DHCR to make certain16 determinations when a unit goes from rent control17 to rent stabilization.18 I will read for the record the19 without any percentages, the Proposed 200720 Apartment Order #39 of the New York City Rent21 Guidelines Board.22 I would ask people who make the23 motions, to make the motions consistent with what24 I've read in the record.	This is the formal25 reading in the record so that everybody knows what
  2 we' re voting on.	When we take actual suggestions3 from the members, we will be filling in the4 blanks, if you will, of the blanks that I'm about5 to read.6 Notice is hereby given pursuant to7 the authority vested in the New York City Rent8 Guidelines Board by the Rent Stabilization Law of9 1969, as amended, and the Emergency Tenant10 Protection Act of 1974, as amended, implemented by11 Resolution No. 276 of 1974 of the New York City12 Council and extended by Chapter 82 of the Laws of13 2003 , and in accordance with the requirements of14 Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, that15 the Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) hereby proposes16 the following levels of fair rent increases over17 lawful rents charged and paid on September 30, 18	2007.19 These rent adjustments will apply to20 rent stabilized apartments with leases commencing21 on or after October 1, 2007 and through September 22	30, 2008.23 Rent guidelines for loft units24 subject to Section 286 subdivision 7 of the25 Multiple Dwelling Law are also included in this
2 order.3 Proposed Renewal Adjustments for4 Apartments.5 Together with such further6 adjustments as may be authorized by law, the7 annual adjustment for renewal leases for8 apartments shall be:9 For a one-year renewal lease10 commencing on or after October 1, 2007 and on or11 before September 30, 2008:	Blank percent.12 For a two-year renewal lease13 commencing on or after October 1, 2007 and on or14 before September 30, 2008:	Blank percent.15 These two adjustments shall also16 apply to dwelling units in a structure subject to17 the partial tax exemption under Section 42la of18 the Real Property Tax Law, or in a structure19 subject to Section 423 of the Real Property Tax20 Law as a Redevelopment Project.21 Proposed Vacancy Allowance for22 Apartments.23 There shall be blank vacancy24 allowance.25 Proposed Supplemental Adjustment.
2 There shall be blank supplemental3 adjustment for apartments renting below any4 specified amount for renewal leases.5 Proposed Equalization Allowance.6 There shall be blank equalization7 allowance for apartments continuously occupied for8 a specified period of time for renewal leases.9 Proposed Additional Adjustment for10 rent stabilized apartments sublet under Section11 2525.6 of The Rent Stabilization Law.12 In the event of a sublease governed13 by subdivision (e) of section 2525.6 of the Rent14 Stabilization Code, the allowance authorized by15 such subdivision shall be blank percent.16 Proposed Adjustments for Lofts17 (units in the category of buildings covered by18 article 7-C of the multiple dwelling law.)19 The Rent Guidelines Board proposes20 the following levels of rent increase above the21 "base rent, " as defined in Section 286,22 subdivision 4, of the Multiple Dwelling Law, for23 units to which these guidelines are applicable in24 accordance with Article 7-C of the Multiple25 Dwelling Law:
2 For one-year increase periods3 commencing on or after October 1, 2007 and on or4	before September 30, 2008:	Blank percent.5 For two-year increase periods6 commencing on or after October 1, 2007 and on or7 before September 30, 2008:	Blank percent.8 Vacant Loft Units - Proposal.9 Blank Vacancy Allowance is permitted10 under this Order.	Therefore, except as otherwise11 provided in Section 286, subdivision 6, of the12 Multiple Dwelling Law, the rent charged to any13 tenant for a vacancy tenancy commencing on or14 after October 1, 2007 and on or before September15 30, 2008 may not exceed the "base rent" referenced16 above plus the level of adjustment permitted above17 for increase periods.18 We have some explanation clauses.19 Fractional Terms.20 For the purposes of these guidelines21 any lease or tenancy for a period up to and22 including one year shall be deemed a one-year23 lease or tenancy, and any lease or tenancy for a24 period of over one year and up to and including25 two years shall be deemed a two-year lease or
2 tenancy.3 Escalator Clauses - Proposal.4 Where a lease for a dwelling unit in5 effect on May 31, 1968 or where a lease is in6 effect on June 30, 1974 for a dwelling unit which7 became subject to the Rent Stabilization Law of8 1969, by virtue of the Emergency Tenant Protection9 Act of 1974 and Resolution 276 of the New York10 City Council, contained an escalator clause for11 the increased costs of operation and such clause12 is still in effect, the lawful rent on September13 30, 2007, over which the fair rent under this14 Order is computed, shall include the increased15 rental, if any, due under such clause except those16 charges which accrued within one year of the17 commencement of the renewal lease.18 Moreover, where a lease contained an19 escalator clause that the owner may validly renew20 under the Code, unless the owner elects or has21 elected in writing to delete such clause,22 effective no later than October 1, 2007 from the23 existing lease and all subsequent leases for the24 dwelling unit, the increased rental, if any, due25 under such escalator clause shall be offset
2 against the amount of increase authorized under3 this Order.4 Special Adjustments Under Prior5 Orders.6 All rent adjustments lawfully7 implemented and maintained under previous8 apartment orders and included in the base rent in9 effect on September 30, 2007 shall continue to be10 included in the base rent for the purpose of11 computing subsequent rents adjusted pursuant to12 this Order.13 Proposed Special Guideline.14 Under Section 26- 513 (b)(1) of the15 New York City Administrative Code, and Section16 9(e) of the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of17 1974, the Rent Guidelines Board is obligated to18 promulgate special guidelines to aid the State19 Division of Housing and Community Renewal in its20 determination of initial legal regulated rents for21 housing accommodations previously subject to the22 City Rent and Rehabilitation Law, which are the23 subject of a tenant application for adjustment.24 The Rent Guidelines Board hereby25 proposes the following Special Guidelines:2 
2 For dwelling units subject to the3 Rent and Rehabilitation Law on September 30, 2007,4 which become vacant after September 30, 2008, the5 special guideline shall be blank percent.6 Decontrolled Units - Proposal.7 The permissible increase for8 decontrolled units as referenced in Order 3a which9 become decontrolled after September 30, 2007,10 shall be blank percent.11 Credits.12 Rentals charged and paid in excess13 of the levels of rent increase established by this14 Order shall be fully credited against the next15 month' s rent.16 Statement of Basis and Purpose.17 The Rent Guidelines Board is18 authorized to promulgate rent guidelines governing19 apartment units subject to the Rent Stabilization20 Law of 1969, as amended, and the Emergency Tenant21 Protection Act of 1974, as amended.22 The purpose of these guidelines is23 to implement the public policy set forth in the24 Findings and Declaration of Emergency of the Rent25 Stabilization Law of 1969 (§26-501 of the N.Y.C.2 
2 Administrative Code) and in the Legislative3 Finding contained in the Emergency Tenant4	Protection Act of 1974 (L.1974 c . 576, §4 [§2]).5 The Rent Guidelines Board is also6 authorized to promulgate rent guidelines for loft7 units subject to Section 286, subdivision 7 of the8 Multiple Dwelling Law.	The purpose of the loft9 guidelines is to implement the public policy set10 forth in the Legislative Findings of Article 7-C11 of the Multiple Dwelling Law (Section 280.)12 That's it.13 So in terms of the individual14 proposals, people will be filling in the blanks or15 any other change you would like .	But this is16 before the collective body.17 Is anybody offering a motion?18 Mr. Schleider.19 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you,20 Mr . Chairman.21 Thank you, Board Members and welcome22 to the public assembly gathered here.23 This year's deliberations have not24 been easy for the Owners Members in spite of the25 reports illustrating an easy case to be made for
1	162 of housing availability.3 Yes, housing should be affordable4 but availability drives market pricing.5 Documentation shows this administration has done a6 major effort towards increasing housing7 availability for half a million people and that8 pricing affordable to the vast majority of low and9 moderate income New Yorkers.10 This is sound public policy.	Yes,11 this administration has expanded the SCRIE12 program.	And I hope that continuing sound public13 policy will move the City Council to press for14 further expansion of this and other programs to15 help those at housing risk.16 Yes, this administration has offered17 housing subsidies of up to $14,600 to entice new18 Math, Science and Special Education teachers to19 work in this City' s most challenging schools, in20 one of most aggressive housing incentive programs21 in the nation, to address a chronic shortage of22 qualified educators in these specialities.23 That's another great public policy24 move.	This is what's needed.	This is what has25 been needed - a workable public policy to address
1	172 housing availability and affordability.	And the3 key to affordable housing is to produce more and4 preserve what' s already in place.5 We need to preserve the vast6 majority of private rental stock that has become7 the backbone of this City.	But what of the8 affordability issue?	What of the homeless issue?9 What of the lower income households in a chronic10 state of stress over living expenses, all11 expenses, and not just rent payments.12 Public policy that addresses income13 assistance is necessary.	The Board will not be14 silent on this.	And the Board has discussed the15 income gap that impacts about one in five rent16 stabilized households.	And the Board will address17 this, and for many years to come, unless18 appropriate income subsidies become public policy.19 A workable public policy to address20 income gaps in housing affordability that puts21 responsibility where it needs to be, on the22 shoulders of government, is what' s needed.23 We've read reports that finally24 another 22, 000 Section 8 vouchers will be made25 available for rent assistance.	We've read that2 
2 Speaker Quinn thought a rental rebate would make3 sense.	We've heard testimony from the tenant4 advocacy groups that it's flexible housing5 assistance that works to lift families out of6 homelessness and to prevent recurring episodes of7 homelessness.8 It's an income issue and government9 policy to address costs of living for those most10 at risk needs to be devised.	Tenants - a sizable11 voting block - need to help the administration to12 focus these incentives and initiatives.13 Through their advocacy groups,14 tenants need to work with landlords to petition15 the City to lower property taxes on rent16 stabilized buildings, to petition the City to17 lower the water and sewer costs, to petition the18 utility and insurance companies to lower the cost19 for rent stabilized buildings, to do something to20 lower these costs for existing properties in step21 with the City initiatives for new affordable22 housing, respect that landlords have been23 shouldering the cost of providing what has become24 an expensive public income subsidy program, and25 help to shift this responsibility back to
2 government where housing and income subsidies3 belong.4 The vast majority of landlords, a5 large number of landlords, own small buildings.6 About 40 percent of the regulated rental housing7 stock is in buildings of less than eleven units.8 And the vast majority of landlords have been9 suffering the cost increases of real estate taxes,10 insurance, fuel oil, labor and services for years11 without a commensurate increase in rents.12 There is no government income13 subsidy for these gatekeepers of the existing14 affordable housing stock.	These gatekeepers are15 the private citizens that the City has inequitably16 forced to shoulder the public cost with higher17 real estate taxes, an 11.5 percent upcoming18 increase of water and sewer charges on top of last19 year' s 9.4 percent increase and the announced 1720 percent Con Ed rate increase.21 Some say landlords don't need the22 help in shifting the burden for subsidizing tenant23 incomes or mean costs.	Though the City's housing24 stock condition has improved in recent years and25 residents are noting improved neighborhood
2 conditions, we've seen the staff reports that show3 a large increase in distressed housing.	That's4 where expenses are greater than rents - and this5 is frightening - the percentage of distressed6 rental properties doubled in five years and still7 eleven out of a hundred rental properties are in8 economic distress.9 What does this mean for the future10 of rent stabilization?	The damage from inadequate11 rent increases so far has encouraged the sale of12 barely profitable rent stabilized buildings from13 long- term, stable ownership to speculators that14 have no other agenda but to clear the building for15 higher rents or convert the properties to condo,16 which will permanently remove those apartments17 from rent regulation.18 In testimony to us last year, a City19 Council Member reported a series of harassments by20 a property manipulator as the only purpose was to21 clear the building of low rent tenancy and go for22 condominium development.	No amount of rent23 increase will satisfy that property manipulator24 because that property manipulator doesn't want any25 tenants to collect rent from.2 
2 But unless commensurate rent3 increases finally begin, more and more landlords,4 those willing to remain as landlords, providing5 rental housing for the City, more landlords will6 sell to property manipulators because the7 landlords can't keep up with the rapid rise in8 operating expenses.9 This Board can't regulate the market10 forces, but we need to be responsive to them.11 This year' s continuing operating cost increases of12 5.1 percent on top of last year' s 7 .8 percent, on13 top of the prior 6.9 percent increase, on top of14 the prior year' s 16.9 percent increase in15 operating costs must be shared.16 This is a 36.7 percent increase in17 operating costs in four years.	The tenants must18 share in these cost increases.	The Board' s own19 calculation show rent increases almost as high as20 ten percent, yes, almost ten percent for a21 two-year renewal lease is warranted.22 This Board must allow landlords to23 protect New York' s housing and to equitably share24 the burden.	I've said this before that this Board25 can and must respect the expectations of a
2 reasonable return if the market is to maintain its3 investment in what is referred to as the largest4 inventory of affordable housing in the City.5 This Board cannot frustrate the6 expectations of the steady and predictable7 operating income for landlords and expect them to8 preserve the housing stock called the backbone of9 this great City.10 To be fair, there should be a11 sharing of the cost increases.	The landlords have12 been burdened with the lion's share of cost13 increases and will continue so given the Board' s14 reluctance to provide for adequate rent increases.15 This being said, in the spirt of16 sharing the burden, I call for a vote for a17 commensurate rental increase limited to 5.518 percent for a one-year renewal lease, and a 9.519 percent increase on the two-year renewal lease.20 Further, I move that the following21 guidelines be permitted:22 A Longevity Allowance.23 I move that upon renewal, a one- time24 Equalization Allowance equal to an additional six25 percent increase for apartments renting for $6002 
2 or less and continuously occupied for ten years or3 more.4 Two, Lease Apartment Sublets.5 Upon subletting, an allowance in the6 amount of ten percent.7 Three, initial rents for8 decontrolled units entering stabilization, the9 Maximum Base Rent plus a hundred percent, plus10 fuel adjustment, or the approximated Fair Market11 Rent for Section 8 Housing as established by HUD12 for the New York City PMSA adjusted for gas and13 electric charges, whichever is greater.14 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there a16 second on that motion?17 DIRECTOR CRUZ:	I second Mr.18 Schleider' s motion.19 I would just like to add - -20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Use the mike.21 DIRECTOR CRUZ:	that the22 proposed guidelines are consistent with the23 staff's report of the CPI adjusted Net Operating24 Income commensurate adjustment which was for a25 one-year lease, 5.75 percent and for a two-year2 
2 lease 9.75 percent.3 And the property owners are4 proposing a slightly lower than that commensurate5 adjustment which is an adjustment that will only6 keep property owners in the same position7 theoretically as they have been.	It is not to8 create a tremendous profit in the rental market,9 it is to maintain, as Mr. Schleider has argued,10 affordable housing in the City.11 It is important, in fact, it is12 critical for property owners to have their cost of13 operating affordable housing in this City to be14 covered by those costs and not to be continuing15 losing the funds available to meet those costs.16 The tenant community has tremendous17 burdens, but so do the property owners in18 maintaining the affordable housing of this City.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 That' s a second.21 Any discussion?22 (No response.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Not hearing any24 discussion, let me just repeat the motion.25 Hopefully I've got it right - although you're2 
2 going to have to tell me again what your3 equalization allowance is.4 But as I understand it, the motion5 is for a one-year lease five- and- a-half percent.6 For a two-year lease 9.5 percent, and a7 equalization allowance for rents over $6008 rents - - whose rent is over $600 and the tenant9 has been in occupancy for - -10 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Ten years or11 more.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	- - ten years or13 more.14 What additional percentage?15 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	A six percent16 increase.17 DIRECTOR CRUZ:	Six percent.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Six percent19 additional.20 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	For apartments21 renting $600 or less.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.23 And a ten percent Vacancy Allowance24 and a Special Guideline, you're saying 100 percent25 above the MBR2 
2	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	A lease3 adjustment sublet, upon subletting allowance  in4 the amount of ten percent.5 DIRECTOR CRUZ:	Upon subletting.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sublet, right.7 Ten percent, which has been our guideline8 consistently.9	DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Right.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And you're not11 suggesting a Supplemental Adjustment?12 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Not at this13 point.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Not at15 this point.16 And 100 percent MBR, above the MBR17 on the Special Guideline as opposed to the 50  that18 we've been using.19 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Maximum Base20 Rent plus 100 percent plus fuel adjustment or  the21 approximated Fair Market Rent for Section  822 Housing established by HUD for New York  City.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right, okay.24 Plus a fuel adjustment, okay?25 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Right.10 
2	Whichever is greater.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is everybody4	clear on that motion?5	Okay.	Hearing no additional6	discussion I'm going to call the roll.7 Ms. Adams.8 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	No.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Adams votes10 no.11 Ms. Cruz.12 DIRECTOR CRUZ:	Yes.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Cruz votes14 yes.15 Ms. Holder,  "Miss" Holder.16 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	No.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder votes18 no.19 Mr. Kimmel.20 DIRECTOR KIMMEL:	No.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Kimmel votes22 no.23 Mr. Languedoc.24 DIRECTOR LANGUEDOC:	No.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Languedoc10 
2 votes no.3 Ms . Levine.4 DIRECTOR LEVINE:	No.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Levine votes6 no.7 Mr. Schleider.8 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Yes.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, you still10 get to vote.11 (Laughter.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr . Schleider13 votes yes.14 Ms. Wright.15 DIRECTOR WRIGHT:	No.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The Chair votes17 no.18 The motion fails 7-2.19 Do we have any other motion?20 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Yes.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Adriene.22 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you .23 Good evening.24 I'd like to thank everyone for25 coming today.	It's good to see the Board is here10 
2 today and it's wonderful that we're holding this3 hearing in the evening.	And I appreciate the4 Chair changing the time of day for both the5 preliminary vote and for the final vote this year6 back to the evening.7 I've said it before and I'll say8 again, this is an impossible process that we have9 to go through year after year.	Year after year10 it's a process that ignores tenant income and11 affordability factors that are at the heart of the12 economic indicators that this Board must consider13 each year.14 We are experiencing a perfect storm15 of an affordability housing crisis here in New16 York City.	This crisis, a result of weakened rent17 laws that no longer protect tenants, combined with18 weakened housing subsidy programs and the19 wholesale loss of hundreds of thousands of units20 through vacancy decontrol, expirations and21 opt-outs in the Mitchell-Lama and Section 822 Housing developments, combined with Rent23 Guidelines Board increases that have been24 historically high for the past four years, are all25 combining to cause the displacement of tens of2 
2	thousands of moderate income tenants.3	What do we see?	We see that the4 lowest income renters in the City are suffering5 the most.	This year's homeless population is at a6 record high.	An average of 35,000 homeless people7 have slept in City shelters each night.	This8 includes over 9,000 families.9 We see, based off the 2006 data,10 that evictions actually are up 1,700.	Poor11 renters, household with annual incomes at our12 below the Federal poverty level in apartments,13 paid 55 percent of income for each - - for rent14 each month.15 And affordable apartments are out of16 reach for lower income New Yorkers who lose their17 current homes.	To afford the City' s Fair Market18 Rent of $1,076 per month a household must have an19 income of close to $44,000 a year.20 And what else do we see?	We see21 that moderate income renters are also suffering a22 severe affordability gap .	Between 1996 and 200523 moderate income tenants, which is 200 percent of24 Poverty level, saw their share of income going for25 rent climb from 34 to 40 percent.4 
2 Almost one quarter of the City' s3 120,917 subsidized apartments were lost between4 1990 and 2005.	Thousands more units will be lost5 this year thanks to expirations and opt-outs in6 the Mitchell-Lama and Section 8 Housing7 developments.8 This means that rent stabilized9 apartments are more important than ever for10 moderate income households.	In between 2002 and11 2005 stabilized rents rose by over eight percent12 while incomes for stabilized tenants went down by13 8.6 percent to a median household income of14 $32,000 a year.	That' s adjusted for inflation to15 2004 dollars.16 And so what is it that we do?	As17 the Rent Guidelines Board, we point our fingers at18 everyone else except ourselves.	We cede control19 to every other entity in this City and this State20 and to the tenants themselves, yet ignore that we21 are a part of this process.	We are a part of the22 problem.23 This current one-size-fits-all24 approach is not working.	And I would really just25 plead and really insist that as a Board this year2 
1	322 we talk about this differently; that we look at3 the housing stock and the people who live in this4 housing stock and we think about ways in which to5 treat this and the issues of affordability, as6 well as the issues of maintenance and repairs of7 the apartments and what' s actually happening with8 the owners and the tenants so that we look at9 these issues with fresh eyes and we think10 differently about it.11 New York City' s Rent Stabilization12 Laws indicate that in considering rent increases13 for stabilized apartments, a number of factors14 should be taken into account, including economic15 indicators and research on both the well being of16 real estate and the tenants, the laws expressly17 designed to protect.18 However, again, this current19 one- size- fits-all for determining annual rent20 increases do not allow for the appropriate21 consideration of all relevant facts.22 As many tenants and community groups23 illustrated in testimony all last year, there are24 a number of buildings in states of severe25 disrepair that have undergone extensive
2 de-regulation or whose owners are non- compliant3 with rules and regulations, yet are still granted4 rent increases year after year along with owners5 that some of my colleagues on the other side of6 the table would contend deserve those increases.7 Why would owners be treated the same8 if they' re not living up to their responsibilities9 in the same way as other might be?10 (Applause.)11	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	The consideration12 and I'd like to discuss it as we move further13 in this process.	This is a process that we do14 over three months every year.	It's a process that15 is extremely inconvenient to the people who have16 to come and witness this process, as well as a17 very uncomfortable and difficult process for the18 people on this Board.19 But I'd like for us to think in the20 remaining month and a half that we have, to think21 about these issues, to think about them different,22 in a different way.23 The discussion of adoption of24 provisos would allow the Board an opportunity to25 set annual guidelines that are not only more fair12 
2 and balanced, but also more flexible, allowing for3 the identification of specific circumstances in4 which it is agreed that rent increases are not5 warranted.	So think about this when we think6 about how we go forward.7 When you consider the following8 issues, such as deregulation, it has long been9 argued that owners who deliberately deprive10 themselves of additional rents by withholding11 units from the market should not complain that12 existing rents are insufficient to earn an13 adequate return on their investment and as a14 result, have been denied annual rent increases.15 Similarly, residential hotels in16 which the majority of the units are used as17 commercial hotel rooms, have been denied rent18 increases based on the financial well being the19 commercial units provided.20 Likewise, if an owner has21 deregulated the majority of the units in his22 building, the new market rent apartment should23 produce a return on the original investment that24 is more than adequate.	As a result, such25 buildings should not receive annual rent increases
2 due to both their demonstrated financial stability3 and their contribution to the erosion of the4 affordable housing stock.5 We should consider this factor.6 (Applause.)7 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Two, Building8 Conditions.9 My colleagues on the opposite side10 of table who represent owners would agree that11 there is no reason why owners who have buildings12 and who flout regulations that say that they're13 supposed to keep them in good repair, that these14 landlords should in any way be held up as being15 good landlords .	So when we think about building16 conditions, let's think about it in this way:17 Buildings with immediately hazardous18 conditions as documented by HPD are both in19 violation of the Rent Stabilization Law and the20 New York City Housing Maintenance Code .21 The State Division of Housing and22 Community Renewal also recognizes that when23 landlords are clearly not upholding their24 responsibility to provide repairs and required25 services, tenants should not be required to
2 provide full compensation and issue rent impairing3 violations to this end.4 Clearly, in buildings with uniformly5 poor conditions, the increases being granted each6 year by this Board to cover operating costs are7 not being used for their defined purpose and8 therefore, should be withheld until such time that9 HPD can verify, through its own inspection, that10 violations have been corrected.11 (Audience participation.)12 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Finally, the13 Omnibus Housing Act requires that all units14 stabilized after 1984 are registered with the15 State in order to track rent levels and do16 regulation.17 Owners are required to register18 annually and provide tenants with copies of the19 registration papers each year.	However, anecdotal20 information seems to indicate that a number of21 units in buildings through the five boroughs22 remain unregistered and therefore unaccounted for23 by the State agency.24 The law expressly states that25 failure to re-certify each year can lead to a
2 denial of annual rent increases, a provision that3 should be adopted.4 I am proposing that this Board think5 about those issues as we move forward.	We should6 think about the fact that right now despite7 everything, that owners of rent regulated housing8 are earning generous incomes.	The 2005 income and9 expense data, the most recent available, show that10 on average owners earn 35 cents profit net11 operating income out of every dollar earned from12 their buildings.13 And for those landlords who are14 suffering, there are hardship applications that15 can be made.	And for those owners that are16 suffering we should, as my colleague Steven said,17 think about ways in which to talk to the City,18 perhaps as a unified voice, if owners truly open19 their books and show us how they are suffering, to20 talk about - -21 (Audience participation.)22 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	- - what it is23 that the City and State can do to help them.	I'm24 not going to sit here and say that costs have not25 gone up.	I'm not going to sit here and say that
2 living in this City and that providing any types3 of utilities, as well as food on the table for a4 child is any cheaper for any of us.	Not one of us5 can say that with any kind of legitimacy.6 But the issue is in terms of how it7 is that you bear the burden and the cost and the8 responsibility.	We, the Rent Guidelines Board,9 are a part of this process.	We are a part of the10 problem.	We do not need to just rely on the City11 to come up with generating new types of income for12 subsidies.	We do not just have to rely on the13 City for talking about the creation of housing.14 That is a part of it.15 We do not have to wait for the State16 to repeal Urstadt and give the City back control17 of its housing.	We are a part of this whole18 process.	And while all the different parts of19 this huge wheel of a machine are working, we need20 to do our best to be creative and to be forceful21 and be a force here in the City as the Rent22 Guidelines Board.	Because this is not working.23 This process is not working.	This24 one-size- fits-all approach has to stop.25 So what am I going to do today, I'm
1	392 about to make a motion.	I'd like seriously for my3 colleagues to consider what I've said.4 My motion today at this preliminary5 hearing is quite simply for one-year leases, zero6 percent until such time as we can have a further7 debate on this process over the next six weeks,8 and zero percent for two-year leases with no9 Supplemental Allowances.10 (Audience participation. )11 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Again, we've had12 some very good preliminary discussions as a Board.13 We have some new members on the Board. I'd like to14 continue those discussions.	This is the15 preliminary vote.16 I would like for my colleagues to17 seriously consider some of the issues that I've18 raised and for us to explore them together with19 the remaining time that we have during this Rent20 Guidelines Board season of 2007.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do I have a22 second on that motion?23 DIRECTOR LANGUEDOC:	Mr. Chair, I24 second the motion.25 And if I may - -2 
2(Applause.)3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Sure.You'd4 like to make a statement?	You need to move the5 mike a little closer.6 DIRECTOR LANGUEDOC:	Okay.	If I7 may, I would just like to echo what Ms. Holder has8 said, particularly with respect to the crisis in9 affordable housing.10 What we have already learned as a11 Board at this stage of the process is that12 approximately 270, 000 of the rent stabilized13 apartments are occupied by families living below14 the Federal Poverty Level, that I don' t know that15 the impact of a rent increase upon those families16 can be discounted, as was suggested by some owner17 testimony.18 I think that - - also that the impact19 upon moderate income household incomes cannot be20 discounted; that we had testimony that the21 starting salary of a Police Officer or a school22 teacher is below the level of affordable housing23 for the rent levels that exist in New York City at24 this time.25 At the same time, the loss of4 
1	412 affordable housing in other sectors of the City3 has been dramatic.	There' s been an opt-out of the4 apartments in the Mitchell-Lama program.	There' s5 been an opt- out of apartments in the Section 86 program.7 And while the New York City Housing8 Authority is - - has reopened the waiting list for9 Section 8 vouchers, that it's not going to make up10 for the numbers that have been lost .11 So that the net result is a12 reduction in the amount of affordable housing and13 necessarily a huge percentage of the lower income14 people in New York City are relying upon the rent15 stabilized housing to meet their housing needs.16 And when we cannot - - we cannot17 ignore that our primary responsibility as this18 Board is to preserve what is New York City' s19 largest supply of affordable housing.20 And for that reason I second the21 motion.22 (Audience participation.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do I have a24 second?25 (No response.)2 
2CHAIRMANMARKUS:Any discussion?3DIRECTORCRUZ:Mr. Chairman4CHAIRMANMARKUS:Sure.5DIRECTORCRUZ:I have a6 comment about zero guidelines.7 I would like to just state for the8 record that such a proposition would be deemed to9 be unconstitutional as the taking of property10 without just compensation.11 (Audience participation.)12 DIRECTOR CRUZ:	This is rental13 housing in New York City that we are here14 considering for determining the correct rental15 increases.	It is not	is not government16 supplied housing.	It is based on the private17 ownership of property.18 Our role on the Board is dictated by19 the New York City Rent Stabilization Laws.	And in20 that law it clearly directs us . as Board Members to21 analyze economic factors of cost and maintenance .22 We are obligated to consider those as primary23 factor in determining our guidelines.24 Yes, we must consider the impact on25 tenants and on households of this City .	But it is6 
2 all a balance.	And to suggest zero guidelines3 would be a complete subversion of both our legal4 obligations as well as the constitutional right of5 property owners to have proper rent increases in6 order to supply regulated housing to the City of7 New York.8	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	What' s your9	legal basis for that?10 (Audience participation. )11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have12 Adriene, talk into the mike, please.13 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Well, I mean14 it's - - what' s the legal basis for that - -15 DIRECTOR CRUZ:	There are - - there16 are the several - -17 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	- - the taking?18 DIRECTOR CRUZ:	cases when rent19 regulation was first enacted in New York City,20 rent stabilization specifically, in which the21 courts held that guidelines must compensate owners22 for their costs and provide property owners with a23 reasonable rate of return.	And absent that, rent24 regulation is unconstitutional.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, I don't - -10 
2 well, we have our points of view.	I'm not sure3 whether it's constitutional or not.	But at this4 point, to the extent this Board were to adopt5 zero, then I think somebody will litigate and6 we' ll see if it's unconstitutional so.7 (Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	But - -9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do we have any11 additional debate?12 (No response.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'll call the14 roll.15 Ms. Adams.16 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	I vote no.17 But I do have a comment in terms of18 some of the things that she said, after the vote,19 if I could make it.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.21 Would you like to make it now?22 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	I can.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Go ahead.24 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	And that would be25 that I think everyone would be in agreement that10 
2 the one-size- fits-all is not working for us. I3 know the general public is very concerned about4 that.5 I am not a lawyer and most of the6 people up here are so I'm not interested in the7 legalistic discussions of the matter. However, I8 think that if there are things that members of9 this Board feel are within our current legislation10 and we can agree on what those are, then they11 should to sent to the Corporation Counsel and we12 take our ruling from there.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.14 Ms. Adams votes no.15 Ms. Cruz?16 DIRECTOR CRUZ:	No.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Cruz votes18 no.19 Ms. Holder.20 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Yes.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder votes22 yes.23 Mr. Kimmel.24 DIRECTOR KIMMEL:	No.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Kimmel votes2 
2 no.3 Mr. Languedoc.4 DIRECTOR LANGUEDOC:	Yes.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Languedoc6 votes yes.7 Ms. Levine.8	DIRECTOR LEVINE:	No.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Levine votes10 no.11 Mr. Schleider.12 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair,13 just a brief comment.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' re entitled15 to make a comment when you vote.	Go ahead.16 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Just a brief17 comment.18 We have landlords that have also19 broached the subject of some sort of bifurcated or20 split analysis of rent increases, something that21 may not go towards the one- size-fits-all.22 But I must take exception with the23 way that Ms. Holder presented it.	I mean last24 year she did the same thing where she said she's25 only going to vote zero unless this Board picks up
2 discussions on a litany of subjects.3 I find that obstructionist.	And I4 have no qualms about conducting discussions.	But5 to hold the Board hostage that she's not going6 move off of a zero percent increase until we7 consider this and discuss it openly, I find8 unconscionable.9 But I have to vote no against the10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider11 votes no.12 Ms. Wright.13 DIRECTOR WRIGHT:	I vote no.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Wright votes15 no.16 The Chair votes no.17 The motion fails 7- 2.18 Let me make a statement.19 Many of the items that Ms. Holder20 alluded to are things that we will be discussing21 I'm pretty sure at our June 5th meeting.	And they22 are items that the Corporation Counsel in most23 cases - - and we will reread the record to make24 sure that we look at the individual sort of25 direction of those suggestions to make sure that2 
2 we have Corporation Counsel give us a sense as to3 whether they think this is within our power or4 not.5 I would point out that there is a6 lot of criticism, as Mr . Schleider says, and7 certainly as Adriene Holder said, that the8 one- size- fits-all is not the right approach.9 And I think probably on that if we10 had a vote, you'd get seven votes - - not seven11 votes, nine votes on that.	But the question is,12 you know, what are the nuances, what are the13 changes that we could agree, on five votes, that14 are legal in order to change that15 one- size- fits- all methodology .16 But we will explore it .	And we will17 explore it certainly I'm sure it will be part of18 the discussion on June 5th.19 Go ahead .20 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Mr. Chairman, I21 just wanted to say that in making the suggestion22 that I did I did not feel that the Board was being23 held hostage.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Right.	I25 understand.
1	492 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And I would just3 like to say that I have never felt so powerful on4 this Board until my colleague, Steven Schleider,5 said I was holding the Board hostage.6 I feel - -7 (Laughter & applause.)8	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I appreciate9 that vote of confidence that I would have the10 power to do that.	But let me assure you that was11 not my intention to hold the Board hostage.	But12 wow, do I feel empowered today as an advocate for13 the tenants.14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay.	You - -16 where is he?	Quiet.17 Any other motions?	Mr. Schleider?18 Ms. Cruz?	Ms. Holder?19 (No response. )20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No motions?21 Anybody else?	Any public members?22 Mr. Kimmel .23 DIRECTOR KIMMEL:	Mr. Chair, I24 look forward to our continued hearings over the25 next couple of weeks and I look forward to9 
2 continued discussions with my fellow Board3 members.4 I propose the following:5 I move to adopt the language of the6 proposed apartment and Loft Order #39 as you read7 into the record of this meeting.	And I move to8 adopt the following proposed rental adjustments9 for rent stabilized apartments and lofts.10 Together with such further11 adjustments as may be authorized by law, for12 apartments, the annual adjustment for renewal13 leases for apartments shall be:14 For one-year renewal leases15 commencing on or after October 1, 2007 and on or16 before September 30, 2008, a range between two and17 four-and- a-half percent.18 For a two-year renewal lease19 commencing on or after October 1, 2007 and on or20 before September 30, 2008, a range between four21 and seven-and- a-half percent.22 No Vacancy Allowance is permitted23 except as provided by Sections 19 and 20 of the24 Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1997.25 There shall be no Supplemental
1	512 Adjustment.3 There shall be no Equalization4 Allowance, and a Sublet Allowance of ten percent.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do I have a6	second on that motion?7 DIRECTOR WRIGHT:	I second that.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Wright' s9	second.10 So to just to clarify, we're talking11 about a proposed range that for public hearing12 purposes that would - - for a one-year lease would13 be two percent to four- and- a-half.	And for a14 two-year lease would be four to seven-and- a-half.15 No Vacancy Allowance.	No16 Supplemental Allowance.	No Equalization17 Allowance.18 DIRECTOR KIMMEL:	A Sublet19 Allowance.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And a Sublet21 Allowance, excuse me, of ten percent.	And all the22 other pieces that were talked about here including23 - - do you have a motion on a Special Guideline?24 DIRECTOR KIMMEL:	Oh, I'm sorry.25 On Special Guidelines, 50 percent10 
2 above the Maximum Base Rent.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So it would read4 similar to what we have today.	Fifty percent5 plus - -6	DIRECTOR KIMMEL :	Or the Fair7 Market Rent for existing housing as established by8 the United States Department of Housing and Urban9 Development for the New York City primary10 Metropolitan statistical area pursuant to Section11 8 (c) 1 of the United States Housing Act of 1937,12 and 24 CFR Part 888, with such fair market rents13 to be adjusted based on whether the tenant pays14 his or her own gas and/or electric charges as part15 of his or her rent, as such gas and/or electric16 charges are accounted for by the New York City17 Housing Authority .18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Any - -19 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER :	Is that the20greaterof?21CHAIRMANMARKUS:Excuse me .22DIRECTORKIMMEL:Yes. The greater23of .24CHAIRMANMARKUS:Greater of.25DIRECTORCRUZ :Mr. Chairman?
1	532 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.3 Let me just ask, Mr. Kimmel, would4 you like to make a motion on the lofts?5 DIRECTOR KIMMEL:	Yes.6 For the lofts.	I'm sorry .7 For the one-year increase period8 commencing on or after October 1, 2007 and on or9 before September 30, 2008, a range between two  and10 four percent.	I'm sorry.	Yes, two and four11 percent, correct.12 And for the two-year increase13 periods commencing on or after October 1, 2007  and14 on or before September 30, 2008, four to  seven15 percent .16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is that - - Ms.17 Wright, do you second that motion, the amendments?18 DIRECTOR WRIGHT:	I second the19 motion.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.21 Go ahead, Ms. Cruz.22 DIRECTOR CRUZ:	Is Mr. Kimmel not23 proposing any Longevity Allowance  for apartments24 that rent for $600 or less and for - -25 (Applause.)2 
1	542	DIRECTOR KIMMEL:	No.3	DIRECTOR CRUZ:	And if I may, with4 all due respect, just understand what the basis is5 for your proposal.	Are you basing those numbers6 on anything specific that we've heard for the past78	DIRECTOR KIMMEL:	The numbers are9 based on the reports that we've gotten.	My10 feeling is it's premature at this point to focus11 on a specific number.	And I feel that as we go12 forward and review more reports, hear more13 testimony and further discussions among ourselves,14 that we will focus on a number for the final vote.15 DIRECTOR CRUZ:	Thank you.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder?17 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	No.	I'm sorry.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oh, Mr. Languedoc.19 Sure.	Go ahead.	Sorry.20 DIRECTOR LANGUEDOC:	I'd just like21 to ask a question about the range because22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.23 DIRECTOR LANGUEDOC:	- - in my mind,24 I understand the notion that we still have more25 discussion and more reports to look at.	But9 
1	552 what' s wrong with proposing a specific number now3 so that the public - -4 (Audience participation. )5	DIRECTOR LANGUEDOC:	So that the6 public understands where the Board is at this7 point.	And, you know, to propose a range of8 numbers is to kind of confuse the issue I think9 for a lot of the members of the public who don't10 know whether the Board is likely to go in the11 middle of the range or towards one end or the12 other.13 And if we pick - - if the Board picks14 a number, we understand that it's a preliminary15 vote, that there' s more discussions to be had, but16 it does give the public a clearer picture of where17 the Board stands at this time in terms of numbers.18 I think it's, you know, fairer to19 the public if we were to do it that way.	And I20 would like to know what' s your reaction to that.21 (Applause.)22CHAIRMANMARKUS:Ms. Adams.23DIRECTORHOLDER:But what' s his24response?25DIRECTORADAMS:When we look at
2 the proposals that have already been submitted,3 for example, the landlords suggesting4 five-and-a-half to nine-and-a-half percent and the5 tenants suggested zero percent.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Zero to zero.7 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Zero to zero .	We8 are in the middle of that .	I, for one, am not9 ready to agree on any number, but the range, it10 seems to me, is between the two.11 DIRECTOR LANGUEDOC:	But with all12 do respect, that begs the question because it's13 not - - as I said, this is a preliminary vote.14 Everyone knows that there' s no finality to this15 decision tonight.16 But by fixing a number in the17 preliminary vote the public understands what18 direction the Board is heading.	And those who are19 advocating that the increases should be higher20 than that know that they have their job cut out21 for them to advocate to this Board.	And those22 that think they should be lower have their job cut23 out for them.24 That' s my point.25 (Applause.)9 
2DIRECTORSCHLEIDER:Mr. Chair.3CHAIRMANMARKUS:Go ahead, Mr.4Schleider.5DIRECTORSCHLEIDER:On yet another6 issue I agree with the tenant's side.7 The range is, I can imagine it can8 be useful to some degree.	But when you go so far9 below the commensurates, I have to question the10 validity of that bottom number.	I mean our own11 commensurates stop at about three and a quarter12 percent and you're well below that at two percent.13 At least give us the bottom number14 at the low end of the commensurate range. Our15 upper number was not at the top of the16 commensurate range. I think you should at least17 start with something that the staff has said would18 be a minimum number.19CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Any additional20discussion?21(No response.)22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:I'm going to23call the question.24Ms. Adams.25DIRECTOR ADAMS:Yes.
2CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Ms . Adams votes3yes.4Ms. Cruz.5DIRECTOR CRUZ:	I vote no .6CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Ms . Cruz votes7no .8Ms .

No additional charges may be22 made to a tenant for such services, however such23 charges may be called or identified.24 Statement of Basis or Purpose.25 The Rent Guidelines Board is4 
2 authorized to promulgate rent guidelines governing3 hotel units subject to the Rent Stabilization Law4 of 1969, as amended, and the Emergency Tenant5 Protection Act of 1974, as amended.6 The purpose of these guidelines is7 to implement the public policy set forth in8 Findings and Declaration of Emergency of the Rent9 Stabilization Law of 1969 (§26-501 of the N.Y.C.10 Administrative Code) and in the Legislative11 Finding contained in the Emergency Tenant12	Protection Act of 1974 (L.1974 c. 576, §4 [§2]).13 I'll entertain motions on the hotel14 stabilized sector.15 Ms. Cruz.16 DIRECTOR CRUZ:	Mr. Chairman, I17 would like to move for the guidelines across the18 board for these special types of properties to - -19 A VOICE:	Can't hear you.20 DIRECTOR CRUZ:	- - at the very,21 very least be implemented in the amount of four22 percent across the board.	This will just maintain23 these property owners at a level to cover their24 basic costs.25 Last year the increases were only
2 two percent.	We have not heard much from these3 property owners.	But clearly they have to pay4 electricity and gas and they have to pay taxes and5 they have to pay everything else that all the6 property owners have, plus they have to provide7 services for their hotel residents .8 So I propose that across the board9 there be a four percent.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Four percent is11 the motion .12 A second, Ms. Schleider?13 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Second.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider15 seconds .16 Any additional discussion?17 (No response.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No discussion.19 I'll call the roll.20 Ms. Adams.21 DIRECTOR ADAMS :	No .22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms .

Mr.10	Languedoc, go ahead .11	DIRECTOR LANGUEDOC :	Mr. Chair,12 I'd like to make a motion.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'm sorry.	Go14 ahead .	I thought I said go ahead.15 DIRECTOR LANGUEDOC:	I'm sorry.16 I'd just simply like to move that17 the rent increases for all of these special type18 of housing be set at zero with no - - I'd like to19 move that all the rent increases for these special20 type of housing be set at zero without any21 provisos.22 It's my understanding based on the23 testimony that was provided that all the owners of24 these properties are making sufficient income from25 the commercial use and short-term, overnight use12 
2 of these properties to - - that they do not require3 any Rent Guideline increase at this time .4	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I second that5 motion .6 I also would just like to add that I7 want everyone to remember that this is housing of8 last resort.	We have people who are paying well9 over $700, $800, $900, even well over a thousand10 dollars a month to live in this housing.11 These are low income tenants who12 cannot afford the deposit and to gather the money13 together to get an apartment that often times14 might rent at the same amount, but they have to15 pay daily.16 These are units even where landlords17 are able to rent them out to students and to18 tourists and others .	There' s a lot of mixed use19 going on.	So a lot of these buildings also have20 other types of commercial leasing under it and are21 a part of high luxury hotels.22 We also have seen pictures through23 the years, and we will I know see more during the24 rest of this season, of the conditions in which25 these tenants live in.	And they're not given the5 
1	682 services that one would expect from this type of3 housing in terms of housekeeping services.	The4 shared facilities are not kept well.5 And I think it is proven year after6 year with the fact that no owner of this type of7 housing shows up to testify, that they actually8 are doing quite well and this process is9completelyirrelevant for them and for their10profit.11So I second my colleague' s motion.12(Applause.)13CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any discussion?14(No response.)15CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Take the vote.16Ms. Adams.17DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Yes.18CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Adams votes19yes.20Ms. Cruz.21DIRECTOR CRUZ:	No.22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Cruz votes23no.24Ms. Holder.25DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Yes.

I was19 wondering if I can make a request of the staff of20 the Rent Guidelines Board and our Executive21 Director.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.2 3	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Would it be24 possible, as we move forward in this process, that25 we could have a complete evaluation of the Maximum24 
2 Collectable Rent versus the Maximum Base Rent3 under the Special Guideline?4 I think this continues to be an5 issue with the special guideline.	I know that6 I've advocated for the percentage to be based off7 the Maximum Collectable Rent instead of the8 Maximum Base Rent.	And I'd like for there to be9 maybe a detailed memo or analysis of that that we10 can share with one another to be a part of this11 process.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That' s fine.13 You know, we' ll try to get	why14 don' t you talk to the staff and try to get15 whatever data you want and we' ll see if we can get16 it, okay?17 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you.18 DIRECTOR CRUZ:	Mr. Chairman, I19 believe that the use of the Maximum Base Rent,20 again, is a legal requirement that would not be21 subject to the jurisdiction of this Board and that22 I believe is in the statute.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' ll look at24 that, too.25 DIRECTOR CRUZ:	So I would oppose2 
2	that - -3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' ll look at the4	statute and see whether or not we could use the5	Maximum Collectable and try to get the difference.6	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	It will be a7	great project for us to look it.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We're certainly9 not going to do anything that we think is illegal,10 all think is illegal, okay?11 With that, I appreciate everybody' s12 attendance.13 Again, the next meeting of the14 Guidelines Board will be June 5th.	And the15 meetings, the public hearing, to repeat, if I can16 find it, the public hearings will be June 12th17 here in the Great Hall.	You should sign up18 tomorrow, beginning tomorrow, 212-385- 2934.19 And then they'll also be a public20 hearing, same sign-up, on June 19th in Queens at21 La Guardia Community College.	The staff has the22 specifics if you need to get that.23 I look forward to seeing everybody.24 Thank you.25 We're adjourned.9
