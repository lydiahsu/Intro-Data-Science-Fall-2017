P	R O	C	E	E	D	I N	G	SCHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	We ' re	ready	to	go Alan	Weinstein .Mr . Weinstein , are	you		here ? MR . ALAN	WEINSTEIN :		Yes .CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .	We ' re	ready 
10 when	you	are .11 MR . ALAN	WEINSTEIN :	Okay .12 I	have	compiled	a	list	of	common 13 beliefs	espoused	by	the	general	public	based 14 upon	statements	we	have	heard	on	multiple 15 occasions	over	the	years	at these	Rent 16 Guidelines	hearings .17 Too	often	the	rhetoric	results	in 18 New	York	City	myths .	I ' m	here	as	a	landlord	to 19 debunk	these	myths	and	present	the	realities 20 which ,	as	a	small	rent	stabilized	landlord ,	I21 have	learned	and	lived	with .22 Myth :	Rent	stabilized	tenants	are 23 poor .24 Fact :	Mr .	Apartment	21	pays	$ 799 . 05 25 a	month	for	a	four - room	apartment	in	New	York 10 
2 City .	Mr .	Apartment	21	owns	a	home	in	the 3 Hamptons	which	he and	the	family	use	in season 4 and	rent	out	during	the	winter	months	for	more 5 than	the	$ 799 . 05 he	pays	for	his	Manhattan 6 rental .7 He also	pays	in excess	of	$ 30 , 000	a8 year	for	private	school	college	tuition . No 9 financial	aid	is received ,	but	then ,	again ,	why 10 should	he	need	financial	aid	since	I ' m11 subsidizing	his	tuition .	The	fair	market	rent 12 for	his	apartment	is	$ 2300	monthly .13 Fact :	Mr .	Apartment	24	pays	$ 1133 . 25 14 monthly	for	a	five - room	apartment	in	the	East 15 Village .	He ' s	also	paying	$ 30 , 000	for	his 16 nine - year	old	son	to	attend	an	elite	New	York 17 City	private	school .	The	fair	market	rent	for 18 this	apartment	would	be	$ 3300 .	The	difference 19 between	his	monthly	rent	and	the	fair	market 20 value	of	that	apartment	is	$ 26 , 000 .	In	essence ,21 I	am subsidizing	his	son ' s	tuition .	I	receive 22 no	tax	breaks	for	this	subsidy	nor	am	I allowed 23 to	take	a	child	contribution	deduction	for	my 24 contribution	to the	school .25 Fact :	Mr .	Apartment	2 B	pays	$ 419 . 40 2 
2 a	month	in	rent	and	has	a	cumulative	stock 3 portfolio	in	excess	of	seven	figures .	Is this 4 tenant	in	need	of rent	protection ?5 Myth :	Rent	stabilization	guidelines '6 increase	have	kept	up	pace	with	my	property 7 taxes '	increase .8 Fact :	In	the	past	twelve	years	my 9 property	tax	bill	has	gone	from	$ 18 , 000	to 10 $ 63 , 000 .	This	is a	whopping	350	percent 11 increase .12 Fact :	In	the	past	twelve	years	Ms .13 Apartment	5 C	has	gone	from	a monthly	rental	of 14 $ 481	to	$ 715 .	Had	a	rent	stabilized	increase 15 kept	pace	with	the	punitive	real	estate	taxes 16 levied	upon	the	property ,	her	present	monthly 17 rent	would	be	$ 1683 . 50 ,	still	below	market	rent 18 for	that	apartment .19 Here ,	again ,	I am	subsidizing	her 20 living	arrangements	to	the	tune	of	$ 968	monthly 21 or	$ 11 , 616	for	this	year .22 So I	ask	you ,	are	these	rent 23 stabilized	tenants	in	need	of subsidized 24 housing ?25 I ' m fully	aware	of	the	economic 2 
2 upheaval	that	we are	experiencing ,	yet	strongly 3 urge	you	to	focus	this	year	on	rent	stabilized 4 units	under	$ 1000 .	It	is	imperative	to	continue 5 for	those	rents	under	$ 1000	the	bump - up of	last 6 year ,	an	$ 85	increase	for	two - years	and	a	$ 45 7 for	the	one - year .8 This	will	allow	for	parity	between 9 tenants	who	signed	leases	this	past	year	and 10 those	who	did	not	have	lease	renewals .11 It would	be	wise	to	have	this	year	a12 two - tier	system : One	guideline	increase	for	the 13 rents	below	$ 1000	and	a	separate	guideline	rent 14 for	the	ones	above	$ 1000 .15 I	hope	that	I	have	helped	to	debunk 16 some	New	York	City	rent	stabilization	myths .	In 17 so	doing ,	I	urge	you	to	listen	carefully	and	to 18 question	the	falsehoods	that	are	propagated 19 during	this	guidelines '	hearing .20 Remember ,	not	all	landlords	are 21 wealthy	and	villains	and	not	all	rent 22 stabilized	tenants	are	poor	and	on	the	verge	of 23 homelessness .24 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .25 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Sir .2 
2 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Sure .	Question .3 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Just	- -	I ' d like	you 4 to	comment	on	the	following	sentence .5 According	to	the	2008	Housing 6 Vacancy	Survey , which	reflects	household	income 7 for	2007 ,	the	median	income	for	rental 8 households	was	- -9 MR . ALAN	WEINSTEIN :	You	need	to 10 know	the	rules . There	needs	to	be	- -	the	rent 11 has	to	be	$ 2000	in	order	for	that	to	abide .	So 12 you	should	know	that .13 MR . LANGUEDOC :	What ?14 MR . ALAN	WEINSTEIN :	The	rents	have 15 to	be $ 2000 .	You	cannot	get	an	increase	on 16 their	household	incomes	if	they	are	making	- -17 if	the	rents	are	not	$ 2000 .18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	He ' s	making 19 another	point .20 MR . ALAN	WEINSTEIN :	Oh !21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	But	I	mean	his 22 point	would	be , in	response , is	he ' s	showing 23 you	situations	that	are	in	the	extreme , just 24 like	- -25 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Which	are	not 2 
2 representative	of the	vast	majority	of	- -3 MR . ALAN	WEINSTEIN :	If	you	are 4 poor	in	New	York	City ,	you	are	very	well	taken 5 care	of .	There ' s SCRIE	and	there ' s	DRIE .6 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .	Thank	you .7 It all	argues	for	a	more	precise 8 income - based	system .9 MR . ALAN	WEINSTEIN :	Yeah . I	agree .10 You	should	look	at	individual	- -11 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Go	ahead .	Thank 12 you . Thank	you .13 ( Audience	participation . )14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Mr .	Simons ,	David 15 Arthur	Simons .16 ( Applause . )17 MR . DAVID	ARTHUR	SIMONS :	Good 18 afternoon ,	ladies	and	gentlemen .19 Thank	you	for	your	service , Members 20 of	the	Board .21 My name	is	David	Arthur	Simons .22 ( Ringing	bell . )23 MR . DAVID	ARTHUR	SIMONS :	And	I	am 24 ringing	this	bell	because	I want	to	sound	the 25 alarm	on	landlords	who	say	they	need	more	money 2 

2	- -34
( Audience	participation . )MR . DAVID	ARTHUR	SIMONS :	- -	when ,
5 in	fact ,	they	do not	know	how	to	manage	the 6 money	they	are	getting	now .7 The	building	where	I	live	on	14 th 8 Street	has	a	Dunkin '	Donuts	on	the	ground 9 floor .	I	know	from	other	businesses	in	the 10 neighborhood	that	the	landlord	charges	them	at 11 least	$ 15 , 000	month ,	but	probably	more .12 Yet	in	spite	of the	fact	that	the 13 landlord	makes	so much	money ,	he	invests	none 14 of	it back	into	the	building .	There	are 15 seventeen	apartments	in	my	building ,	four	are 16 vacant ,	and	the	landlord	refuses	to	re - rent 17 them .	Some	of	them	have	been	vacant	for	over 18 two	years .19 There	are	fifty - two	open	violations 20 against	the	building .	None	have	been	addressed 21 by	the	landlord . And	these	include	the	facade 22 of	the	building	is	cracking , every	radiator	is 23 leaking	and	causing	the	ceiling	on	the	floor 24 below	to	cave	in ,	and	the	stairs	are	in need	of 25 repair ,	and	many	other	things .5 
2 But	the	landlord	wants	more	money .3 We know	that	no matter	how	much	you 4 increase	the	rent ,	this	particular	landlord	is 5 not	going	to	do anything	to maintain	and	repair 6 this	building .7 So we	ask	for	a zero	increase .	That 8 is	the	only	increase .9 ( Audience	participation . )10 MR . DAVID	ARTHUR	SIMONS :	We	also 11 know	that	this	landlord	owns	340	buildings	in 12 the	tristate	area .	His	name	is	Stanley 13 Wasserman .	He ' s highly	respected	in	his 14 community .	There ' s	a	school	that	has	been	built 15 in	his	name	in	Jerusalem .16 We know	this	man	has	got	incredible 17 power	and	money , yet	he	refuses	to	repair	this 18 building	and	also	two	others	that	he	owns	on 19 14 th Street ,	one	of	which	you	heard	mentioned	a20 little	while	ago	where	the	tenants	were 21 evacuated	because	the	facade	came	down .22 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	It ' s	an SRO ?23 MR . DAVID	ARTHUR	SIMONS :	It ' s	an 24 SRO .25 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .2 
 2 MR . DAVID	ARTHUR	SIMONS :	He	took 3 the	same	approach	on	two	other	buildings	that 4 he	owns	on	14 th Street .	One	deteriorated	so 5 much	that	the	facade	began	to fall	and	the	City 6 evacuated	and	the	residents	were	evacuated	and 7 the	facade	was	ripped	off	the	building .8 Now	some	of	those	tenants	are 9 homeless .	And	he still	will	not	let	them	rent 10 the	empty	apartments	in	our	building .11 Our	building	is heading	in the	same 12 direction	because	the	landlord	does	not	care 13 about	the	people	in	our	building .	He	wants	to 14 make	more	money	at	any	cost . That ' s	all	he ' s15 interested	in .16 So next	time	you	hear	a	bell	ringing 17	- -18 ( Ringing	bell . )19 MR . DAVID	ARTHUR	SIMONS :	- -20 remember	that	the	landlords , who	do	not	know 21 how	to	manage	money	in	the	buildings	they	own ,22 do	not	deserve	to get	any	rent	increase .23 Thank	you .24 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .25 ( Audience	participation . )18 
2 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	brought	your 3 own	cheering	section .4 And ,	by	the	way ,	it ' s	a	good	thing 5 this	is	a	public	hearing	because	in	the	final 6 decision	you	wouldn ' t	get	through	with	the 7 bell .8 Helen	Daniels .9 Go ahead .	Helen	Daniels .10 MS . HELEN	DANIELS :	Good	afternoon .11 I ' m Helen	Daniels .	I	really	had	not 12 planned	on	speaking	today .	But ,	however , in 13 listening	to	what	was	going	on ,	I	felt	it was 14 important	that	I share	some	of	my	thoughts	and 15 concerns .16 The	years	I	have	worked	with	small 17 property	owners , mainly	minority	owners ,18 black / Latino	owners ,	owners	who	live	in their 19 buildings ,	who	maintain	their	buildings , they 20 live	there	with	their	families	and	also	with 21 the	renters .22 These	are	people	who	are	committed 23 and	concerned	about	what ' s	going	on	in	their 24 neighborhood .	That ' s	why	they	own	the	buildings 25 and	they	maintain	them	to	the	best	of	their 2 

2	abilities .3
But ,	however ,	owning	a	building	and 
4 maintaining	it	requires	money ,	requires	income .5 Therefore ,	it	means	that	someone	must	pay	the 6 expenses .	In	order	for	the	owner	to	pay	the 7 expenses ,	he	or she	must	be sure	to	receive	the 8 rent	and	it	must	be	an	adequate	rent	because 9 buildings	are	supposed	to	be self - sustaining .10 But	many	minority	owners	have	to 11 work	a	second	job	in	order	to maintain	their 12 homes .13 I	think	it ' s	an anomaly	in this	City 14 when	we	think	about	it .	In	this	room	you	don ' t15 see	anyone	or	I doubt	that	anyone	is	here	today 16 who	lives	in	public	housing . If	you	think	about 17 it , if	one	lives	in	public	housing ,	the	rents 18 are	set .	Those	people	who	pay	the	rent	pay	the 19 rent	that	is	set .	If	they	disagree	with	it ,	I20 don ' t	know	what	they	do .	But ,	unfortunately ,21 that ' s	the	rent . They	don ' t argue	and	they 22 don ' t	complain . They	realize	that ' s	the	rent .23 However ,	as	a	private	owner ,	there ' s24 an	issue	about	the	rent .	But	private	owners 25 must	receive	adequate	dollars	in	order	to 4 
2 maintain	their	buildings .3 They	have	to	pay	taxes ,	have	to	pay 4 a	water	bill ,	have	to	pay	a sewer	fee ,	they 5 have	to	pay	maintenance	and	have	to	pay 6 anything	else	that	goes	along	with	maintaining 7 that	building .8 Now ,	please	understand ,	owners ,	and 9 especially	small	owners ,	are	concerned	about 10 their	renters .	They	are	concerned	about	those 11 who	live	there	because	they	live	there	with 12 their	families .13 But ,	however ,	in	this	City , in	order 14 to	maintain	a	building ,	income	must	come	in .15 So , therefore ,	as difficult	as	the	situation	is 16 for	both	owners	and	renters	alike ,	we	must 17 realize	rents	must	be	maintained ,	rent	must	be 18 paid ,	and ,	unfortunately ,	rents	have	to 19 increase	because	expenses	also	increase .20 Thank	you	so	much .21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .22 ( Audience	participation . )23 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Walter	Gambin .24 MR . WALTER	GAMBIN :	Here .25 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Come	on down .2 
2 MR . WALTER	GAMBIN :	Okay .3 First ,	I	want	to	say	I	really	need 4 to	represent	myself	about	a lot	of	things .5 I	really	stand	for	justice . I	don ' t6 agree	with	some	- -	I ' m	a	tenant	and	I	side 7 largely	with	the	tenants ,	but	there	are	a	few 8 issues	that	I	don ' t	side	with	the	tenants	on .9 I	really	- -	I	don ' t	want	to be 10 guilty	of	doing	BS .	There	are	a	few	things	that 11 some	of	the	small	owners	here	have	brought	up 12 that	I	can	sympathize	with .13 And	that	being	said ,	what	you ' re 14 going	to	hear	on the	speech	that	I	prepared 15 would ,	I	think , be	largely	for	the	large	owners 16 among	the	landlords ,	of	which	I	am	a	victim	in 17 the	building	where	I	live .18 And	my	victimization	is	not	huge .19 Other	people	in my	building	suffer	more .20 But ,	okay .	Here	you	go .21 My name	is	Walter	Gambin .	I live	at 22 the	Dexter	House .	It ' s	an	SRO	on	West	86 th 23 Street	in	Manhattan	with	about	250	rooms .24 Okay .	A	few	points .25 Management	there	is	illegally	trying 2 
2 to	change	the	building	to	a tourist	hotel	and 3 also	is	now	renting	to	students	at	rents	which 4 are	more	by	far	than	the	legal	rent	for	their 5 rooms .6 A	second	point . I	know	that	this 7 kind	of	activity	is	common	among	landlords .8 Number	three ,	many	SRO	landlords 9 keep	rooms	empty	on	purpose . Why	don ' t	they 10 just	rent	them	out	if	they	need	more	money ?11 And	number	four ,	and	now	we have	a12 financial	disaster ,	and	most	landlords	have 13 more	of	a	financial	safety	net	than	most 14 tenants .	I	betcha .15 Five ,	especially	to	the	small 16 owners ,	why	not	apply	for	hardship ?17 For	these	reasons	I	say	no rent 18 increases .19 ( Applause . )20 MR . WALTER	GAMBIN :	I	- -	personally 21 I	am designated	disabled	with	a	serious	heart 22 condition	and	live	on	a	combination	of	Social 23 Security	retirement	benefits	and	SSI	of 24 supplemental	security .25 Increasing	my	rent	would	make 2 
2 necessities	harder	to	afford .3 Now	to	speak	a little	more	generally 4 - -	I should	be	able	to	do	this	almost	within 5 the	time .6 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .	Good .7 MR . WALTER	GAMBIN :	What ' s wrong 8 with	these	landlords ?	With	all	the	wealth	they 9 own	they	still	trouble	and	harass	many	of their 10 fellow	citizens	who	are	tenants	and	have	much 11 less	so	that	they ,	the	landlords ,	can	gain 12 still	more	dollars	for	themselves .13 I	say	it	is	sickness .14 ( Audience	participation . )15 MR . WALTER	GAMBIN :	It	is	antisocial 16 behavior .	It	goes	against	living	in	harmony 17 with	their	sisters	and	brothers .18 I	say	it	is	addiction	and	there 19 should	be	rehabilitation	programs	set	up - -20 ( Audience	participation . )21 MR . WALTER	GAMBIN :	- -	for 22 landlords ,	landlords	- -23 ( Audience	participation . )24 MR . WALTER	GAMBIN :	- -	who	appear	to 25 me	to be	unwilling	or	unable	to	realize	fully 2 
2the	hurt they	do to	people .3How	is	it	- -4CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :You ' re	almost 5done ?6MR . WALTER	GAMBIN :Almost	done .7CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :Okay .	Good .8MR . WALTER	GAMBIN :How	is it	that 9 they	get	away	with	keeping	knowledge	of their 10 profits ,	including	those	for	rent ,	out	of the 11 arena	of	discussion	and	deliberation	when 12 rental	amounts , therefore	affordable	homes ,	are 13 such	an	important	part	of	the	well - being	and 14 peace	of	mind	and	health	of so	many	people ?15 Come	to	your	senses .16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	And	thank	you .17 MR . WALTER	GAMBIN :	Thank	you 18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .19 ( Audience	participation . )20 MR . WALTER	GAMBIN :	I	just	want	to 21 make	one	announcement	for	my own	pleasure .22 I ' m an	official	Federal	senior 23 citizen	as	of	today ,	my	birthday .

RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	Good 18 afternoon .19 My name	is	Renata	Wertheimer .20 And ,	Members	of the	Board , I	would 21 like	to	first	thank	you	for	this	opportunity	to 22 be	able	to	speak	and	hopefully	you	will	come	up 23 with	a	fair	guideline	this	year .24 My 83 - year	old	mother	has	owned	and 25 lived	in	her	six - unit	building	in	Queens	since 2 
2 1965 .	All	the	units	are	stabilized	and	rent	for 3 about	$ 800	a	month .4 I ' m here	today	to	speak	on her	and 5 my	behalf .	She ' s disabled .	She	can	no	longer 6 handle	the	building	and	I ' m trying	to	help	out .7 Like	many	other	small	property 8 owners ,	this	building	is	a	family	business .9 We ' ve never	considered	flipping	it .	I ' m not 10 over - leveraged . I ' m	just	trying	to	hang	on .11 I	need	to	make	improvements	but 12 there ' s	just	not	any	money	to do	it .13 I ' m in	this	for	the	long	haul	and	I14 really ,	really	need	the	Board	Guidelines '	help .15 Should	I	not	get	any	reasonable	rent 16 increases ,	I	will	have	to	either	mortgage	my 17 house	or	be	forced	to	sell	it .18 Even	though	you	have	the	incredible 19 task	of	coming	up with	a	one - size - fits - all 20 guideline	for	problems	that	are	hardly 21 one - size ,	last	year	you	took	a	step	in	the 22 right	direction	by	creating	some	form	of 23 limited	equity	in the	system .24 However ,	I	was	not	able	to take 25 advantage	of	any	of	these	guidelines	because 2 
2 none	of	my	leases	were	available	to	renew	at 3 that	time .	So	I personally	did	not	get	any	of 4 the	rent	increases	that	were	acknowledged	last 5 year .6 My fuel	bills	went	up 7 astronomically . My	insurance	costs	have 8 increased .	My	tax	bill	is	over	$ 8000 .	And	I9 just	can ' t	complete	any	capital	major 10 improvements	in my	building . There ' s	just	not 11 any	money	left	over .12 And	my	mother , of	course ,	lives	on	a13 fixed	income	at this	point .14 We really ,	really	need	some	kind	of 15 major	adjustment	so	that	we can	keep	our 16 building	and	keep	our	tenants .17 These	are	very	tough	times	for 18 everyone ,	but	if small	owners	are	driven	out	of 19 the	business ,	there ' s	going	to	be	a	serious 20 deterioration	in the	building	stock .	And	I	live 21 in	the	Ridgewood	community	and	most	of	the 22 buildings	are	in the	position	that	ours	is	in .23 And	the	housing	stock	in	New	York 24 City	I	think	really	needs	our	- -	you	know ,	our 25 building	should	be	maintained	and	our	tenants 2 
2 not	to	be	overloaded	with	increases	in	rent .3 However ,	we	do	need	a	fair	amount	of	income	so 4 that	we	can	maintain	our	building	and	keep	it .5 Thank	you .6 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .7 MS . ADAMS :	Question .8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	How	big	is	your 9 building ?10 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	Six 11 families .12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	And	where	is	it ?13 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	Ridgewood .14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Ridgewood ,15 Queens ?16 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	Ridgewood ,17 New	York ,	yes .18 MS . ADAMS :	Are	all	of	the	units 19 stabilized ?20 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	Yes .21 MS . ADAMS :	And	how	is	it that	no 22 leases	came	up	for	renewal	last	year ?23 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	Because	we 24 had	two - year	leases	and	I	just	had	one	lease	I25 was	able	to	renew	this	year	with	the	$ 45 .	They 2 
2 took	two - year	leases .3 MS . ADAMS :	I	see .4 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	And	it	was 5 all	in	April	of last	year .6 MS . HOLDER :	And	what	are	the	rents 7 in	your	building ?8 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	Two	of	them 9 pay	over	$ 500 ,	one	pays	$ 650 ,	and	one	pays 10 close	to	$ 700 .11 MS . ADAMS :	And	what ' s	the	size	of 12 the	units ?13 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	They ' re 14 four	rooms .15 MS . ADAMS :	Each	of	them ?16 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	It ' s	front 17 and	back .	Each	unit	is	front	and	back .	There ' s18 a	bathroom .	And , of	course , there	are	two	of 19 them	in	the	front ,	there ' s	a hallway ,	a20 bathroom ,	and	two	rooms	in	the	back .21 MS . ADAMS :	So all	of	the	other 22 leases	will	come	up	for	renewal	this	year ;	is 23 that	correct ?24 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	No ,	none	of 25 them ,	except	one .2 
2 MS . ADAMS :	Wait	a	minute .3 Last	year	- -4 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	No ,	no ,	no .5 Last	year	there	were	three	leases	that	came	up 6 last	year	for	two	years .	So they	are	going	to 7 renew	next	year .8 MS . ADAMS :	But	you	did	not	charge 9 them	the	increase	that	was	allowed ?10 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	Just	the 11 three	or	five	percent .12 MS . ADAMS :	I	beg	your	pardon ?13 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	I think	it 14 was	5 . 7	percent	for	the	two - year	lease	in 2008 .15 MS . ADAMS :	And	you	did	or did	not 16 get	that ?17 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	Yes ,	I	did .18 MS . ADAMS :	Okay .19 MS . HOLDER :	Oh !	But	you ' re	saying 20 that	the	tenants	whose	leases	are	going	to	be 21 up	in - -22 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	Next	year .23 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	This	cycle .24 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	2010 ,25 except	for	this	one	lease	that	I	have .	A tenant 2 
2 only	took	a	one - year	lease	last	year .	So I	was 3 able	to	get	$ 45 extra	from	one	tenant	who	pays 4 $ 500	and	change .5 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Whose	lease	came 6 up	in May ?7 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	Excuse	me ?8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	The	lease	came	up 9 in	May .	So	just	- -10 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	One	lease 11 came	up	in	May , yes .12 MS . HOLDER :	And	you	have	a13 mortgage	on	your	building ?14 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	No .	Thank 15 God .16 MS . HOLDER :	And	I	appreciate	your 17 testimony	as	a	lot	of	the	small	landlords	have 18 come	today .19 Why	don ' t	you	think	there	aren ' t20 some	of	the	larger	landlords ,	why	don ' t you 21 think	they	come	to	these	hearings ?22 MS . RENATA	WERTHEIMER :	I have	no 23 idea .24 Honest	to	God , in	the	1970 s I25 remember	New	York	City	having	a	big	problem 2 
2 with	deserted	housing ,	deserted	buildings .	And 3 I	wondered	why	that	was .	And	I	can	certainly 4 understand	it	now .5 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Let	me	try	to 6 posit	an	answer	to	that .7 The	big	landlords	don ' t	come	for	the 8 same	reasons	that	the	tenants	who	might	have	a9 house	in	the	Hamptons	don ' t come .10 You	know ,	let ' s face	it .	The	people 11 who	are	beneficiaries	of	the	existing	system 12 don ' t	come .	And	that ' s	nothing	new .	Somebody 13 outside	- -	I	should	subpoena	them	or	get	them 14 somehow	to	come .15 Can ' t	come .	We can	only	ask	people 16 or	invite	people	to	come .	And	there	are	many 17 beneficiaries ,	both	owner	and	tenant ,	from 18 owning	real	estate	and	living	in	real	estate	in 19 New	York	City .20 And	the	ones	who	are	benefiting 21 don ' t	come .	And	that ' s	it .22 ( Audience	participation . )23 MS . HOLDER :	Like	the	owners	invest 24 in	real	estate .25 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	What ?2 
2 MS . HOLDER :	Like	the	owners	invest 3 in	real	estate .4 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	can ' t	force 5 anybody	to	come . And	it ' s	a pretty	specious 6 argument	that	there	are	people	who	don ' t come .7 99 . 9	percent	of New	Yorkers	do	not 8 come	to	our	hearings .	That ' s it .	And	we have	to 9 face	that .10 ( Audience	participation . )11 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Let ' s	go .12 Terry	Bocanelli .13 ( Audience	participation . )14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Terry	Bocanelli .15 MR . TERRY	BOCANELLI :	My	name	is 16 Terry	Bocanelli . I	live	in	an SRO	building	with 17 348	units	at	38 West	31 st	Street	in	Manhattan .18 Most	of	the	apartments	in	my 19 building	consist	of	one	very	small	room	that 20 would	barely	be considered	a walk - in	closet	in 21 most	homes .22 Approximately	thirty	of	these 23 apartments	on	each	floor	share	a	common 24 bathroom	on	that	floor .	There	are	no	kitchen 25 facilities	in	these	apartments .	Even	the 2 
2 apartments	that	do	have	their	own	bathrooms	are 3 very	small .	They	also	do	not	have	kitchen 4 facilities .5 The	ceilings ,	walls ,	floors ,	windows 6 -	if they	have	windows	-	and	doors	in	these 7 apartments	are	generally	in a	very	poor 8 condition .	These	are	not	luxury	apartments .9 They	are	simply	there	to	provide	a	home	for	the 10 few	working	class	people	who	remain	in 11 Manhattan .12 As to	whether	these	apartments	would 13 be	considered	affordable	is debatable .	With 14 rents	ranging	from	$ 600	to	well	over	$ 1000	a15 month	for	many	of these	apartments ,	they	are 16 hardly	affordable	for	the	working	class	tenants 17 who	occupy	them . And	in	some	cases	these 18 tenants	are	being	overcharged .19 Rent	increases	will	force	these 20 people	to	leave	their	homes	and	the	City .	The 21 landlord	will	then	remove	the	apartments	from 22 rent	stabilization	under	vacancy	decontrol	or 23 he	will	warehouse	the	apartments	and	keep	them 24 vacant	so	that	he claims	to be	under 25 eighty - five	percent	occupancy	and ,	therefore ,2 
2 qualify	for	rent	increases .3 The	result	is	fewer	apartments	for 4 the	working	class .5 The	tenants	in my	building	and	the 6 City	of	New	York	cannot	afford	the	consequences 7 of	a rent	increase .8 Thank	you .9 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .10 ( Applause . )11 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Mr .	Diop .12 I	saw	him	coming .	There	you	go .13 MR . ALLOUENE	DIOP :	Good	afternoon ,14 ladies	and	gentlemen ,	and	thanks	for	this 15 opportunity .16 My name	is	Allouene	Diop .	I live	at 17 215	West	14 th	Street ,	a	building	owned	by Mr .18 Stanley	Wasserman .19 ( Audience	participation . )20 A	VOICE :	The	worst	landlord .21 MR . ALLOUENE	DIOP :	So	- - yes .22 Before	that ,	I	used	to	live	on	152 ,	a	building 23 recently	evacuated	by	the	City .	I	mean	they 24 forced	the	tenants	to	leave	- -	exit	the 25 building	because	it	was	not	stable .	It	was	no 2 
2 longer	safe .3 I	mean	the	reason	why	I	don ' t4 believe	Mr .	Wasserman	deserves	a	rent	increase 5 I	mean	is	the	following .6 First	of	all ,	his	management	doesn ' t7 care	about	the	tenants .	So	you	call	to 8 complain ,	they	either	hang	up on	the	phone	on 9 you , and	they	never	return	your	phone	call ,10 never	return	your	phone	call .11 I	personally ,	you	know ,	wrote	a12 letter	to	his	management ,	Tom	Elliott .	He never 13 returned	any	phone	call .14 So we	have	leaks	all	over	the	place .15 We	have	cracks . When	you	enter	my	room , my 16 floor ,	you	can	see	the	nails .	I	hurt	myself 17 many ,	many	times .18 So recently	- - we	don ' t	have	a19 buzzer ,	the	door .	I ' m	saying	you	can	get	mugged 20 because	it	takes	like	two	to three	minutes	to 21 open	the	front	door .22 So last	week	we had	a	problem	in	the 23 building .	The	Fire	Department	showed	up and 24 couldn ' t	get	in because	we	don ' t	have	a buzzer .25 And	we	keep	complaining .	We ,	you 2 
2 know ,	repeat	whatever	we	can ,	but	they	don ' t3 care .	So	I	personally	believe ,	and	like	people 4 ( unintelligible ) ,	none	of	these	tenants 5 deserve ,	you	know ,	a	rent	increase	because	in 6 order	to	get	a	rent	increase ,	you	should 7 provide	excellent	customer	service	and , you 8 know ,	like	treat	your	tenant	like	- -	not	like 9 kings ,	but	treat	them	with	respect	and	dignity .10 Thank	you	so	much .11 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .12 ( Audience	participation . )13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Yuncha	Kim .14 Mr . Kim	or	Ms . Kim ?15 Coming ?	There	you	go .16 ( Audience	participation . )17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .18 I ' m going	to	read	some	names .19 Hold	on	a	second ,	Ms .	Kim .

Thank	you .15 ( Audience	participation . )16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thanks	for	the 17 translation .18 Thank	you .19 Dorothy	Williamson .20 That	was	a	good	translation ,	by	the 21 way .22 MS . DOROTHY	WILLIAMSON :	Good 23 afternoon .24 My name	is	Dorothy	Williamson .25 Despite	what	my landlord	says ,	I	am 11 
2 a	permanent ,	rent	stabilized	SRO	tenant	living 3 at	307	West	79 th Street ,	the	Imperial	Court 4 Hotel .5 In March	of	this	year	I	lost	my	job 6 as	a caretaker	in the	Bronx	from	a	friend .	When 7 my	service	was	no longer	needed ,	she	asked	me 8 to	leave .	I	had	nowhere	to	go .	To	buy	time	to 9 figure	things	out ,	I	borrowed	a	friend ' s10 computer	and	searched	for	a cheap	hotel	room	in 11 the	City .12 Without	a	job , I	knew	my	fixed 13 income	from	Social	Security	wouldn ' t	take	me 14 very	far .15 I	went	to	Imperial	Court ,	which	was 16 listed	as	a	hotel	for	tourists .	I	booked	a	room 17 for	ten	days .	After	a	couple	of	days	I	started 18 to	get	nervous , asked	the	hotel	if	they	had	a19 program	that	would	help	me	stay	longer . They 20 said	no ,	but	that	they	could	extend	my	stay	for 21 $ 59 a	day .22 I	needed	help . A	friend	took	me	to 23 Gale	Brewer ' s	Office	who	then	referred	me to 24 the	West	Side	SRO	Law	Project .	I	learned	that 25 the	Imperial	Court	is	an	illegal	hotel	and 2 
2 thereby	requested	a	lease .	I had	a	right	to 3 become	a	permanent	tenant ,	permanent	rent 4 stabilized	tenant .5 The	first	time	I	submitted	the	lease 6 request ,	I	was	refused .	The	second	time	they 7 accepted .	But	the	next	day	when	I	was	outside 8 of	the	building , they	illegally	locked	me out 9 of	my room .	The	food	from	my refrig	was	thrown 10 in	a garbage	bag	with	my	balled - up	clothes 11 which	were	taken	off	of	a	hangar ,	clean 12 clothes ,	and	put	in	the	bag	with	the	clothes	in 13 the	lobby .14 The	landlord	threatened	me that	if	I15 go	head - to - head	with	him	I	would	lose	because	I16 was	ill - advised .17 But	while	- -	I called	the	police .18 After	a	long	and	scary	day , the	police	issued	a19 summons	against	the	landlord	who	at	the	time 20 that	I	was	talking	to	the	police	rented	my	home 21 to	a tourist .22 They	gave	him	a summons	for	an 23 unlawful	eviction	and	asked	him	to	give	me	a24 room .	I ' m	still	fighting	the	landlord	in 25 Housing	Court	with	the	SRO	Law	Project	to get	a2 

2	lease .3
I	also	have	a	harassment	case 
4 against	the	landlord .5 If I	wasn ' t	able	to	have	an 6 apartment ,	an	affordable	place	in	the	City ,	I7 don ' t	know	where	I	would	go . But	I	am	fighting 8 and	have	been	fighting	to	have	a	place	to live .9 Why	would	a	landlord	who	has 10 threatened	me	and	who	makes	his	money	from 11 tourists	he	rents	to	illegally	deserve	more 12 money	from	me ?13 No increase	this	year	for	me	or	any 14 other	SRO	tenant .15 ( Audience	participation . )16 MS . DOROTHY	WILLIAMSON :	I want	to 17 thank	you	for	letting	me	tell	you	my	story .18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you 19 ( Audience	participation . )20 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Diana	Seifert .21 MS . DIANA	SEIFERT :	Good	afternoon .22 I ' m Diana	Seifert	and	I	also	live	in 23 an	SRO	unit .	I	already	lost	my	rent	stabilized 24 apartment	and	now	I ' m	in	a	unit	that	is 120 25 square	feet .4 
2 My landlord	does	not	deserve	an 3 increase	for	many	reasons .4 He has	- -	we	have	- -	you	can	give 5 this	up	there	- - he	does	rent	to	tourists .	We 6 have	tourists	in the	building .7 The	building	was	renovated	or 8 converted	about	a	year	ago . There	was	some	sort 9 of	conversion	in there .	And	during	that	time	he 10 did	warehouse	some	of	the	units	and	now	he 11 rents	them	to	tourists .12 We do	have	some	market - rate	tenants 13 in	there .14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	know	if	he	is 15 subject	to	the	proviso ?16 MS . DIANA	SEIFERT :	Oh !	Here	is	- -17 last	year ' s	provisos ?	Are	not	enforceable .	He ' s18 actually	overcharging	the	six	remaining	rent 19 stabilized	tenants	in	the	building .	We ' re only 20 forty - six	percent	rent	stabilized	tenants	in 21 there	and	he	did	charge	the	increase .	That ' s22 another	issue	in there .23 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	But	he ' s not 24 entitled	to	it ?25 MS . DIANA	SEIFERT :	I ' m	sorry ?2 
 2 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	He ' s	not	entitled 3 to	it under	our	proviso .4 MS . DIANA	SEIFERT :	No ,	he ' s	not ,5 but	he ' s	getting	it .6 And	I ' m	the	only	one	- -7 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	What	do you	mean 8 he ' s getting	it ?9 MS . DIANA	SEIFERT :	He ' s	getting	it 10 from	the	other	tenants	because	they	are	afraid 11 to	challenge	him ,	from	the	other	five	- -12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	But	you ' re 13 challenging	it	at DHCR ?14 MS . DIANA	SEIFERT :	Oh ,	I am .	I	am .15 And	I ' m	winning .16 But	there ' s	many	problems	with	him .17 He	has	- -	his	apartments	are	listed	on	the 18 Internet .	His	building	was	the	one	that	was 19 collapsed	just	recently ,	a	couple	of	weeks	ago .20 It	was	a	landmark	building	and	it	collapsed 21 because	of	violations .22 I ' m the	only	one	also	that	calls	311 23 to	- -	there	you	go	- -	to	report	the	violations 24	- -25	CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	This	is not	the 
2 building	you	live	in ?3 MS . DIANA	SEIFERT :	Not	that	one ,4 but	he	owns	that	one .	That ' s Aaron	Beckman .	He 5 owns	that	among	others .6 The	building	I live	in	I	have	had 7 stop	work	orders	put	in	because	he	was	doing 8 illegal	work	in the	building .	Those	have	been 9 since	rescinded	because	he	filed	the	correct 10 permits .11 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .12 MS . DIANA	SEIFERT :	Our	intercom 13 system	was	disabled	when	the	construction	was 14 going	on .	He	only	fixed	it	when	the	new	tenants 15 finally	moved	in .	During	that	time	we	had	no 16 access	to	police	services ,	fire	or	EMT .17 I	also	have	a	very	senior	citizen 18 who	is	in	the	building .	Should	he	need	EMT ,	he 19 was	not	able	to get	it	because	we	had	no 20 intercom	system .21 If we	lose	our	keys ,	it ' s	a $ 25	fee 22 to	get	a	new	key	for	the	front	door .	But	if 23 you ' re	a	market	rate	tenant , it ' s	free	to you ,24 but	not	for	us , not	for	rent	stabilized 25 tenants .2 
2 There	are	- -	I mean	there	are	so 3 many	things .	The	building	actually	is	kept	in 4 better	condition	now	because	he	has	market	rate 5 tenants	in	there .	But	my	door	has	- -	I	have 6 duct	tape	all	around	my	door	because	it ' s	not 7 flush	with	the	frame	of	the	door .	So	you	can 8 get	roaches	and	mice .9 Not	the	new	tenants .	Their	stuff	is 10 nice .	But	we	older	tenants , the	rent	stabilized 11 tenants ,	are	second - class	citizens .12 I	pay	fifty - four	percent	of my 13 income	in	rent . I	have	nothing	left	as 14 disposable	income .	Nothing .15 Zero	percent	increase	for	SROs .16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you 17 ( Applause . )18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thomas	Diana ;19 Followed	by	Joyce	Goodman ;20 Followed	by	Dr .

THOMAS	DIANA :	To	know	where 7 you ' re	going ,	you	have	to	know	where	you	are .8 Last	year ,	the	Board	calculated	a9 $ 90 increase	for	all	apartments	on	a	base	cost 10 of	$ 1200	and	approved	a	$ 45 minimum	on 11 basically	half	the	tenants , some	of	which	are 12 paying	$ 400	a	month .13 A	$ 22	a	month	increase	is	nowhere 14 near	our	$ 90	cost	increase .15 Let ' s	shift	the	increases	away	from 16 tenants	who	are	paying	their	fair	share	to 17 those	who	are	not	paying	their	fair	share .18 Tenants	and	politicians	always	seem	to	speak	in 19 code .	They	speak	of	not	being	able	to	afford	a20 $ 400	a	month	apartment	while	they	actually	pay 21 $ 400 .	I	wish	I	had	a	$ 400	a month	apartment .22 Then	I	wouldn ' t be	here .23 The	rent	is	never	a	real	number ,24 only	half	of	a	Social	Security	number ,	half	of 25 a	disability	check .	Let	them	pay	what	they ' re 4 
2 really	paying	in the	rent	and	see	if	it matches 3 our	cost .4 Some	of	them	wasted	our	rent	money 5 sending	their	kids	to	college	and	now	their 6 kids	will	let	them	sleep	on the	street	if the 7 landlord	raises	the	rent .8 Tenants	bitterly	complain	they	are 9 paying	half	their	income	in rent	yet	there	are 10 politicians ,	our	State	legislature	wants	to 11 reduce	SCRIE	requirements	from	a	third	of your 12 income	to	a	quarter	of	your	income .	Why	do	they 13 need	to	do	that ? Simple .	Because	a	lot	of these 14 people	are	not	paying	half	of their	income	in 15 rent .16 Tenants	speak	of	phantom	tenants 17 working	two	and	three	jobs . Yet	a	lot	of the 18 speakers	seem	to be	unemployed .19 Tenants	are	supposedly	doubling	up 20 and	taking	on	boarders .	Have	any	of	them	ever 21 come	here	and	admitted	they	are	taking	rent 22 money	from	these	people ?23 Politicians	rail	against	landlords 24 on	behalf	of	single	mothers , yet	they	do 25 nothing	to	collect	child	support	from	deadbeat 2 
2 fathers .	Why ?	Simple .	Because	couples	like	the 3 welfare	check .	The	boyfriends	don ' t	want	to	get 4 a	job .5 Are	we	to	believe	that	these	women 6	- -7 ( Audience	participation . )8 MR . THOMAS	DIANA :	- -	do	not	know 9 who	fathered	their	children ?10 Have	they	ever	come	here	and 11 complained	that	this	particular	person	did	not 12 take	care	of	the	kids ?13 Most	of	our	local	politicians	seem 14 to	be spending	their	efforts	staying	out	of 15 jail	for	rape ,	assault ,	slashing	their 16 girlfriends	- -17 ( Audience	participation . )18 MR . THOMAS	DIANA :	- -	campaign 19 finance	violations .20 ( Audience	participation . )21 MR . THOMAS	DIANA :	They ' re 22 legalizing	drugs	and	embezzling	money	from 23 non - profits .24 Would	they	give	up	their	own 25 stabilized	apartment	for	a	tenant	in	need ?	We 7 
2 let	them	stay	in their	house	in	New	Jersey ,	yet 3 they	come	with	the	Board	with	the	same	recycled 4 lame	speeches .5 And	some	of	you	behave	like	little 6 girls	with	a	crush .	None	of them	are	investing 7 their	own	money	in	apartments .8 The	bottomline	is	that	below	cost 9 apartments	need	a	consistent	series	of	low - rent 10 adjustments .	Okay ?	They	should	be	getting	a	$ 50 11 annual	rent	increase .	Then	we can	take	the 12 financial	pressure	off	the	tenants	that	are 13 paying	their	fair	share	of	the	rent .14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .15 ( Audience	participation . )16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Joyce	Goodman .17 Good	to	see	you	again .18 MS . JOYCE	GOODMAN :	Hi !	Nice	to	see 19 you . I	hope	this	isn ' t	a	recycled	speech .20 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I	hope	it ' s	not 21 either .	But	it ' s okay .	If	it is ,	many	of them 22 are , you	can	be assured .23 MS . JOYCE	GOODMAN :	Good	afternoon .24 I ' m saying	my	name	is	Daniel 25 O ' Donnell ,	but	clearly	it ' s not .	I ' m	a	member 2 
2 of	the	New	York	State	Assembly ,	69 th	District ,3 representing	residents	of	Manhattan	Valley ,4 Morningside	Heights ,	the	Upper	West	Side	of 5 Manhattan	and	Southern	Harlem .6 Thank	you	for	the	opportunity	to 7 discuss	rent	adjustments	for	renewal	leases	for 8 rent - stabilized	apartments .9 The	proposed	rent	increases ,	if 10 passed ,	will	be an	economic	burden	to	thousands 11 of	families	and	individual	renters	who	reside 12 in	my district	and	throughout	the	City	at 13 large .14 In fact ,	the	New	York	City	Housing	&15 Vacancy	Survey , conducted	by the	U . S .	Census 16 Bureau	in	2008 , reveals	that	thirty - nine 17 percent	of	the	City ' s	low - income	households 18 live	in	rent	regulated	apartments ,	making	the 19 stock	of	regulated	housing	the	single	most 20 important	source	of	housing	for	low - income	New 21 York	City	residents .22 That	is	why	the	discussion	of 23 proposed	rent	increases	is	so critically 24 important .	Your	decision	regarding	rent 25 increases	affects	hundreds	of thousands	of 2 
2 lives	and	the	future	stability	and	diversity	of 3 our	neighborhoods .4 Let ' s	be	clear . We	know	what 5 affordable	housing	means .	Affordable	housing 6 encourages	residents	to	participate	in	the 7 civic	life	of	their	communities ,	helps	to build 8 stable	communities ,	forges	relationships	among 9 neighbors ,	helps	to	shape	career	paths , and 10 allows	for	family	planning	and	budgeting	for 11 life ' s	long - term	expenses ,	such	as	college	and 12 retirement .13 A	lack	of	affordable	housing	means 14 New	Yorkers	are	forced	into	shelters ;	our 15 City ' s	residents	are	too	often	choosing	between 16 buying	healthy	food	and	paying	the	utility 17 bill ,	and	are	living	in	severely	overcrowded 18 housing .19 The	lack	of	affordable	housing	also 20 means	that	too	many	New	Yorkers	have	inadequate 21 funds	saved	for	life ' s	inevitable	emergencies ,22 and	too	many	New	Yorkers	are	over - burdened	and 23 do	not	spend	adequate	time	with	their	children ,24 overseeing	after - school	activities ,	visiting 25 their	schools ,	or having	adequate	time	to read 2 
2 to	them	or	prepare	their	meals .3 With	this	much	at	stake	we must 4 recognize	that	for	the	people	in	regulated 5 apartments ,	affordable	rents	are	essential .6 Otherwise ,	the	system	offers	no	meaningful 7 protection .8 It is	disingenuous	to	claim	that 9 they	can	find	housing	elsewhere ,	when ,	in fact ,10 most	cannot	afford	the	going	rate	of	a	vacant 11 apartment	in	any	city	neighborhood .12 Of those	- -13 ( Audience	participation . )14 MS . JOYCE	GOODMAN :	- -	who	have 15 sought	assistance	from	my	office ,	many	fit	the 16 profile	of	the	working	family	whose	combined 17 household	income	over	the	years	has	not 18 increased	anywhere	near	the	rent	increases	that 19 have	been	instituted	by	the	Rent	Guidelines 20 Board .21 When	these	increases	are	coupled 22 with	the	rent	increases	imposed	by	Major 23 Capital	Improvements ,	a	great	many	find 24 themselves	over - burdened	with	rents	that	are 25 beyond	their	means .2

CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Would	you	wrap MS . JOYCE	GOODMAN :	Yes ,	yes .	I
5 have	three	more	sentences .6 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .	Good .7 MS . JOYCE	GOODMAN :	It	is an 8 acknowledged	fact	that	my	community	office 9 could	justifiably	operate	solely	as	a	Housing 10 Assistance	Unit , with	no	extra	time	or 11 resources	to	devote	to	the	myriad	of	other 12 issues	that	affect	my	constituents '	lives ,13 given	that	so	many	have	housing - related 14 problems .15 Based	on	these	facts	alone , I	am 16 adamantly	opposed	to	yet	another	rent	increase ,17 which	will	further	burden	thousands	of	New 18 Yorkers	who	are	already	struggling	to	make	ends 19 meet .20 Thank	you 21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .22 ( Applause . )23 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Question .24 Ms .

ADAMS :	Or however	he	thinks	it 16 can	be	resolved	beyond	what	this	Board	is 17 empowered	to	do .18 MS . JOYCE	GOODMAN :	Sure .19 Ending	vacancy	decontrol	would	be	a20 big	step .21 ( Applause . )22 MS .

GLORIA	WALDMAN :	I	was 23 twenty - one	in	1968	when	I	came	to	Stuyvesant 24 Town	from	the	Bronx	as	a	newlywed .	I	had	just 25 gotten	my	first	and	only	job	that	I	have	held 6 
2 for	forty	years	as	a	Professor	of	Spanish ,3 Women	Studies	and	Latin - American	Studies	at 4 York	College	of the	City	University	of	New	York 5 in	Queens .6 So I	guess	I	have	lived	in 7 Stuyvesant	Town	all	of	my	adult	life ,	seeing 8 neighbors	come	and	go ,	shared	joys ,	losses ,	my 9 divorce ,	the	death	of	my	husband ,	death	of 10 parents ,	a	life .11 I	have	always	considered	myself	very 12 lucky	to	have	had	an	affordable	apartment	in 13 New	York	City .14 Today ,	however , I ' m	not	just 15 speaking	as	a	former	Bronxite	and	very 16 fortunate	Manhattanite ,	but	rather	on	behalf	of 17 a	statewide	organization .	I ' m	part	of	the	New 18 York	State	Tenants	and	Neighbors	Coalition	that 19 wants	residents	in	other	boroughs	to	have 20 affordable	housing	also .21 I	can	tell	you	personally	that 22 friends	of	mine	in	their	seventies	have	moved 23 from	Manhattan	after	thirty	years	on	East	33 rd 24 Street ,	a	rent	stabilized	apartment ,	to Queens 25 because	they	can	no	longer	afford	their 2 
2 Manhattan	rent .3 I	was	asked	this	morning	by 4 Univision ,	Channel	47 ,	if	I feel	impotent	about 5 what	is	happening	today	right	here	before	the 6 Rent	Guidelines	Board .	Si ,	mi siento	impotente .7 And	I	said	a	life	of	activism	leads	me	to 8 believe	that	I	am not	impotent ,	that	we are	not 9 impotent .10 This	is	my	first	time	in	front	- -11 testifying	here . I ' m	retired	now	so	I	have	time 12 to	do this .	So	watch	out .	I ' m	going	to	be here 13 all	the	time .14 ( Audience	participation . )15 DR . GLORIA	WALDMAN :	But , really ,	I16 implore	you	- -	really ,	I ' m	looking	at	you ,	I17 know	who	you	are ,	I	studied	the	situation .	I18 know	the	politics .	I ' m	just	looking	at	you ,19 regular	people , maybe	second	houses ,	whatever ,20 whatever .	I ' m	imploring	you	to	do	the	right 21 thing ,	the	right	thing ,	for	the	working	class 22 and	the	middle	class	of	New	York	City ,	for	all 23 of	us who	call	New	York	our	home .24 I ' m asking	for	a	zero	percent 25 increase .2

I ' m	asking	for	no 5 minimum	increase .6 And	at	the	very	least ,	because	I7 know	about	real	politique ,	I ' m	asking	for	the 8 very	worst ,	the	lowest	possible	increase .	I ' m9 asking	you	to	do the	right	thing .10 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you 11 ( Audience	participation . )12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Assemblymember 13 Rosie	Mendez .14 COUNCILWOMAN	MENDEZ :	I ' m in	the 15 City	Council ,	not	in	the	New	York	State 16 Legislature .17 So , good	afternoon ,	Board	Members .18 I	am	Rosie	Mendez	and	I	actually 19 represent	the	District	where	we ' re	located	in 20 right	now ,	representing	parts	of	the	Lower	East 21 Side ,	the	East	Village ,	Gramercy	Park ,	Kips	Bay 22 and	Murray	Hill , known	as	the	2 nd	District	here 23 in	Manhattan .24 Thank	you	for	this	opportunity	to 25 testify	at	this	very	important	hearing .2 
2 I ' d like	to	add	that	I ' ve	only	been 3 in	office	three - and - a - half	years .	I ' ve	been 4 coming	here	for	twenty - three	years	on	and	off 5 to	give	testimony	in	front	of this	Board 6 because	this	is an	important	issue	to	me .7 Within	the	communities	that	I8 represent ,	there	are	thousands	of	rent 9 stabilized	housing	units	which	are	constantly 10 at	risk	of	being	lost .	At	this	critical	time	it 11 is	important	that	the	Board	take	steps	to 12 ensure	that	these	units	are	preserved	for	New 13 York ' s	low	and	middle - income	communities .14 I	strongly	urge	the	Rent	Guidelines 15 Board	to	implement	a	rent	freeze	in	order	to 16 preserve	- -17 ( Audience	participation . )18 COUNCILWOMAN	MENDEZ :	- -	those 19 precious	units	of affordable	housing .20 Over	the	past	years	my	community	has 21 experienced	a	tremendous	real	estate	boom .22 Rents	in	District	# 2	are	among	the	highest	in 23 the	City	of	New	York .	The	community	is	still 24 considered	one	of the	most	desirable	for	young 25 people	seeking	housing	near	the	many 2 
2 institutions	of higher	learning	or	for	jobs	in 3 midtown	and	Lower	Manhattan .4 It is	utterly	amazing	that	in	this 5 community ,	especially	south	of	14 th	Street	and 6 east	of	First	Avenue ,	which	was	not	that	long 7 ago	considered	dangerous	and	with	second - rate 8 housing	stock ,	rents	now	exceed	$ 2500	for	a9 one - bedroom .10 Buildings	once	considered	a11 substandard	tenement	are	now	promoted	as luxury 12 walkups ,	often	with	nothing	more	than	a13 cosmetic	touchup .14 All	of	this	is happening	while	many 15 have	testified	before	you	arguing	that	rent 16 regulations	are	stifling	the	market	and 17 unnaturally	curbing	legitimate	return	on real 18 estate	investment .19 When	I	first	moved	to	11 th Street 20 and	Avenue	B	approximately	eighteen	years	ago ,21 the	majority	of my	neighbors	in	privately - owned 22 tenement	buildings	on	the	block	were	lower 23 income	and	working	class ,	largely	Latino 24 residents ,	who	had	lived	in the	same	building 25 for	many	years	and	theoretically	protected	by 2 
2 rent	regulations .	Rents	are	high	but	reasonably 3 affordable	for	these	families .4 Now ,	the	vast	majority	of	my 5 low - income	neighbors	reside	in	public	housing 6 and	other	subsidized	buildings	which	have	been 7 built	through	the	sweat	and	tears	of	community 8 residents	and	organizations .9 Working	class	residents	are	being 10 pushed	out	completely	since	there	is	little 11 moderate	income	housing	available .12 My time	is	winding	down	so I ' m	going 13 to	say	that	not	a	day	goes	by in	my	office 14 where	I	am	not	contacted	by a	resident	that	is 15 on	the	verge	of being	evicted ,	oftentimes	being 16 harassed ,	oftentimes	through	measures	where	the 17 owner	is	evicting	the	entire	building	because 18 they	need	9 , 000	square	feet	for	themselves ,19 often	using	other	things	like	phony	demolitions 20 and	other	measures	to	empty	out	the	buildings 21 and	try	and	get	more	rents .22 I	love	my	community .	My	neighbors 23 should	continue	to	have	an	opportunity	to live 24 here .25 The	current	fiscal	crisis	makes	it 2 
2 very	difficult	on anyone ,	on everyone .3 So I	believe	that	a	rent	freeze	now 4 would	provide	the	relief	that	thousands	of 5 families	across	New	York	City	really	need .6 I	just	want	to say	one	more	thing .7 Approximately	a year	ago ,	Mayor 8 Bloomberg	passed	an	Executive	Order	demanding 9 translation	services	in	the	six	most	frequently 10 spoken	languages	here	in	the	City ,	languages 11 and	dialects .12 I	understand	that	someone	was	here 13 today	to	testify	and	there	was	no	translator .14 ( Audience	participation . )15 COUNCILWOMAN	MENDEZ :	I ' m abhorred 16 by	that .17 This	is	a	public	hearing	and	in	the 18 most	diverse	city	in	this	country .	And	the 19 Mayor	acknowledged	this	a	year	ago .	We	should 20 have	translators ,	at	least	in those	six	most 21 frequent	language	dialects	that	the	Mayor 22 decided	we	needed	to .23 Thank	you	very	much .24 ( Applause . )25 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	We	do	have	- -	I ' m2

And	many 21 of	these	individuals	can	no longer	afford	to 22 live	in	the	apartment	once	these	increases	come 23 in , and	can	no	longer	then	afford	to	live	in	my 24 district	and	sometimes	in	the	City .25 MS .

She ' s	here .15 COUNCILWOMAN	MELISSA	MARK - VIVERITO :16 That ' s	okay .17 You	know ,	I	want	to	just	echo	a	lot 18 of	the	sentiment	that	was	expressed	by	the 19 Assemblyman ' s	representative	who	I	work	closely 20 with ,	as	well	as Rosie .21 I	represent	District	# 8	which	is 22 East	Harlem ,	El Barrio ,	which	is	Motthaven	in 23 the	Bronx ,	which	is	Manhattan	Valley	on the 24 west	side .	And	within	that	community	there	are 25 thousands	of	affordable	housing	units ,	not	only 2 
2 rent	regulated , but	we ' re	talking	about 3 project - based	Section	8 ,	Section	8 ,4 Mitchell - Lama ,	public	housing ,	all	of	which	are 5 critical	affordable	housing	stock	in	the	City 6 of	New	York .7 I ' m a	proud	sponsor	with	my 8 colleague	Dan	Andrejcuk ,	who	I	know	was	here 9 earlier ,	of	the	Tenant	Protection	Act 10 legislation	which	allows	tenants	to	now	sue 11 landlords	for	harassment	in the	case	which	we 12 see	very	frequently .13 Similar	to	the	Assemblymember ,14 ninety	percent	of my	constituent	cases	are 15 housing	related , easily	ninety	percent	are 16 housing	related , people	that	are	being	evicted ,17 people	that	are	being	harassed .	It	is	an 18 ongoing	issue .19 So affordable	housing	is	very ,	very 20 much	something	that	is	a	very	important	matter 21 for	me	and	my	constituencies .22 So like	many	New	Yorkers ,	I ' m	also 23 deeply	troubled	by	the	decrease	in	the	stock	of 24 affordable	housing	for	low	and	middle - income 25 residents	of	our	City .	And	over	the	past	few 2 
2 years	the	City	has	seen	market	rents	skyrocket ,3 particularly	in Manhattan .4 Rent	stabilized	apartments	are	one 5 of	the	few	affordable	housing	options	available 6 to	low	and	middle - income	New	Yorkers .7 The	rent	increases	on	these 8 apartments	proposed	by	the	RGB	will	be 9 devastating	to	many	New	York	City	families ,10 particularly	in the	midst	of this	economic 11 crisis .12 Therefore ,	I ' m urging	members	of	the 13 Rent	Guidelines	Board	to	support	a	rent	freeze 14 for	this	year .15 ( Audience	participation . )16 COUNCILWOMAN	MELISSA	MARK - VIVERITO :17 Granted ,	this	would	be	the	first	such	- -18 granted	this	would	be	the	first	such	vote	by 19 the	RGB ,	but	the	current	reality	calls	for	just 20 such	a	vote .21 In recent	years ,	the	Rent	Guidelines 22 Board	has	consistently	voted	in	favor	of rent 23 increases	for	stabilized	apartments .	Just	last 24 year ,	the	Board	approved	a	4 . 5	percent	increase 25 on	one - year	leases	and	a	8 . 5 percent	increase 2 
2 on	two - year	leases .3 While	operating	expenses	do 4 typically	rise	each	year ,	tenants	have	far	too 5 often	shouldered	the	burden	of	those	increased 6 expenses .7 Furthermore ,	tenants	often	report 8 that ,	even	as	they	are	paying	higher	rent	each 9 month ,	the	conditions	of	their	buildings	are 10 actually	worsening .11 Most	recently , the	RGB ' s	2009	Income 12 and	Expense	Report	released	last	month ,13 revenues	have	outpaced	expenses	to	the	extent 14 that	average	monthly	net	operating	income	was 15 worth	17 . 2	percent	more	in	2007	than	it was	in 16 1990 ,	after	adjusting	for	inflation .17 This	report	gives	strength	to	the 18 argument	that	rent	increases	should	be	frozen .19 This	year ' s	proposal	to	increase 20 rent	by	an	additional	2	to	4 . 5	percent	on 21 one - year	leases	and	4	to	7 . 5 on	two - years	will 22 greatly	harm	our	City ' s	working	families	and 23 seniors	who	depend	on	these	affordable	units 24 and	are	already	facing	greater	economic 25 insecurity	than	ever .2 
2 For	some	of	the	tenants	this 3 increase	could	mean	eviction .4 Furthermore ,	according	to	the	New 5 York	City	Rent	Guidelines	Board ' s	June	2009 6 study ,	there	was	an	estimated	net	loss	of more 7 than	8 , 000	rent	stabilized	units	in	the	City	in 8	2008	alone .9	As we	lose	more	of	these	affordable 10 units ,	we	need	to assure	that	those	stabilized 11 apartments	that	do	remain	continue	to	be within 12 the	reach	of	low	and	middle - income	New	Yorkers .13 And	I ' m	almost	done .14 This	is	an	issue	that	I	care	deeply 15 about	and	that	my constituents	care	deeply 16 about .	It	is	a	shame	that	year	after	year ,17 despite	the	valid	arguments	and	the	mass 18 mobilizations	that	this	issue	elicits ,	the	RGB 19 has	consistently	stood	up	for	the	interests	of 20 the	landlord	lobby	at	the	expense	of	the 21 working	class	of this	City .22 Additionally ,	the	mockery	of	our 23 democratic	process	that	is	taking	place	in 24 Albany ,	unfortunately ,	has	led	us	to	a	point	of 25 gridlock	on	several	key	issues	affordable 10 
2 housing	activists	have	labored	over	for 3 decades ,	further	deepening	the	cynicism	many	of 4 our	constituents	have	of	government .5 The	landlord	lobby	has	its	prints 6 all	over	this	mess ,	but	it	is my	belief	that 7 ultimately	justice	on	behalf	of	the	low	and 8 moderate	income	tenants	of	this	City	will 9 prevail	and	we	will	see	progress	on	this	front .10 I	call	on	the	Rent	Guidelines	Board 11 Members	to	seriously	consider	the	needs	of	the 12 tenants	residing	in	rent	stabilized	apartments 13 and	to	institute	a	rent	freeze	for	this	year .14 ( Audience	participation . )15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Any	questions ?16 MS . CRUZ :	One	question .17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Question	from	Ms .18 Cruz .19 MS . CRUZ :	Councilwoman ,	do property 20 owners	in	your	district	make	any	positive 21 contribution	to your	community ?22 COUNCILWOMAN	MELISSA	MARK - VIVERITO :23 Of	course .	Everybody	does	make	positive 24 contributions .25 MS . CRUZ :	Could	you	describe	some 2 

2	of	them .3
COUNCILWOMAN	MELISSA	MARK - VIVERITO :
4 What	are	- -	I	mean	- -	as	every	individual	in 5 the	City ,	they	are	taxpayers ,	as	every 6 individual .	Every	individual	in	the	City	is	a7 taxpayer	so	they	make	contributions	to	the 8 City ,	renters	and	owners	alike .9 You	know ,	I ' m	a homeowner	myself .10 You	know ,	but	that	doesn ' t	mean	that	my needs 11 outweigh ,	just	because	I ' m	a homeowner ,12 outweigh	the	needs	of	renters	in	the	City .13 ( Audience	participation . )14 COUNCILWOMAN	MELISSA	MARK - VIVERITO :15 You	know ,	so	there	are	very	real ,	real	facts 16 which	I	cited	which	is	that	the	profit	margins 17 have	actually	increased ,	that	we	are	in an 18 incredible	economic	crisis , that	people	need 19 the	ability	to	stay	in	their	homes ,	and 20 whatever	money	they	were	going	to	apply	to	rent 21 increases ,	let	them	provide	for	their	families .22 Let	them	buy	groceries	in	the	local 23 supermarket ,	support	our	local	economies .	Let 24 that	money	go	towards	being	able	to	contribute 25 in	that	way	to	the	economy	as opposed	to giving 4 
2 it	to increase	the	profit	margins	of	the 3 landlords .4 So I	mean	that ' s ,	in	essence ,	- -5 ( Audience	participation . )6 COUNCILWOMAN	MELISSA	MARK - VIVERITO :7 - -	what	the	times	call	for .8 MS . ADAMS :	I	have	a	question .9 We ' ve	heard	a	lot	from	smaller 10 landlords	and	the	hardship	that	they	have	in 11 making	adjustments	and	making	improvements	and 12 that	sort	of	thing .13 The	other	side	of	that	is	if	you ' re 14 having	problems , why	don ' t	you	apply	for 15 hardship .16 And	there	we ' re told	that	because 17 it ' s such	a	long	process ,	people	don ' t .18 Can	you	share	anything	with	us	that 19 would	help	us	in understanding	that	better ?20 COUNCILWOMAN	MELISSA	MARK - VIVERITO :21 I	mean	I ' m	more	than	glad	to ,	you	know , be	able 22 to	pull	together	a	report	with	my	constituent 23 services	staff	with	regards	to	what	it	is that 24 we	are	facing .25 As I	mentioned , clearly	eighty - five 2 
2 to	ninety	percent	of	our	constituent	matters 3 are	housing	related	very	specifically .4 So I	don ' t	obviously	deal	day - to - day 5 with	the	minutiae	of	the	cases ,	but	I ' m sure	my 6 staff	would	welcome	the	opportunity	to 7 contribute	something	to	you	as	the	RGB	with 8 regards	to	their	experiences	and	what	they	are 9 seeing	on	the	ground .10 MS . ADAMS :	Whatever	they	can	pull 11 together	on	the	experiences	of	people	around 12 hardship	would	be very	helpful .13 Thank	you .14 COUNCILWOMAN	MELISSA	MARK - VIVERITO :15 No	problem .16 Thank	you .17 ( Applause . )18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Manhattan	Borough 19 President	Scott	Stringer .20 ( Applause . )21 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :22 Thank	you	very	much .23 One	of	the	primary	rationales	used 24 last	year	for	the	largest	rent	increase	since 25 1989	was	the	skyrocketing	cost	of	energy .2 
 2 I ' m here	to	report	to	you	what 3 happened	since	that	increase .4 Fuel	costs	for	building	owners	have 5 decreased	by	ten	percent .	The	price	of	oil	fell 6 to	1 / 3 rd	of	what	it	was	during	the	summer .	The 7 energy	market	bottomed	out	during	the	winter ,8 which	is	the	time	period	when	buildings 9 experience	their	highest	rate	of	energy 10 consumption .	This	was	a	boom	for	owners .11 Now ,	the	Rent	Guidelines	Board	can ' t12 be	expected	to	anticipate	major	shifts	in 13 energy	markets	that	are	beyond	its	control ,	but 14 what	is	expected	is	you ' re	supposed	to	correct 15 the	mistakes	that	you	made	at first 16 opportunity .17 ( Applause . )18 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :	So 19 last	year	you	made	a	mistake	when	you	predicted 20	- -21 ( Audience	participation . )22 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :	- -23 when	you	predicted	historic	rent	increases	on 24 faulty	assumptions .25 This	year	you	must	hold	yourselves 21 
2 accountable	for	the	mistakes	with	a	rent 3 freeze .	This	is not	simply	playing	to	the 4 crowd .	This	is	not	about	making	a	wild 5 assumption .6 Based	on	data	that	you	used	last 7 year ,	we	ended	up overcharging	tenants . This 8 year	you	can	make	it	up	to	them	and	level	the 9 playing	field	especially	in these	very 10 difficult	times	by	simply	freezing	the	rent ,11 letting	people	- -12 ( Audience	participation . )13 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :	- -14 letting	people	have	a	little	extra	so	they	can 15 stay	in	their	homes .16 Second	issue .17 This	proposed	poor	tax	is	getting 18 out	of	hand .	I	don ' t	know	if all	of	you	read 19 the	papers	everyday	or	live	the	lives	of the 20 people	behind	me do ,	but	the	poor	tax	now	truly 21 means	eviction	or staying	in homes .22 And	if	we	are	going	to	get	out	of 23 this	recession	or what	some	have	likened	a24 depression ,	it ' s going	to	take	some	real	smart 25 thinking .	It ' s	going	to	take	some	real	good 2 

2	analysis .3
And	I	ask	you	not	to	make	the	same 
4 mistake	you	made	last	year	because	clearly	your 5 matrix	for	determining	rent	increases	is really 6 not	working .	That ' s	what	I	want	to	say	to you 7 today .8 So I	urge	you	to	do	a	freeze	and	I9 urge	you	to	reevaluate	how	you	determined	the 10 record	rate	of	increase	last	year	based	on 11 totally	false	assumptions .12 Thank	you	very	much .13 ( Audience	participation . )14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	have	a15 question .16 Ms . Levine .17 MS . LEVINE :	Hi ,	Scott !18 In the	interest	of	full	disclosure ,19 Scott	is	a	friend	of	mine .	I supported	his 20 efforts	in	the	past	but	not	since	I ' m	a member 21 of	the	Rent	Guidelines	Board .22 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :	We 23 are	friends .	I	am not	afraid	to	say	it .24 MS . LEVINE :	We are	friends .25 Scott ,	we	are	asked	to	act	like	King 4 
2 Solomon	and	yet	whether	we	have	the	wisdom	is 3 really	irrelevant .	We	don ' t have	the	power .4 ( Audience	participation . )5 MS . LEVINE :	We have	had	some 6 testimony	today	that	I	would	like	to	ask	you 7 about .	I ' m	going	to	quote	two	specific	- -8 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :9 Sure .10 MS . LEVINE :	- - people .	Their 11 testimony	is	emblematic	of	a lot	of	what	we 12 heard	today .13 The	first	was	a landlord	who	talked 14 about	thirty - five	percent	of their	costs	each 15 year	is	- -	landlord	costs	- - is	taxes	and	other 16 expenses	to	the	City	of	New	York .	It	is the 17 fastest	growing	category	of landlord	expenses 18 with	a	twelve	percent	increase	over	last	year .19 We can ' t	control	those	costs	that 20 they	have	to	pay	to	the	City	but	we	have	to 21 consider	them .	It might	be	something	that	you 22 and	the	City	Council	might	be able	to	take	to 23 address .24 And ,	secondly , we	were	asked	by	a25 tenant	for	a	hardship	provision	for	tenants	in 2 
2 this	economic	situation .	They	are	looking	for 3 landlords	basically	to	extend	unemployment 4 guarantee ,	you	know ,	unemployment	insurance	to 5 tenants .6 And	we ,	again , it ' s	not	something 7 that	we	think	- - that	we	can	even	think	that 8 individual	landlords	should	have	to	guarantee 9 individual	tenants	in	this	situation .10 So I ' m	looking	to	you ,	I ' m looking 11 to	our	elected	officials	to talk	to	us	and 12 explain	how	you	can	increase	landlord	costs	in 13 this	environment	at	the	same	time	and	whether 14 there	is	anything	that ' s	going	to	be	done	for 15 individual	tenants	who	are	losing	their	jobs 16 that	are	more	- -17 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :18 Well ,	first	of	all ,	nobody	really	is	suggesting 19 that	landlords , especially	small	landlords	give 20 money	to	tenants	to	stay	in their	apartment .21 That	is	rhetoric	that	would	not	make	sense	and 22 I	don ' t	subscribe	to	that .23 What	we ' re	trying	to	do ,	though ,	is 24 - -	let ' s	just	cut	to	the	chase .	Let ' s	just	put 25 all	the	rhetoric	aside	and	deal	with	what 2 
2 you ' re	charged	with	dealing	with ,	is	data .3 So you	have	to determine	rising 4 taxes	and	rising	fees	based	on	one	factor	for	a5 rent	increase ,	and	then	you	have	to	consider 6 why	you	gave	the	largest	rent	increase	you	did 7 in	about	twenty	years .	You	know	why	you	did	it ?8 Because	you	said	to	the	tenants ,	based	on your 9 analysis ,	we	are	going	to	have	a	spike	in 10 energy	costs .	We ' re	going	to have	a	spike	in 11 oil	costs .12 Now ,	okay ,	you	made	that	assumption .13 Some	people	disagreed	with	you .14 MS . LEVINE :	At the	time	we did	have 15 increases	of	eighteen	percent .16 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :17 Okay .	But	now	- - but	now	- - but	now	- -	that ' s18 right .	At	the	time	you	- -	I ' m	not	questioning 19 your	motivation .20 What	I	am	saying	that	now	that	you 21 know	a	different	set	of	facts ,	if	you	want	to 22 be	intellectually	honest	and	fair ,	you	would 23 then	say ,	okay , you	got	the	highest	rate	last 24 year	under	faulty	assumptions .25 ( Audience	participation . )2 
2 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :3 Now	- -	now	- -	now ,	the	reality	is ,	now	the 4 reality	is	fuel	costs	are	down ,	energy	costs 5 are	down .	There	shouldn ' t	be a	rate	increase 6 this	year .7 MS . LEVINE :	Excuse	me .8 ( Audience	participation . )9 MS . ADAMS :	One	of	the	things	that 10 we	are	being	told ,	however	- -	one	of	the	things 11 that	we	are	being	told	is	that	the	City	has 12 increased	charges	to	landlords ,	like	property 13 tax	and	all	of	that .14 MS . LEVINE :	Water	and	sewer .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Let ' s	talk	about 16 the	facts	here . Let ' s	talk	about	our	Price 17 Index	of	Operating	Costs .18 Let	me	- -	I ' ve been	quoted	many 19 times	with	the	following	quote	and	I ' ll make	it 20 again .	Most	times	when	we	predict	things	we ' re 21 going	to	be	wrong .22 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :23 That ' s	true .24 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	And	generally 25 when	we ' re	right ,	we ' re	right	for	the	wrong 2 
2 reasons .	So	let	me	take	you	through	what 3 happened .4 Fuel ,	as	you	correctly	point	out ,5 went	down .	However ,	we	did	not	anticipate	and 6 nobody	anticipated	a	mid - year	property	tax 7 increase ,	beginning	last	January ,	during	the 8 year	of	seven	percent	or	7 . 5 percent .9 In fact ,	if	you	look	at	the	Price 10 Index	of	Operating	Costs ,	it - -	property	taxes 11 represents	25	percent	of	our	weighted	index ,12 whereas	fuel	costs ,	which	were	projected	to	go 13 up , represent	only	15	percent .14 So while	we	were	wrong ,	you	choose 15 to	find	the	selected	facts	where	we	were	wrong 16 without	looking	at	the	facts	- -17 ( Audience	participation . )18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	where	we	were 19 wrong	on	the	other	side .20 And	that	was	something ,	as Lisa 21 said ,	was	in	the	control	of the	City	Council 22 not	to	do .23 You ' re	not	a	City	Council	member ,	I24 understand	that .25 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :2 
2 But	let	me	- -3 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Let ' s	understand 4 that	this	is	a	balance	that	we	are	trying	to 5 strike .6 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :7 Okay .	But	- -8 ( Audience	participation . )9 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :	I10 hear	what	you	are	saying .	And	if	you	want	to 11 strike	a	balance ,	what	you	should	have	struck 12 is	those	property	tax	rebates ,	as	the	Mayor	has 13 said ,	have	to	be reauthorized	every	year .14 Right ?	They ' re	not	automatic .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	We ' re	not	talking 16 the	rebates .	We ' re	talking	about	property	tax 17 increases .18 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :19 Right .	But	that	always	is	part	of	your	factor ,20 is	increased	costs .21 The	fact	is	that	what	you	cited	last 22 year	- -	you	can ' t	have	it	both	ways .23 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	We	cite	- -24 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :25 You	cited	energy .2 
 2 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	We	cited	- -3 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :4 And	you	cited	all	of	them .	And	you	know 5 something ?	If	you	can ' t	freeze	a	rent	and	give 6 tenants	a	break	this	year ,	then	you	know 7 something ?	You	guys	really	should	be	abolished 8 because	- -9 ( Audience	participation . )10 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :	- -11 you	are	never	going	to	see	it .12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I	think	- -	well 13	- -14 ( Audience	participation . )15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	If	you	were	to 16 read	our	explanatory	statements ,	we	cited	a17 whole	host	of	factors	and	a whole	host	of 18 testimony	on	many ,	many	issues .	We	did	not 19 merely	cite	the	fuel	thing . You ' re	taking	one 20 cite	out	of	context	- -	not	out	of	context ,	out 21 of	the	whole	thing	saying	that ' s	why	we 22 provided	the	rent	increase	last	year .	It ' s	not 23 accurate .	It	was	part	of	our	analysis ,	to be 24 sure .	We ' re	not	going	to	say	no .	But	everything 25 else	was	too .14

MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :	So CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	And	to	just	take 
5 just	one	fact	and	say	we	were	wrong	here	and ,6 therefore ,	provide	redress , without	the	other 7 facts	where	we	were	right ,	which	balance	out 8 that	wrong ,	is	wrong	on	your	part .9 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :10 You	know	what ?	I feel	like	I ' m	talking	to the 11 - -	first	of	all , can	I	just	make	- -12 ( Audience	participation . )13 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .

Shut	up ,	man .20 ( Audience	participation . )21 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :	So 22 are	you .23 So just	going	through	your	logic ,24 what	I	guess	I	want	to	say	to you	is	part	of 25 what	should	happen	tonight	is you	should	go 5 
2 back	and	analyze	fuel	costs , analyze	energy 3 costs .4 You ' re	already	defending	an increase 5 without	listening	to	our	testimony .	So	at the 6 end	of	the	night	you	should	then	turn	around 7 and	give	us	your	analysis .8 But	you ' re	basically	already	skewing 9	- -10 ( Audience	participation . )11 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .

2 correctly ,	the	commensurate	rent	increases	were 3 fifty	to	eighty	percent	higher	based	on the 4 fuel	and	other	factors	that	was	ultimately 5 passed .6 So there	seems	to	be	some 7 self - correcting	mechanism	here	with	the	Board .8 MS . CRUZ :	Mr . Chair ,	I ' d	also	like 9 to	make	a	comment	and	ask	a question	of Mr .10 Stringer .11 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Of	course .12 MS . CRUZ :	Just	following	up	on	what 13 our	Chairman	has	emphasized	to	you ,	that	you 14 are	concentrating	on	one	factor ,	the	fuel	cost .15 But	I	want	to	bring	to	your 16 attention	that	this	year	while	fuel	costs	have 17 gone	down	by ,	according	to	our	report	and	the 18 PIOC	report ,	10 . 1	percent ,	at the	same	time 19 there	are	three	other	major	expenses	that	have 20 gone	up ,	as	the	Chairman	pointed	out	and	as	Ms .21 Levine	also	said .22 Real	estate	taxes	have	risen	11 . 723 percent .24 ( Audience	participation . )25 MS . CRUZ :	That	certainly	offsets 2 
2 the	decrease	in fuel .3 But ,	in	addition	to	real	estate 4 taxes ,	labor	costs	have	increased	by	almost	35 percent	and	the	utilities	component	of	the	cost 6 of	running	a	rental	business ,	which	is	water ,7 sewer ,	electricity ,	those	- -8 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :9You	don ' t	have	to pile	on .10MS . CRUZ :	- -	have	gone	up .11Mr . Stringer ,	by	almost	11 percent .12MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :I13get	it .	But	here ' s	what	happened .14MS . CRUZ :	So	how	- -	you	say	to	us 15about	being	intellectually	honest ,	- -16MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :17Yes .18MS . CRUZ :	- -	how	do	you	justify 19berating	us	- -20MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :21Okay .22MS . CRUZ :	- -	for	passing	a23guideline	based	on	information	that	was	- -24MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :25I ' ll tell	you	- -

23	reports .4
MS . CRUZ :	- -	that	was	based	on	our MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :
5 I ' ll tell	you	why .6 MS . CRUZ :	And	then	this	year ,	yes ,7 there	has	been	a decrease	- -8 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER : 9	I ' ll - -10 MS . CRUZ :	- -	but	you	don ' t mention 11 those	other	factors .12 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :13 Because	- -	I ' m	going	to	answer	you	and	that ' s	a14 very	fair	question .	And	I	don ' t	mean	to berate 15 but	we	are	having	a	frank	discussion .16 You	got	- -	the	landlords ,	because	of 17 the	faulty	assumptions	last	year ,	got	a free 18 ride	based	on	the	historic	rent	increase .19 ( Audience	participation . )20 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :21 Now	you	come	here	a	year	later	and	you	say ,22 fuel	costs	are	down ,	this	is up ,	it ' s	about 23 even .	But	we	need	a	rebate	for	the	faulty 24 assumption	of	last	year .	And	you	don ' t	seem	to 25 want	to	address	that .10 
2 ( Audience	participation . )3 MS . CRUZ :	Mr . Stringer ,	you	have 4 not	answered	my question .5 MR . SCHLEIDER :	A	rebate	- -6 MS . CRUZ :	How	can	you	say	property 7 owners	- -8 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :9 Because	I ' m	still	- -10 MS . CRUZ :	- -	have	to	give	up	rent 11 monies	- -12 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :13 Because	I ' m	- -14 MS . CRUZ :	Mr . Stringer ,	let	me 15 finish	my	question .16 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :17 Actually	you	need	to	rebate	' 08	before	I talk 18 to	you	about	' 09 .19 ( Audience	participation . )20 MR . SCHLEIDER :	The	rebate	in	' 08 21 was	already	granted	because	the	commensurate 22 rent	increase	would	have	been	significantly 23 higher	if	we	had	gone	strictly	by	the 24 assumptions	in	the	PIOC .	And	it	was	about	half .25 So you	already	have	your	rebate .2 
2 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :	By 3 the	way ,	let ' s	all	- -	let ' s also	understand 4 that	you	traditionally	don ' t only	go	based	on 5 the	charts	and	that	we	could	also	argue	in 6 prior	years	there ' s	a	number	of	other	factors 7 that	are	taken	into	consideration .8 MR . SCHLEIDER :	We	always	argue	on 9 the	facts .10 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :11 What	I	think	people	- -	and	what	we	think	people 12 are	saying	to	you	today	is	that	you	also 13 represent	not	just	landlords	and	not	just 14 tenants ,	but	you	also	have	a responsibility	to 15 the	City	as	a	whole .16 And	part	of	what	you ' re	going	to 17 hear	tonight	from	people	- - I ' m	not	going	to 18 say	this	in	my	remarks ,	but	you	also	understand 19 that	there ' s	a	lot	of	people	who	are	out	there 20 who	are	barely	hanging	on	by a	thread ,	that	one 21 rent	increase	can	push	you	over	and	out .22 And	I ' m	not	sure	that	landlords 23 necessarily	want	to	push	people	out	given	the 24 fragile	economy . That ' s	obviously	not	my 25 decision .	That ' s what	others	have	to	make .2 
2 But	I	would	be very	careful	not 3 pushing	people	to the	point	where	we	do create 4 a	whole	set	of	evictions	and	that	we	can ' t	get 5 our	arms	around	it	and	that	you	can ' t	replenish 6 those	tenants	in many	neighborhoods	because	of 7 the	economy	that	we	are	facing	this	year .8 I	ask	you	to	respectfully	think 9 about	the	people	who	are	barely	on	the	edge	and 10 the	small	landlord	who	also	may	want	to keep 11 those	tenants	this	year ,	you	know .	It	may	be	- -12 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr .	Stringer ,	- -13 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Mr .	Chair ?14 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Just	one	quick 15 question .16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Yes .17 MR . SCHLEIDER :	The	City	passed	-18 what ?	-	a	$ 60	billion	budget .	If	we	had	taken 19 about	one - tenth	of	one	percent	of	that	money 20 and	applied	that	towards	the	tenants	that	are 21 most	at	risk ,	it probably	would	have	alleviated 22 all	if	not	most	of	this	scenario ,	this	dire 23 scenario	that	you ' re	talking	about .24 Why	wasn ' t	that	brought	up in	the 25 budget	discussions ?2 
2 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :	I3 think	- -	I	think	that	- -	I	certainly	know	where 4 you ' re	coming	from	and	I	agree	with	you .5 One	of	the	things	I	think	I asked 6 you	to	do	a	year	ago	is	it	would	have	been 7 helpful	if	those	of	you	would	have	signed	a8 letter	to	the	City	and	to	the	State .	It ' s	great 9 that	you	now	tell	us	a	day	after	the	budget 10 what	they	should	have	done .11 But	I ' d	like	to know ,	did	you	go	to 12 the	Housing	Committee	during	budget	time	and 13 testify ?14 Did	you	offer	a proposal	and 15 testify ?16 Did	you	write	a letter	to	the	City 17 Council	and	testify ?18 None	of	you	did	that .	Not	a single 19 one	of	you .20 ( Audience	participation . )21 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :22 You	had	no	intention	of	doing	it .23 So to	say	to	me ,	who	is	not	even	a24 member	of	the	City	Council , that	in	theory	that 25 was	right ,	I	think	you	may	remember	that	I2 
2 asked	you	a	year	ago	to	go	beyond	what	you ' re 3 supposed	to	do	and	advocate	and	come	up with 4 programs .5 If you	had	called	me	up	and	said	can 6 we	go together	to the	Housing	Committee , I7 would	have	marched	right	in with	you	and	these 8 folks	would	have	followed .9 You	didn ' t	do	that .10 So today	to	say	that	is	a	little 11 disingenuous	with	all	due	respect ,	Steve .12 ( Audience	participation . )13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	No ,	no	more 14 questions .15 Thank	you .16 MANHATTAN	BORO . PRES .	STRINGER :17 Thank	you	very	much .18 ( Audience	participation . )19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I ' m	going	to	read 20 off	six	names	that	are	going	to	go	next .21 Barbara	Kraebel	- -22 MR . SCHLEIDER :	He	didn ' t return	my 23 call .24 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	Louis 25 Scheeder ,	- -2

MR . LOUIS	SCHEEDER :	Yeah .CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	Eldib	Mamoud ; Rob	Kabakoff ;Shelley	Hartman ;	and	then Clare	Dockery .Okay .First	is	Barbara	Kraebel .	Is	that MS . BARBARA	KRAEBEL :	That ' s	me .I	prepared	a	short	memo	for	the 
13 Board	which	I	left	at	the	desk .14 I	just	wanted	to	- -15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	We ' ll	get	it .16 We ' ll get	it .17 MS . BARBARA	KRAEBEL :	I	just	wanted 18 to	cover	a	couple	of	points .19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Could	we have 20 decorum ,	please . Thank	you .21 MS . BARBARA	KRAEBEL :	I	am one	of 22 the	famous	small	owners ,	small	property	owners ,23 and	I	am	appealing	to	the	Board	to	continue	to 24 consider	the	actual	expenses	of	building 25 management	- -13 
2 ( Audience	participation . )3 MS . BARBARA	KRAEBEL :	- -	and	not	to 4 be	thrown	off	course	by	the	discussion	about 5 tenant	needs	because	that	really	is	not	the 6 owners '	bailiwick .	The	owner	has	got	to have 7 the	money	to	pay	the	taxes , to	pay	for	the 8 repairs ,	to	pay	all	the	expenses .	And	if the 9 tenant	doesn ' t	have	it ,	then	the	City	or the 10 State	or ,	you	know ,	go	to	the	Federal 11 government	or	to charitable	groups ,	have	to 12 fill	in .13 And ,	in	fact ,	it ' s	my	understanding 14 - -	I was	very	surprised	to	hear	that	there	is	a15 problem	with	excessive	rents	out	in	the	outer 16 boroughs ,	which	I	am	sure	there	are	some .	But 17 it ' s my	understanding	that , as	a	general	rule ,18 the	owners	in	the	outer	boroughs	do	not	charge 19 the	increase	in many	cases	because	they	know 20 that	the	tenants	cannot	afford	them	or	charge 21 them	to	the	tenants	who	can	afford	them .22 ( Audience	participation . )23 MS . BARBARA	KRAEBEL :	And , you	know ,24 I	owned	a	building	actually	in	Harlem ,	Central 25 Harlem ,	for	many	years	and	I would	never	charge 2 
2 increases	to	tenants	who	couldn ' t	afford	them .3 I	gave	preferential	rents	all	across	the	board .4 So , you	know ,	I think	in	some	ways 5 some	of	this	is exaggerated	because	you	are 6 hearing	from	- - you ' re	not	hearing	from	the 7 tenants	who	are	being	given	preferential	rents ,8 and	you ' re	hearing	from	the	tenants	who	are 9 paying	full	rents	for	whatever	reason .10 The	other	thing	is	that	I	had 11 mentioned	in	my memo	that	it ' s	my	understanding 12 that	there	are	some	Board	Members	who	- - that 13 the	provisions	of the	Board ' s	charter	or 14 whatever	permit	tenants	to	be members	of the 15 Board .	And	it	seems	to	me	that	that ' s	a very 16 serious	conflict	of	interest .17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Well ,	the	law 18 provides	that	a tenant	in	a rent	stabilized 19 apartment	can	be ,	but	cannot	be	a	member	or 20 officer	of	a	tenant	organization .21 MS . BARBARA	KRAEBEL :	Well , - -22 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	That ' s	what	the 23 law	provides ,	because ,	you	know ,	quite	frankly 24 - -	and	it	could	be ,	an	owner	rep	could	be an 25 owner ,	but	not	an owner	of	a building	subject 2 
2 to	rent	stabilization .3 So there	is	an ability ,	for	example ,4 for	a	commercial	building	owner	to	serve .	We 5 tend	to	have	lawyers	and	appraisers	and	such 6 historically ,	but	that ' s	the	law .7 So , therefore , there ' s	no	conflict 8 legally .9 MS . BARBARA	KRAEBEL :	Well , I	mean 10 I ' m just	making	the	point	that ,	even	if the	law 11 says	that ' s	the	case ,	it	seems	to	me	there	is	a12 conflict	of	interest	because	the	Board	is 13 acting	as	an	administrative	body	and	I	don ' t14 see	how	a	tenant	or	an	occupant	of	a	rent 15 stabilized	apartment	can	possibly	be	impartial .16 So I ' m	now	personally	appealing	to 17 those	people ,	if there	are	members	of	the	Board 18 who	are	tenants	in	rent	stabilized	apartments ,19 that	they	recuse	themselves	from	further 20 participation	in the	deliberations	and	that 21 they	not	vote ,	because	I	think	it ' s	very 22 irresponsible .23 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	There	are	some ,24 you	know ,	bills	pending	in	Albany	to	reform	the 25 Rent	Guidelines	Board	and	I guess	you	should 2 
2 let	your	legislator	know	that ' s	one	of	the 3 reforms	you	would	like	to	see .4 ( Audience	participation . )5 MS . BARBARA	KRAEBEL :	Can	I just 6 make	one	more	point ?7 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Sure .8 MS . BARBARA	KRAEBEL :	I	mention	also 9 in	my memo	the	issue	which	I notice	in	some	of 10 the	Board ' s	reports	that	they	are	considering 11 vacancies	in	their	deliberations .12 It ' s	not	clear	to	me	how	that 13 factors	in .	But	I	don ' t	see	- -14 ( Audience	participation . )15 MS . BARBARA	KRAEBEL :	- -	that	it	has 16 any	relevance	to a	rent	to	be charged	to a17 continuing	tenant	because	they ' re	not	involved 18 in	the	process	of renovating	apartments , the 19 legal	costs	that	may	be	involved ,	all	the	rest 20 of	it .	And	so	they	shouldn ' t have	any	reduced 21 rent	or	increased	rent	because	of	that	factor .22 And	so	I	just	raise	that .23 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Where	is your 24 building ?25 MS . BARBARA	KRAEBEL :	In	Manhattan .2 
2 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	In	Manhattan .3 You	said	Harlem ?4 MS . BARBARA	KRAEBEL :	No ,	no .	I	used 5 to	own	a	building	in	Harlem . No .	I	just	own	one 6 building	now .	It ' s	the	Upper	East	Side .7 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	And	how	many 8 units ?9 MS . BARBARA	KRAEBEL :	Ten .10 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Ten .11 Okay .	Thank	you 12 MS . BARBARA	KRAEBEL :	Okay . Thank 13 you .14 ( Applause . )15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I ' m	told	that	the 16 Speaker	of	the	City	Council , Christine	Quinn ,17 is	on her	way .	So - -18 ( Audience	participation . )19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	I	read	a	list .20 When	she	does	come ,	we	are	going	to	take	her 21 next .22 Louis	Scheeder .23 MR . LOUIS	SCHEEDER :	Yes . Right 24 here .25 Hi !2 
2 You ' re	going	to hear	today	obviously 3 from	a	lot	of	folks	about	the	unconscionable 4 rent	increases	that	you	come	up	with	year	after 5 year ,	your	fight	against	working	people , your 6 fight	against	the	working	poor .7 I ' m here	to	raise	another	issue	with 8 you .9 Ladies	and	gentleman ,	I	claim	- -	I ' m10 an	active	teacher .	I ' m	an	active	coach . I ' m	a11 director .	I ' m	a third	generation	New	Yorker .	I12 live	in	a	rent	subsidized	unit .13 But	I	am	stating	to	you	that	you	are 14 slowly	destroying	the	aesthetic	life	of this 15 City .	Little	by little ,	you	are	making	it more 16 and	more	difficult	for	artists	to	come	to this 17 City ,	to	work	in this	City .18 ( Audience	participation . )19 MR . LOUIS	SCHEEDER :	And	it is	my 20 belief ,	and	I	cannot	prove	this ,	but	I	fear 21 that	generations	from	now ,	twenty / thirty	years 22 from	now ,	people	will	look	back	and	speak	about 23 the	Rent	Stabilization	Board	and	how	it 24 destroyed	the	preeminence	of New	York	as an 25 artistic	and	cultural	capital .2 
2( Audience	participation . )3MR . LOUIS	SCHEEDER :	I	would	ask 4you to consider	this	thought .5Thank	you	very	much .6CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .7( Audience	participation . )8CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Eldib	Mahmoud .9Eldib	Mahmoud , is	he	here ?10( No response . )11CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Or	she ?

I23 appreciate	the	opportunity	to have	my	say .24 I	live	at	7	West	63 rd	Street ,	which 25 is	a very	fancy	address	for	the	West	Side	YMCA .12 
2 It ' s an	SRO .3 I ' ve	been	living	there	- -4 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	7	West	what ?5 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	7	West	63 rd .6 Got	a	good	zip	code .	But	it ' s	an 7 SRO .8 And	I ' ve	been	there	about	fifteen 9 years .10 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I	live	next	door .11 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	At	the	Lincoln 12 Plaza .13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	At	the	Park 14 Laurel .15 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	Very	nice .	I ' m16 right	on	top	of you .17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	No ,	you ' re	right 18 underneath	of	me .19 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	Right , right ,20 right .	I ' m	working	my	way	up .	Okay .21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	That ' s	right .	I22 hope	so .23 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	Thank	you .	Thank 24 you . It ' s	a	great	building .25 So you	want	to talk	about	the	Y .	The 2 
2 Y	runs	the	first	eleven	floors	of	that 3 building .4 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Yes ,	I	know	all 5 about	it .6 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	Okay .	My	case 7 rests .8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	My	cousin	is	in	a9 condo	and	the	condo	includes	the	Y .10 So go	ahead .11 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	Good	to see	all 12 of	my neighbors	up	here .13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	There	you	go .14 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	All	right .15 Now ,	the	deal	with	- -	most	of	the 16 people	that	live	on	my	side	of	the	street	are 17 working	people . I	myself	am an	actor	and	there 18 are	only	two	categories	of	actors :	There	are 19 the	superstars	that	live	on your	side	of the 20 street ,	and	then	there	is	everybody	else	that 21 is	struggling	- -22 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	We ' re	on the	same 23 side	of	the	street .24 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	Metaphorically ,25 yes . I ' m	in	the	low	rent	district .	That ' s	what 2 
2 I	tell	people .	You ' re	a	high - end	building .3 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I	want	you	to 4 know	just	that	we had	a	buyer	who	backed	out 5 because	of ,	not	my	apartment ,	but	another 6 apartment	this	weekend ,	this	week .	I	was	asked 7 to	talk	to	him	- it	was	a	broker	asked	me to 8 talk	to	him	-	backed	out	because	of	the	SRO .	He 9 was	wrong .10 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	Thank	you .	I11 don ' t	see	why	he would	because	it ' s	basically 12 pretty	decent	people .13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I ' m	with	you .14 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	Most	of them	or 15 a	good	percentage	of	them	are	disabled , elderly 16 people .	Most	of them	are	immigrants ,	legal 17 immigrants ,	very	hard	working	people .18 And	then	there	are	guys	like	myself ,19 just	working	class	New	Yorkers	that	are	trying 20 to	make	ends	meet .21 And	the	reason	why	I	feel	like	the	Y22 should	not	get	an increase	is what	I ' m	going	to 23 say	right	now .24 Number	one ,	we have	several 25 vacancies	on	my floor	and	we ' ve	had	them	for	a2 
2 number	of	years . I	myself	have	tried	to get 3 other	actor	friends	of	mine	to	take	these	rooms 4 because	they	need	housing	too	and	it ' s5 affordable .	And	for	one	reason	or	another	the 6 landlords	have	found	them	unacceptable . And	I7 haven ' t	been	able	to	find	out	exactly	why ,	but 8 it ' s consistent , and	these	rooms	remain	empty .9 We also	have	a restaurant 10 downstairs .	I	don ' t	know	if you	noticed	the 11 sign	out	there .12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Yes ,	I	noticed .13 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	Okay .14 The	tenant ,	the	restauranteur ,	the 15 guy	that	has	been	running	that	facility	for	at 16 least	as	long	as I ' ve	been	there ,	has	said	that 17 they	tried	to	double	the	rent .	They	cannot	find 18 a	new	renter .	That ' s	why	the	sign	is	still 19 there .	And	rather	than	accept	a	monthly 20 arrangement	with	this	restauranteur	rather	than 21 have	him	sign	a lease ,	they	are	just	kicking 22 them	out .23 So if	they	need	money ,	let	them	stay 24 on	month - by - month	until	they	find	a	new	tenant .25 We also	had	a	laundry	machine	in 2 
2 that	building ,	I mean	a	laundry	room	with 3 several	machines .	There	was	some	sort	of 4 falling	out	with	the	proprietor ,	with	the 5 vendor ,	who	owns	those	machines	and	we	have	no 6 more	laundry	there .7 So if	they	need	rent ,	make	a	deal 8 with	the	laundry	guy	that	they	can	both	live 9 with	rather	than	have	the	place	go	empty .10 Third	point ,	final	- -	or	fourth 11 point ,	final	point	I	wanted	to	make	was	that 12 from	what	- -	oh , yes .	The	hotel	itself , the	Y ,13 charges	the	lowest	hotel	rate	in	the	City .	It ' s14 about	$ 70	a	night .	If	they	need	more	money ,	let 15 them	get	euros	from	the	tourists	that	are 16 coming	here	to	spend	money , not	from	the	hard 17 working	or	the	disabled	who	are	trying	to make 18 ends	meet	in	New	York	City	in today ' s	difficult 19 economic	climate .20 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	That	is , I	would 21 point	out ,	a	separate	legal	unit	from	the	SRO .22 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	But	they ' re 23 owned	by	the	YMCA .24 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I	understand .	I ' m25 just	telling	you ,	because	- - therefore , you ' re 2 
2 not	subject	to	the	proviso	because	that	is	a3 - - I would	suggest	that	you	call	HPD	because 4 it ' s part	of	an inclusionary	zoning	agreement ,5 the	units .	So	if they ' re	holding	units	off	the 6 market ,	it ' s	not	us	who	have	anything	to do 7 with	it .	I	think	it ' s	HPD	on that	particular 8 case	because ,	you	know ,	it	was	a	complex	real 9 estate	deal	and	part	of	it	was	this 10 inclusionary	unit	as	it	is	called ,	which	is	all 11 the	SROs .12 So there	is	somebody	who	I think 13 would	be	interested	in	the	fact	that	they	are 14 holding	units	off	the	market .15 They	are	not	holding	units	off	the 16 market ,	however , to	rent	them	to	transients .	So 17 you	would	not	be subject	to our	proviso .18 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Well ,	also , the	YMCA 19 is	not	covered	by rent	stabilization .20 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	Yes ,	it is .	We 21 are .22 We are .	I	mean	unless	I ' m	mistaken .23 I	mean	I ' ve	been	under	- -24 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I	think	that	they 25 are . I	mean	they ' re	an	owner .	They	are	an owner 2 
2 of	this	unit	and	it ' s	not	for	their	own	use .3 It ' s not	for	their	use .4 I	don ' t	know .5 MR . LANGUEDOC :	It ' s	been	held	by 6 the	courts	- -7 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Well ,	maybe .	I8 mean	- -	they	give	you	a	lease ;	right ?9 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	Yeah ,	I have	a10 two - year	lease .11 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	How	long	have	you 12 been	there ?13 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	I ' ve	been	there 14 before	that	building	was	built .	I	lived	in	the 15 hotel	for	six	or seven	years	before	they	built 16 that	- -17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	And	they	moved 18 you	into	the	SRO ?19 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	I	moved	myself 20 there ,	yeah .	Right .21 MR . LANGUEDOC :	It ' s	been	held 22 several	times	by the	courts	that	the	YMCA	is 23 not	covered	by	rent	stabilization .	I	have 24 litigated	those	cases	and	lost	them .25 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .	Maybe	they 2 
2 are	being	nice	for	doing	it .3 MR . LANGUEDOC :	They ' re	just	doing 4 - -	yeah .5 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	But	I	don ' t	know .6 But ,	anyway ,	I think	they	should	not 7 be	holding	the	units .	Whether	or	not	that 8 changes	your	rent	situation	is	a	whole	other 9 issue .10 And	it ' s	unfortunate	about	the 11 restaurant	because	I	know	a lot	of	the	people 12 in	our	area	eat	there .	It ' s a	restaurant	in	the 13 Y .	It ' s	like	a	cafeteria .14 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	Well ,	my 15 impression	is	that	they	are	rent	stabilized .16 That ' s	what	my	lease	says ,	and	they	raise	the 17 rents	or	not	according	to	what	you	guys	decide .18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Maybe	they ' re 19 caught	in	the	fact	that	the	building	itself	is 20 441	( a ) .	I	don ' t know .21 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	They	take 22 Section	8	housing .	That ' s	a fact .23 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .24 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	I	mean	I	don ' t25 know	whether	that	bears	on	whether	it ' s2 
2 stabilized	or	not .3 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	We	don ' t know .4 MS . HOLDER :	No ,	it	doesn ' t .5 But	I	don ' t	know .	We ' re	not	going	to 6 be	able	to	figure	that	out	right	now .	But	I	do 7 appreciate	your	coming	in .8 MR . ROB	KABAKOFF :	All	right .9 The	bottomline	is	I	think	they 10 should	get	a	zero	increase . Thank	you	very 11 much .12 ( Audience	participation . )13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	And	I	don ' t	like 14 the	Y	either ,	so they	may	have	gotten	it .15 Shelley	Hartman ;16 Clare	Dockery ;17 Georgia	Cervos	will	be	after	Clare 18 Dockery ;	and 19 Rodrick	Molina	will	be	after 20 Georgia .21 Shelley	Hartman	is	next .22 MR . SHELLEY	HARTMAN :	Hi !23 Thank	you	for	the	opportunity	to 24 speak .25 My name	is	Shelley	Hartman . I ' m	a2 
2 landlord .	I	own	two	buildings ,	twenty - one 3 apartments	each .4 The	average	rent	stabilized	rent	is 5 about	$ 570 ,	which	is	far	below	what	it	costs	to 6 break	even	on	these	apartments .7 Just	a	few	of	the	big	items .8 Mortgages :	Interest	rates	have	gone 9 up	due	to	this	credit	crunch	and	commercial 10 mortgages	usually	have	to	be refinanced	every 11 five	or	ten	years .12 Other	Board	Members	have	mentioned 13 the	real	estate	taxes ,	the	water	and	sewer	tax .14 I	read	with	interest	the	recent 15 comments	of	Mr . Markus	at	the	Forum	on	Housing 16 Policy	at	NYU .	It ' s	about	time	we	had	a public 17 discussion	on	rent	regulations	in	New	York 18 City .	Almost	every	economist	disparages	rent 19 regulations ,	yet	year	after	year	they ' re 20 continued ,	in	my opinion ,	out	of	simple 21 inertia .22 No one	wants	to look	at	what	we	are 23 trying	to	accomplish	with	these	rules	and 24 regulations .25 To comment	on	a previous	speaker ,2 
2 it ' s not	the	Guidelines	Board	that ' s	destroying 3 New	York	City ,	but	rent	regulations .4 ( Audience	participation . )5 MR . SHELLEY	HARTMAN :	Mr . Markus '6 comments	were	a breath	of	fresh	air .	If we	had 7 an	income - based	approach ,	which	I	believe	Mr .8 Markus	endorses , this	would	bring	some 9 rationality	to	the	system .10 There	are	tenants	who	can ' t afford 11 any	increases .	There	are	tenants	who	can	afford 12 small	increases	and	so	on .13 An income - based	approach ,	based	on 14 the	SCRIE ,	would	accomplish	this .	It	would 15 target	help	to	those	most	in need .16 Just	to	mention	a	recent	notorious 17 case ,	Bianca	Jagger	does	not	need	the	benefits 18 of	rent	laws .19 Mr . Markus	mentioned	a	rent	tax	to 20 fund	this	program .	In	my	opinion	a	more 21 politically	realistic	approach	would	be to 22 raise	real	estate	taxes	on	apartment	buildings 23 based	on	the	increased	income .	In	this	way	you 24 would	be	helping	the	tenants	truly	in	need	and 25 the	rest	of	the	tenants	would	be	paying	their 2 

2	fair	share .3
An appropriate	increase	in the	real 
4 estate	tax	would	prevent	windfall	profits 5 accruing	to	landlords	and	give	the	City	a6 source	of	income	to	pay	for	this	program .	It 7 would	also	place	the	responsibility	of	caring 8 for	those	truly	in	need	where	it	belongs ,	on 9 City	government , and	not	on private	citizens 10 engaged	in	business .11 Thank	you	very	much	for	your	time .12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .13 ( Audience	participation . )14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Clare	Dockery .15 After	Ms .	Dockery ,	we	are	going	to 16 take	Christine	Quinn ,	the	Speaker	of	the	City 17 Council .18 Go ahead .19 MS . CLARE	DOCKERY :	Hi !20 I ' m Clare	Dockery ,	a	resident	of 21 Park	West	Village ,	and	a	member	of	Goddard 22 Riverside	Senior	Center ,	JPAC	and	CFD .23 I	hope	my	testimony	is	not	futile 24 since	I	believe	the	decision	as	to	rent 25 increases	has	already	been	made .4 
2 I	want	to	speak	for	seniors	and 3 other	moderate	income	New	York	City	residents .4 Landlords	have	gotten	increases	every	year	for 5 at	least	the	last	thirty	years .6 My rent	has	doubled ,	and	so has	that 7 of	most	rent	stabilized	tenants ,	over	the	last 8 twenty	years .	Have	landlords '	expenses	doubled 9 during	that	period ?	I	doubt	it ,	but	we	will 10 never	know	because	we	are	never	told	facts 11 about	landlords ' expenses .12 We get	cost	of living	things ,	but	we 13 don ' t	get	landlord	expenses .14 But ,	I	do	know	how	the	residents	of 15 the	building	in which	I	live	have	changed .	When 16 I	moved	in	there ,	there	were	many	working 17 teachers ,	social	workers ,	policemen	and	women ,18 secretaries	living	in	the	building ,	the	Park 19 West	Village	complex .20 Some	of	them	have	retired	and	are 21 still	living	in the	building	on	scaled - back 22 living .	But	I	know	of	no	working	nurses , social 23 workers ,	firefighters	living	in	my	building 24 now . They	can ' t afford	to	because	of	the	huge 25 rent	increases	granted	by	the	RGB	which	have 2 
2 doubled	and	tripled	the	rents .3 I	said	my	rent	had	doubled , but	new 4 tenants	are	paying	three	times	what	I	pay	for	a5 similar	apartment .	That ' s	$ 34 , 000	a	year .6 Please ,	if	you	want	to	stop	the 7 trend	which	makes	living	in New	York	City 8 unaffordable	for	those	who	make	New	York	the 9 City	all	of	us	like	to	live	in ,	please	ask	for 10 a	rent	freeze	now .11 Thank	you .12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .13 ( Applause . )14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Christine	Quinn ,15 Speaker	of	the	New	York	City	Council ,	and 16 actually	- -17 ( Applause . )18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Following	Speaker 19 Quinn	will	be	Councilmember	Robert	Jackson .20 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :21 Good	evening ,	everyone .22 And	I	just	want	to	thank	you	for	the 23 opportunity	to	testify .	I	also	want	to	thank	my 24 colleagues ,	Robert	Jackson , Councilwoman 25 Melissa	Mark - Viverito	and	Councilwoman	Rosie 2 
2 Mendez	who	are	still	here	this	evening .3 As you	all	well	know ,	on	May	5 th	the 4 Rent	Guidelines	Board	began	the	process	of 5 deciding	the	fate	of	the	City ' s	rent	stabilized 6 tenants .7 Many	would	say	that	most	years	you 8 can	set	your	watch	by	the	results .	The	Rent 9 Guidelines	Board	raises	rents	despite	howls 10 from	crowds	of	tenants	who	fear	that	they	will 11 lose	their	home .12 This	year ' s	preliminary	vote	appears 13 to	be no	exception .	The	Rent	Guidelines	Board 14 suggested	increases	of	2	to 4 . 5	percent	for 15 one - year	leases	and	4	to	7 . 5 percent	for 16 two - year	leases .17 This	year	rent	stabilized	tenants 18 deserve	something	different . They	deserve	to 19 have	their	rents	frozen	at	the	current	level .20 ( Audience	participation . )21 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :22 They	deserve	this	freeze	so that	they	too	can 23 successfully	guide	their	families	through	these 24 uncertain	economic	times .25 A	rent	freeze	would	be	the	first 2 
2 such	action	for	the	Board .3 But	difficult	times	call	for 4 unprecedented	measures .	The	numbers	are	on	our 5 side	for	a	call	for	a	rent	freeze .6 In 2007 ,	the	average	net	income	per 7 month	for	a	landlord	on	a	rent	stabilized	unit 8 was	more	than	$ 400 .	In	a	small	building	with 9 six	units	or	so , that ' s	nearly	$ 30 , 000	in 10 annual	profits	after	operating	expenses .11 Keep	in	mind	that	profit	margin 12 reflects	a	year	when	fuel	costs	hit	an	all - time 13 high .	Fuel	costs ,	as	we	all	know ,	have	since 14 thankfully	decreased	ten	percent	meaning 15 profits	on	rent	stabilized	apartments	are 16 larger	now	than	they	were	two	years	ago .17 In fact ,	according	to	the	2009 18 Income	&	Expense	Report	released	by	the	Rent 19 Guidelines	Board	last	month , revenues	have 20 outpaced	expenses	to	the	extent	that	average 21 monthly	net	operating	income	was	worth	17 . 222 percent	more	in 2007	than	it was	in	1990	after 23 adjusting	for	inflation .24 To put	it	another	way ,	landlords	are 25 doing	better	today	than	at	any	time	in	recent 2 

2	history .3
In many	neighborhoods	across	our 
4 City	rent	stabilized	apartments	are	the	last 5 enclaves	of	low	and	middle - income	New	Yorkers .6 All	told ,	we	are	talking	about	more	than	a7 million	New	Yorkers	that	are	affected	by each 8 and	every	increase .9 I	know	my	time	has	gone	over ,	so	I10 don ' t	want	- -11 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	No ,	no . We	didn ' t12 give	you	any	time .13 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :14 Oh , okay .	I ' m	sorry .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	We	can	start	now 16 though .	Give	her	three	minutes .17 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :18 But	rather	considering	themselves	fortunate ,19 most	residents	live	in	fear	of	being	forced	out 20 of	their	homes	either	through	the	predictable 21 ritual	of	rent	increases	or through	possible 22 harassment	by	landlords	eager	to	cash	in on	the 23 housing	crunch	at the	expense	of	the	very 24 people	who	make	this	such	a desirable	City	or 25 neighborhood	to live	in .4 
2 While	the	economic	crisis	has 3 affected	everyone ,	including	landlords , common 4 sense	will	tell	anyone	that	people	at	the 5 bottom	of	the	City ' s	economy	will	undoubtedly 6 be	hit	the	hardest	by	the	recession .	They	are 7 the	ones	working	without	a	safety	net ,	the	ones 8 who	could	be	forced	out	onto	the	street	if	the 9 Rent	Guidelines	Board	stands	by	its	hikes	that 10 it	proposed	a	month	ago .11 Providing	rent	relief	now	will 12 provide	a	life	line	to	those	families	and	act 13 as	a stimulus	for	our	local	economy .14 Money	that	was	being	set	aside	for 15 annual	increases	would	instead	go	towards	food ,16 clothing	and	a	doctor ' s	appointment .17 Freezing	rents	at	the	current	level 18 will	give	working	families	a helping	hand	and 19 we	believe	won ' t break	the	bank	for	landlords .20 Beyond	dollars	and	cents	which	we 21 think	are	on	our	side	based	on	your	own	report ,22 it ' s just	the	right	thing	to do	at	a	critical 23 time	in	our	City ' s	history .24 Thank	you	very	much	for	giving	me 25 this	opportunity	without	the	clock	to	testify .2 
2 ( Applause . )3 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .4 Betty .5 MS . ADAMS :	Thank	you	for	coming	and 6 thank	you	for	your	testimony .7 One	of	the	dilemmas	we	face	is	large 8 landlords	versus	small	landlords .	And	we ' ve 9 heard	from	a	lot	of	the	smaller	ones	today	who 10 say	an	awful	lot	of	the	same	thing	that	you 11 said	about	the	tenants	who	are	to	be	housed 12 there .	But	yet	we have	to	come	up	with 13 something	that	applies	to	all .14 Can	you	help	us with	that	a bit ?15 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :16 Well ,	obviously , you	know ,	and	I ' ve	said	this 17 before ,	we	are	more	than	willing	to	throughout 18 - -	not	just	when	it ' s	this	time	of	year	but 19 anytime	throughout	the	year	work	with	the	Rent 20 Guidelines	Board	on	policies	or	changes	that 21 would	be	helpful	to	the	overall	rental	system 22 in	the	City	of	New	York .23 You	know ,	one	of	the	questions	- -24 and	Clare	mentioned	this	when	she	was	speaking 25 a	few	minutes	ago	- -	there	is ,	and	I ' m	not 2 
2 saying	they	are	not	being	truthful ,	but	a3 representation	from	smaller	landlords	that	they 4 can ' t	balance	the	books .	That	may	very	well	be 5 true .6 What	would	be	useful	is	in the 7 months	between	now	and	the	next	time	we engage 8 in	this	process	to	have	smaller	landlords	sit 9 down	with	all	of us ,	open	up their	books ,	and 10 show	us	where	the	challenges	are .11 ( Audience	participation . )12 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :	We 13 might	then	- -	okay .14 ( Audience	participation . )15 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :	We 16 might	- -17 ( Audience	participation . )18 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :	We 19 might	then	- -20 ( Audience	participation . )21 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :	We 22 might	then	be	able	to	orchestrate	or	create 23 some	government	initiative	that	could	be 24 targeted	and	helpful .	But	otherwise	we	wouldn ' t25 want	to	just	be stabbing	in the	dark .2 
2 MS . ADAMS :	Okay .3 We , as	you	know ,	really	don ' t	set 4 policy .	And	small	landlords	have	been	willing 5 to	open	their	books	for	us . And	we ' ve	had	- -6 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :7 I ' m sorry .	For	you ,	did	you	say ?8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	They ' ve shown	us 9	- -10 MS . ADAMS :	For	us ,	yes .	They ' ve 11 shown	us	their	books .12 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :13 Great .14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Well ,	I mean ,15 they	show	us	what	they	want . So	I	mean	- -16 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :17 I ' m sorry ,	Marvin .	I	can ' t	hear	you .18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	They	show	us	what 19 they	want	to .	So there	have	been	examples	of 20 distressed	buildings .21 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :	I22 think	there	is	- -	obviously	one	only	needs	to 23 look	around	the	City	and	there	are	examples	of 24 distressed	buildings	out	there .	And	the	Council 25 in	a lot	of	different	ways	has	taken	steps 10 
2 around	that	as	it relates	to foreclosure 3 prevention ,	not	just	- -	and	the	Council ' s	also 4 been	quite	outspoken	about	moving	the 5 foreclosure	efforts	of	the	City ,	State	and 6 country	beyond	just	one	and	two	and 7 three - family	homes .	Not	that	that ' s	not 8 important ,	but	we are	having	a	very	different ,9 you	know ,	in	places	impact	on that .10 So we	do	want	to	work	with	folks	on 11 that .12 But	the	only	thing	that	can	really 13 have	good	work	happen	is	full	info .14 MS . ADAMS :	So we	can	refer	some	of 15 the	- -16 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :17 Absolutely .	788 - 7210 .18 MS . ADAMS :	Thank	you .19 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :20 Ask	for	Barbara . She ' ll	keep	a	list .21 ( Audience	participation . )22 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	No	questions ,	no 23 questions .24 Go ahead .	Do	you	have	a	question ?25 MS . LEVINE :	Thank	you	for 2 
2 everything	that	you	are	doing ,	particularly 3 this	year	I ' ve	been	vigilant	on	a	number	of 4 issues	that	are	personally	important	to me .	So 5 I	greatly	appreciate	it ,	as you	know .6 We are	particularly	sensitive 7 obviously	in	these	recessionary	times	to what 8 the	tenants	are	experiencing .	But	what	we have 9 heard	from	landlords	this	year ,	more	than 10 anything	else ,	more	than	fuel ,	more	than 11 insurance ,	more	than	anything	else ,	is	what 12 they	are	experiencing	in	terms	of	fees	payable 13 to	the	City ,	specifically	real	estate	taxes	and 14 water	and	sewer .15 We ' ve	heard	that	it ' s	thirty - five 16 percent	of	their	costs	and	it ' s	the	fastest 17 growing	segment	of	their	costs .18 We just	gave	Scott	Stringer	a	really 19 hard	time	about	this ,	but	really	- -20 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :21 Well ,	then ,	I ' m going	to	have	to	leave . Because 22 if	you	weren ' t	nice	to	Scott ,	I	can ' t	stay .23 MS . LEVINE :	He left	smiling .	So 24 it ' s okay .25 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :2 

2	Okay .3
MS . LEVINE :	Clearly	the	City 
4 Council	is	imposing	this	burden	on	landlords .5 It	would	be	so	much	easier	for	us	if	you	could 6 give	the	landlords	some	help	so	we	can	give	the 7 tenants	a	lot	more	help .8 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :9 Well ,	you	know , on	the	issue	of	property	tax ,10 obviously	this	past	winter	we took	the , what	we 11 had	hoped	would	be	for	two	years ,	but	- - what 12 we	originally	planned	to	do for	a	year , give	a13 break	in	the	property	tax	rate	that	was 14 increased	after	September	11 th .15 We were	able	to do	it	for	a year .	We 16 had	hoped	we	would	be	able	to do	it	for	another 17 year .	It	ended	up only	being	about	six	months .18 So right	before	the	end	of 2008 ,	we 19 took	property	taxes	back	up to	the	level	they 20 were	at	after	September	11 th .	We	would	have 21 preferred	not	to ,	but	obviously	we	had	no real 22 choice	at	that	time .23 Now	that	said , it ' s	important ,	I24 just	want	to	underscore ,	they	were	not	raised 25 above	what	they	had	been .	They	were	raised	back 4 
2 to	that	level	after ,	you	know ,	eighteen	months 3 of	them	being	lowered .4 You	take	that	fact	and	still	I	go 5 back	to	your	2009	Income	and	Expense	Report ,6 taking	them	back	to	where	they	had	been 7 eighteen	months	before	can ' t possibly	offset 8 the	17 . 2	percent	that	your	report	references .9 So although	I	am	not	pretending	that 10 raising	any	kind	of	tax	is	not	an	impact	on 11 someone	-	of	course	it	is	- but	we	have	to	keep 12 it	in perspective	of	what	it went	back	to after 13 a	break	and	in	the	perspective	of	your	own 14 data .15 That	said ,	also	if	you	look	back	at 16 what	happened	after	the	taxes	were	raised ,17 property	taxes	post	9 / 11 ,	many	landlords	came 18 before	the	then	Rent	Guidelines	Board	and	said 19 raise	our	rate , give	us	a	higher	percentage 20 because	property	taxes	have	gone	up .21 That	happened . No	landlord	came	here 22 eighteen	months	ago	and	said	you	can	take	that 23 back	or	part	of it	back	now	that	the	City 24 Council	and	the	Mayor	have	given	a	property	tax 25 break .2 
2 So you	can ' t	have	it	both	ways .3 ( Audience	participation . )4 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I	would	just	say ,5 I	think	- -	I	understand	and	I	agree	on	the	tax 6 rate .7 You	know ,	one	of	the	issues	here	- -8 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :	Is 9 assessment .10 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	is	assessment .11 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :12 Without	a	doubt .13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	And	as	you	know ,14 the	Class	2	properties	bear	a	burden	that	is 15 much	greater	than	Class	1	and	others .16 And ,	you	know , Martha	Stark	did	some 17 very	interesting	work	while	she	was	still 18 Finance	Commissioner	- -19 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :20 She	did .21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	on	that 22 particular	issue .23 So that	- -	we	have	not ,	that	I	can 24 recall ,	ever	seen	a	reduction	in	tax	burden	on 25 this	sector .	And	it ' s	been	largely	due	to 2 
2 assessment	I	would	agree	with	you .3 But	- -4 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :5 Well ,	let	me	just	say	one	thing	if	I	can ,6 Chairman ,	about	assessment .7 I	mean	that	is absolutely	a problem 8 and	the	point	you	raise	about	Class	2	versus 9 Class	1 ,	et	cetera ,	et	cetera ,	is	a	problem .10 And	Martha	did	some	very	good	work 11 on	this	when	she	was	Finance	Chair ,	probably 12 some	of	the	best	work	that	had	been	done	- -13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Definitely .14 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :	- -15 in	quite	some	time ,	and	we	need	to	follow	up	on 16 it .17 We all	know	many ,	many	years	ago	at 18 the	end	of	the	Dinkins	Administration ,	then 19 Deputy	Finance	Commissioner	Graham ,	now	at	our 20 Department	of	Education ,	had	also	led	an effort 21 to	try	to	move	us towards	greater ,	you	know ,22 fairness	or	equalization	that	we	probably 23 should	also	go	back	and	dust	off	and	see	what 24 ideas	are	in	there .25 Now ,	the	thing	about	assessments 2 
2 though	is	obviously	it	cuts	in	the	negative	as 3 it	relates	to ,	even	if	the	rate	is	the	same	or 4 lower ,	your	bill	might	go	up .5 The	flip	side	of	assessment	is	that 6 means	your	property	is	worth	more ,	which	if	you 7 are	a	business	person	creates	the	greater 8 opportunity	for	other	business ,	you	know ,9 loans ,	et	cetera ,	et	cetera , based	on	the	value 10 of	your	property .11 So there	is	- - it	doesn ' t	take	away 12 that	you ' re	paying	more ,	but	there	is	another 13 side	to	be	considered	to	it .14 Let	me	just	go back	to	the	water 15 rate	issue	for	a second .16 You	know ,	the	Council	had	tremendous 17 and	was	quite	- - and	some	of the	Council 18 Members	quite	outspoken	on	- -	in	opposition	to 19 what	the	Water	Board	did .20 And	I	believe	there	are	some	not	too 21 complicated	steps	that	could	be	taken	as it 22 relates	to	changing	the	structure	of	the	lease 23 that	is	part	of our	Water	Board	model	and	Water 24 Board	structure	that	would	give	a	much	lighter 25 load	not	just	to landlords	but	to	all	kinds	of 2 
2 property	owners .3 I	still	don ' t	think	that	increase 4 outpaces	the	other	data	on	profits ,	et	cetera .5 But	I	don ' t	want	to	pretend	that	it	isn ' t6 something	we	all	don ' t	have	to	come	back	to 7 because	that	affects	landlords	and ,	you	know ,8 lower - income	property	owners	as	well .9 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Of	course ,	- -10 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :	I11 mean	homeowners . Excuse	me .12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	and	I ' m	quite 13 familiar	with	the	water	lease .	Of	course ,	if 14 you	do	- -	and	you ' re	probably	suggesting	that 15 the	ten	percent	City	override	be	eliminated .16 But , of	course , that	would	make	a	two / three 17 hundred	million	hole	in	the	budget	you	adopted 18 and	you	would	have	to	fill	that	- -19 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :20 It ' s important	to note	- -21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	in	some	way .22 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :23 It ' s important	to note	that	DEP	for	quite	some 24 time	is	one	of	the	few	agencies	that ' s	been 25 exempted	from	any	capital	cuts	or	things	of 2 
2 that	nature .	So it ' s	a	place	that	is	- - I ' m	not 3 saying	wasteful , but	that	we might	actually	be ,4 unlike	other	agencies	that	have	had	more	cuts ,5 we	might	be	able	to	find	something .6 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I	hope	so .	But ,7 you	know ,	a	lot	of	that ' s	been	- -	we ' re one	- -8 I ' m at	Goldman	Sachs	- -	we ' re one	of	the 9 underwriters ,	and	the	Water	Authority ,	a lot 10 has	been	Federally - mandated	- -11 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :12 That ' s	true .13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	costs ,14 filtration	and	the	rest ,	that	resulted	in the 15 capital	plan	and	the	third	water	tunnel	which	I16 think	everybody	agrees	is	important .17 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :18 Absolutely .19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	So	I	mean	it ' s20 not	a	simple	issue .21 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :22 None	of	this	is . None	of	this	is	a	simple 23 issue .	But	there	are	particular	burdens	right 24 now	and	at	particularly	extreme	times	and	a	set 25 of	facts	that	I think	make	this	a	year	that	is 2 
2 an	appropriate	call .3 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I	appreciate	it .4 Any	other	questions ?5 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :6 Thank	you .7 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .8 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr .	Chair ?9 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .	One	more 10 question .11 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :12 I ' m sorry .13 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Speaker	Quinn ,14 thank	you .15 In your	testimony	you	made	mention 16 of	an ,	I	guess , an	average	NOI	per	apartment 17 per	month .	I	think	you	said	$ 400 .18 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :19 Yes .20 MR . SCHLEIDER :	And	then	you	said 21 - -	then	you	had	a	number	after	that .	Could	you 22 repeat	that ?	I ' m not	quite	sure	I	understand 23 what	that	is .24 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :	It 25 was	just	six	units	$ 400 , 000 . That ' s	nearly	a2 
2 three	hundred	- - I ' m	sorry	- -	$ 30 , 000	in annual 3 profits .4 MR . SCHLEIDER :	For	a	six - unit 5 building	then ,	right ?6 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :7 Yes .8 MR . SCHLEIDER :	I	get	$ 28 , 800 .9 All	right .10 But	the	number , the	$ 400 ,	- -	it ' s	in 11 the	order	of	magnitude .	It ' s fine .12 But	in	the	report	that	you	cited	- -13 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :	We 14 are	in	the	midst	of	the	City	Budget	so	we might 15 have	rounded	up .16 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Okay .17 ( Laughter . )18 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Great .	Great .19 Like	the	AVs	- okay	-	which	don ' t20 match	a	downward	trend	with	property	values .21 They ' re	a	lagging	indicator . So	I	don ' t know 22 any	businessman	that	would	be able	to ,	or a23 person	who	would	be	able	to use	that	as an 24 asset	for	loans	nowadays .	But	- -25 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :2 
2 But	there	have	been	times	when	you	have	and 3 there	haven ' t	been	at	those	moments	- -4 MR . SCHLEIDER :	These	are	not	those 5 times .6 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :7 No . But	it	is	important	to	note ,	with	all	due 8 respect ,	these	may	not	be	those	times ,	but 9 there	are	never	those	times	when	- -10 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right . Can	we 11 get	- -12 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :	- -13 owners	step	forward	and	say	things	are	good 14 so	we can	- -	you	can	take	a little	back . That 15 never	ever	happens .	That ' s	the	point .16 ( Audience	participation . )17 MR . SCHLEIDER :	And	we	can	get	into 18 property	- -	we	can	also	get	into	personal 19 income	taxes	- -20 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :21 I ' m sorry ,	sir . I	just	can ' t hear	you .22 MR . SCHLEIDER :	We	can	also	get ,	I23 guess ,	into	personal	income	tax	theory	and	what 24 the	City	does	about	that	or doesn ' t	do .25 But ,	again ,	going	back	to	the	study 2 
2 that	you	cited , I ' m	having	a problem	I	guess 3 matching	the	numbers	that	you	came	up	with	and 4 I ' d like	to	know	where	you	got	them	in	our 5 report .6 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :7 Well ,	we	can	- - I	don ' t	have	it	in	front	of	me 8 but	we	can	certainly	follow	up	with	you .9 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right .10 I	have	the	report	in	front	of	me	so 11 I	can	just	go	through	what	I have .12 If we	look	at	the	cross - section ,13 Income	and	Expense	Study	Estimated	Average 14 Rent - Income	Cost	for	2007	for	apartment	per 15 month	by	building	size	and	location ,	and	just 16 do	the	City	overall ,	for	post - ' 46 ,	you	know 17 pre - wars ,	post - wars ,	income , including	other 18 sources ,	not	just	rent ,	against	the	costs 19 leaves	$ 350	a	month .	That ' s overall .20 But	if	we	strip	out	core	Manhattan ,21 and	I	think	there	are	some	on the	Board	that 22 would	like	to	have	some	sort	of	bifurcation	of ,23 you	know ,	rent	steps ,	some	- - you	know ,	using 24 core	Manhattan	maybe	as	some	line	of 25 demarcation ,	if we	take	out	core	Manhattan ,2 
2 it ' s $ 236	a	month	per	unit .3 If we	look	at	the	median	rents ,	it ' s4 far	lower .	In	fact ,	the	City ,	without	the	core 5 Manhattan ,	comes	down	to	$ 216	per	month	per 6 unit .7 So we	are	not	looking	at	the	$ 28 , 000 8 a	year	anymore	for	your	hypothetical	building .9 ( Audience	participation . )10 MR . SCHLEIDER :	So	given	that ,	is 11 the	Council	- -	as most	of	the	City	without	the 12 core	Manhattan	it ' s	made	up of	smaller	building 13 stock	- -	would	the	City	Council	be	willing	to 14 do	something	to help	the	smaller	landlords 15 outside	the	core	Manhattan	because	obviously 16 it ' s not	as	profitable	as	you	are	making	it	out 17 to	be ?18 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :19 Well ,	first	of	all ,	I	don ' t have	the	report	in 20 front	of	me	so	I can ' t	go	back	and	forth	on	the 21 numbers .	And	I ' m happy	to	follow	up	with	you ,22 sit	with	you	and	go	over	the	numbers .23 MR . SCHLEIDER :	I	welcome	that .24 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :	I25 stand	by	the	numbers	- -	okay .	Great .2 
2 If you	will	just	make	- -	we ' ll	call 3 Mr . McLaughlin	and	get	your	phone	number	and 4 follow	up	and	set	up	that	time .5 I ' m going	to	stand	by	the	numbers	in 6 my	testimony .7 That	said ,	the	Council	is	always 8 willing	to	work	with	property	owners ,	large	or 9 small .	Obviously ,	the	challenge	of	small 10 property	owners	can	be	greater	clearly	than 11 large	ones .12 The	City ' s	had	different	- - if	you 13 look	at	the	different	loan	programs ,	et cetera ,14 historically	in the	City ,	there ' s	always	an 15 interest	in	doing	that .16 There	was	a	very	creative	program	a17 number	of	years	ago	that	then	the	Community 18 Group	CTRC	came	up	around	loans	to	help	small 19 landlords	who	had	challenges	with	boilers	and 20 things	like	that	go	through	a	training	program ,21 get	loans ,	you	know ,	get	kind	of	violations ,	et 22 cetera ,	off	their	back .23 We would	welcome	sitting	down	and 24 looking	at	a	program	like	that	again .25 But	that	said , if	we	are	going	to 2 
2 sit	down	and	come	up	with	a program	that	deals 3 with	problems	small	owners	have	as	that	CTRC 4 program	did	in	my opinion	effectively ,	and	I5 think	most	of	the	small	landlords	and	tenant 6 advocates	all	agreed	that	was	an	effective 7 program	in	the	late	' 90 s ,	we are	going	to have 8 to	have	a	level	of	disclosure	and 9 forthcomingness	from	the	owners	about	what	the 10 problems	are .11 That ' s	one	of	the	things	that	made 12 that	program	work .	It	was	very	targeted	at	a13 problem	that	was	costing	small	property	owners 14 money ,	causing	lack	of	services	for	tenants ,15 but	it	was	very , very	targeted	and	it	worked .16 So we	would	with	that	proper	amount 17 of	disclosure	be happy	to	go take	a	look	at 18 something	like	that	again .19 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Just	one	follow - up 20 question ,	please .21 We ' ve	heard	from	- -	we ' ve	heard	some 22 commentary	that	DHCR	hardship	programs	are 23 available	for	landlords	that	have	problems 24 making	ends	meet ,	distressed	properties .25 But	when	we	had	DHCR	testify	in 2 
2 front	of	us	a	few	weeks	ago , the	Deputy 3 Commissioner	said	that	the	hardship	program	is 4 a	non - starter .	It doesn ' t	work .	They	can ' t	get 5 the	applications	through	because	there ' s a6 component	of	it that ' s	beyond	their	control	- -7 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :8 Beyond	the	department ' s	control ?9 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- -	and	that ' s	the 10 - -	out	of	DHCR ' s control	and	out	of	the 11 landlords '	control	because	part	of	the 12 application	has	to	do	with	tax	relief ,	real 13 estate	tax	relief ,	certiorari .14 And	the	City	just	doesn ' t	have	those 15 cases	being	heard .16 So these	cases	in	front	of DHCR 17 languish	for	years	and	they	haven ' t	given	any 18 hardship	awards	for	years .19 It seems	like	it ' s	a	futile	program 20 for	landlords	to get	involved	with ,	yet	the 21 populace ,	the	general	populace ,	here	feels	that 22 it ' s an	avenue	for	landlords .23 But	it	just	doesn ' t	work .	And	the 24 main	reason	it	doesn ' t	work	is	because	the	City 25 is	dragging	its	feet	in	allowing	the	certiorari 2 
2 proceedings	to	go forward	to provide	real 3 estate	tax	relief	so	that	these	owners	can	then 4 have	a	bona	fide	proforma	to put	in	front	of 5 DHCR	that	shows	what ' s	going	on .6 Now	you ' re	talking	years	lapsing 7 between	the	time	an	application	may	be	put	in 8 and	by	the	time	there	is	some	resolution .9 What	can	the	City	do ?10 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :11 Well ,	I	can ' t	- - I	mean	I	can ' t	comment	on	DHCR 12 Deputy	Commissioner ' s	testimony	because	I13 wasn ' t	here	to	hear	it .	That	said ,	we	will 14 reach	out	- -	I ' ll have	myself	and	staff	reach 15 out	to	DHCR	staff ,	reach	out	to	the	appropriate 16 City	staff ,	reach	out	to	landlord 17 representatives	and	to	tenant	representatives .18 And	if	there	is ,	in	fact ,	a problem 19 with	the	program ,	we ' ll	take	steps	to	try	to 20 fix	it .21 I	just	can ' t	comment	in	the 22 abstract .	I	didn ' t	hear	the	Commissioner ' s23 testimony .	But	we will	obviously	follow	up	with 24 the	Commissioner	and	the	relevant	City	staff	as 25 well	and	see	if there ' s	something	that	needs	to 2 
2 be	addressed .3 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Terrific . Thank 4 you .5 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .6 COUNCIL	SPEAKER	CHRISTINE	QUINN :7 Thank	you ,	all .8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	We	appreciate	it .9 ( Applause . )10 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Sir .	Sir .	Sit 11 down .	Sit	down . Sit	down .12 One	second ,	Councilmember	Jackson .13 Sit	down ,	sir . Not	you ,14 Councilmember	Jackson .15 Let	me	just	make	one	announcement .16 ( Audience	participation . )17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Good	bye .	Thank 18 you .19 One	announcement .20 The	registration	upstairs	closes	at 21 6 : 00 .	So	if	anybody	in	the	audience	who	is	not 22 registered	would	like	to	speak ,	go	upstairs	and 23 get	yourself	registered	because	the 24 registration	stops	at	6 : 00 .25 Okay .2 

234	you .5
Councilmember	Jackson .COUNCILMEMBER	JACKSON :	Well ,	thank Thank	you	for	the	opportunity	to 
6 come	and	testify	in	front	of the	Board	in order 7 to	speak	on	behalf	of	the	people	that	I8 represent	in	the	7 th	Councilmanic	District	in 9 Northern	Manhattan ,	which	includes	the 10 geographic	areas	of	West	Harlem ,	part	of the 11 most	northern	part	of	Morningside	Heights ,	all 12 of	Hamilton	Heights ,	Sugar	Hill ,	part	of 13 Washington	Heights	and	Inwood .14 I	chair	the	City	Council ' s Education 15 Committee ,	but	I also	sit	and	serve	on	the 16 Housing	and	Buildings	Committee	at	the	City 17 Council	of	New	York .18 And	I	am	here	tonight	to	let	you 19 know	that	my	constituents ,	including	so many 20 families	with	children	and	seniors	on	fixed 21 incomes ,	cannot	afford	to	pay	another	round	of 22 excessive ,	unjustifiable	rent	increases .23 Last	year ,	this	Board ,	the	Rent 24 Guidelines	Board ,	justified	rent	increases	and 25 painful	supplemental	increases	that	caused	our 6 
2 poorest	citizens	to	pay	harsh	rent	increases 3 based	on	the	assumption	that	fuel	costs	were 4 going	to	continue	to	rise .	But	they	did	not .5 The	Rent	Guidelines	Board ' s own 6 research	shows	that	fuel	costs	fell	by	over	ten 7 percent .8 Will	these	clearly	unjustified	rent 9 increases	be	corrected	by	this	Board	or will 10 landlords	be	allowed	to	reap	a	windfall	of 11 profits	on	the	backs	of	the	workers	of	this 12 City ?13 I	say	" windfall "	because	it seems 14 that	it	is	just	that .	Net	operating	income	for 15 landlords	has	increased ,	my understanding ,	by 16 9 . 3 percent	last	year .	And	these	are	not	my 17 figures .	These	are	your	figures .18 And	at	the	same	time	the	actual	and 19 real	income	of	tenants	continues	to	fall .20 Countless	tenants	in	the	City	are	paying	forty ,21 fifty	and	sixty	percent	of	their	disposable 22 income	for	rent .23 In many	buildings	where	MCIs	are 24 being	granted ,	justified	or otherwise ,	the	rent 25 increases	imposed	by	the	Rent	Guidelines	Board 2 
2 amounted	to	a	twenty	percent	or	more	increase 3 in	their	rent ,	that	they	have	to	pay	out	of 4 their	pocket .5 Could	any	of	you	absorb	such	an 6 increase	in	your	housing	costs ?	If	your	bank 7 suddenly	started	charging	you	a	twenty	percent 8 premium	on	a	loan ,	you	would	be	looking	for 9 another	bank .	I know	I	would .10 Some	people	have	been	heard	to	say ,11 " If they	can ' t	afford	the	rent ,	then	let	them 12 get	another	apartment	somewhere	else . "	Easier 13 said	than	done .14 A	VOICE :	That ' s	right .15 ( Audience	participation . )16 COUNCILMEMBER	JACKSON :	Well ,	Board 17 Members ,	I ' m	here	to	tell	you	that	our	stock	of 18 affordable	units	is	rapidly	disappearing	and 19 there	are	few ,	if any ,	affordable	apartments 20 from	which	poor	and	financially	strapped 21 tenants	can	choose	from .22 And	with	vacancy	increases	added	to 23 the	yearly	rental	increase	approved	by	this 24 Board ,	those	apartments	quickly	reach	the	point 25 of	being	unaffordable	to	most	of	us .2 
2 Others	are	concerned	that	not	all 3 landlords	are	wealthy	and	that	some	are 4 actually	doing	poorly .	I	understand	that	this 5 Board ' s	own	reports	do	not	reflect	that	to	be 6 true .	But	to	the	extent	that	it	may	be	true	for 7 some	landlords , across - the - board	rent	increases 8 to	protect	a	few	owners	is	not	right .	In some 9 people ' s	minds	it ' s	unconscionable .10 And	to	the	extent	some	are	doing 11 poorly	because	of their	own	bad	business 12 practices ,	it	is not	the	obligation	of	this 13 Board	to	bail	them	out .14 At a	time	when	many	constituents	of 15 mine	and	around	the	City	are	losing	their	jobs 16 - -	and ,	in	fact , I	just	left	a	rally	being 17 sponsored	by	Local	372	of	District	Council	# 37 18 where	they	are	expected	to	lose	about	2500 19 employees	as	a	result	of	the	budget	cuts	in	the 20 Department	of	Education .21 So considering	that	and	considering 22 that	income	is	falling	and	the	cost	of	food	is 23 rising ,	and	the	rest	of	the	economy ,	we all 24 know ,	is	struggling ,	the	Rent	Guidelines	Board 25 must	stop	acting	to	guarantee	substantial 2 
2 profits	to	the	wealthy	housing	industry .3 By increasing	rents ,	you	are 4 violating ,	in	my opinion ,	your	public	trust	and 5 contributing	significantly	to the	loss	of 6 affordable	housing ,	the	very	commodity	in which 7 you	are	supposed	to	help	stabilize .8 The	rent	increases	in	2009	are	not 9 justified	and	especially	the	supplemental	rent 10 increase	intended	for	tenants	who	have	leases 11 of	six	years	or longer .12 I	request	- -	no ,	I	demand	that	you ,13 the	Rent	Guidelines	Board ,	the	members , act 14 responsibly	and	hold	rents	at current	levels ,15 and	under	no	circumstances	enact	a	supplemental 16 rent	increase .17 So I	say	that	to	say	this . I ' ve	been 18 here	before .	I ' ve testified	before .	I ' ve been 19 here	when	you	acted	as	a	body .	And	I	understand 20 that	all	of	you	have	an	obligation .	And	I21 understand	that	some	of	you	have	certain 22 constituencies	that	you	represent	by	your 23 plaques	in	front	of	you	-	the	owner	members ,24 the	tenant	members ,	and	the	Executive	Director ,25 the	Chairman	and	public	members .2 
2 But	I	say	to	you	put	yourself	in	my 3 situation	as	a	representative	of	163 , 000	people 4 in	Northern	Manhattan .	The	citywide	average 5 family	income	is only	about	$ 44 , 000	a	year ,6 citywide .	And	in my	district ,	District	# 7 ,7 based	on	the	2000	Census	-	and	obviously	next 8 year	we	have	the	2010	Census	data	-	but	based 9 on	the	2000	Census	a	family	of	four	earned	less 10 than	$ 34 , 000	a	year .11 I	stand	here	as their	representative 12 advocating	on	their	behalf	and	ask	you	to 13 consider	their	situation .14 I	thank	you	for	the	time .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .16 ( Applause . )17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Any	questions ?18 ( No response . )19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .20 I	am	going	to	read	the	next	six 21 names	and	tell	me if	you ' re here .22 Georgia	Cervos ? Yes ?	I	got	that 23 right ?	Georgia	Cervos ?	You	here ?24 Rodrick	Molina .25 Just	wait .	I ' m going	to	call	- -	go 2

JOSEPH	PORTO :	Yes .13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Alvin	Doyle ?14 MR . ALVIN	DOYLE :	Here .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Sid	Miller ?16 MR . SID	MILLER :	Yes .17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Samantha	Paige ?18 MS . SAMANTHA	PAIGE :	Here .19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .20 Those	will	be	the	next	six .21 Mr . Molina .22 MR . RODRICK	MOLINA :	Thank	you	for 23 hearing	me	out .24 My name	is	Rodrick	Molina	and	I ' ve 25 been	asked	to	speak	by	the	Fifth	Avenue 2 

2	Committee .3
I ' ve	lived	in	a rent	stabilized 
4 apartment	for	twelve	years , moving	here	from 5 Miami ,	Florida	in 1997 .6 It was	only	because	I	was	able	to 7 find	a	rent	stabilized	apartment	that	I was 8 able	to	afford	to live	in	New	York	City .9 A	VOICE :	Can ' t hear	you .10 MR . RODRICK	MOLINA :	I ' m	in	the 11 middle - class	income	bracket	and	affordable 12 housing	is	near	impossible	to locate .	Along 13 with	the	vacancy	rate	makes	finding	affordable 14 housing	difficult .15 Although	I	live	in	a	rent	stabilized 16 apartment ,	I ' m	still	victimized	on	a	monthly 17 basis	by	profit - oriented	landlords .	The 18 building	I	live	in ,	originally	an	eight - family 19 dwelling ,	has	been	warehoused	with	only	two 20 tenants	left .21 Living	conditions	have	steadily 22 worsened	since	the	new	landlords ,	three 23 lawyers ,	have	taken	over .	Lack	of	maintenance 24 and	repairs	have	contributed	to	unsafe	and	even 25 hazardous	conditions .4 
2 Still	the	landlords	are	seeking	to 3 increase	the	rent	through	the	guidelines	set 4 forth	by	the	RGB .5 The	only	recourse ,	I ' ve	been	to	the 6 agencies	that	regulate	rent	stabilized 7 apartments .	In	the	last	year	alone	I ' ve been	to 8 Housing	Court	on ten	different	separate 9 occasions ,	all	of this	because	of	the	owners '10 refusal	to	maintain	adequate	living	conditions .11 This	is	part	of their	insidious	plot	to drive 12 out	regulated	tenants	so	as to	deregulate	all 13 the	apartments	in the	building	for	a	larger 14 profit	margin .15 The	fact	that	they	seek	to make	a16 profit	is	not	objectionable . It	is	the	manner 17 in	which	they	do it	that	is troubling .	Although 18 they	have	the	capacity	to	renovate	the	building 19 around	regulated	tenants ,	they	continue	subtle 20 methods	to	drive	out	the	remaining	tenants .21 This	includes	trash	accumulation ,	vermin 22 nuisance ,	including	roaches	and	rats ,	lack	of 23 smoke	detectors , lack	of	heat	and	hot	water .24 And	when	there	is hot	water , it	is	also 25 scalding .2 
2 Another	subtle	form	of	harassment	is 3 a	complete	lack	of	attention	to	any	repairs 4 necessary	to	the	property .	As a	result , the 5 building	is	on	the	verge	of dilapidation .	The 6 roof	is	in	poor	condition .	It leaks	whenever	it 7 rains .8 In my	apartment	alone	the	ceilings 9 are	to	the	point	of	collapse .	The	walls	are	in 10 poor	condition . They	need	plastering	and	paint .11 And	the	floors	are	equally	in need	of	attention 12 with	rotten	floor	boards	from	water	leaks .13 The	only	relief	is	provided	by 14 government	agencies	such	as yours ,	which	have 15 the	ability	to	regulate	both	tenants	and 16 landlords	to	provide	affordable	housing	to 17 people	filling	essential	services	to	the 18 inhabitants	of	our	great	City .19 The	Rent	Guidelines	Board ,20 Department	of	Housing	Preservation	and	the 21 Department	of	Housing	and	Community	Renewal 22 provide	the	only	recourse	in a	time	when 23 household	resources	are	already	stretched	thin 24 by	increasing	living	expenses .25 Ironically ,	it ' s	the	same	conditions 2 
2 around	the	turn	of	the	last	century	which	led 3 to	the	birth	of agencies	such	as	yours .4 And	I	remind	you	all	of	Jacob	Reese 5 who	wrote	" How	the	Other	Half	Lives . "6 Conditions	in	this	area	and	in	the	five	points 7 led	people	like	Jacob	Reese	to	call	national 8 attention	to	the	wretched	living	conditions	in 9 this	City .10 It is	now	up	to agencies	like	yours 11 to	prevent	a	return	to	these	same	conditions 12 under	very	similar	circumstances .13 This	is	why	they	must	vote	not	to 14 increase	the	rent	this	year . The	times	could 15 not	be	worse	for	an	increase .16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .17 Good	job .18 ( Applause . )19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Chuck	Gedinsky .20 Mr . Gedinsky .21 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	My	name	is 22 Charles	Gedinsky .	I	want	to thank	you	for 23 letting	me	speak	before	you	this	evening .24 I ' m a	small	property	owner	who	goes 25 to	work	like	my tenants	each	day ,	normally	six 2 
2 days	a	week .3 I	want	to	thank	you	for	the	$ 45	and 4 $ 85 low - rent	supplement	that	you	gave	us last 5 year	to	supplement	some	extremely	low	rents	and 6 high	expenses .	I have	tenants	living	in 7 three - bedroom	apartments	paying	under	$ 700	a8 month .	The	increase	helped	me with	the	running 9 of	my building , and	all	the	tenants	in	my 10 building	realize	that	even	with	the	low - rent 11 supplement ,	they	have	a	rent	that	is	fifty	to 12 sixty	percent	below	market	rents .13 Last	year ,	you	gave	us	an	increase 14 of	4 . 5	percent	and	8 . 5	percent	respectively	for 15 one	and	two - year	renewals .	I ask	that	you	do 16 the	same	this	year .17 Water	and	sewer	have	increased	by	14 18 percent .	Real	estate	taxes	increased	by 7 . 519 percent .	These	more	than	offset	any	relief	in 20 fuel	prices	which ,	by	the	way ,	since	February 21 2009 ,	have	increased	by	forty	percent	for	No .	222 oil .23 On February	19 th	I	paid	$ 1 . 465	per 24 gallon	for	No .	2 oil .	On	June	13 th	the	price 25 increased	by	41 percent	to	$ 2 . 06	for	the	same 2 
 2 No . 2	oil .	I	have	price	charts	if	you	would 3 like	to	see	them .4 All	of	my	tenants	weathered	the 5 guidelines	and	supplements	voted	in	2008 .6 Nobody	lost	their	apartments	as	a	result	of 7 these	guidelines .8 My lower - income	tenants ,	as those	on 9 SCRIE ,	had	the	increase	picked	up	by	SCRIE	or 10 other	programs	they	may	be	on .	The	two	tenants 11 I	had	to	go	to	court	with	over	the	last	year 12 both	received	financial	aid , one	for	the	third 13 time	in	three	years .14 It is	important	that	you	be 15 consistent	with	what	you	do . Leases	that	expire 16 from	10 / 1 / 09	through	9 / 30 / 10 should	be	treated 17 the	same	as	those	that	expired	from	10 / 1 / 08	to 18	9 / 30 / 09 .19 I	ask	that	you	vote	for	the	minimum 20 rent	increase	for	rents	under	$ 1000	as	you	did 21 in	' 08 - ' 09 ,	and	that	you	vote	for	the	same	4 . 522 and	8 . 5	percent	increase	that	you	voted	for 23 last	year .24 With	the	large	increases	in water 25 and	sewer	and	real	estate	taxes	and	the	costs 19 
2 to	keep	all	the	buildings	in good	repair ,	these 3 same	increases	are	needed	to preserve	and 4 maintain	New	York	City	housing .5 Thank	you .6 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .7 How	many	buildings	do	you	have ?8 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	I	have	two 9 buildings .10 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	And	how	many 11 units ?12 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	One	building 13 has	twenty	apartments	and	the	other	building 14 has	eight .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	And	they	are 16 where ?17 MR . CHUCK	GEDINSKY :	In	Queens .18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .19 ( Audience	participation . )20 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Joseph	Porto .21 Joseph	Porto .22 Go ahead ,	Mr .	Porto .23 MR . JOSEPH	PORTO :	Hi !24 I ' m a	building	owner ,	small	building 25 owner ,	about	twelve	units .2 
2 The	problems	that	the	gentleman	just 3 preceded	me	are	all	true .4 No one	has	lost	any	money	because	of 5 the	minimum	rent	increase ,	no one	has	lost	any 6 occupancy	or	apartments	because	of	it .7 But	I	did	notice	that	Mr .	- -	the 8 Councilman	that	spoke	before	said	that , because 9 of	the	acts	of	bad	landlords ,	that	they	have 10 problems .11 You	know ,	I	don ' t	know	about	that 12 bad	landlord	stuff	so	much . It	might	be true 13 that	some	landlords	are	not .14 But	then	again	there ' s	a	lot	of 15 tenants	and	problems	-	not	any	in	this	audience 16 - there ' s	a	lot	of tenants	that	are	taking 17 advantage	of	the	system ,	having	- -18 ( Audience	participation . )19 MR . JOSEPH	PORTO :	- -	parents ,	their 20 children ,	their	grandchildren ,	all	occupy	small 21 two - bedroom	apartments .22 And	no	minimum	- -	and	nothing	a23 landlord	can	really	do	- -	excuse	me	- -24 ( Audience	participation . )25 MR . JOSEPH	PORTO :	And	I	agree .2 
2 There	is	nowhere	else	to	go . There	is	a3 problem .	There	is a	shortage	of	housing	making 4 it	difficult	for	everybody .5 But	it	doesn ' t necessarily	mean	that 6 the	landlords	are	bad .7 A	VOICE :	They	are .8 MR . JOSEPH	PORTO :	Some	- - maybe 9 yours	is .	And	I would	talk	to him	for	you	if 10 you	want .11 But	I	have	a	tenant	that	doesn ' t	pay 12 rent	every	year	for	a	year	straight .	Finally 13 they	pay	in	court .	It	costs	- -14 A	VOICE :	Live	in	an	SRO ?15 MR . JOSEPH	PORTO :	No ,	no .16 ( Audience	participation . )17 MR . JOSEPH	PORTO :	So	basically	some 18 tenants	do	take	advantage	too .	And	I	do take 19 the	tenant	to	court	and	it	takes	a	year ,20 basically	about	three	or	four	grand	in	legal 21 expenses ,	to	collect	basically	the	same	amount 22 of	rent .23 And	it	is	tenants	like	that	that	are 24 costing	landlords	more	money	that	aren ' t able 25 to	put	into	these	buildings	that	they	complain 2 
 2 that	are	falling	apart	which	might	be	true .3 But	it ' s	a	balance	system	that	has 4 to	work	for	both	sides .	It ' s not	one	or the 5 other .6 If someone	is	occupying	an apartment 7 that ' s	four	bedrooms	and	they ' re	paying	less 8 than	$ 700	a	rent ,	a	minimum	tenant	rent 9 increase	might	be appropriate .	I ' m	not	saying 10 extravagant ,	but	a	minimum	rent	increase ,11 especially	if	they	have	several	family	members 12 living	there	that	are	all	wage	earners	of 13	$ 20 , 000 ,	$ 30 , 000 ,	$ 40 , 000	or more .14 ( Audience	participation . )15 MR . JOSEPH	PORTO :	Living 16 overcrowded	is	not	the	way	to go .	I	agree	with 17 you .18 So that ' s	the	whole	point . You	know ,19 there ' s	good	and	bad	in	this	system .20 And	to	say ,	well ,	don ' t	give	the 21 landlord	an	increase	of	2	percent	or	4	percent 22 or	6 percent	increases ,	well ,	that ' s	just	like 23 saying ,	well ,	how	would	you	like	it	if	we told 24 you	you	can ' t	get	a	raise .25 ( Audience	participation . )14 
2 MR . JOSEPH	PORTO :	I	know . That ' s3 another	problem	too .	That ' s not	necessarily	my 4 fault	because	I try	to	pay	everybody	to do 5 everything	as	possible .6 ( Audience	participation . )7 MR . JOSEPH	PORTO :	I ' m	also	working 8 on	the	building	six	days	a	week	and	that	is	my 9 only	source	of	income .10 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Do	you	have	a11 recommendation	for	us ?12 MR . JOSEPH	PORTO :	Excuse	me ?13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Do	you	have	a14 recommendation	for	us ?15 MR . JOSEPH	PORTO :	Recommendation ?16 Okay .	Yeah ,	sure .	Here ' s	a	recommendation .17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Go	ahead .18 MR . JOSEPH	PORTO :	I	think	it ' s	very 19 simple .20 I	think	that	increases	where	people 21 truly	have	a	hardship	can	be supplemented	in	a22 way	that	they	don ' t	have	to pay	the	full 23 increase .24 If they	truly	have	a	hardship ,	maybe 25 the	City	could	cough	up ,	you	know ,	half	of	it 2 
2 or	something	like	that ,	and	the	landlord	could 3 take	only	half	of it	if	they	truly	have	a4 hardship .5 But	if	it ' s	turned	around	and	they 6 have ,	you	know , three	or	four	wage	earners 7 living	in	the	home ,	then	I	don ' t	think	that 8 seriously	qualifies .	If	they ' re	just	taking 9 advantage	of	the	system	like	not	paying	rent 10 for	a	year	just	because	they	can ,	I	don ' t	think 11 that	person	qualifies	to	have	the	same	rights 12 as	a person	that	truly	has	a hardship .13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .14 MR . JOSEPH	PORTO :	That ' s	all .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .16 MR . JOSEPH	PORTO :	Thank	you .17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Alvin	Doyle .18 Mr . Doyle ,	is	he	here ?	There	he	is .19 Go	get	' em ,	Al .20 MR .

( Applause . )MR . ALVIN	DOYLE :	Stuyvesant	Town 
5 and	Peter	Cooper	Village	are	home	to	about 6 25 , 000	people ,	the	majority	of	which	are	rent 7 stabilized	tenants .8 Our	tenants ,	like	most	people	today ,9 are	struggling	to survive	in this	horrid 10 economy .	Some	of my	neighbors	have	suffered 11 layoffs	from	work	or	reduced	employment	hours 12 due	to	this	economic	crisis	not	of	their 13 making .14 Our	rent	stabilized	tenants	and	our 15 market	rate	neighbors ,	along	with	tenants	from 16 throughout	the	five	boroughs ,	form	the	economic 17 foundation	of	New	York	City .18 The	Mayor	and	City	Council	just 19 agreed	on	a	new	budget	for	$ 60	billion . The 20 money	from	this	budget ,	which	runs	the	greatest 21 City	in	the	world ,	comes	from	the	taxpayers .22 And	we	are	the	taxpayers .23 Many	years	ago , our	former	State 24 Senator	Roy	Goodman	called	Stuyvesant	Town	and 25 Peter	Cooper	Village	the	anchor	of	New	York .5 
2 We pay	our	rent ,	we	pay	our	taxes 3 and	we	pay	our	bills .4 The	same	cannot	be	said	for	some	of 5 the	big	landlords .	Stellar	Management ,	Tishman 6 Speyer	and	the	so - called	predatory	property 7 owners	are	willing	to	walk	away	from	their 8 responsibilities .9 Well ,	real	New	Yorkers	don ' t	walk 10 away	from	responsibilities . We	are	the	New 11 Yorkers	whose	work	and	taxes	enabled	this	town 12 to	become	this	great	City .	We don ' t	want	to	be 13 forced	out	of	our	homes	by	this	horrible 14 economy	and	we	don ' t	want	to be	forced	out	by 15 the	Rent	Guidelines	Board .16 Please	help	us taxpayers .

We	must	not	talk	emotion .21 And	the	facts	are :22 Number	one ,	if a	tenant	needs	a23 subsidy ,	it ' s	the	responsibility	of	the 24 government	to	provide	subsidies	to	tenants	in 25 need ,	not	the	responsibility	of	a	private 2 

2	owner .3
Number	two ,	the	subsidy	should	be 
4 based	on	the	tenant ' s	income .	If	the	tenant 5 makes	a	lot	of	money	above	a certain	point ,6 they ' re	not	entitled	to	a	subsidy .	So	the 7 tenant	must	reveal	all	their	income	if	they 8 want	a	subsidy .9 How	long	they ' ve	been	in	the 10 apartment	is	not	the	issue .11 The	next	thing : The	tenant ' s	rent 12 must	be	based	on dollars	per	room	per	month ,13 not	just	dollars	per	apartment .	A	person	who 14 lives	in	a	studio	should	not	pay	the	same	as	a15 person	who	lives	in	a	five - bedroom	apartment .	A16 person	who	lives	in	a	five - bedroom	apartment 17 should	pay	a	lot	more .18 And	the	facts	are	only	the	rich	have 19 benefited	by	rent	regulation .	The	poor	have 20 been	hurt .	Rent	regulation	has	wiped	out	the 21 competition	in	housing .22 The	one	and	only	time	to	prevent	the 23 problems	that	we ' re	facing	now ,	which	is the 24 shortage	of	housing	and	the	high	price	of 25 housing ,	was	in the	mid	1940 s	when	the	New	York 4 
2 State	Legislature	was	facing	the	sunset	of	rent 3 regulations .	They	didn ' t	have	the	guts	in the 4 mid - 1940 s	to	do what	was	in the	best	interest 5 of	the	State	of New	York .	They	did	what	was	in 6 their	own	best	interest	and	they	said	we ' ll 7 study	the	problem .	Sixty - five	years	later	they 8 don ' t	know	what ' s	going	on . They ' re	still 9 studying	the	problem .10 You	cannot	abolish	rent	regulations .11 If	you	abolish	rent	regulations	now ,	there 12 would	be	war	in the	streets .13 And	the	point	is	the	division 14 between	the	rich	and	the	poor	is	getting	wider .15 The	rich	always	benefit	by	rent	regulations 16 because	the	rich	had	the	best	housing .	The	poor 17 always	lost	under	rent	regulations	because	they 18 always	had	the	worst	housing .	That ' s	a	fact .19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .20 ( Audience	participation . )21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Just	to repeat 22 what ' s	going	to happen .23 Councilmember	Brewer	is	going	to 24 speak .25 And	then	actually	we	need	to	give 2 
2 the	stenographer	a	break .3 So when	she	finishes ,	we ' ll take	an 4 approximately	fifteen - minute	break	and	come 5 back .6 And	before ,	however ,	before	we 7 leave ,	I ' m	going	to	read	some	more	names	so	we 8 can	get	a	sense	of	who ' s	here	and	who ' s not 9 here .10 Go ahead .11 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	Thank 12 you , Mr .	Chairman .	I ' ll	be	very	brief .13 I ' ll	just	submit	my	testimony .14 I	am	Gale	Brewer	and	I	represent	the 15 Council	District	on	the	West	Side	and	the 16 northern	part	of Clinton .17 I	am	here	today	to	request	that	the 18 Rent	Guidelines	support	no	rent	increases ,19 particularly	for	residents	of Class	A	hotels ,20 Single	Room	Occupancy ,	Rooming	Houses ,	and	the 21 same	for	rent	regulated	tenants .22 ( Audience	participation . )23 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	We 24 really	want	you	to	freeze	the	rents .25 I	think	you	know	more	than	anybody 2 
2 else ,	the	Rent	Guidelines	knows	that	there	are 3 about	a	million	rent	stabilized	units	and	about 4 40 , 000	rent	controlled	-	that ' s	it	-	left	in 5 New	York	City .	And	in	Manhattan ,	it ' s	around 6 three	hundred	and	three ,	maybe	a	little	bit 7 more ,	thousand	rent	stabilized	units .8 I ' m here	to	say	that	I	understand 9 that	there	are	increases	that	have	taken	place 10 for	owners .	I	own	a	building .	I	don ' t	have	any 11 tenants ,	but	I	own	a	building .	I	know	what	the 12 mortgage	is .	I	know	what	the	insurance	is .	And 13 I	know	what	the	property	taxes	are ,	and	I	know 14 what	the	ConEd	bill	is ,	and	I	know	what	the 15 electrical	bill	is .16 And	I	can	say	that	in	today ' s	world 17 property	taxes	have	gone	up , but	the	cost	of 18 electricity	has	gone	down ,	the	cost	of	ConEd 19 has	gone	down .	You	could	weatherize ,	which 20 we ' ve done	in	our	building . You	can	get	a	lower 21 cost	mortgage .22 And	the	fact	of the	matter	is	in 23 most	of	the	buildings ,	at	least	in	Manhattan ,24 you	have	a	variety	of	kinds	of	units	in every 25 building .2 
2 You	have	some	rent	regulated .	You 3 might	have	some	rent	controlled .	You	definitely 4 have	some	market .	You	may	have	a	co - op , maybe	a5 condo	in	that	same	building .6 And	the	fact	of the	matter	is	these 7 buildings	are	now	very ,	very	multi - unit	in 8 terms	of	the	way	in	which	they	are	structured .9 So I	strongly	urge	you ,	although 10 we ' ve said	this	year	after	year	and	it	doesn ' t11 happen ,	that	you	think	about	particularly	no 12 rent	increases	where	there	are	a	multitude	of 13 incomes	coming	into	those	units	where	it is	not 14 just	rent	regulated .15 I	also	support	- -	I	know	Albany ,16 what ' s	going	on there	is	very	challenging .	But 17 Assemblymember	Rosenthal	and	other	tenant 18 advocates	in	the	New	York	State	Assembly ,	their 19 legislation	I	support	completely .	Obviously ,20 the	one	that	involves	vacancy	decontrol	is 21 something	that	I support .	Certainly	not	the 22 owners '	perspective ,	but	it certainly	is mine .23 I	want	to	say	that	in	the	last	two 24 years	we	have	had	on	the	West	Side	housing 25 clinics	for	small	owners	and	for	renters	every 2 
2 single	Wednesday	once	a	month .	We	have	thirty 3 to	forty	people , different	people ,4 unduplicated ,	people	from	Urban	Justice	and 5 from	Goddard	Riverside	and	private	attorneys 6 helping	people	with	a	multitude	of	problems .7 In some	cases	we ' re	able	to save	the 8 apartment ;	in	some	cases	we ' re	not .9 People	come	in with	whole	different 10 ways	in	which	regulated	rents	are	challenged ,11 in	my opinion	illegally ,	but	always	- -	people 12 need	housing .	And	I	also	feel	that	as	a City 13 policy	every	neighborhood	should	be	a	mixture 14 of	people	-	rich	people ,	middle - income	people 15 and	low - income	people .16 If you	get	rid	of	rent	regulation ,17 middle - income	families	in	this	City	will	not	be 18 part	of	our	neighborhoods .	They	are	the 19 backbone	of	our	neighborhoods .20 ( Audience	participation . )21 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	So	I ' m22 here	to	say	that	I	strongly	urge	no	rent 23 increase .24 I	know	that ' s	ridiculous	coming	from 25 me	representing	the	West	Side .	But	I	want	to 2 
2 make	it	clear	that	I	think	that	it	is	good	for 3 the	City .	I	think	it	is	a	way	to	keep	our 4 neighborhoods	safe	and	part	of	the	fabric	of 5 what	a	city	is	all	about .6 Thank	you	very	much .7 ( Audience	participation . )8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Councilmember 9 Brewer ,	I	just	have	a	question .10 Last	year	I	said	I	live	in your 11 district .	You	said	you	know	where	I	live .12 So we	had	testimony	earlier	from	a13 tenant	who	lives	in	an	SRO	in the	condo	unit 14 that	I	live	in , the	Park	Laurel ,	which	has	an 15 SRO	- -16 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	73 rd 17 Street .18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	at	the	bottom ,19 the	Y	SRO .20 And	that	clearly ,	at	least	in	my 21 mind ,	you	might	disagree	- -22 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	No ,	I23 agree .24 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	and	tell	me	if 25 you	do ,	is	what	we	want .	The	SRO	and	the	Y	is 2 
2 what	we	want .3 And	one	of	the	things	that	we ' ve 4 been	looking	for ,	and	we ' ve always	been	told 5 there ' s	no	good	SRO	landlord	and	- -6 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	No ,	I7 don ' t	think	that ' s	true .8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	they	are	all 9 going	to	disinvest .10 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	I	don ' t11 think	that ' s	true .12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	But	they ' re	all 13 going	to	disinvest .14 And	one	of	the	points	I ' ve made	over 15 the	years	is ,	and	we	have	been	very	supportive 16 of	the	proviso	for	the	people	who	are	trying	to 17 get	rid	of	the	SRO	tenant ,	the	classic	SRO 18 tenant .19 I	guess	my	question	is ,	doesn ' t	the 20 Y ,	which	is	an	owner	-	and	I think	we	can	all 21 agree	is	a	good	owner	-	and	trying	to	keep	SRO ,22 they ' ve	just	built	this	SRO	- -23 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	Yes .24 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	in	the	last 25 ten	years ,	shouldn ' t	the	Y	be able	to	get 2 
2 reasonable	rent	increases	from	its	tenants 3 because	they	are	a	responsible	SRO	owner ?4 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	I	think 5 in	the	Y ' s	case	- -	first	of all ,	it ' s	a6 non - profit ,	which	means	that	the	issue	with	the 7 Y	is that	it	has	a	variety	- as	I	understand 8 it , correct	me	if I ' m	wrong	-	residents .9 It has	people	who	are	guests .	It	has 10 people	who	are	permanent	residents .	And	it	is 11 obviously	a	building	with	other	kinds	of 12 income .13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Let	me	say	this .14 As far	as	I	know ,	because	I ' m15 President	of	our	condo ,	the	SRO	unit ,	the 16 inclusory	housing	unit	which	I	think	is what	it 17 is	called ,	- -18 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	Yes .19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	is	a separate 20 legal	entity .	Therefore ,	the	transient	tourist 21 from	France	- -22 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	Okay .23 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	who	I see	all 24 the	time	on	the	block ,	in	the	buses ,	are	not 25 affected .	They ' re in	a	separate	- -2 
2 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	They ' re 3 a	separate	unit . Okay .4 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Yes .5 So we ' re	really	talking	about	the 6 SRO , which	I	think	is	about	a	hundred	units .7 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	Okay .8 I	mean	I	think	that	models	like	that 9 could	make	sense ,	where	you	have	inclusionary 10 zoning	supplementing	sometimes	what	is	already 11 part	of	a	single	room	occupancy .12 But	the	problem	is	where	you	have	a13 situation	in	some	of	these	hotels	where	you 14 have	what	we	would	consider	the	illegal	hotels 15 next	to	permanent	tenants .	That ' s	a	bad	mixture 16 because	many	of the	hotel	guests	are	young .17 When	I	was	young ,	I	was	probably	drinking ,18 throwing	up .	It ' s	just	what	you	do	when	you ' re 19 young .20 And	the	fact	of the	matter	is	- -21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	We	are	going	to 22 strike	that	from	the	record	just	so	you	know .23 ( Laughter . )24 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	I	admit 25 it .2 
2 ( Laughter . )3 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	But	the 4 fact	of	the	matter	- -5 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Did	you	inhale ?6 That ' s	the	question .7 ( Laughter . )8 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	I	wish	I9 did	because	then	I	could	say	I	did ,	but	I	was 10 too	square .11 ( Laughter . )12 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	But	the 13 issue	is	when	you	have	the	individuals	who	are 14 both	young	next	to	people	who	are	permanent ,15 you	lose	the	affordable	housing	and	you	have	a16 mixture	of	cultures	that	doesn ' t	work .17 I	do	think	that	some	of	these	single 18 room	occupancies ,	and	rooming	houses	and 19 residential	hotels ,	we	need	to	come	up	with 20 some	HPD	or	other	program	to supplement	some	of 21 the	rents	because	it	is	a	challenge	for	the 22 owners .23 I	don ' t	think	the	answer ,	however ,24 is	bringing	in	illegal	hotel	guests .25 What	is	the	answer	is	for	some 2 
2 program .	And	I	have	been	pushing	like	Y does 3 where	they	have	an	inclusionary	zoning , where 4 there	is	something	to	help	with	the	underlying 5 costs .6 So I	do	think	that ' s	a	model	that 7 could	be	used	elsewhere .8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Just	to be	clear ,9 and	something	that	you	probably	should	look 10 into ,	he	came	really	complaining	that	the	Y11 does	not	need	income ,	and	based	largely	on 12 that ,	they	were	keeping	some	of	their	SRO	units 13 empty	he	said .14 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	Okay .	I15 will	- -16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	So	I	think	that ' s17 something	- -18 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	- -	look 19 at	that .20 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	- -	you	should 21 check	into	with	the	Y	because	it	seems	to me 22 they	shouldn ' t	be doing	that .23 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	I24 absolutely	agree	with	you .	Thank	you ,	Mr .25 Chairman .2 

2345678	testimony .910	you , Betty .11
CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .Thank	you .( Audience	participation . )MS . ADAMS :	I	have	a	question . CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Betty .MS . ADAMS :	Thank	you	for	your COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	Thank MS . ADAMS :	One	of	the	things	that 
12 we	wrestle	with	is	an	awful	lot	of	testimony 13 which	we ' ve	gotten	today	and	before	from	small 14 landlords	where	they	have	either	one	building 15 or	there ' s	a	few	buildings . They	cannot	compete 16 as	the	large	landowners	do	and	get	reduced 17 rates	for	fuel , electricity	and	all	the	rest .18 Do you	have	anything	to	share	with 19 us	along	those	lines ?20 COUNCILWOMAN	GALE	BREWER :	I21 certainly	live	on a	block	on both	sides	of	me 22 are	my	colleagues ,	some	of	whom	own	the 23 brownstones	and	some	of	whom	have	rent 24 regulated	and	some	of	them	have	market .25 And	I	think	in one	case	it ' s	a12 
2 regulated	and	a market	and	it ' s	balancing	it 3 out	because	the	market	is	paying	a	much	larger 4 share .	I	think	that ' s	okay .5 I	do	think	that	- -	I ' d	like	to	look 6 at	the	numbers	to see	how	many	of	the	small 7 owners	are	market	and	how	many	of	them	have 8 rent	regulation .9 My guess	is	in 2009 - 2010	there ' s	an 10 awful	lot	of	folks	who	have	market	and	not	a11 lot	with	regulated .	I ' d	like	to	look	at the 12 numbers .13 MS . ADAMS :	Okay .	Thank	you	very 14 much .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .16 MS .

SAMANTHA	PAIGE :	Thank	you	for 19 allowing	me	to	speak .20 It ' s	nothing	really	big .	But	I	thank 21 you	for	allowing	me	to	speak .22 My name	is	Samantha	Paige . I	reside 23 in	Brooklyn	and	I ' m	head	of the	tenants 24 association	for	420 - 17	Caton	Avenue .25 I	came	here	today	because	I heard 2 
2 about	the	increases	that	you	guys	were	talking 3 about	for	the	tenants	all	over ,	in	all	five 4 boroughs .	I	don ' t	think	that	is	correct .5 I	work	for	the	City ,	HHC ,	and	it	is 6 very	hard	to	afford	these	apartments .	A lot	of 7 these	apartments	are	raggity ,	cracks ,	tears ,8 holes ,	roaches , rats .	You	name	it ,	we	have	it .9 We are	paying	these	landlords	a	lot 10 of	money .	And	when	I	say	" a lot , "	I	mean	for	a11 one - bedroom	it	can	run	$ 1200	to	$ 1500	and 12 that ' s	in	your	worst	neighborhood .	They	are	not 13 investing	their	monies	back	into	the	property 14 because	right	now	where	I ' m living	at	we have 15 over	eight	hundred	violations ,	forty	apartments 16 in	the	building . Fifty	something	violations	are 17 in	my apartment	for	the	lead ,	holes	in	the 18 ceilings ,	holes	in	the	floors .19 I	don ' t	think	it ' s	correct . I	don ' t20 know	where	these	figures	are	coming	from	and 21 why	the	landlords	are	asking	for	so	much	money .22 But	it ' s	not	correct .	How	are	we	going	to 23 survive	here ?	How	are	we	going	to	survive	here ?24 Eventually	everyone	is	going	to	leave	and	those 25 that	can ' t	afford	to	leave	to go	somewhere	else 2 
2 will	live	on	the	streets .3 I	mean	I	don ' t understand	what ' s	the 4 picture ,	what	is the	big	picture	that	everyone 5 is	looking	at .	I mean	it ' s	not	hurting	no one 6 but	the	middle	class	people .7 It hurts	us .	It hurts	us .	It ' s	a8 shame	that	I	have	to	uproot	my	children	and 9 move	to	another	state ,	not	to another 10 apartment ,	but	to a	whole	other	state	to raise 11 my	children	so	that	they	can	have	the	nicer 12 things	that	other	children	have .	I	don ' t think 13 that ' s	correct .14 You	have	the	elderly	out	here	that 15 have	worked	for	years ,	years	in	New	York ,	as 16 well	as	myself . I ' ve	worked	for	years .	And	this 17 is	the	thanks	that	we	get .18 We pay	taxes .	We	do	things	the 19 proper	way .	And	this	is	all	that	Albany	and 20 Bloomberg	and	everyone	else	could	say	thank	you 21 but	no	thanks .	I don ' t	think	that ' s	correct .	I22 really	don ' t .23 This	will	be	my first	and	last	time 24 speaking	here .	But	hopefully	you	guys	will	look 25 at	the	bigger	picture .	We	can ' t	afford	this .2 
2 It ' s becoming	too	much	for	us .	It	really	is .	It 3 really	is .4 And	I	would	have	loved	to	raise	my 5 children	here ,	but	I	can ' t . I	can ' t	afford	it 6 anymore .	I ' ve	tried .	I ' ve	tried	affordable 7 housing .	They	say	they	have	it .	It	doesn ' t8 exist .9 First - time	homebuyers ,	it	doesn ' t10 exist .11 You	can ' t	afford	to	save	money 12 because	everything	goes	into	rent ,	and	every 13 time	you	look	up ,	you ' re	in the	courts	because 14 the	landlord	is not	making	appropriate	repairs 15 to	the	apartment	and	you	are	just	shelling	out 16 a	whole	lot	of	money	just	to move	over	and	over 17 and	over	again .18 Thank	you .19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .20 ( Applause . )21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Mr .	Berko ,	Joe 22 Berko .23 MR . JOE	BERKO :	Yes .24 Good	evening .25 My name	is	Joe	Berko .	Thank	you	very 2 
2 much	for	giving	me	this	opportunity	to	speak .3 I ' ll	be	brief . I	know	it ' s late .4 You ' ve	been	listening	to	a	lot	of	opinions	and 5 everybody	certainly	has	one .6 You	know ,	I ' m	a small - time	property 7 owner .	I ' ve	saved ,	worked	very	hard	to	buy 8 property .	I	bought	it	about	five	years	ago	and 9 I ' m not	going	to sit	here	and	say	that , you 10 know ,	I ' m	feeling	very	privileged .11 It ' s	a	very	interesting	game .	You 12 know ,	as	a	property	owner ,	I feel	a	lot	of 13 times	that	tenants	are	really	taking	advantage 14 of	the	empowerment	that	they ' re	getting . I ' m15 not	saying	that	it ' s	right	or wrong .	What	I	am 16 saying	is	that	it ' s	a	system	that ' s	been 17 designed	in	such	a	way	to	make	it	ultra 18 difficult	to	even	try	and	survive .19 I	don ' t	remember	when	was	the	last 20 time	I	pulled	a penny	out	of my	property	in	the 21 past	five	years .22 Most	of	my	tenants	are	rent 23 stabilized .	The	building	is just	a	few	blocks 24 away	from	here .25 Somebody	mentioned	that	he feels 2 
2 that	there	should	be	some	sort	of	a	justice 3 system	where	if a	tenant	is making	a	certain 4 amount	of	money , maybe	he ' s not	entitled	to ,5 you	know ,	pay	$ 450	or	$ 550	a month .	This	is 6 certainly	what	the	average	of my	tenants	are 7 paying .8 It ' s	a	great	building .	We	are	trying 9 to	do our	very	best	to	keep	it	in	great	shape .10 And	that ' s	pretty	much	it . We	have 11 only	a	couple	of - -	out	of	fifteen ,	we	have 12 only	two	free	market	tenants .	Usually	from	what 13 I	see ,	those	apartments	are	either	vacant ,	and 14 if	they ' re	not	vacant ,	they ' re	occupied , you 15 know ,	I ' m	not	leasing	them	out	to	any	ultra 16 rich	New	Yorkers .	They	are	mainly	just	like	me ,17 young ,	working	class ,	you	know ,	trying	to make 18 it	type	of	young	individuals .19 So I	don ' t	for	one ,	as	a	small 20 property	owner , I	don ' t	see	the	disparity 21 between ,	you	know ,	my	rent	stabilized	tenants ,22 which	are	pretty	much	around	my	age ,	maybe	a23 little	bit	older ,	some	of	them ,	making	very 24 similar	money	to what	I ' m	making ,	however ,25 getting	the	privilege	of	paying	about	$ 500	or 2 
2 $ 600	a	month .3 And	that ' s	kind	of	like	where	I ' m4 coming	from .5 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .6 MR . JOE	BERKO :	I	really	wanted	to 7 thank	you .8 I	wanted	to	mention	that ,	you	know ,9 last	year	the	increases	that	we	have	received	I10 believe	they ' re just .	I	believe	they	were 11 helpful .12 ( Audience	participation . )13 MR . JOE	BERKO :	And	if	we can	get 14 the	same	increases	this	year ,	I	think	it will 15 be	- -	again ,	it will	be	very	just .16 We have	to	deal	with	things .	I17 cannot	call	the	bank	and	say ,	you	know , I18 cannot	afford	to pay	my	mortgage	this	month .19 That ' s	not	a	conversation	I can	have	with	my 20 banker .	It ' s	not	a	conversation	I	can	have	with 21 the	gas	company	or	the	oil	company	or	the 22 utilities	company .	Everybody	expects	to get 23 paid .	They	are	entitled	to	a raise	or	to 24 whatever	raises	that	they	are	making .25 And	I	feel	that	the	property	owner ,2 
2 who	is	trying	to do	everything	right ,	is 3 entitled	to	the	same	rights .4 So this	evening	I	would	like	to	ask 5 you	to	keep	true	to	how ,	you	know ,	the	economy 6 is . And	things	are	getting	more	and	more 7 expensive	for	everyone .8 And	that ' s	why	to	even	the	playing 9 field	out .10 I	really	want	to	thank	you	for	your 11 time	and	have	a nice	evening .12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .13 ( Applause . )14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Mr .	Pimenetal .15 A	VOICE :	He ' s coming .16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	He ' s	coming ?	He ' s17 out	there .18 Rodger	Parsons	and	then	we ' ll	come 19 to	Mr .	Pimenetal .20 Rodger	Parsons .21 MR . RODGER	PARSONS :	Ladies	and 22 gentlemen	of	the	Board :23 Thank	you	for	giving	me	this 24 opportunity	to	speak .25 An inflated	speculative	real	estate 2 
2 market	has	caused	rents	to	skyrocket	in New 3 York	City .	This	market	mania	has	led	to the 4 demolition	of	middle - income	buildings ,5 especially	in	Manhattan ,	as developers	try	to 6 outdo	themselves	in	creating	some	of	the	most 7 expensive	housing	in	the	world .8 And	where	does	this	leave	most	New 9 Yorkers	looking	for	affordable	housing ? No 10 where .11 We hear	in	the	hallowed	halls	of 12 real	estate	greed	that	the	day	of	the	$ 2000	or 13 $ 3000	a	month	apartment	is	upon	us .	But	if 14 people	are	only	supposed	to put	forth	one 15 quarter	of	their	income	toward	rent ,	how	many 16 are	making	the	$ 96 , 000	or	$ 144 , 000	a	year	and 17 can	afford	this	high - priced	housing ?18 Tenants	should	not	be	asked	to 19 support	the	bad	business	choices	of	small ,20 medium	or	large	landlords .	If you	cannot	afford 21 to	be in	the	landlord	business ,	you	should	get 22 out .23 ( Audience	participation . )24 MR . RODGER	PARSONS :	The	banking 25 crisis ,	the	Wall	Street	crash ,	the	demise	of 2 
2 the	US	auto	industry ,	all	parts	of	a	larger 3 economic	market	where	sensibility	was	replaced 4 by	speculation	and	avarice .5 All	these	market - driven	models 6 collapsed	because	no	one	had	the	sense	to limit 7 risk	and	control	costs .	This	is	not	the	time	to 8 increase	rents	unless	this	Rent	Guidelines 9 Board	is	interested	in	creating	massive 10 homelessness .	And	that ' s	the	least	of	it ,11 especially	for	older	tenants .12 The	number	of	elderly	tenants	living 13 in	rent - regulated	apartments	is	in	the 14 thousands .	Most	of	these	people	live	on fixed 15 incomes	and	are	struggling	to survive .16 Shall	we	throw	our	senior	citizens 17 into	the	street	to	improve	some	landlord ' s18 bottomline ?19 ( Audience	participation . )20 MR . RODGER	PARSONS :	The	SCRIE 21 program	does	not	begin	to	address	the	number	of 22 people	who	will	lose	their	homes	if	rents	are 23 increased	by	a	single	percent .	These	are	hard 24 times .	This	is	not	the	time	to	increase	rent .25 In fact ,	it ' s	time	to	hold	Mayor 2 
2 Bloomberg	accountable	for	the	actions	of the 3 members	of	the	Rent	Guidelines	Board	who	he 4 appointed	- -5 ( Audience	participation . )6 MR . RODGER	PARSONS :	- -	knowing 7 their	position	on these	matters .	For	the	Mayor 8 to	claim	in	his	campaign	that	he	is	a	friend	of 9 the	middle	class ,	and	then	appoint	members	that 10 he	knew	would	vote	against	the	interests	of	the 11 middle	class	is duplicitous	at	best .12 It ' s	time	to	reign	in	rents .	And	the 13 Members	of	the	Rent	Guidelines	Board	should 14 hold	the	line	and	pass	no	increases	in	this 15 time	of	economic	hardship .16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you 17 MR . RODGER	PARSONS :	Thank	you .18 ( Audience	participation . )19CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Mr .	Pimenetal ,20are	you in the	room ?21A	VOICE :	He ' s here .22CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .	Come	on 23down .24Your	friend	has	been	looking	out	for 25you .
2 MR . CALEB	PIMENETAL :	Thank	God !3 Hi ! My	name	is Caleb ,	and	I live	in 4 a	small	room	at 358	West	51 st Street .	It is	an 5 SRO .6 A	VOICE :	Could	you	speak	into	the 7 mike ,	please .8 MR . CALEB	PIMENETAL :	Okay .9 It is	an	SRO	rent	stabilized .	And	I10 share	that	room	in	the	hallway .11 There	is	no	mailbox .	There	is	no 12 bell .	The	room	- -	vestibule	is	very	dirty .	And 13 I	think	they	just	bought	the	building .14 The	owner	before	they	never 15 increased .	I	think	like	they	know	the 16 ( unintelligible . )	But	this	new	owner	they	just 17 increase	right	away	even	though	it ' s	not	full 18 rented ,	a	lot	of people	is	not	there	and 19 warehouse .20 And	they	are	trying	to	buy	people 21 out , like	one	year	rent	free	and	$ 2000 . You 22 know ,	you	cannot	make	a	living	anywhere	with 23 this	kind	of	money .	I	think	they	just	want	to 24 leave	every	art , every	people	who	is	- - you 25 know ,	you	got	to understand	that	most	of the 2 
2 people	who	are	living	in	a	room	they ' re 3 probably	the	art	or	somebody	who	is	- -	have	a4 hard	time .5 And	last	year	they	increased	the 6 rent	right	away	although	they ' re	not	supposed 7 to .8 I	think	they	deserve	- -	I	mean	not 9 everybody ,	but	circumstances	like	that , there ' s10 a	lot	of	people	who	is	leaving	a	small	room .11 And	I	think	they	deserve	like	they	should	not 12 increase ,	specifically	in	this	time	that	- -13 most	people	is	just	pay	rent .	They	work	very 14 hard	basically	to pay	rent .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .16 MR . CALEB	PIMENETAL :	You ' re 17 welcome .18 ( Applause . )19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Roy	Phillips .20 MR . ROY	PHILLIPS :	Yes .21 My name	is	Roy	Phillips	and	I	reside 22 at	308	West	94 th Street .23 I ' ve	been	in	that	area	since	about 24 1994 .	When	I	moved	there ,	I moved	into	308	- -25 306	West	94 th ,	which	is	now	an	apartment	they 2 
2 are	renting	out	for	transients .3 I ' m having	a	difficult	time	because 4 of	the	fact	that	when	I	first	moved	there ,	I5 moved	there	from	a	shelter	into	an	alcohol 6 program .	And	I	was	told	that	as	long	as I	stay 7 there ,	that	my	rent	wouldn ' t increase 8 regardless	if	I got	a	job ,	which	I	have	now .9 And	my	rent	has	increased	four 10 hundred	percent . They	kicked	me	out	of	306	to 11 308	and	it	went	from	$ 200	to $ 500 .12 I	was	kind	of	like ,	really	like 13 frightened	to	even	say	something .	And	I talked 14 to	some	people	and	they	said	that	I	should	show 15 up	here .16 I	see	a	lot	of things	going	on	up 17 there .	I	don ' t	know	too	much	about	numbers ,	but 18 what	I	do ,	that	if	I	was	a	landlord	and	I	had 19 some	empty	rooms	in	the	building	that	I own ,	I20 should	rent	them	out .21 I	live	on	the	seventh	floor	of	308 22 and	there	are	eight	empty	apartments	in that 23 building .	And	what	they	have	done ,	they	have 24 stored	certain	things	in	there .	So	they	are	not 25 renting	those	rooms	out	to	anyone .	And	I live 2 

2	in	an SRO .3
I	also	know	that	there ' s	something ,
4 and	people	are	here ,	landlords	are	talking 5 about	a	rent	increase .	I	think	that	for	me 6 looking	at	certain	things	that	if	they	use	a7 business	approach	to	certain	things ,	I	don ' t8 know	if	they	should	be	here	asking	for	any	type 9 of	increase	if	they	do	the	right	thing	here .10 We also	have	in that	building	a11 laundry	room ,	a beautiful	laundry	room , six 12 washers ,	six	dryers .	What	I ' d	look	at	if I	was 13 a	landlord ,	to	make	sure	that	the	tenants	were 14 able	to	use	them ,	that	they	keep	running .	I	go 15 down	there	and	use	them ,	the	washers	are	broke ,16 the	dryers	are	broke .	So	I	would	have	to take 17 my	money	up	the	street .18 If I	was	a	landlord	and	I	was	using 19 a	business	approach ,	I	would	make	sure	that 20 they	were	operable ,	that	the	people	in	that 21 building	would	be able	to	use	them .	That	way	I22 wouldn ' t	be	here	today	asking	for	an	increase .23 I	would	be	able	to	use	certain	business 24 approaches	and	establish	my building	the	way	it 25 should	be	instead	of	coming	here ,	embarrassing 4 
2 people	with	all	of	these	things	here .3 I	don ' t	know	numbers ,	but	I do	know 4 that	I	see	things	that	is	done	really	wrong	in 5 my	hotel .6 They ' re	making	a	lot	of	money	across 7 the	street	there .	I	see	people	coming	in and 8 out . My	building ,	308 ,	is	completely	empty	and 9 they ' re	talking	about	a	rent	increase .	I can ' t10 afford	it ,	even	though	I	have	a	job	now .11 And	I	think	that ' s	why	they ' re 12 raising	my	rents	so	frequently ,	from	$ 200	to 13 $ 500	in	the	last	three	years .14 And	I	think	it ' s	very	unfair	and	I15 just	needed	to	be here	to	say	that .16 Thank	you	for	letting	me	talk	to 17 you .18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	put	on	a19 sheet	Goddard	Riverside	SRO	Law	Project . Are 20 they	helping	you ?21 MR . ROY	PHILLIPS :	Well ,	I just 22 started	talking	to	them .	So I	have	an 23 appointment	on	Thursday .24 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Good .	Okay .	Thank 25 you .2 

234	you .56789
MR . ROY	PHILLIPS :	Yes .CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	They	can	help ( Audience		participation . ) CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Hector	Rivera . MR . HECTOR		RIVERA :		Okay .Good	evening !My name	Hector	Rivera .	I ' m a
10 community	organizer	at	Pratt	Area	Community 11 Council	and	I	am also	a	rent	stabilized	tenant .12 I	will	start	with	Pratt	Area 13 Community	Council .14 As a	community	organizer	there ,15 everyday ,	Monday	through	Friday ,	we	have 16 tenants	coming	into	our	office	with	a	lot	of 17 issues .	And	one	of	them	is	their	rent ,	is it	a18 legal	rent ,	is	it a	fabricated	rent ,	is the 19 increase	the	correct	amount .20 And	what ' s	happening	is	that	they 21 are	falling	behind	with	their	rent	due	to the 22 decisions	you	guys	come	up	about	every	June .23 The	increases	are	tremendous .	Last 24 year ' s	increases	were	an	example .	That	$ 85	for 25 rents	that	are	less	than	$ 1000 ,	that	is a	big 10 
2 burden	for	senior	citizens	in our	area , Central 3 Brooklyn ,	especially	our	handicapped	too	who 4 are	living	on	a fixed	income .	Any	increases 5 this	June	that	you	guys	come	about	next	Tuesday 6 will	be	a	tremendous	blow	for	them	again ,7 including	me ,	because	I	fit	in	that	category 8 too . My	rent	is less	than	$ 1000	and	your 9 decision	last	year	affected	me .10 And	what	I ' m	asking	for	is zero 11 increase ,	to	freeze	rents	for	these	people .12 I ' m in	pretty	good	standing	at	the 13 moment ,	but	I	cannot	afford	the	increases	every 14 year .	This	has	been	going	on for	a	number	of 15 years ,	and	every	June	is	the	same	thing .16 Look	around .	The	room	is	empty	right 17 now . But	you	know	who	is	missing	out	here ?	Our 18 seniors .	They ' re not	going	to be	here	to listen 19 to	the	same	story	every	June .	Every	June ,	the 20 same ,	same	story .21 And	then	when	it	comes	the	vote ,22 who ' s	happy ?	The	landlords .23 Go to	my	neighborhood .	See	who	has 24 benefited	from	the	increases .25 And	as	a	rent	stabilized	tenant ,	I2 
2 tell	you ,	and	I can	relate	to most	of	these 3 guys	here ,	right	now	my	landlord	is	a	slumlord .4 And	any	increase	that	he	gets	is	not 5 acceptable .	I	personally	feel	that	he	should 6 not	get	one	cent .	There ' s	rats	in	the	building ,7 there	are	cockroaches	in	the	buildings	and	no 8 intercom	service .	You	think	he	deserves	a9 penny ?10 I	understand	about	the	small 11 homeowners .	That	I	understand .12 But	when	you	have	buildings	of	six 13 units	or	more	and	you	are	continuing	purchasing 14 properties	in	a neighborhood ,	they	should	not 15 deserve	an	increase .16 So I	am	asking	you	guys	to go	home 17 tonight	and	until	Tuesday	think	about	what	you 18 heard	here	tonight	from	our	seniors ,	from	our 19 landlords ,	whatever ,	and	just	think	who	has	the 20 point .21 Any	increase	Tuesday	is	going	to 22 hurt	a	lot	of	people .	Just	think	about	that .23 And	have	a	conscience .24 Thank	you ,	and	you	guys	have	a	good 25 night .2 
2 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .3 ( Audience	participation . )4 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Lucille 5 Carrasquero .6 I ' m going	to	read	some	additional 7 names	so	you	know	you ' re	next .8 After	Lucille	is :9 Natasha	Missick ;10 Claire	McGivney ;	and 11 Dorothea	Fogey .12 MS . LUCILLE	CARRASQUERO :	Members	of 13 the	Board :14 I	am	Lucille	Carrasquero	and 15 Chairperson	of	the	Cooper	Square	Committee .	I ' m16 here	to	ask	the	Rent	Guidelines	Board	to vote 17 for	a	rent	freeze	this	year .18 Our	organization	has	seen	a great 19 deal	of	deregulation	of	rent	stabilized	housing 20 in	recent	years . Only	about	forty	percent	of 21 apartments	on	the	Lower	East	Side	are	now	rent 22 stabilized .23 Landlords	are	deregulating 24 apartments	through	a	variety	of	practices ,	both 25 legal	and	illegal .	These	landlords	are	making 2 
2 huge	profits	on the	deregulated	apartments .	You 3 should	take	this	into	account	when	you	vote 4 this	year .5 We know	of	many	15	to	20 - unit 6 buildings	that	have	been	almost	entirely 7 deregulated ,	with	the	exception	of	just	a8 handful	of	apartments .9 There	has	been	considerable 10 harassment	of	long - term	lower - income	and 11 lower - rent	tenants ,	and	it	is ongoing .	Just 12 because	someone	has	lived	in their	apartment 13 for	twenty	years	and	has	a	below	market	rent ,14 they	should	not	be	made	to	feel	like	they	are 15 freeloaders .16 People	who	bought	their	own	homes 17 twenty	years	ago	for	a	cheap	price	enjoy	the 18 benefits	of	below	market	housing	costs . Why 19 should	long - term	tenants	be made	to	feel	like 20 they ' re	benefiting	at	the	expense	of	building 21 owners ?22 ( Audience	participation . )23 MS . LUCILLE	CARRASQUERO :	In	a	City 24 where	the	supply	of	affordable ,	subsidized 25 housing	is	shrinking ,	the	Rent	Guidelines	Board 2 
2 needs	to	begin	to seriously	look	at	its	role	in 3 preserving	a	diverse ,	mixed - income	population .4 Our	City	needs	- -5 ( Applause . )6 MS . LUCILLE	CARRASQUERO :	Our	City 7 needs	to	be	able	to	house	teachers ,	government 8 workers ,	artists ,	construction	workers , nurses 9 and	home	health	attendants , as	well	as 10 corporate	executives .11 ( Applause . )12 MS . LUCILLE	CARRASQUERO :	I ask	the 13 Board	to	bear	in mind	that	tenants	are 14 struggling	in	the	current	economic	recession .15 Landlords	who	overpaid	for	their 16 buildings	should	not	be	getting	a	bailout	this 17 year .	The	tenants	need	a	bailout	in	the	form	of 18 a	rent	freeze .19 I	thank	you	for	your	consideration .20 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .21 ( Audience	participation . )22 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Natasha	Missick ,23 is	that	you ?24 MS . NATASHA	MISSICK :	Yes .25 Hi ! I ' m	Natasha	Missick .2 
2 I ' m here	as	a	tenant .	I	live	in	a3 rent	stabilized	apartment .	I pay	under	$ 1000	a4 month .5 The	increases	last	year	really 6 affected	me .	I ' m paying	nearly	fifty	percent	of 7 my	income	in	rent .8 We see	what ' s	happening	with	the 9 economy .	And	I	agree	with	most	of	what	the 10 other	tenants	have	said	about	preserving	the 11 diversity	in	New	York	City	and	about	just	how 12 everybody	is	struggling .	There ' s	a	loss	of 13 jobs .14 And	I	really	wanted	to	ask	what	it 15 would	take	for	the	Board	to vote	differently 16 than	you ' ve	been	voting	for	the	past	several 17 years .18 ( Audience	participation . )19 MS . NATASHA	MISSICK :	People	have 20 come	and	they ' ve presented	different 21 statistics ,	and	then	you ' ve come	back	with ,22 well ,	let ' s	remove	Manhattan	from	the	scenario .23 But	Manhattan	is	a	big	part	of	the 24 scenario .	And	a lot	of	people ,	most	people	in 25 New	York	City	are	renters .	So what	would	it 2 
2 take	for	you	to give	us	a	break ?3 ( Audience	participation . )4 MS . NATASHA	MISSICK :	I	mean	it 5 seems	like	you	guys	basically	end	up 6 representing	the	interests	of the	landlords 7 every	single	year .8 ( Audience	participation . )9 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Any	additional 10 testimony ?11 ( No response . )12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .13 Claire	McGivney .14 ( No response . )15 MS . CLAIRE	McGIVNEY :	Okay .16 Hi !	Good	evening .17 Mr . Markus ,	I	last	spoke	with	you 18 when	I	was	here	at	Cooper	Union	speaking	and 19 you	asked	me	a	question .20 You	said :	How	many	vacancies	where 21 you	live ?22 At that	time	there	were	ten .	I	live 23 in	an SRO	for	fourteen	years ,	152	West	14 th 24 Street .25 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	lived	or	you 2 

2	live ?3
MS . CLAIRE	McGIVNEY :	I	live .	Well ,
4 sort	of	lived .	We were	vacant ,	a	full	vacancy 5 by	the	DOB	because	our	landlord	ignored	a	City 6 violation	to	fix	the	facade . So	now	it ' s a7 hundred	percent	vacant .8 And	due	to	this ,	I	have	been 9 homeless	and	other	tenants . And	the	vacancy	has 10 been	a	nightmare :	A	night	at the	Y ,	I	got	a	car 11 with	my	bags ,	and	they	sent	me	to	something 12 called	a	Yale ,	the	City ,	a	Yale	hotel .	I13 associate	it	with	New	Haven , like	Yale 14 University .15 I	have	walked	and	I	tell	you	I	was 16 frightened	to	death .	And	the	man	showed	me	a17 room	and	it	had	roaches	on	the	door	and	a	bed 18 half	unmade .	Of course ,	I	left .	I	called 19 someone	from	work .20 I	have	lived	here ,	there	and 21 everywhere .	It	is a	horrible	thing .	My	cat	is 22 in	New	Jersey	with	family ,	far	out	in	New 23 Jersey .	My	computer ,	my	stuff	is	all	over	the 24 place .25 I	still	maintain	my	job ,	but	it ' s4 
2 difficult	because	I	don ' t	know	where	to go .3 I	went	to	Gold	Street	and	they	said 4 we ' re going	to	find	you	permanent	housing .	I5 still	await	that .	I	spoke	with	a	Ms .	Barone 6 this	morning .	She	said ,	oh , I ' ll	have	someone 7 call	you	back	about	permanent	housing .8 The	landlord ,	Stanley	Wasserman ,	has 9 been	so	negligent	and	has	so wrongly	treated 10 the	tenants .	I	put	my	hard - earned	savings	into 11 fixing	a	120	square	foot	room ,	had	the	floor 12 leveled ,	a	brand	new	ceramic	tile ,	a	stainless 13 steel	bar	sink . You	name	it I	did	it	in that 14 one	room	for	fourteen	years , and	worked , and 15 donated	my	time .16 I ' m not	perfect	but	I ' m	a	good 17 person .	And	if	anyone	has	a house - sit	for	the 18 summer	here	in	the	City ,	I ' m here .	I	need 19 housing .20 That ' s	all	I	can	say .21 And	they	do	not	deserve	an increase ,22 not	my	landlord , believe	me .23 And	I	miss	my	cat .24 ( Audience	participation . )25 MS .

You	know ,	so - -	I20 can ' t	stand	filth .21 MS . HOLDER :	Is	anybody	working 22 with	you	right	now ?23 MS . CLAIRE	McGIVNEY :	I	went	to 24 housing	and	they	took	me	aside	and	said	they 25 are	going	to	get	permanent	housing	for	me .2 
2 And	I	spoke	with	a	Ms .	Barone	today 3 again .	She	said	call	back	in a	week .	I	did .	I4 spoke	with	her	today	before	coming	here . And 5 she	said	someone	will	call	you	back	today .6 Well ,	they	leave	four .	There	is	no 7 call .8 I	just	want	a	place	to	live .	It ' s9 been	hell	living	in	that	SRO .

I	said	welcome	to	affordable	housing .	My 14 place	could	be	in a	magazine .	But	it ' s	gone .15 That ' s	all	I	had .	I	did	want	to	stay	there .16 Where	was	I	going	to	go ?17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .18 MS . HOLDER :	Thank	you .19 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Let	us	know 20 what ' s	happening .

20 rent	stabilized	tenant	and	a senior	citizen .21 Unfortunately , I	was	$ 50	over	the 22 limit	to	qualify	for	SCRIE . So	I	got	hit	with 23 that	$ 85	last	year .24 By increasing	it	$ 85 ,	I	can ' t	take 25 one	of	my	medications .	And	I work .	I	work 20 
2 part - time	in	Housing	Court . I ' m	seeing	more	and 3 more	people	who	can ' t	pay	the	$ 85 .	I	don ' t	know 4 where	you	got	that	number	last	year ,	but	it	was 5 crazy .	And	you	had	better	not	do	it	this	year 6 because	there	are	going	to	be more	and	more 7 evictions	and	more	and	more	people	homeless	and 8 they	have	nowhere	to	go .9 Have	a	heart !	Give	the	tenants	a10 break .11 You	always	feel	sorry	for	the	poor 12 landlords .	I	never	see	my	landlord	here . My 13 landlord	is	the	same	one	that	owns	the	SRO	that 14 collapsed .	So	you	know	he ' s not	doing	a good 15 job .16 But	I	can ' t	afford	to	move	anywhere .17 So , please ,	keep	the	increases	low .18 Actually	zero	would	be	a	nice	number .19 Thank	you .20 ( Applause . )21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you ,	Susan .22 Mr .

2 MR . JIMMY	McMILAN :	Good	afternoon .3 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Good	afternoon 4 MR . JIMMY	McMILAN :	My	voice	is	a5 little	hoarse .	I ' m	running	for	Mayor	of the 6 City	of	New	York	to	replace	Bloomberg .	So you 7 got	to	forgive	me .	I	got	to make	it	a	little 8 short .9 I ' m here	to	plead	to	the	Board 10 tonight	because	we	have	a	crummy	City	Council 11 and	a	crummy	State	Legislature .12 Because	of	President	Barack	Obama ' s13 plan	he	put	into	effect ,	and	they	are	busy 14 fighting	in	Albany ,	the	stimulus	and	the 15 bailout ,	and	now	we ' re	fifty	percent	owners	of 16 General	Motors , I ' m	asking	the	Board	to freeze 17 rent ,	to	be	patient	until	after	the	Council 18 stops	fighting	- -	I	mean	the	State	Assembly 19 stop	fighting .20 Because	we	are	now	fifty	percent	of 21 General	Motors , and	between	the	bailout	and	the 22 stimulus ,	we	all	put	out	$ 6000	combined , which 23 means	that	the	landlord	shouldn ' t	go	into 24 foreclosure ,	they	shouldn ' t complain	about 25 being	there	because	they ' re owners	like	us .2 
2 As soon	as	the	plan	is	worked	out ,3 we	all	will	benefit	from	what	the	President	has 4 done .5 This	City	Council	and	the	Assembly 6 are	those	who	were	in	office	when	George	Bush 7 was	there .8 So I ' m	only	coming	to	plead	with	you 9 all , and	that ' s you	ought	just	be	patient	and 10 freeze	it	until	the	President ' s	plan ,	we could 11 feel	the	effects	of	the	President ' s	plan .12 Because	the	people	that	I ' m here	to 13 represent	don ' t have	it	to	pay	rent .	This	is 14 additional	money .	They	can ' t afford	breakfast ,15 lunch	or	dinner . When	they	buy	- -	get	to buy 16 body	medication , they	can ' t afford	to	get	it .17 But	when	they	do get	it ,	they	can ' t	eat 18 breakfast ,	lunch	and	dinner	after .	They	can ' t19 afford	it .20 But	I ' m	not	here	to	argue	about 21 anything	other	than	to	ask	the	Board	here	- -22 I ' ve been	here	before	- -	and	the	things	that	I23 have	mentioned	before ,	I ' m	glad	to	hear	that 24 City	Council	and	other	people	are	beginning	to 25 say	it .2 
2 I ' ve	been	calling	for	a	rent	freeze 3 for	the	past	six	years .	And	I ' m	hoping	that	a4 rent	freeze	- -	no one	could	see	it	as	I ' ve	seen 5 it	as an	undercover	investigator ,	an 6 independent	investigator ,	which	I	have	found	so 7 many	things	wrong	as	the	landlord	raise	the 8 rent	with	violations .	You	allow	that	to happen .9 If you	do	decide	to	raise	the	rent ,10 make	sure	that	the	landlords	cannot	accept	- -11 cannot	be	benefitted	from	these	increases ,12 those	with	violations .13 And	there	are	a lot	of	other	things 14 wrong	and	I ' ll	be back	to	discuss	those .15 But	right	now	my	voice	is	about 16 gone .17 And	I	ask	you	to	freeze	rent	on	the 18 behalf .	Give	the	President ' s plan	to	work ,	the 19 bailout	and	the	stimulus .20 And	I ' m	happy	to	be	here	today .	Good 21 to	see	Steve	and	everyone	else	here .	Good	to 22 see	all	of	you , and	also	you	too	Marvin .23 Thank	you .24 Do what	is	right	for	the	people	and 25 give	the	President ' s	plan	a chance	to	work .2

DIANE	WESTON :	Hello !	Hello ,23 once	again .24 It ' s	been	a	few	years .25 I ' m Diane	Weston .	I	live	on the 6 
2 Upper	East	Side . I ' m	in	Jessica	Lapin ' s area .3 I	live	on	East	81 st	Street , 515 .	It 4 seems	like	I ' m	the	only	one	who	ever	comes	out 5 of	my door	to	testify ,	to	get	involved	in the 6 neighborhood .	I was	with	John	Sullivan	for 7 many ,	many	years ,	East	Side	Tenants	Coalition ,8 when	we	had	it . But	we	don ' t have	it	anymore .9 We	have	another	one .10 Okay .11 What	I	want	to say	is	that	I ' ve	been 12 in	court	for	over	eight	years .13 Number	one ,	I	have	a	landlord	who 14 took	over	the	building	in	1999	in	April . He	is 15 a	slumlord .16 I	got	through	with	court	not	too 17 long	ago .	I	had	an	illegal	inspection	on the 18 lawyer ' s	side ,	of course .	It would	have	to	be 19 the	lawyer ' s	side .	But	on	the	side	of	EIS	and 20 Lenox	Hill	Neighborhood	House ,	who	has 21 represented	me	in court	quite	a	few	times ,	and 22 they	tried	screwing	me	up	left	and	right ,	but	I23 came	up	with	every	piece	of documentation	and 24 pictures	needed .25 We also	had	a	super	who	fixed	- -	for 2 
2 many	years	he ' s been	the	super	of	our	building ,3 not	anymore .	He ' s	a	delivery	boy	today . Which 4 goes	to	show	you	that	he	was	never	qualified	in 5 the	first	place	to	be	a	super .	All	the	repairs 6 were	not	done	properly .7 After	there	was	a	MCI	increase	in 8 the	building ,	my apartment	was	with	black	paper 9 bags	and	tape ,	it was	just	all	taped	up . I10 didn ' t	get	it	fixed	until ,	oh ,	almost	five 11 years	later .	And	it	was	bogus .12 I	went	to	court .	My	repair	work	has 13 not	been	complied	with .	I	still	get	my	- -	I	get 14 roaches ,	but	I	know	how	to	deal	with	it . They 15 don ' t	scare	me .16 I ' m speaking	to you	tonight	because 17 you ' ve	seen	my	face	before , you ' ve	heard	me 18 before .	And	I	know	where	all	of	you	guys	are 19 coming	from .20 I ' ve	been	on	the	streets	long	enough 21 to	know	where	all	you	guys	are	coming	from 22 because	corporations	control	us .23 There	are	very	few	people	I ' m24 speaking	to	who	are	not	pro - landlord .	I can 25 only	think	of	one	person	right	now	who	is for 2 
2 the	tenants .3 And	as	far	as	what	we	are	receiving ,4 I	live	without	heat .	I ' m	sure	a	lot	of	people 5 in	the	building	live	without	heat .	I	lived 6 without	it	for	eight	years . I	bundled	up .	I7 went	to	court	in what	I	was	wearing	the	day 8 before	when	I	had	the	first	judge	at	111	Centre 9 Street .10 I	don ' t	feel	that	these	landlords 11 deserve	an	increase .	I	believe	that	we	need	our 12 rents	frozen ,	even	though	right	now	I	have 13 DRIE .	I	got	it .14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .15 MS . DIANE	WESTON :	But	I	have	more 16 to	say .17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Well ,	you ' re 18 done .19 MS . DIANE	WESTON :	Why	am	I done ?20 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Because	your	time 21 is	up .22 MS .

2 else	that	you	wanted	to	tell	us ?3 MS . DIANE	WESTON :	We	are	not 4 getting	our	needs	done	properly .5 As a	matter	of fact ,	the	pavement	in 6 front	of	the	building	was	fixed	by	the	former 7 super .	There	was	never	- -	the	Department	of 8 Buildings ,	there	was	never	what	you	call	a	sign 9 in	front	of	the	building	when	the	work	was 10 being	done	in	February	of	2007	or	2008 . I	have 11 pictures .	And	I took	pictures	when	no	one	was 12 around .	I	have	pictures	of	everything .13 I	have	graffiti	in	front	of the 14 building .	It	says	rat ,	r - a - t .15 MS .

6 one	who	comes	out	because	f - e - a - r	is	what	keeps 7 them	in .8 And	if	f - e - a - r didn ' t	keep	them	in 9 and	we	took	a	third	action	lawsuit	in	1999 ,	the 10 building	would	be different	today .11 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .

JUDY	FRANK :	Hello !16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Go	ahead .17 Judy	Frank ,	go ahead .	Thank	you .18 MS . JUDY	FRANK :	I	just	want	to 19 speak	for	those	tenants	who	pay	for	our	own 20 heat .21 Whenever	there	is	an	increase	in 22 rent ,	we	only	get	a	. 5	decrease	in	rent	if	we 23 are	lucky .24 My landlord	has	not	improved	the 25 public	area	since	he	bought	the	apartment	house 6 
2 at	least	twenty - five	years . There	are	holes	in 3 the	floors ,	the	walls	have	holes	at	places ,4 deteriorated	linoleum	floor	edges	remain	since 5 the	1950 s ,	if	not	earlier .6 I	just	came	from	a	rally	with	DC	# 37 7 workers .	There	could	be	approximately	2600	jobs 8 lost	by	school	aides ,	who	are	the	lowest	paid 9 in	the	schools . I	wonder	what ' s	going	to happen 10 if	they	lose	their	jobs	because	they	get	very 11 low	pay	already , and	I ' m	one	of	them .12 If landlords ,	it ' s	true ,	have	38 13 percent	profit	on the	dollar	approximately ,14 what	more	do	they	want	on	investments ?	Nothing 15 creates	that	profit .16 In my	building	only	two	rent 17 stabilized	apartments	and	one	rent	controlled .18 The	woman	asked	for	her	apartment	to	be painted 19 a	little	bit	and	he	hasn ' t	done	that	in months .20 We haven ' t	had	a	paint	job	in	years .21 My	husband	has	to do	our	own	painting .22 That ' s	all	I	want	to	say .23 There	should	be no	increase .24 Thank	you .25 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .2

I ' m	retired	and	I live	on	a	fixed 9 income .10 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You ' re	wearing	a11 Brooklyn	t - shirt ,	sweatshirt .12 MS . BARBARA	SANDMAN :	That ' s	where 13 I ' m originally	from .14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I	see .15 MS . BARBARA	SANDMAN :	Okay .16 But	I ' m	a	wild	Mets	fan .	Okay .17 I	live	in	- -18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	See ,	maybe	you ' ve 19 convinced	me	now .20 MS . BARBARA	SANDMAN :	I	live	in	a21 mixed	building . It	went	co - op ,	but	I	am a	rent 22 stabilized	tenant	living	in a	sponsor - owned 23 apartment .24 I ' ve	lived	there	for	many , many 25 years .	I	started	out	when	the	building	was	all 2 
2 rental .	When	it turned	co - op ,	I	could	not 3 afford	the	downpayment	and	then	maintenance	and 4 a	mortgage .	So	I had	to	remain	as	a	renter .5 My - -	the	owner	of	my	apartment 6 lives	in	Trump	Tower	and	has	many	other	real 7 estate	holdings . However ,	I must	say	that	over 8 all	of	these	years	both	he	and	I	have	played 9 fairly	and	by	the	rules .	I	don ' t	really	have	an 10 issue	with	the	man	who	owns	my	apartment .11 What	I	don ' t	really	understand	- -	I12 understand	it ,	but	I	object	to	it	- -	is the 13 concept	of	a	poor	tax .14 Over	the	many	years	I	have	willingly 15 paid	the	required	increases	because	I	agree 16 that	fair	increases	should	be granted .	Things 17 cost	more	the	longer	we	live .	His	costs	go	up 18 as	mine	do .	But	I	recognize	that	if	my	dry 19 cleaner	can	charge	me	more , it ' s	only 20 reasonable	that	the	landlord	also	is	entitled 21 to	some	kind	of increase	commensurate	with	the 22 general	increase	in	prices .23 However ,	I	don ' t	understand	why	I24 should	be	punished	for	having	been	a	stable	and 25 responsible	tenant	with	this	thing	called	a2 
2 poor	tax ,	which	is	only	going	to	make	me poor .3 It ' s certainly	not	going	to make	the	landlord 4 poor .5 ( Applause . )6 MS . BARBARA	SANDMAN :	I	don ' t7 understand	why	the	landlord , whom	I ' m	really	- -8 I	don ' t	have	any	personal	vendetta	against	this 9 particular	landlord .	But	I	don ' t	understand	why 10 he	should	be	rewarded	just	because	I	have	not 11 moved .12 He hasn ' t	had	to	do	anything	in	my 13 apartment	except	replace	a	refrigerator	for 14 which	I	am	paying	the	increase	year	after	year 15 after	year .	But	he	hasn ' t	had	to	renovate .16 Thankfully ,	he	has	not	really	had	to	invest	in 17 my	apartment .18 All	he ' s	had	to do	was	collect	the 19 rent .20 I	don ' t	understand	why	he	should	get 21 a	financial	present	just	because	I	haven ' t22 moved .	I ' ve	actually	helped	stabilize	the 23 building .	I ' ve	been	there	a long	time	as I ' ve 24 said .	I ' m	interested	in	the	maintenance	of	the 25 good	conditions	that	do	exist	in	the	building 2 
2 and	do	everything	I	can	to	see	to	it	that	that 3 remains	constant .4 I ' m also	obviously	a	stabilizing 5 force	in	the	neighborhood	which	has	changed	its 6 population	a	couple	of	times .	It ' s	become	more 7 diverse .	I	welcome	that .	But	it ' s	important 8 that	we	represent	all	kinds	of	populations	in	a9 city ,	in	a	part	of	a	city	which	is	known	for 10 being	a	melting	pot .11 In any	case ,	the	point	that	I	really 12 want	to	make	is that	I	think	the	poor	tax	is 13 unconscionable	and	should	absolutely	be 14 eradicated .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Do	you	know	what 16 the	relationship	is	between	the	maintenance	on 17 your	apartment	that ' s	payable	to	the	co - op 18 corporation	and	your	rent ?19 MS . BARBARA	SANDMAN :	They	are 20 almost	equivalent	at	this	point .21 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .	Thank	you .22 MS . BARBARA	SANDMAN :	You ' re	quite 23 welcome .24 ( Applause . )25 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Yetta	Kurland .2 
2 MS . YETTA	KURLAND :	Good	evening .3 My name	is	Yetta	Kurland .	I am	a4 candidate	for	City	Council	in the	3 rd	District .5 I ' m also	a	tenants '	rights	attorney	for	almost 6 a	decade .	And	I live	in	Chelsea .7 And	as	a	tenants '	attorney , I ' ve 8 seen	first - hand	over	the	years	that	landlords 9 do	profit	and	not	just	in	honorable	ways ,	but 10 I ' ve also	seen	first - hand	how	landlords	have 11 profited	unfairly	by	taking	advantage	of 12 loopholes	and	different	advantages	like	the 13 vacancy	decontrol .14 And	I	noticed	you	had	a	lot	of 15 testimony	today	from	small	landlords .	But	I16 just	want	to	say ,	you	know , for	the	record	and 17 say	very	carefully	that	only	three	hundred 18 landlords	own	ninety	percent	of	the	rent 19 controlled	and	rent	stabilized	apartments	here 20 in	New	York	City .21 And	I	think	there	have	been	some 22 good	suggestions	and	proposals	for	how	some	of 23 those	small	landlords	could	improve	their 24 situation .25 But	I	think	that	I	want	to speak	to 2 
2 you	today	from	a position	of vision	and	as	an 3 opportunity	for	you	to	be	champions	for	the 4 people	of	New	York	City .5 New	York	City , including	my district 6 here	in	Manhattan ,	cannot	survive	unless 7 working	families	can	survive	in	our 8 neighborhoods .	That	means	having	available 9 decent	housing	at affordable	rents	where 10 parents	can	live	and	raise	their	children ,11 where	seniors ,	who	have	already	paid	for	the 12 right	through	a lifetime	of work ,	can	live	in	a13 neighborhood	they	love ,	and	where	young	people 14 who	choose	to	live	in	New	York	can	find	decent 15 accommodations	while	they	refine	their	skills .16 When	working	people	are	forced	to 17 live	outside	of New	York	because	the	rent	is 18 too	high ,	all	New	Yorkers	lose .19 When	working	people	can	find	decent 20 homes	in	New	York	at	affordable	rents ,	all	New 21 Yorkers	win .22 Members	of	the	New	York	City	Rent 23 Guidelines	Board ,	you	have	the	power	to help 24 New	Yorkers	and	to	help	New	York .25 And	you ' ve	heard	a	lot	of	testimony 2 
2 today	about	some	of	the	negative	impacts	that 3 could	happen	with	a	rent	increase .	But	I want 4 to	offer	you	the	opportunity	for	a	positive 5 opportunity	to	really	be	champions	and	give 6 hope	to	New	York	City	by	freezing	the	rent 7 increases	for	this	year .8 Your	role	in	keeping	New	York	vital 9 and	inclusive	and	creative	is crucial .	Please 10 show	leadership , compassion	and	vision	by 11 freezing	the	rent ,	or	better	yet ,	rolling	back 12 prior	rent	increases	so	that	all	New	Yorkers 13 have	a	home	they	can	afford .14 Thank	you	very	much .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .16 ( Applause . )17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Susan	Howard .18 MS .

You 13 represent	the	landlords .	You	were	appointed	by 14 Bloomberg	who	claims	to	be	the	affordability 15 mayor .	He	wants	to	bring	affordable	housing	to 16 the	City .17 This	is	affordable	housing . Why 18 aren ' t	you	supporting	his	agenda	by	making	sure 19 that	we	- -	units	remains	affordable ?	There	are 20 no	rent	stabilized	units	in New	York	that	you 21 could	move	into	tomorrow .22 The	landlords	who	buy	these 23 buildings	know	they	are	buying	rent	stabilized 24 buildings .	They	buy	the	buildings ,	then	they 25 try	to	turn	them	to	market	rate .8

It ' s	one	of the 15 reasons	we	have	it	now .16 Do you	really	want	to	go	back	to 17 that ?	Do	you	really	think	that	market	rate	is 18 going	to	stabilize	New	York	City ?

If	I	go	down	to	the	building 12 at	129 th	Street	and	Lenox	Avenue ,	a13 three - bedroom	is $ 3000	to	rent .14 The	Beacon	on	139 th	Street , I15 watched	brick - by - brick	and	I set	my	mind	on	it 16 that	I	wanted	to live	there .

KATHLEEN	LYOONS :	Good 7 afternoon .8 I	used	to	live	in	an	SRO	on the 9 Upper	West	Side . I	moved	in about	twenty	years 10 ago . I	was	hoping	I	wouldn ' t be	there	very 11 long .12 But	due	to	maybe	harassment	in	the 13 building	and	rents	going	up so	high ,	I	ended	up 14 staying	there	longer .15 And	because	of so	much	harassment ,16 it	was	a	very	difficult	place	to	live ,	very 17 stressful .18 And	at	the	time	I	didn ' t	know	it	but 19 I	was	going	to	the	doctor ' s and	they	kept 20 telling	me	that	I	had	like	chronic	fatigue ,21 Epstein	Barr .	And ,	well ,	it turned	out	to be 22 cancer .	I	already	had	it	for	like	fifteen	years 23 and	it	was	misdiagnosed .	I	had	gone	to	so many 24 doctors	and	they	just	could	not	figure	this 25 out , although	the	symptoms	should	have	been 2 

2	obvious .3
Which	probably	cost	the	City	a	lot 
4 of	money ,	myself	also .	I	started	going	to 5 Chinese	doctors , which	were	most	helpful ,	more 6 so	than	the	others .7 And	when	it	was	finally	diagnosed ,8 they	told	me	I	was	terminal . And	I	was	very 9 lucky	that	- -	I had	to	move	because	I	had	a	lot 10 of	bleeding .	So I	moved	in	with	my	brother .11 I	had	my	apartment .	I	tried	to	still 12 - -	well ,	my	SRO , it ' s	really	not	an	apartment .13 It	was	standing	room	only .14 And	I	did	recover ,	not	because	I	did 15 what	the	doctor	said .	I	didn ' t	do	chemo . I	was 16 lucky .	My	brother	was	able	to help	me .	My 17 family	was	able	to	help	me . I	had	intravenous 18 vitamins	and	all	that .19 And	they	were	really	surprised	to 20 see	that	I	lived ,	but	not	because	- -	I	mean	I21 still	can ' t	afford	to	live	in the	City	because 22 the	rents	are	so high .	I	would	like	to	move 23 back .24 I	don ' t	know	if I	can	still	live 25 with	my	brother .4 
2 But	I	mean	the	situation	is the 3 rents	are	just	unaffordable	anywhere .	They	are 4 so	high .	Everyone	is	stressed .	I	mean	from 5 food ,	I	can ' t	- - I	have	to	eat	good	food .	I6 can ' t	eat	chemical	food ,	food	with	additives	or 7 any	- -	I	don ' t	eat	junk	food ,	you	know . And	the 8 prices	for	food	are	very	expensive .	Everything 9 is	going	up	and	nobody ' s	income	is	going	up .10 I	am	not	unique	in	this	situation .11 There	are	many , many	people	in	this	situation .12 I	think	it ' s	unconscionable	that	any 13 rent	should	go	up -	SRO ,	anywhere .14 I	have	a	nephew	who	is	on	the	dean ' s15 list ,	has	a	full	scholarship ,	and	he ' s	not	- -16 he	got	a	full	scholarship	to go	live	in the 17 City .	He	can ' t	because	he	can ' t	afford	the 18 rents .19 He ' s	not	unique .	He ' s	a	good 20 student .	And	I	just	think	it ' s	unconscionable 21 that	any	rent	increases .22 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .23 MS .

DOROTHY	YOUNG :	Good	afternoon .20 My name	is	Dorothy	Young .21 At present	I ' ve been	displaced	from 22 my	apartment	that	I	lived	in twenty - five	years .23 My landlord	was	greedy	for	dollars 24 and	for	a	few	other	agencies	in	the	City	and 25 the	SROs	that	you	are	talking	about ,	they ' re 2 
2 box	cars .	I	call	them	box	cars ,	and	they	used 3 to	throw	feed	out	of	the	box	cars	on	the	train .4 And	each	of	the	rooms	that	they	rent 5 is	equal	to	three	- -	one	box	car	is	equal	to 6 three	rooms	in	the	SRO .	So	you	know	how	small 7 that	is .8 That ' s	why	I	don ' t	have	room	to	move 9 around	in	it .	It ' s	the	same	thing	when	you	get 10 a	room	with	a	wheelchair	and	you	can	hardly 11 move .	You	got	to back	in	and	pull	up .12 And	then	you	have	to	suffer	with 13 food	that ' s	contaminated .	And	like	this	lady 14 was	saying	about	her	daughter ,	I ' m	on	a special 15 diet .	I	take	coumadin ,	20	mg a	day ,	to	stay 16 alive .17 And	I	don ' t	get	to	eat	three	meals	a18 day	because	I	can ' t	afford	it and	because	I ' m19 in	a shelter	that	does	not	believe	in	honoring 20 people ' s	health . And	it ' s	also	sponsored	by	the 21 Department	of	the	Aging	which	I	find	very	rude 22 and	obnoxious .	These	are	folks	that	should	be 23 taking	care	of	us and	you	get	treated	like	your 24 criminals .25 Criminals	are	running	the	shelter .	I2 
2 know	because	I	know	two	people	who	are	on 3 parole	that	work	at	the	shelter .	I	have	never 4 been	to	jail	a	day	in	my	life	and	I	have 5 somebody	telling	me	you	must	be	in	at	ten 6 o ' clock .	You	cannot	go	out	the	door	after	ten 7 o ' clock .	You	cannot	get	a	late	pass	because	you 8 haven ' t	been	here	long	enough .	And	if	you	break 9 the	curfew ,	which	I	have ,	I say ,	yes .	I ' ve 10 broken	the	curfew	so	many	times	I	stopped 11 counting .	Because	when	I	have	to	do	something ,12 I	have	to	do	it . I	might	be breaking	the	curfew 13 right	now .	But	I want	to	be here	and	I ' m going 14 to	be here .15 God	has	granted	me	the	strength	to 16 live	this	long . That ' s	why	I do .	I ' m	going	to 17 keep	on	pushing	because	I	know	there	are	things 18 that	I	have	to	do and	I	have	to	do	them .19 ( Unintelligible )	I ' m	upset	and 20 that ' s	why	I	came .	You	all	need	to	check	out 21 the	shelters	that	the	City	is paying	criminals 22 to	run	and	beat	over	good	people	who	don ' t	have 23 problems	like	they	do .	And	I ' m	talking	about 24 womanizing ,	husband	beaters , you	name	it .25 They	say :	Oh ,	Ms .	Young ,	we can ' t	do 2 

2	anything .3
You	don ' t	have	any	of	the	major 
4 problems .	The	major	problem	- -	I ' m	not	a drug 5 addict .	I ' m	not	a	dope	pusher .	I	just	haven ' t6 been	able	to	find	an	apartment	that	I	can 7 afford	to	pay	rent .	Rent	is $ 636 .	I ' ve	got 8 $ 646 .	So	you	tell	me	how	I	can	pay	rent	out	of 9 $ 650	and	pay	for	my	telephone ,	transportation 10 to	and	from	the	hospital	and	the	apartment .	I11 can ' t	do	it .	It doesn ' t	make	sense .12 Rent	needs	to	stop .13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	need	to	wrap 14 up .15 Thank	you .16 MS . DOROTHY	YOUNG :	Thank	you .17 ( Applause . )18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Beth	Weinreb .19 Beth ?20 MS . BETH	WEINREB :	Could	you	turn 21 that	back	around ,	please .22 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Yes ,	we will .23 That ' s	the	plan .24 MS . BETH	WEINREB :	Thank	you	very 25 much .4 
2 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You ' re	not	one	of 3 those	tenants	who	has	a	house	in	Easthampton ,4 do	you ?5 MS . BETH	WEINREB :	No ,	I	don ' t .	But 6 I	don ' t	get	to	go to	Easthampton .7 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	This	wasn ' t	the 8 wisest	- -9 ( Audience	participation . )10 MS . BETH	WEINREB :	Yes ,	I know .	I11 thought	about	it when	I	was	sitting	here .	I12 thought	I	really	shouldn ' t	have	worn	that .13 You	know ,	my	situation	is	maybe	not 14 quite	as	dire	as some	of	the	people	I ' ve been 15 listening	to	and	it	has	really	touched	my 16 heart .17 But	I	am	an	unemployed	New	Yorker 18 and	I	know	that	I ' m	not	alone .	I	know	that 19 unemployment	in New	York	City	has	hovered 20 between	eight	and	ten	percent ,	and	that	this 21 year ,	2009 ,	is	completely	different	than	any 22 other	year	that	you	have	sat	there	and	thought 23 about	rent	increases	for	rent	stabilized 24 tenants	and	rent	controlled	tenants .25 I	live	in	a	rent	stabilized 2 
2 apartment .	I ' ve been	out	of work	for	over	a3 year	and	I ' ve	cut	everything	that ' s	extra .	I4 don ' t	have	cable	TV ,	I	don ' t buy	any	clothes .	I5 just 6 try	to	make	my	rent	and	try	to	keep	my	health 7 insurance .8 And ,	you	know , I ' m	a	big	supporter 9 of	rent	stabilized	apartments .	And	I	think 10 there	aren ' t	that	many	of	them	left	otherwise 11 this	room	would	be	full .	I	think	there	are	a12 lot	of	New	Yorkers	who	are	living	in	apartments 13 that	are	not	stabilized .14 And	I	think	a	lot	of	the	NYU 15 students ,	who	live	in	this	neighborhood	now ,16 don ' t	even	know	what	rent	controls	are . And 17 that ' s	why ,	you	know ,	it ' s	a non - issue	for 18 them .19 But	nobody	has	mentioned	the	fact 20 that	we	are	facing	subway	and	bus	increases	at 21 the	end	of	the	month .22 And	any	increases	that	you	will	put 23 on	rents	at	this	point ,	I	mean	for	the 24 unemployed	New	Yorkers	like	myself	I	don ' t	know 25 how	you	can	consider	raising	rent	this	year .2 
2 You	know ,	people	don ' t	have	money .	And	there 3 are	no	jobs .	I	can ' t	find	a job	in	my 4 profession .	I ' m trying	to	get	a	job	in	Whole 5 Foods	as	a	cashier .	I ' ve	had	a	profession	for 6 my	entire	adult	life .7 And	I	just	think	it	would	be	an 8 amazing	thing	if this	one	year	the	Rent 9 Guidelines	Board	gave	zero	percent	to	the 10 landlords .11 Thank	you .12 ( Applause . )13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	We ' ll	be right 14 with	you .15 Now ,	we	are	up to	our	last	speaker ,16 Trina	Semorile .17 Is there	anybody	in	the	audience	who 18 hasn ' t	spoken	who	would	like	to	speak ?19 Okay .	We	are	going	to	call	you	down .20 We	are	going	to go	one ,	two , three .	And	you ' re 21 going	to	introduce	yourselves	so	we	have	your 22 name .23 Okay .24 Go ahead ,	Ms .	Semorile .25 MS . TRINA	SEMORILE :	My	name	is 2 
2 Trina	Semorile . I ' m	a	Hell ' s Kitchen	tenant .	I3 live	in	a	stabilized	apartment	which	is taking 4 up	most	of	my	income .	I ' m	a disabled	tenant	as 5 well .6 Capital	must	protect	itself	in	every 7 way . Debts	must	be	collected	and	loans	and 8 mortgages	foreclosed	as	soon	as	possible .	When 9 through	a	process	of	law	the	common	people	have 10 lost	their	homes ,	they	will	be	more	tractable 11 and	more	easily	governed	by the	strong	arm	of 12 the	law	applied	by	the	central	power	of leading 13 financiers .14 People	without	homes	will	not 15 quarrel	with	their	leaders . This	is	well	known 16 among	our	principal	men	now	engaged	in	forming 17 an	imperialism	of capitalism	to	govern	the 18 world .19 By dividing	the	people	we	can	get 20 them	to	expend	their	energies	in	fighting	over 21 questions	of	no importance	to us	except	as 22 teachers	of	the	common	herd .23 Those	are	the	words	of	JP	Morgan .24 That ,	Marvin	Markus ,	is	the	ideology 25 you	are	espousing	as	policy	and	which ,	under 2 
2 your	tenure	as	chair ,	twice , you	have 3 repeatedly	violated	both	the	spirit	and	letter 4 of	the	law	and	regulations	governing	rents	in 5 New	York	City .6 Worse ,	you	have	undertaken	a	new	lie 7 in	pursuit	of	unbridled	greed	and	theft	from 8 the	majority	of New	Yorkers .9 I	remind	you ,	and	the	six	other 10 antitenant	Bloomberg	appointees ,	that	rent 11 stabilization	is not ,	as	you	are	now	seeking	to 12 assert ,	a	public	welfare	program .	Its	purpose 13 is	to protect	tenants	from	the	extreme 14 inequality	of	power	and	money	as	it	is	applied 15 and	plied	upon	the	corrupt	politicians	of New 16 York	in	favor	of landlords	and	developers	and 17 the	rich	who	seek	to	steal	the	homes	of poor 18 and	working	class	people ,	destroying 19 neighborhoods	and	communities .20 Indeed ,	the	intent	is	to	change	the 21 landscape	of	New	York	City	into	a	bland	strip 22 mall ,	boutique	haven	of	the	unnecessary	and	a23 fake	city .24 Bloomberg ' s	policies	are	those	of 25 Robert	Moses	on steroids	and	you	are	one	of	the 2 
2 mechanisms	by	which	he	intends	to	further	such 3 aims .4 Your	goal	is	to falsely	redefine 5 rent	stabilization	as	a	welfare	or	entitlement 6 program	so	that	it	may	be	finally	cut	as a7 budget	line	item .8 After	all ,	we	know	what	Bill	Clinton 9 and	Rudy	Giuliani	did	to	welfare ,	while 10 enriching	themselves	and	screwing	everything 11 not	nailed	down , they	were	telling	poor	women 12 to	work	for	less	than	minimum	wage	and	take 13 chastity	classes .14 The	greatest	of all	crimes	are	the 15 wars	that	are	carried	on	by governments , to 16 plunder ,	enslave	and	destroy	mankind .	The	next 17 greatest	crimes	committed	in the	world	are 18 equally	prompted	by	avarice	and	ambition ;	and 19 are	committed ,	not	on	sudden	passion ,	but	by 20 men	of	calculation ,	who	keep	their	heads	cool 21 and	clear	and	who	have	no	thought	whatever	of 22 going	to	prison	for	them .23 They	are	committed ,	not	so much	by 24 men	who	violate	the	laws ,	as by	men	who , either 25 by	themselves	or by	their	instruments ,	make	the 2 
2 laws ;	men	who	have	combined	to	usurp	arbitrary 3 power	and	to	maintain	it	by force	and	fraud ,4 and	whose	purpose	in	usurping	and	maintaining 5 it	is by	unjust	and	unequal	legislation , to 6 secure	to	themselves	such	advantages	and 7 monopolies	as	will	enable	them	to	control	and 8 extort	the	labor	and	properties	of	others ,	and 9 thus	impoverish	them	in	order	to	minister	to 10 their	own	wealth	and	aggrandizement .11 The	robberies	and	wrongs	thus 12 committed	by	these	men ,	in	conformity	with	the 13 laws ,	that	is ,	their	own	laws ,	are	as	mountains 14 to	molehills ,	compared	with	the	crimes 15 committed	by	other	criminals	in	violation	of 16 the	laws .17 That ' s	Lysander	Spooner .	He died	in 18 1887	and	not	much	has	changed .19 The	landlord	lobby	and	the	RGB	spent 20 two	years	spinning	the	lie	that	long - term 21 tenants	are	stealing	from	landlords	through 22 rent	stabilization .	This	doesn ' t	pass	the	laugh 23 test ,	yet	many	of us ,	myself	included ,	were 24 slapped	with	a	$ 45	per	month	increase .	As such ,25 and	in	consideration	that	landlord	costs	have 2 
2 actually	dropped ,	we	should	receive	no	increase 3 at	all .4 I ' m almost	done .5 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .6 MS . TRINA	SEMORILE :	I	remind	you ,7 as	I do	every	year ,	that	disabled	tenants 8 continue	to	be	third	class	citizens	facing	a9 DRIE	disparity	of ceiling	limit	for	eligibility 10 unequal	to	SCRIE ,	unequal	to the	tune	of 11 $ 9 , 604 . 00 .	That ' s	a	lot	of	money .	That ' s almost 12 a	$ 10 , 000	difference .13 This	is	discrimination	of	the	most 14 basic	kind	and	leaves	us	far	more	likely	to 15 become	homeless . And ,	yes ,	you	have	an 16 obligation	to	take	such	matters	into	account .17 Further ,	there	continues	to be 18 absolutely	no	enforcement	of housing	laws	which 19 require	habitable	conditions	and	many	of which 20 actually	create	disabilities	and	severe	health 21 problems .22 These	are	the	people	being	given	a23 guaranteed	profit ,	no	matter	the	economic 24 conditions	for	others .25 Stop	the	theft , stop	the	increases ,2 
2 enforce	compliance	and	jail	the	landlords	who 3 ignore	the	law .4 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .5 ( Applause . )6 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Sir ,	the	first 7 gentleman ,	the	first	one .	Give	us	your	name .8 MR . ROBERT	STEPANEK :	My	name	is 9 Robert	Stepanek . I	was	listed	on	your	list	of 10 speakers .11 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Yes ,	you	were .12 MR . ROBERT	STEPANEK :	I	was	out	in 13 the	restroom	I	guess	when	you	called	my name .14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I	don ' t know 15 where	you	were , but	we	found	you .16 Go ahead .17 MR . ROBERT	STEPANEK :	The	question 18 arises	as	to	why	there	needs	to	be	a	Rent 19 Guidelines	Board	whatsoever . And	the	reason	is 20 simple .21 Because	New	York	City	is	such	a22 desirable	place	to	live ,	work ,	do	business	and 23 visit ,	that	were	rents	allowed	to	redound	to 24 market	rates ,	which	is	what	every	landlord 25 would	like	to	have	happen ,	that	people	who 2 
2 actually	live	and	work	here	of	modest	means	do 3 so	because	of	what	they	believe	in	doing	rather 4 than	profit	as	being	their	sole	motive	in their 5 existence ,	would	be	priced	out	of	residences	in 6 New	York .7 People ,	whose	main	residences	are	in 8 Dubai ,	in	Berlin ,	in	Tokyo , San	Paolo ,	Mexico 9 City ,	where	have	you ,	would	be	able	to	maintain 10 a	pied - a - terre . These	people ,	paying	market 11 rents ,	would	not	be	subject	to	eviction	as	most 12 New	Yorkers	of	modest	means	are	if	they	are 13 found	or	deemed	by	a	court	to be	a	person	not 14 maintaining	their	principal	residence	or 15 primary	residence	or	sole	residence	in	a unit 16 which	is	at	a	rental	level	deemed	unacceptable 17 by	landlords .18 Now ,	an	example	of	the	kind	of 19 issues	that	prevail	for	most	tenants	here	are 20 not	the	many	mom	and	pop	types	who	own	a single 21 family	that	have	probably	testified	here ,	and 22 maybe	everyone	who	has	testified	here ,	but 23 rather	the	large	corporate	entity	which	see	New 24 York	rental	real	estate	as	a profit	opportunity 25 and	not	as	a	place	that	is	part	of	the 2 

2	community .3
My building	is one	such	unit .	It	is 
4 owned	and	operated	by	an	entity	which	also 5 operates	an	investment	firm	out	of	their	same 6 offices .	This	investment	firm ,	for	example ,	was 7 fined	$ 250 , 000 , a	quarter	of a	million	dollars ,8 to	be able	to	stay	in	business	in	2003	because 9 they	would	illegally	bundle	their	investors '10 monies ,	use	those	monies	as collateral	to 11 obtain	fraudulent	bank	loans	for	themselves .12 Now ,	mind	you , you	could	afford	to 13 pay	the	quarter	of	a	million	dollars	which 14 enabled	them	to stay	in	business	that	the	Stock 15 Exchange	required	them	to	do so .16 But	it	just	shows	you	the	kinds	of 17 forces	and	the	kinds	of	financial	forces ,	the 18 corporate	real	estate	forces ,	which	impact	upon 19 most	New	Yorkers ,	and	who	are	not	subjected	to 20 the	kinds	of	costs	that	these	so - called	mom	and 21 pop	single	business	owners	are	subject	to .22 The	people	that	own	my	building 23 maintained	a	condition	for	four	months , in 24 excess	of	four	months ,	where	we	had	no	cooking 25 gas	whatsoever . They	were	not	compelled	to 4 
2 redress	the	situation	until	it	became	a point 3 in	time	where	they	would	have	to	pay	penalties 4 to	do so .	And	they	sought	to address	the 5 conditions	where	there	was	no gas	by	not	even 6 bothering	to	get	a	New	York	Department	of 7 Building ' s	work	permit	in	order	to	do	the	work 8 thusly	putting	the	health	of all	the	tenants	in 9 the	building	at risk .10 These	are	not	the	kind	of	folks	who 11 merit	any	kind	of consideration	for	any	kind	of 12 automatic	rent	increases .	And ,	in	fact , there 13 should	be	no	increases .14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you 15 MR . ROBERT	STEPANEK :	Thank	you .16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Good	job .17 ( Applause . )18 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	The	next 19 gentleman ,	and	then	- -20 MR . THOMAS	HASLER :	Good	afternoon .21 Thank	you	for	giving	me	the 22 opportunity	to	speak .23 My name	is	Thomas	Hasler .	I walk	- -24 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	also	were	on 25 the	list .2 
2 MR . THOMAS	HASLER :	I	was	on	the 3 list .	I ' m	sorry . I	had	to	go eat	something .4 I ' m a	high	school	teacher . I	live	in 5 this	street ,	127	East	7 th	Street .	I	didn ' t	know 6 about	the	hearing .	I	walked	by	and	I	came	in 7 and	I	care	deeply	about	the	issue .	That ' s	why	I8 wanted	to	stay	and	say	a	few	things .9 I	am	deeply	concerned	about	the	loss 10 of	rent	stabilized	apartments	in	the	City .	As 11 people	like	me	are	being	forced	out	more	and 12 more ,	like	hard - working	people	who	cannot 13 afford	the	sky	high	rents .14 I	do	not	think	- -	I	do	have	sympathy 15 for	small	tenants ,	small	tenants .	But	as we 16 heard	before	in the	testimony ,	a	small	number 17 of	tenants	owns	the	majority	of	these 18 apartments .19 And	I	have	witnessed	in	my own 20 building	practices	that	are	borderline 21 harassment	to	get	people	out	of	those 22 apartments .23 I	have	a	picture	here .	I ' m not 24 prepared ,	but	I lived	in	an apartment .	We had	a25 leak	in	the	roof	for	two	years .	I ' m	a	teacher .2 
2 One	day	it	fell	down .	We	called	the 3 firefighters ,	311 .	Nothing	was	done .	I	feel 4 like	that	renters '	rights	- - we	have	rights	but 5 it	feels	like	the	others	are	more	powerful .6 My student	work	was	trashed .	It	was 7 - -	nothing	got	done .8 And	who	are	we talking	here	about ?9 We	are	talking	about	rent	stabilized 10 apartments .	And	who	lives	in those	apartments ,11 it ' s low - class , low - income	- -	I ' m	sorry	- -12 low - income ,	middle - income	people .13 And	I	think	it would	be	the	right 14 thing	for	you	to do	not	to	increase	the	rents 15 in	these	economic	times .16 And	one	thing , yes ,	everyone 17 suffers .	People	have	lost	millions	of	dollars 18 in	Wall	Street .19 But	there	is	a difference	between 20 having	$ 10	million	and	then	$ 3	million	or 21 living	on	the	edge	already , cutting	food ,22 cutting	everything	you	can , not	having	cable 23 TV , facing	subway	increases .24 And	to	finish	my	statement , I25 strongly	believe	that	this	year	you	should 2 
2 strongly	consider	not	raising	the	rent .3 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .4 ( Applause . )5 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	There	was	another 6 gentleman	who	wanted	to	speak .	Are	you	here ?7 There ' s	a	woman .	Come	on	down .8 Somebody	else	here ?	Do	you	want	to 9 speak	too ?10 Okay .11 Please	give	us your	name .12 MS . DOREEN	GUSHUE :	My	name	is 13 Doreen	Gushue ,	G - u - s - h - u - e .14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .15 MS . DOREEN	GUSHUE :	And	I would 16 just	like	to	say	that	I ' m	a small	property 17 owner ,	a	sixteen - family	apartment	building	in 18 Brooklyn ,	owner - occupied .19 We have	several	tenants	that	are	not 20 paying	rent .	So we	have	to	go to	the 21 landlord / tenant	- -	you	know , the	eviction 22 route .	We	haven ' t	started	that	process	yet .	We 23 keep	trying	hoping	that	they	are	going	to 24 eventually	pay	the	rent .	We put	it	off . We	put 25 it	off .2 
2 We also	have	a couple	of 3 preferential	rents .	We	give	- -	you	know ,4 because	there ' s been	high	turnover .	And	one	or 5 two	of	the	apartments ,	those	rents	have	gone	up 6 dramatically .	So then	when	we find	a	good 7 tenant ,	we	give	them	a	preferential	rent .8 The	same	adjacent	apartment	has	a9 low	rent .10 So the	only	thing	I ' m	asking	is 11 whatever	percent	you	come	up with ,	or	zero ,	or 12 whatever ,	but	if you	could	please	do	the 13 longevity	increase .	I	don ' t remember	what	you 14 call	it .15 A	VOICE :	Low - rent	adjustment .16 MS . DOREEN	GUSHUE :	The	low - rent 17 adjustment .18 And	thank	you . That ' s	all	I ' d	like 19 to	say .20 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	I	don ' t think	we 21 call	it	that .	But	we	understand	you .22 MS . DOREEN	GUSHUE :	Okay .23 MS . ADAMS :	One	question .24 How	long	have	you	owned	that 25 building ?2 
2 MS . DOREEN	GUSHUE :	My	family 3 bought	it	in	the	' 60 s .	My	parents	bought	it	in 4	the	' 60 s .5 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	And	where	is	it ?6 MS . DOREEN	GUSHUE :	Sunset	Park ,7 Brooklyn .8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .9 MS . DOREEN	GUSHUE :	Thank	you .10 Oh ! And	I	have	one	more	thing .11 Someone	earlier	had	said	that	many 12 of	the	buildings	are ,	you	know ,	condos , co - ops ,13 market .	We	have	no	market	value .	Nothing	in	our 14 building	is	market	value .	Everything	is rent 15 controlled	or	rent	stabilized .16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	You	mean	no 17 market	rate	tenants .18 MS . DOREEN	GUSHUE :	No	market	rent .19 Right .20 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Okay .21 MS . DOREEN	GUSHUE :	I ' m	sorry .22 Market	rate .23 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .24 The	next	person .25 MS . DAWN	JONES :	Good	evening .5 
2 I	just	wanted	to	add	to	my testimony 3 from	Monday .	The	gentleman	- -4 Oh , I ' m	sorry . My	name	is	Dawn 5 Jones .	And	I ' m	President	of Lenox	Terrace 6 Association	of	Concerned	Tenants	and	floor 7 captain	for	10	West	Tenants	Association .8 The	gentleman	had	asked	- -9 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	And	you	work	for 10 the	City	of	New	York .11 MS . DAWN	JONES :	Yes ,	I	do .12 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	And	you	got	a	big 13 caseload .14 MS . DAWN	JONES :	Yes ,	I	do .15 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	So	we	remember .16 MR . LANGUEDOC :	You	work	Sundays .17 MS . HOLDER :	And	you	work	on 18 weekends	too .19 MS . DAWN	JONES :	Yes .20 And	I	wanted	to add	- -	answer	the 21 gentleman ' s	question .	We	got	a	4	percent 22 increase	last	year .23 But	I	just	want	to	read	this 24 statement .25 It is	the	responsibility	of the	Rent 2 
2 Guidelines	Board	to	establish	fair	rent 3 adjustments	for	rent	stabilized	units .	And	I4 urge	you	when	determining	what	you	think	would 5 be	fair	this	year	to	keep	in mind	the	great 6 hardship	that	many	rent	stabilized	tenants	are 7 facing	in	this	economic	climate	and	the 8 devastating	impact	that	a	significant	rent 9 increase	would	have	on	us .10 Tenants	are	facing	serious	hardships 11 as	our	country	faces	the	worst	economic 12 downturn	since	the	Great	Depression .13 Last	year ,	the	Rent	Board	adopted 14 the	highest	rent	increases	in twenty	years ,	4 . 515 percent	for	one - year	lease	renewals	and	8 . 516 percent	for	two - year	lease	renewals .17 ( Audience	participation . )18 MS . DAWN	JONES :	Yes ,	$ 45 - -19 exactly .	I ' m	getting	there .20 Tenants	paying	less	than	$ 1000	who 21 have	lived	in	their	apartment	for	at	least	six 22 years	were	hit	with	a	$ 45	one - year	renewal	and 23 $ 85 two - year	renewal	minimum	rent	hike .24 This	is	unacceptable .	Tenants	across 25 the	City ,	whether	or	not	they	paid	the 2 
2 supplemental	increase	last	year ,	are	united	in 3 the	belief	that	the	RGB	does	not	have	the	right 4 to	impose	a	higher	increase	for	some	tenants 5 than	others .6 Last	year ' s	massive	increase	coupled 7 with	the	economic	downturn	has	put	tenants	in	a8 dangerous	situation .9 While	we	understand	that	there	are 10 some	landlords	who	are	struggling ,	most 11 landlords	are	prospering	under	the	regulations .12 Statistics	from	RGB	reports 13 published	on	the	website ,	that	is ,14 www . housingnewyorkcity . com , based	on	the	most 15 recent	data	available	from	2007 ,	the	average 16 owner	of	rent	stabilized	apartments	spent	only 17 62	cents	of	each	rent	dollar	collected	on 18 operating	costs , leaving	38 cents	for	net 19 operating	income .20 Last	year ,	landlords	were	pointing 21 out	facts	that	the	cost	of	fuel	oil	was 22 expected	to	increase ,	and	this	was	one	major 23 justification	for	the	very	high	increase	that 24 was	passed	last	year .25 Projections	proved	to	be	incorrect .2 
2 Fuel	costs	actually	decreased	10 . 1	percent .3 Tenants	are	counting	on	the	Rent 4 Guidelines	Board	and	all	members	of	the	Board 5 to	take	the	economic	hardships	tenants	are 6 facing	this	year	into	consideration	when	you 7 make	the	decision .8 We are	calling	on	a	zero	percent 9 increase ,	no	minimum	increase .10 And	if	you	decide	to	pass	an 11 increase	within	the	range	that	was	proposed	in 12 the	preliminary	vote ,	it	should	be	the	lowest 13 possible .14 And	I	just	want	to	just	add	three 15 live	situations . I	see	I	have	eight	minutes ,16 but	I	appreciate	- -17 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Eight	seconds .18 MS . DAWN	JONES :	Eight	seconds .19 Actually	it ' s	four .20 I	appreciate	the	tenants	- - I ' m21 sorry ,	the	teacher ' s	testimony .	But	we	actually 22 have	a	teacher	in our	neighboring	complex ,23 Savoy ,	who	was	put	out .24 I	don ' t	want	to say	the	person ' s25 name .	They	work	for	a	Borough	President . I2 
2 won ' t	say	which	one .	She	died	of	starvation .3 And	a	HRA	worker	high	up	has	now	just	been 4 evicted .	She ' s	now	in	Harlem	Hospital .5 So I	mean	this	is	really	a hardship 6 on	working	people .7 So please	take	that	into 8 consideration	this	year .9 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .10 MS . HOLDER :	Ms .	Jones ,	I have	a11 question .12 In response	to Mr .	Schleider ,	you 13 said	4	percent . What	was	that ?14 MS . DAWN	JONES :	We	got	a 4	percent 15 increase	last	year .16 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	In	wages .	In 17 wages .18 MS . DAWN	JONES :	Yes .19 MS . HOLDER :	Oh ,	wages .20 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	His	question	was 21 what	was	the	wage	settlement	last	year .22 MS . DAWN	JONES :	But	I	totally 23 can ' t	see	it	because	all	of my	utilities	go 24 direct .	So	I	cannot	even	see	my	increase .25 MS . HOLDER :	Thank	you ,	Ms .	Jones .2 
2 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Any	other 3 speakers ?	Anybody	wishing	to be	heard ?4 Come	on	down .	Let ' s	go .5 We give	everybody	a	chance .6 MR . ED	LEWIS :	I ' m	a	rent 7 controlled	tenant .8 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Rent	controlled ?9 MR . ED	LEWIS :	Yes .10 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Not	stabilized .11 Controlled ,	not	stabilized .12 MR . ED	LEWIS :	Rent	controlled .13 I	am	a	rent	controlled	tenant .14 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Your	name	is ?15 MR . ED	LEWIS :	My	name	is Edward 16 Lewis .	I	want	to make	a	comment	on	the	fact 17 that	the	landlords	apparently	don ' t	seem	to 18 understand	that	when	they	rent	an	apartment ,19 they	conduct	a	financial	investigation	as to 20 whether	the	tenant	is	capable	of	paying .21 And	when	they	complain	that	the 22 tenants	are	bringing	other	tenants	in	in order 23 to	pay	that	rent ,	it ' s	because	they	have	not 24 done	their	investigation	sufficiently	well .25 And	these	tenants	are	forced	by	the 2 
2 exorbitant	rent	to	get	these	other	persons	into 3 the	apartment	in order	to	pay	these	exorbitant 4 rents .5 And	the	only	reason	that	they	are 6 forced	to	do	that	is	because	the	landlords	have 7 been	charging	more	than	they	should	be	charging 8 for	that	apartment .9 Meaning	- -	and	that	is	partly	your 10 problem ,	partly	your	fault , meaning	you	should 11 be	reducing	the	rent	or	maintaining	the	rent	at 12 a	low	enough	level	that	one	person	can	afford 13 or	the	persons	named	on	the	lease	can	afford	to 14 pay	that	rent .15 The	landlords	are	just	exploiting 16 the	situation .	All	they ' re	doing	is	cramming 17 people	in	or	allowing	people	to	be	crammed	into 18 this	apartment . And	then	they	claim	there	is 19 wear	and	tear	on the	apartment .	It	is	the 20 biggest	joke	on this	planet .21 And	you	people	really	have	a	duty	to 22 tell	these	landlords	that	they	should	not	be 23 able	to	get	away	with	that	type	of 24 exploitation .25 Thank	you .2

CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Thank	you .Anybody	else	left ?A	VOICE :		Can	I speak		from		here ? CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :		She		can ' t	stand ? It can	be		short .	But	come	to	the We , I	think ,	actually	at	this	hour 
9	prefer	short .10 MS . VIRGINIA	MALIDINE :	My name	is 11 Virginia	Malidine .	I ' m	a	senior .	I ' m	on fixed 12 income	and	I ' m	not	about	to - -	the	people	have 13 already	testified	plentifully	about	the 14 situation	and	I think	accurately .15 And	I	do	have	some	sympathy	for 16 landlords ,	small	property	owners .	My	father	was 17 last ,	not	least , at	one	time	many	years , he	is 18 deceased ,	was	a small	property	owner .19 He was	not	very	skilled ,	let	alone 20 talented ,	in	the	business .	So he	really	had	no 21 business	being	in it	unless	he	were	prepared	to 22 learn	about	it .23 And	some	of	that	- -	these	lack	of 24 skills	has	been	brought	up	by other	people .25 Now ,	what	I	really	wanted	to	remark 10 
2 on	is that ,	so	far	as	I	know ,	it ' s	rude	when 3 one	person	is	speaking	quite	earnestly	and	to 4 the	point	for	another	person	to	be	in	some	way 5 commenting	and	drawing	attention	from	the 6 person	who	is	speaking	in	a very	proper	way .7 It ' s inappropriate	to	do	that .	It ' s	rude .8 So I	think	whether	you ' re	a9 landlord ,	property	owner ,	small	or	large ,	or 10 whatever	your	capacity	is ,	it really	is not 11 something	that	should	be	done .	It ' s	rude .12 Thank	you .13 CHAIRMAN	MARKUS :	Mr .	Diana ,	we 14 agree .15 In fact ,	if	you	would	like	to	come 16 to	our	final	vote ,	make	that	speech	before	we 17 start	the	vote , maybe	you	can	keep	everybody 18 quiet .19 I	doubt	it	though .20 Okay .21 We stand	adjourned .22 Let	me	just	make	one	comment	so 23 we ' re clear	on	this ,	you	know ,	fuel	and	how	it 24 was	used	last	time .	I	think	there	is	a	lot	of 25 confusion .2 
2 We are	charged	with	a	one	and 3 two - year	lease . That	projection	that	was	made 4 had	nothing	to	do with	the	one - year	lease .	It 5 had	to	do	with	our	projections	of	a	two - year 6 lease	and	what	was	likely	to happen .7 So that	everybody	is	clear , it	was 8 not	a	reimbursement ,	which	is what	our	one - year 9 lease	is ,	but	it was	a	projection	which	turned 10 out	to	be	wrong , and	I	would	bet	that	most	of 11 our	projections	turned	out	to be	wrong	over	the 12 years .13 So I	just	want	to	make	it	clear	as 14 to	where	that	came	from .15 Thank	you .16 The	meeting	is adjourned .17 The	next	meeting	of	the	Rent 18 Guidelines	Board	will	be	a	public	meeting	right 19 here ,	Tuesday ,	the	23 rd	at	5 : 30	when	we expect 20 to	make	a	final	decision .21 Thank	you .22 ( At 8 : 21	o ' clock	p . m .	the 23 proceedings	were	concluded . )24	*	*	*25
