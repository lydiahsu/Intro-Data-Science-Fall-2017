Mr.20 Lubell will go first.21 Mr . Lubell.22 Sit down . Sir, sit down.23 (Audience part icipation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You, sit25 down . Everybody sit down .
3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to4 sit. We've got business to do.

Everybody needs to sit  down.10 (Audience participation.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Everybody12 needs to sit down.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell ,15 are you ready?16 (Audience participation.)17 MR. LUBELL:	Ladies and18 gentlemen, I am sure that Ms. Holder and  Mr.19 Pagan would agree with me that we need to  get20 started and there is also some fairness, at  least21 fairness in hearing all  sides.22 (Audience part icipation.)23 MR. LUBELL:	I'm sure you24 agree, is that correct?25 MS. HOLDER:	We agree .
3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right.4 Let 's try. Mr. Lubell is going to offer a motion.5 Let ' s have decorum in this room.6 Decorum in this room.7 (Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Mr . Lubell ,9	try . Let 's try .10 (Audience part icipation. )11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let 's try to12 have  some quiet , please .13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Please.15 MR. LUBELL :	Mr. Chairman,16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, sir.17 MR . LUBELL:	Members of the18 Board, ladies and  gentlemen:19 Here we are again caught  between20 Schylla and Charibdis. That 's the proverbial	rock21 and the hard place. How do we  maintain22 affordability and preserve the economic  and23 physical  stability of stabilized housing?24 (Audience participation.)25 MR . LUBELL:	That 's our
1	172 perennial conundrum.3 I've been doing this for  twenty-4 one years.5 (Audience participation.)6 MR. LUBELL:	Unfortunat ely,7 (Audience participation.)8 MR. LUBELL:	Unfortunately for9 the last three years, economic and  physical10 stability is lagging further and further  behind.11 (Audience participation.)12 MR. LUBELL:	The picture for13 most of our housing and the tenants,  including14 many of you here, who live in that housing   is15 bleak and the future for that housing and   for16 those tenants, many of whom are here, is  dim.17 We are on the brink of  an18 accelerating shortage of affordable  housing19 (Audience participation.)20 MR. LUBELL:	- - it's getting21 worse  - - with  the number of distressed  buildings22 growing to in excess of ten  percent.23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. LUBELL:	Should we let25 sentiment override hard  facts?
3	MR. LUBELL:	If so, all of you,4 all of you may once again see the boarded - up5 buildings of the '70s and  the early	'80s.6 (Audience participation.)7 MR. LUBELL:	We are all very8 sympathetic to the tenants who can't afford  any9 increase in rent , believe me.10 (Audience participation.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	For many who12 can't , we have evidence that in some areas the13 increase is not collectible  anyway.14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. LUBELL:	And there are many16 tenants who are not here that can afford to  pay17 an increase in rent.18 (Audience participation.)19 MR. LUBELL:	And some of our20 esteemed and your esteemed tenant  advocates21 recognize we are not a welfare agency. We can't  -2223 (Audience participation.)24 MR. LUBELL:	We can't increase25 Sect ion 8 benefits,
3	MR. LUBELL:	much as we4 would like to.5 We can't expand SCRIE, much  as6 we' d like to.7 (Audience participation.)8	MR. LUBELL:	We can't widen the9 number of people who receive food stamps, much   as10 we would like to.11 (Audience participation.)12 MR. LUBELL:	We can't fund any13 social services, much as we' d like to.14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. LUBELL:	Nor can we provide16 tax abatement to owners in exchange for  reduced17 rent.18 (Audience participation.)19 MR. LUBELL:	Nor can we provide20 funds for much needed public housing,  public21 housing that many of you  need.22 As much as we would like to  do23 all of these things, we' re mandated to look at24 certain facts  - -25 (Audience participation.)
2	MR. LUBELL:	- - and make a3 decision that will assist in preserving  the4 housing that many of you live  in.5 (Audience participat ion.)6	MR. LUB ELL :	Let 's review some7 of those facts.8 (Audience participation. )9 MR. LUBELL:	And let 's try and10 listen to some of those facts. It 's for your11	benefit and the Board' s benefit.12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold it.14 For those of you who have  your15 hand raised , this is not a public hearing .   The16 public hearing will take place in June.  Okay?17 This is not a public hearing. This is a  public18 meeting .19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell.21 MR . LUBELL:	Ladies and22 gentlemen, this is my turn . Your representatives23 will get their turn. In America we say that 's24 fair.25 (Audience participation.)
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell.3	MR. LUBELL:	When is a price4 spike no longer a spike? Well , a fuel spike is no5 longer a spike when it lasts for three  years.6 (Audience participation. )7	MR. LUBELL:	We are now growing8 accustomed to $50 a barrel for oil and we  all9 cheer when it briefly dips below  $50.10 (Audience participation.)11	MR. LUBELL:	For those few of12 you who may have cars, you know what it' s like13 when you drive up to a gas  pump.14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. LUBELL:	Our Income and16 Expense Study showed that operating  costs17 increased by 12.6 percent18 (Audience participation.)19 MR. LUBELL:	I know many of you20 are not interested in hearing the facts, but   I21 think it 's important that you do.22 (Audience participation.)2 3	MR. LUBELL:	Income rose by 6.224 percent.25 Those of you who would like  to
2 speak will have an opportunity at a  public3 hearing, but this is the time for  your4 representatives to speak, not just myself , but5 your tenant representatives.6 (Audience participation.)7	MR. LUBELL:	But in a democracy8 we generally make an effort to listen to  both9 sides.10 (Audience participat ion. )11	MR. LUBELL:	In a dictatorship12 we only listen to one  side.13 (Audience participation. )14 MR. LUBELL:	I thought this was15 not a dictatorship.16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The three18 people standing up front , go sit down. Find  seats19 or you will be removed. Find seats .20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Find seats.22 (Audience participation. )23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	People should24 be sitting in their  seats.25 (Audience participation.)
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could we turn3 Mr. Lubell 's mike on, please.4 Mr. Lubell.5	MR. LUBELL :	Our Income and6 Expense Study showed that operating  costs7 increased by 12.6 percent8 (Audience participation.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	and10	income  rose by 6.2 percent	- -11	(Audience participation.)12 MR. LUBELL:	and probably13 rose less than that according to our  staff.14 (Audience participation. )15 MR. LUBELL:	There is no16 likelihood that these costs will  decline.17 (Audience participation.)18 MR. LUBELL:	Net operating19 income has declined by 4 .5 percent. We keep20 taking steps backwards.21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. LUBELL:	We' re about where23 we were in 1989.24 (Audience participation. )25 MR. LUBELL:	The Price Index we
2 reviewed may be flawed , but it still reflects3 cost increases in pre- war buildings, our most4 vulnerable housing, of at least 6.8  percent.5 (Audience participation.)6	MR. LUBELL:	The Price Index is7 also projected to increase 6.7 percent next   year.8 Last year we underest imated the9 projections by 2 percent.10 (Audience participation .)11	MR. LUBELL:	Bear in mind that12 these increases will be higher for pre- war13 buildings and pre- war buildings constitute14 approximat ely seventy percent of our housing15 stock.16 We have  - and I found  this17 number shocking - 1309 distressed  buildings.18 That ' s 10.9 percent  of  the cross sectional19 (Audience participation.)20 MR. LUBELL:	sample of21 buildings that filed RPIE  forms.22 (Audience participation.)23 MR. LUBELL:	Those are24 buildings, many of you may live in  those25 buildings, with operating costs that  exceed
2 income.3 (Audience part icipation.)4	MR. LUBELL:	We have a growing5 number of buildings in New York that are on   the6 verge of being distressed. And distressed  means7 in danger of being eliminated from our  housing8 stock.9 (Audience participat ion.)10 MR. LUBELL:	No one here wants11 to see that.12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. LUBELL:	Insurance costs14 have risen cumulatively by 104 percent over   the15 past  four years.16 (Audience participat ion.)17 MR. LUBELL:	Interest rates are18 heading north. That means mortgages with   higher19 interest rates. Not good for the public.  Earlier20 today, today, the Feds increased by  another21 quarter of a point for the eighth time in a   row22 and they said that more measured increases   are23 likely.24 (Audience participation.)25 MR. LUBELL:	We have had5 
2 testimony of a growing number of costs that  are3 not captured by the Price Index. Local Law  114 remediat ion of sidewalk violations,5 (Audience participation.)6 MR. LUBELL:	- - lead paint7 removal - even though we heard disput ed testimony8 that the law may not have radically changed   since9 last August , owners have testified to the  reality10 of increased costs.11 (Audience participation.)12 MR. LUBELL:	We are also facing13 the specter of the costs of removing toxic  mold.14 These are but a few of the  non-15 captured costs.16 (Audience participation.)17 MR. LUBELL:	No matter how you18 look at it  - -  and thanks to our dedicated  staff19 we have seen reams of charts, reams  of20 statistics, and we've heard testimony  from21 tenants and owners alike.22 (Audience participation.)23 MR. LUBELL:	But we have a24 responsibility here. We have a  responsibility25 (Audience participation. )2 
2 MR. LUBELL:	- - to maintain the3 physical and economic viability of housing   so4 that you will have a place to live and  your5 children will have a place to  live6 (Audience participat ion)7	MR. LUBELL:	- - and your8 grandchildren will have a place to  live.9 (Audience participation.)10 MR. LUBELL:	You have the11 facts. Those of you I commend who have  been12 listening. The picture isn't rosy. We need  to13 make a hard - nosed decision in the face of14 increasing costs and decreasing  profitability15 (Audience participation.)16 MR. LUBELL:	- - and ,17 unfortunately,  increasing inflation.18 (Audience participation.)19 MR. LUBELL:	Accordingly, Mr.20 Chair, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Board,  my21 motion  - -  I make  the following proposals.22 (Audience participation.)23 MR. LUBELL:	I move that the24 following guidelines be permitt ed.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You want to
1	282 hear this?3 (Audience participation.)4	MR. LUBELL:	Six percent for a5 one - year lease renewal ;6 And nine percent	for a two- year7 lease renewal.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.9 We have a motion on the  floor.10	Any debat e?11	The motion is:12 Is there any debate?13 (No response.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Everybody15 heard the motion?16 (No response.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The motion18 is:19 For a one-year lease six 20	percent ;21 A two-year lease nine  percent.22 Any debate?23 (No response. )24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.25 We have additions to the  motion.
2 Go ahead, Mr. Lubell.3 MR. LUBELL:	I move - -4 (Audience participation.)5 MR. LUBELL:	And we heard6 cogent test imony yesterday that this would help a7 great number of owners:8	That upon renewal a one- time9 equalization allowance equal to an additional six10 percent  increase for apartments renting for  $60011 or less and continuously occupied for ten  years12 or more.13 (Audience participation. )14 MR. LUBELL:	Ten years or more.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right.16 The motion is two parts:17 Six and nine percent , one and18 two;19 And in terms of  equalization20 allowance an additional  6 percent  for rents that21 are under $600 and have been in  continuous22 occupancy for over ten years.23 Do I have a second on  that?24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Second.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider
2is the second.3Any debat e?4(Audience participation.)5CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No debate.6I'm going to call the roll  on7the motion. Nodebat e.8Ms. Adams?9MS.

2 The motion fails 7- 2.3 (Audience participation. )4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do we have5	another proposal?6 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you, Chair.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, ma' am.8 MS. HOLDER:	I appreciate9 everyone coming today for the public meeting  and10 I hope that we can keep it a public  meeting11 today. I'm so happy to see so many tenants  here.12 This year it really needs to  be13 about the tenants and it needs to be  about14 affordability.15 And we need to hold to  our16 responsibility as a Board17 (Audience participation.)18 MS. HOLDER:	- - to consider the19 economic factors that we  face.20 It's the same thing that we  say21 every year and I hope that this year it  will22 resonate that enough is  enough.23 (Audience participation.)24 MS. HOLDER:	We know that as25 tenants here in New York City - and I am a  rent
2 stabilized tenant - we know that as tenants  here3 in New York City that we are facing an  uphill4 battle with our moves to try to repeal  the5 Erstadt Law.6 We  understand	- -7 (Audience participation.)8	MS. HOLDER:	We understand that9 the State and people who have no business  with10 New York City are trying to control how we  deal11 with our housing here in the  City.12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. HOLDER:	We understand14 further that the City further ties our hands  with15 their policies here against tenants that  are16 not  - - that are more tenant unfriendly  than  they17 are even society friendly. And we know that  this18 is detrimental to the maintaining of  affordable19 housing here in New York  City.20 We know that a lot of  those21 things this Board cannot control. And we  know22 that with the help of our neighbors that maybe  we23 can change those other  realities.24 But there is a part - we  were25 talking yesterday - where this Board is  relevant.9 
2 And we are relevant in that we continue to have   a3 role. We still have a role in setting what  these4 increases will be for  apartments.5	And part of that is not  just6 considering that prices have gone up, but it   is7 considering that wages have eroded and  that8 tenants cannot afford to stay in this  housing.9 (Audience participation. )10 MS. HOLDER:	Landlords are11 assured a certain percentage of profit because   of12 the actions of this Board and we need to  reflect13 and see where we are.14 Let me tell you what we do  know.15 (Audience participation.)16 MS. HOLDER:	The gap between17 rent and income has continued to widen as  New18 York City has lost more than a half -million19 affordable apartments over the last  decade.20 More than 168,000 housing  units21 were deregulat ed from 1991 to 2002.22 As The New York Times has23 recently reported, there is strong evidence  that24 at this pace deregulation has accelerat ed  in25 recent years and it will only  worsen.
2 Currently, more than one in  four3 or close to one- third of New York City renter4 households pay more than half of its income  in5 rent , and nearly half of rent stabilized tenant6 households have incomes below $30,000 in  the7 City of New York.8 (Audience participation.)9	MS. HOLDER:	By New York City's10 own standards a sufficient wage in which to  live11 and be a product ive member of society here is12 more in line with $55,000 to $65,000 a year.  How13 we are all surviving as New Yorkers is a  good14 question.15 (Audience participat ion.)16 MS. HOLDER:	Although the17 unemployment  rate, as reported in March of this18 year, shows that there has been a drop  in19 unemployment to 5.2 percent , what all the20 statistics showed is that a lot of you all  have21 more jobs but you're earning less than you did   a22 year ago.23 (Audience participation. )24 MS. HOLDER:	Income erosion,25 while owners' profits have increased,  demand
1	362	consideration by this Board.3	Low rent apartments are4 extremely scarce with a vacancy rate of  1.545 percent for units with rents of $500 or less   and6 two percent for units $700 or less. And those   are' 7	occupied units. 8 Upon vacancy landlords are 9 allowed to take exorbitant increases of twenty 1O	percent.11	And what I don' t understand is12 that with those kinds of increases why  additional13 increases upon renewal are necessary when  it14 seems that the apartments that are turning  over,15 a lot of them in low- income neighborhoods,16 continue to realize a substantial jump in   rent.17 The vacancy rate for  rent18 stabilized tenants was 2 .54 percent  less than the19 rate for all other rentals throughout the  City.20 And two- thirds of rent stabilized tenants  live21 outside of Manhattan.  61.3 percent have a  person22 of color as the head of household and one in   four23 has a head of household of 55 or older. It 's  a24 real fact that this Board needs to  consider.25 (Audience participation.)
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.3 MS. HOLDER:	These tenants4 depend on continued existence of  rent5 stabilization in order to be able to afford  to6 remain in their neighborhoods.7 And what this Board is  mandated8 to do is to consider all of those issues  of9 affordability.10 What we are seeing with  the11 increase in people' s base rents with high renewal12 increases placed on top of them is that it 's not13 only forcing folks out , and it has that effect ,14 but it 's also forcing apartments out of the rent15 stabilization pool of apartments. And we  cannot16 allow this to happen.17 We will continue as  neighbors18 and advocates  and people  - -19 (Audience participation .)20 MS. HOLDER:	- - concerned about21 the City - -22 (Audience participation.)2 3	MS. HOLDER:	- - to try to24 improve upon the housing  stock,25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet over
2	there.3	MS. HOLDER:	- - to move that4 New York City has control over what it does   with5 this housing stock.6 But tonight this Board can  make7 sure that anything we pass takes  into8 consideration affordability.9	And for that reason and for the10 increases that New Yorkers have had to sustain   in11 rent hikes in the past , I am proposing that we12 have:13 A flat zero percent  increase for14 one -year leases;15 (Audience participation.)16 MS. HOLDER:	- - and zero17 percent	for two- year leases;18 No adjustment this year. No19 adjustment  this year.20 (Audience participation. )21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Adriene, what22 was the two-year mot ion?2 3	MS. HOLDER:	Zero percent.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.25 Zero and zero plus no  additional
2adjustment.3Do I have a second, Mr.  Pagan?4MR. PAGAN:	Yes.56CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would youlike to make a statement?7MR. PAGAN:	Yes.8CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Okay. Go9ahead.10MR. PAGAN:	Thankyou.11There is one thingthat I agree12 with the owners tonight , that the work that  the13 staff has done, including the work they have   done14 for the year, has been fabulous and  under15 pressure. So we extend thanks from our side   of16 the aisle.17 I second the motion made by  my18 colleague Adriene Holder to freeze  rents19 (Audience participation.)20 MR. PAGAN:	- - with no other21 adjustments.22 Since 2000, we have seen23 increases for apartments per year of 4 and 6 , 4  24	and 6 , 2 and 4, 4.5 and 7.5, 3.5 and 6.5, even  in25	years when there was no merit  for increases.  And
2 that' s for one and two- year leases.3 It 's no wonder that after all4 those increases that tenants are  having5 difficulty meeting  their financial needs.6 In general , most of the tenants7 are using a greater share of their gross  income8 to meet their rent.9 No one has to talk about  how10 much of their disposable income is being used   to11 meet their housing needs. At the lower  income12 levels taxes - and I want to say regressive  taxes13 - take a major portion of their gross income.  And14 that means that there' s no way that you can lower15 your Social Security and Medicare taxes. It's   the16 same for everyone except for the higher  income.17 It is no wonder that the  rent18 collection has dropped since tenants have   reached19 the ability to meet their  contractual20 obligations.21 We also have reservations  about22 trying to get additional income from tenants  by23 bringing additional charges such as a  minimum24 rent surcharge, or as we call it the poor tax,   or25 the longevity surcharge, bett er known as the2 
2 senior citizen tax.3 The intention is to have  rent4 increases that are fair. In both these cases  the5 percentage of increase is well above what  is6 considered  fair for low to moderate income7 families.8	For instance, a $15 surcharge to9 a tenant paying less than $250 is at least  an10 additional six percent  increase in rent. And11 that 's before throwing in another six percent the12 owners want for being there over ten  years.13 On the senior citizen tax  it14 will be a percentage  above whatever we approve.15 If the owners are seeing16 increasing numbers of persons falling behind   in17 their rent , an action of this kind will make  the18 problem worse .19 Maybe there will be an  increase20 in the overall income of the tenant , but at a21 greater cost to the owner since it will   require22 more legal actions to maintain their  collections.23 Today I am asking my  fellow24 Board Members to remember the plight of  the25 tenants in meeting  their obligations and join  us9 
2	in getting and consider and approve our  request3	in order.4	Recently there was a movie5	called "A Day Without a Mexican. " It came out  in6 which it depicts the problem in California.   If7 all Mexicans were not available to do their   work,8 many of the services that we take for  granted9 were not there, the population of the State as  a10 whole suffers.11	Imagine now our City divorced of12 service providers because they depend on  low-13 income wages and there is nowhere for them  to14 reside.15 (Audience participation.)16 MR. PAGAN:	It will not be a17 pretty picture.18 We need to hold onto  those19 precious resources of affordable rents for all   of20 our citizens no matt er what their economic  scale21 is.22 At this time we cannot count  on23 new construction, but rather those buildings   that24 were built a long time ago and provide the  most25 affordabl e rents available because their
2 construction costs have been amortized over  a3 long period of time.4 Thank you.5	(Audience participation.)6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The motion7 before the house is:8 A zero across- the-board motion.9 Any discussion?10 (No response.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No12 discussion.13 Let me call the roll.14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Adams?16 MS.

2 So that 's - - a zero equalization3 allowance;4 In the event of a sublease5 governed by Subdivision	(e) of Section 2525.6 of6 the Rent Stabilization Code, the  allowance7 authorized by such Subdivision shall be  ten8 percent ;9 Fractional terms, loft10 escalator clauses, I read it  before;11	In terms of the proposed special12 guideline:13 For dwelling units subject  to14 the Rent and Rehabilitation Law on September 30,15 2005, which become vacant after September 30,16 2005, the special guideline shall be the  greater17 of :18 Fifty percent above the  Maximum19 Base Rent - the same as last year;  or20 The Fair Market Rent.21 This is the same motion as  last22 year.23 That 's - - both places it24 appears, both the proposed  special guideline  and25 the decontrolled units.
2 That 's the motion.3 Let me repeat it .4 2 to 4.5 for a one-year  lease;5 4 to 7 percent for a two- year6 lease;7 Zero for the supplemental8 adjustment ;9 Zero for the equalization10 allowance;11	Ten percent in the event of a12 sublease;13 Fifty percent above the MBR  for14 proposed  special guideline or the Fair Market15 Rent ,  in both places.16 Do I get a second on that17 motion?18 MS.

ADAMS:	I join Mr. Pagan in20 thanking the staff for the work that  they've21 given us.22 And I think Ms. Holder' s point23 with regard to affordability of housing  is24 certainly one that we have been very conscious   of25 throughout  this time.
2 The fact that we have not  yet3 had public testimony and that there are  other4 things that we are looking into, including  lead5 based paint , leads me to believe  that , in  terms6 of assuring that there is adequate housing   stock7 and that at the same time it is affordable  to8 tenants who have had increases in education,  in9 transportation,	just as landlords have had10 increases in other things, with the  preliminary11 nature of this vote I vote  yes.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Adams13 votes yes.14 Ms. Holder?15 MS.

ZELNIK:	This motion17 reflects at least at the low end an area where   I18 think reason can prevail.19 I'm certainly not supportive  of20 the higher ends of either the one year or the   two21 year. I think we've heard a lot of testimony  at22 this point and I don' t think, while I believe23 additional testimony will be very helpful ,  I24 think there' s a lot of information out there that25 we hear and read and see everyday that   indicates
2 the loss of housing, the loss of Section 8,  the3 fact that the City is not building  housing,4 affordable housing, and they  should.5	So while I do support this  and6 vote yes, I'm very concerned that we keep it  at7 the very low end and not have the big spread  that8 we had last year.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Zelnik10 votes yes.11 The Chair votes yes.12 The motion passes: 5- 4.13 We stand in recess for  fifteen14 minutes.15 (Audience participation.)16 (At 6:45 o'clock p.m. there was17 a recess in the proceedings. )18 (At 7:00 o'clock p.m. the19 proceedings  were resumed.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' re ready to21 get started again.22 The next thing we are going  to23 deal with is Hotel Apartments.24 Let me read the guideline.25 Proposed  - - this is the New York

2of rentadjustment over the lawful rent  actually3chargedand paid on September 3 0 , 2005 shall be  O4percentif:5	11    (1) Permanent rent stabilized6 or rent controlled tenants paying no more  than7 the legal regulated rent at the time that  any8 rent increase in this Order would otherwise  be9 authorized , constitute fewer than 75 percent of10 all units in a building that are used  or11 occupied , or intended, arranged or designed to be12 used or occupied in whole or in part as the  home13 residence, or sleeping place of one or more  human14 beings;15 " (2) On any individual  unit the16 owner has failed to provide to the new  occupant17 of that unit a copy of the Rights and Duties  of18 Hotel Owners and Tenants, pursuant  to Section1925.22.5oftheRent  Stabilization Code."20To repeat the motion:21O  to 2 percent , the range;22No vacancy allowance;23With the so- called provision.24Do I have a second on that25motion?

KAUFMAN:	I would just like20 to request that the staff do more of a study  of21 the rooming house segment of the market so  that22 we could determine at the final vot e whether  it23 might be appropriat e to adopt a different24 guideline  for that class.25 But I'm in favor of  the
2	proposal.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Kaufman,4	yes.5	Mr. Lubell?6	MR. LUBELL:	No.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell,8	no.9	Ms. Lusskin?10	MS. LUSSKIN:	Yes, on the same11	logic that we had with the apartment vote, that12 we are at a very early stage in the process,   we13 have public hearings coming up, so a range   is14 appropriate.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Lusskin16 votes yes.17 Mr. Pagan?18 MR.

2	MR. ZELNIK:	Although  I think3 the range is appropriate for today's meeting,   I4 am very hopeful that when we come to the  final5 vote, that we will be at the zero level as we   did6 last year.7 Vote yes.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Zelnik9	vot es yes.10 The Chair votes yes.11 The motion passes 5-4.12 Loft guidelines. I have to  find13 the right piece of paper.14 Okay.15 Proposed Amendments  for the Loft16 Apartments  in the Category of Buildings  Covered17 by Articl e 7-C of the Multiple Dwelling Law.18 "The Rent Guidelines Board19 proposes the following levels of rent   increases20 above the base rent as defined in Section  286,21 Subdivision 4, of the Multiple Dwelling Law,   for22 units to which these guidelines are applicable in23 accordance with Article 7- C of the Multiple24 Dwelling Law:25 " For one -year  increase periods10 
2 commencing on or after October 1, 2005 and on or3 before September 30, 2006, blank  percent.4	" For two- year increase periods5 commencing on or after October 1, 2005 and on or6 before September 30, 2006, blank  percent.7 "Vacant  loft units  - proposal.8 "No Vacancy Allowance is9 permitted under this Order. Therefore, except as10 otherwise provided  in Section 286 , Subdivision11	6 •  • • II	actually blank vacancy allowance, we' ll12 see what the motion is.13 " Therefore , except  as otherwise14 provided in Section 286, Subdivision 6, of the15 Multiple Dwelling Law, the rent charged to   any16 tenant for a vacancy tenancy commencing on  or17 after October 1, 2005 and on or before  September18 30 , 2006 may not  exceed the	'base rent '19 referenced above plus the level of  adjustment20 permitted  above  for increase  periods. "21 Is there any motion?22 (No response.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The Chair24 will make a motion.25 I would make the same motion,12 
2 that we adopt for public hearing purposes  the3 same range and no vacancy allowance. It 's the4 same range that we just adopted for  apartments,5 which will be 2 to 4.5 and 4 to 7 for a two- year6 lease, and no vacancy allowance for the  lofts.7 Do I hear a second?8 MS. KAUFMAN:	Second.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Second.10	Any discussion?11	Go ahead , Mr. Pagan.12 MR. PAGAN:	Second.13 I just want to talk in  reference14 to the lofts. This is an area where many of  the15 costs are borne by the  leaseholder.16 And I believe that even the  217 percent is too high. I would like to see  that18 lowered.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any22 additional debate?23 (No response.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Adams?25 MS.

2CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms.Adams3vot es yes.4Ms. Holder?5MS. HOLDER:	For thesame6 reasons that my colleague David Pagan stated ,7 this range is not a good place to start if  there8is supposedtobe reasonable debate about  loft9tenants.10I vote no to this motion.11CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Holder,12no.13Ms. Kaufman?14MS.

2 votes no.3 Mr. Schleider?4	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Similarly, we5 have not had the type of exploration on  this6 topic as we need to. And in that case I  can't7 vote for this. We need to explore how much   these8 landlords' costs have actually gone up.9	The answer is no.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider11 vot es no.12 Mr. Zelnik?13 MR. ZELNIK:	I would like to14 agree with Mr. Schleider in one respect , and  that15 is, I think we do need to explore this a  little16 bit more, especially in terms of the  utilities17 that are provided by the loft  dweller.18 While I would again vote  for19 this, I believe we have to really look at  the20 energy cost that is paid by the tenant in  making21 sure that there is a fair reduction reflected   in22 that particular cost.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You voted?24 MR. ZELNIK:	Yes.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Zelnik10
