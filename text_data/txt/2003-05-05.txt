We've22 also had our Board deliver to us various   studies23 on various aspects that we' re charged by law to24 evaluate.25 And  tonight , as I think most of6 
2 you know, is our preliminary vote on a guideline.3 We are going to start with  the4 rent stabilized apartment sector. Then we  are5 going to go to the so- called special guideline6 which deals with the guideline differences when   a7 unit comes out of rent control and goes into   rent8 stabilization. That guideline is utilized by   the9 State Division of Housing and Community  Renewal10 to adjudicate any complaints associat ed with11 units converting from rent controlled to  rent12 stabilized status.13 We will then go to rent14 stabilized hotels and then to go the  loft15 guidelines.16 With that I would like the  Board17 Members to introduce themselves and then we   will18 move immediately to the business at  hand.19 We could start - -20 MS.

LUBELL:	Mr. Chairman,9 Fellow Board Members:10 No one ever said this is easy,11 part icularly for Board Members who are here for12 the first time and received reams of informat ion.13 It ' s a diff icult problem.14 You' re confronted with soaring15 costs for owners, low inflation,  higher16 unemployment , the usual  some people  who can' t17 afford any increase in rent .18 I'm sure the same considerat ions19 were before the City when they raised real  estate20 taxes by more than eighteen percent and the  same21 considerat ions were before the MTA when they22 raised fares by thirty- three and a third percent ,23andthe Water Board who I understand will pass  or24haspassed a six- and - a - half percent increase for25theumpteenth year in a row.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 But here we are with a3 responsibility as the guardians of housing   for4 future generations.5 By failing to pass an  adequate6 guideline , we can easily promot e the failure to7 maintain our aging housing stock and also  promot e8 widespread  abandonment as happened in the	'60s9 and the	'70s.10 Before we vot e, we need to look11 at some hard realit ies and inescapable facts.12 This year' s increased cost to13 owners is not some one time aberrat ion that  will14 evaporat e with next year' s Price Index or I & E15 Statement. This is, for example, the sixth  year,16 consecut ive year, that tax assessments for  rent17 stabilized buildings have increased. Next   year18 will probably be the  seventh.19 And if by some miracl e20 assessments aren't increased next year, we   know21 for certain that the tax rate will rise by  at22 least seven- and - a- half percent.23 For the smaller owners -  and24 they constitute the larger number of owners  -25 this is the tenth consecutive year that non- union2 
2	labor pay outpaced union labor  wages.3	Water and sewer charges will4 continue to rise and even after next year  with5 the construction of the new aqueduct and the  need6 to pay for that.7 These charges went  up six- and -8 a- half percent this past year and I told you what9 happened just now.10 We've heard a lot about11 insurance and I'm not going to review that  whole12 ugly picture  again. But  it ' s interest ing to note13 that the largest increases for insurance  costs,14 and this surprised me as well , were in Queens and15 in the Bronx where there are large numbers  of16 small owners, not Manhattan.17 And these costs  unfortunately18 were rising before  9/11.19 Notice that I haven' t even20 mentioned	fuel because even if you eliminate  this21 unpredictable cost , the core Price Index rose  by22 10.6 percent  and it ' s predicted  to rise by 9.423 percent  in 2004.24 You've also heard testimony  and25 read about a host of costs that are not  captured4 
2	by a Price Index, such as lead abatement costs  -3	- these aren't minimal  costs  - -	Local  Law #114 facade inspections, compliance with  Fire5 Department safety regulations, DHCR  annual6 registration fees, among other  charges.7	How are these dramatically8 increasing costs going to be paid for and who  is9 going to pay for them? Where' s the money coming10 from to pay for an aging population of  housing?11 When I started here, the  average12 housing was I believe sixty years old and  that13 was many moons ago.14 Who is going to pay the  huge15 increased cost imposed by our  government?16 Before you make a decision,  let17 me share some history with  you.18 The Price Index has shown  double19 digit increases twenty percent of the time  since20 its inception . This is not new. This year is21 surprising but not historic. Far from  it.22 We've also had double digit23 increases in the past especially when we had  a24 choice of one, two or three-year leases. And  in25 those years we had a double digit increase  for8 
2 the third year approximately  fourteen times.3 We also had double digit4 increases for the second and even the first  year.5 So it 's not something that would be entirely new.6 And when we had large  increases,7 there was not an explosion of evictions for  non-8 payment. There was not an explosion  of9 proceedings  for non- payment. There was not an10 explosion of homelessness, which is more than  an11 issue that deals with the payment of rent.  And12 there was not a mass exodus from the  City.13 Today, as for many years,  there14 is a segment of our population unfortunately   that15 can't afford their current rent or even a  one16 percent  increase. Some small segment we have17 figures on unbelievably pay at least a  hundred18 percent of their income for rent. This is   not19 new. It 's unfortunate, but it 's not new. It has20 existed for the thirty- five year history of rent21 stabilization.22 Those households are burdened  by23 low incomes. And , unfortunately, we here on  the24 Board can't do anything about it. We are  all25 sympathetic to the homeless and the  unemployed.2 
2 But aren't those unfortunate3 peopl e the responsibility of all of us, all of  us4 who are not homeless or unemployed? It 's a5 government  social problem.6 You may have also heard7 testimony that maybe rents are constrained  by8 market conditions and many tenants  receive9 preferent ial rents. The issue of affordability,10 please remember that the median rent burden   in11 New York City  - that means most  people  -  is12 slightly below the national median rent  burden,13 twenty- seven percent versus twenty- eight percent ,14 and well below the HUD standard of  thirty15 percent.16 This translate into the  fact17 that many people can afford a rent  increase.18 The only way that owners,  most19 owners, can pay for soaring costs is  by20 increasing rents, and especially from   apartments21 that are below market. And the alternative   is22 deterioration of a large segment of our   housing23and we hereon the Board will wind up as  the24gatekeepersfor abandonment.25We have to make a  sensible,
1	122 realistic  increase ,  provide  for a sensible,3 realist ic increase in light of the facts and  the4 numbers that we have .5	Accordingly,	I'm prepared to6 make a proposal after comments by my  colleague,7 Mr. Schleider.8	MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you, Mr.9	Lubell .10 That was  quite  comprehensive ,11 hits all the points that the landlords have   been12 calling for .13 A PARTICIPANT:	Can't hear you.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I just might15 want to point out one  thing.16 The costs to the landlords  have17 been incurred and these costs are  rising.18 Insurance costs have been incurred since the   fall19 of 2001 through 2002.20 Fuel costs have gone up21 tremendously over the past six months  and22 cont inue to be a source of uncertainty for23 landlords.24 And we've had test imony and25 studies showing that over the past ten years  or10 
1	132 so twenty- five percent of those years exhibited3 increases in fuel in excess of twenty- five4 percent from the prior year. These types  of5 swings need to be addressed to smooth it out   for6 the landlords.7	We've had increases going on in8 wat er and sewer rates . And these increases are9 paid for in real dollars from the landlords   and10 in a real t ime manner. The types of increases11 that the Rent Guidelines Board presents,   passes12 through, take into account or take effect   almost13 a year after the fact that these costs have  been14 incurred directly by the  landlord.15 This lag period is unfortunat e16 for landlords, but they have to maintain  the17 habitability.  They have to maintain the  services.18 And they have to do this on a real time  basis.19 The time has come for tenants  to20 really have a fair share in this type of   burden21 for the landlords because the landlords  are22 providing housing . And you've had testimony  to23 show that over the past half - dozen years the24 quality and condit ions of the housing stock  have25 improved dramatically.8

SCHLEIDER:	Landlords are7 putting capital monies back into these  properties8 to maintain this aging housing  stock.9	Real estate taxes go up. If  they10 go up tremendously, that has to be paid for  in11 real time dollars.12 The burden for the landlords13 needs to be shared with tenants. And, as  Mr.14 Lubell  said , it 's time for a real istic15 apportionment of those burdens.16 MR. LUBELL:	Mr. Chair, I move17 that the following guidelines be  permitted.18 And I must preface my mot ion by19 saying that I personally feel that a  higher20 guideline is clearly justif ied by the numbers.21 But I am ameliorating any proposal by reason  of22 the impact that it might  have.23 Clearly  - - I mean I 've heard24 seventeen and twenty some odd percent. As  you25 said, I don' t think that would have been a real ,10 
1	152 responsible guideline.3 But I do feel that nine  percent4 for one- year and a twelve percent	for two years -56 (Audience participation.)7 MR. LUBELL:	- -  is a responsible8	and reasonabl e guideline under the facts that we9	have.10 I also move  for - - shall I make11 all the other moves?12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No.13 So do I hear your mot ion is:14 Nine percent for a one- year15 guideline;16 Twelve percent  for a two- year;17 Is that what you are  saying?18 MR.

Can everyone hear  me?10 PARTICIPANTS:	Yes.11 MS. HOLDER:	Good evening.12 It has been an interesting  day.13 It 's particularly been a very interesting news14 day.15 We  have  The Daily News " Fares,16 Taxes, Fines, Tolls Are Putting New Yorkers  in17 The Big  Squeeze. 1118 And then we have at Crain' s19 today, we have  " Owners embrace regulated  space. 1120 It has been an interesting  news21 day.22 It ' s interest ing to me because23 it really reveals what 's going on here in New24 York City. And I want to talk about some of  the25 things that this Board has already  heard10 
2 testimony about , but just to bring it out3 further.4 We are a Board of nine  members.5 We have two tenant members, two owner members  and6 five public members. And we have to do what 's7 best given the mandate from the  Rent8 Stabilization Law. Doing what 's best is balancing9 many reports that we had presented to us as   well10 as expert testimony that was present ed to us last11 week.12 We have to talk about issues  of13 income and expense. We have to talk about  the14 Price Index of Operating Costs. We have  to15 consider very seriously issues of income  and16 affordability as well as looking at our  mortgage17 survey.18 What we find when we look at  all19 of these things is right now for tenants   the20 picture is extremely bleak, but it' s one that  we21 have to consider when we talk about   affordability22 and the responsibility of this  Board.2 3	We know that there are a ton  of24 recessive taxes that are being hit on the  working25 class. And folks that we care about here,   those24 
1	202 that we have some control over, their  regulated3 space, we are talking about those who have  a4 median income of $31,000 a  year.5	The truth is that unemployment6 is at an all time high. For twenty- eight months7 now New York City has been experiencing a  deep8 and prolonged recession, one that affects  this9 whole City and the quality of life of New  Yorkers10 in this	City.11 We are seeing unemployment  rates12 as high as eleven percent	in the Bronx. We know13 9.2 percent for New York City as a  whole.14 This is real and it has  an15 effect on what rent regulated tenants can do   in16 terms of paying for their  rent.17 What we also know equally is  bad18 is that real wages for tenants in New York  have19 gone down and have not kept up with the rate  of20 inflation. This is bad again for all New  Yorkers21 especially those renters, but all New Yorkers   as22 we have seen a decline in our economy because   of23 that .24 What we also know and really  is25 undisput ed , and I can't claim ignorance to the6 
1	212 fact , is that property taxes have increased. What3 we do understand is that insurance rates  have4 increased for many reasons, some having to  do5 with the horrific events of September 11th,  but6 also most doing because of the decline in  our7 economy and the problems that we have with  Wall8 Street.9	There are serious burdens that10 are going on for all New Yorkers and we are   all11 being asked to bail our City  out.12 What we have to do here for  a13 Guidelines Board though is figure out , in  terms14 of New Yorkers' responsibility to bail the   City15 out , where it should fall and how properly  and16 proportionat ely it should fall.17 Let 's just review some of the18 things that we know, the things that we know  to19 be the truth.20 What I understand	is that in the21 last decade rents have gone up so much   faster22 than operating costs that on the  average23 landlords of rent stabilized properties  in  New24 York City have seen a gigantic increase in   their25 net operating incomes.10 
2 In the early 1990s they were3 spending roughly sixty- five cents of every rent4 dollar on operat ing costs, leaving thirty- five5 cents for debt service and prof it . By 2000, the6 most recent numbers available , they were  spending7 only fifty- six cents on operating costs leaving8 them with a net  of forty- four cents. That ' s not9 bad in this economy.10 We have more than  compensated11 owners for operating costs, and the  increases12 that we gave last year have shown that in a year,13 last year, when rents should have been adjusted  -14 tenants were calling for a rollback then as  we15 recall , that at the very least rents should have16 been frozen - this Board gave landlords two  and17 four percent	increases, much more than what  the18 data would have shown was  necessary.19 And so we know these truths  and20 we see this and we know the big squeeze is   going21 on and New Yorkers are feeling that they are   all22 wrung out. And The Daily News did  wonderful23 coverage on what is the state of New Yorkers,   all24 New  Yorkers,  including the property	- - real25 estate property owners.2 
2 But at the same t ime I see that3 we have Robert Nelson, who reaps the benefits  of4 owning 1,000 rent regulated apartments in  the5 City while other real estate sectors lag.  And6 what does it say when we hear of owners  embracing7 regulated space? We hear that landlords  are8 snapping up apartment buildings and they  are9 doing it while they know that the owners  of10 commercial office buildings and the landlords  of11 luxury rental towers fight to find  tenants.12 Robert Nelson says that  with13 1,000 apartments located in Brooklyn,  Manhattan14 and the Bronx, he is smack in the middle of  one15 of the hottest segments in the New York  real16 estate market , mult i - family rent regulated17 apartment buildings.18 He says this is a unique time  in19 our industry. Even peopl e who don' t understand20 the market are getting into it. And there  are21 several reasons for the rush to rent  regulated22 buildings. The stock market is volatil e and23 commercial real estate is too risky for  many24 investors. Financing is cheap. Rent  regulated25 buildings of fer a consistent return it says.2 
2	I said publicly and I'll  say3 again that we are all hurting here in New  York4 City, but the one sector that seems to be  making5 money here in New York City is the real  estate6 sector.7 (Applause.)8	MS. HOLDER:	Let ' s get real.9	Are they going to have  increased10 costs this year? I think we had test imony that11 shows that they probably will. But does that  mean12 that they are not going to be making money,  that13 they are not going to have  profits?14 We have small landlords who  come15 before us and say that they want double  digit16 increases but at the same t ime tell us that they17 can't realize those increases because  their18 tenants are at market rate  levels.19 Then who will we be giving  the20 increases too and for what?21 Is it really a ruse or a  guise22 for something else? Is it for money?  Property23 owners to move these units out of control , out of24 rent regulated status?25 Let ' s not be a tool for a larger10 
2 agenda. The Rent Guidelines Board knows that  we3 have a responsibility and we know that we are   not4 a mere formula. We will balance all of  these5 relevant data and indices.6 But what I am asking is that  we7 come clean and understand what is the truth  out8 there. We must bail our City out . This is a  rough9 time. But landlords continue to make profits   and10 tenants continue to suffer.11 And to the extent when we  heard12 testimony that landlords are talking about   the13 non- payment proceedings that they are losing14 money on, that is an issue around   affordability15 again because peopl e are not making enough money16 to sustain high rents.17 And those same landlords  are18 telling us - and I met one from East  Flatbush19 also who said the Rent Guidelines Board can't   do20 anything for me. I can't realize an increase   on21 my units. I need for my tenants to be able  to22 work consistently so that they can pay the  rent ,23 the rent that is already at market he  said.24 I think that we need to  really25 understand  what ' s going  on. And  for these small2 
2 landlords who may seem to have more buildings  but3 whose units actually constitute something  like4 twelve and thirteen percent of the  entire5 universe of rent regulated units, let 's get real6 and  let ' s understand  what we are talking about.7 (Applause.)8	MS. HOLDER:	Robert Nelson says9 it all for us right here. Rent  regulated10 buildings  offer a consistent  return and that ' s11 good for you all. It offers a consistent  return.12 So having said that and  giving13 consideration to the things that are going  on,14 having said that and understanding that last  year15 there should have been a readjustment of  the16 rents or at the very least a rent freeze , Chair,17 I move that our rent regulated apartments here  in18 New York City, given all of the reports  and19 expert test imony that 's before us, I propose:20 A one percent increase on  one-21 year leases;22 And a two percent increase  on23 two-year leases.24 (Applause.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there a9 
2	second?3	MR. PAGAN:	Mr. Chairman,4 Members of the Rent Guidelines Board , New5 Yorkers:6 I second Ms. Holder' s motion of7 one and two percent .8 We understand  that  - - some of9 the problems  owners have this year.  It ' s easy to10 see that life has changed in the City ever  since11 September 11th, 2001.12 It has changed for the  owners,13 for the tenants and those that are not under  our14 considerat ion tonight.15 But let us look at history . As16 per Jack Freund' s test imony in the afternoon of17 May 1, 2003 , over the past ten years cost18 increases have been very benign. This is  his19 quote.20 Well , let ' s look at the increase21 cost over the past twelve years as reported  by22 our staff in the 2003 Income and Expense  Report.23 The average rent growth over that period of t ime24 was 4.5 percent. The average income growth  was25 4.5 percent . Average NOI for the return was 5. 84 
  2 percent . So that was actually a growth of  income3 while everything else stayed constantly the   same.4 As recently as last year,  the5 staff recommendat ions were:6 Traditional commensurate rate7 from zero to zero;8 Net revenue commensurate  rate,9 minus 2.25 and minus 1.02 ;10 Net revenue commensurat e11 adjustment  with vacancy  increase,  minus  5.0 ,12 minus 3 .5;13 CPI- adjusted NOI commensurate14 rate, zero and zero;15 CPI - adjust ed NOI commensurat e16 adjustment with vacancy increase, minus 3 .5 and 17	1.75.18 Even though negative  numbers19 were called for, tenants were hit with a two   and20 four percent  increase. That has been the  truth21 through most of my term on the Board with  the22 same - -  looking at the same  results.23 Thus, I believe  it's only fair24 that when we now see larger than anticipat ed25 increases, we must make up for those times  when18 
2 no increase was called for by approving the  one3 and two percent called for by Ms.  Holder.4 Thank you.5 (Audience part icipation. )6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mot ion is7 seconded.8 Any debate?9 Yes, Mr. Lubell.10 MR. LUBELL:	This is my11 eighteenth year here.12 A PARTICIPANT:	Time to retire.13 MR. LUBELL:	I haven' t seen - -14 because I have a service to  offer.15 I don' t think two or four16 percent is the cat 's meow. For most owners it17 didn't pay for the six percent core price  index18 increase.19 (Audience part icipation. )20 MR. LUBELL:	And as far as Mr.21 Nelson is concerned , ask him if he' s flocking to22 Flatbush, Elmhurst , Woodside, East New York, the23 Grand Concourse, South Bronx, East Bronx,  West24 Bronx, Howard Beach, and most of the  other25 neighborhoods where most of the people in  New7 
2 York live.3 He' s not buying buildings there.4 It ' s still 1   as we all know 1	a Tale of Two Cit ies.5 And the second city is extended from Manhattan   to6 gentrif ied areas in Brooklyn and some little7 gentrif ied areas in the Bronx.8 But most of the people don' t9 live there and Nelson is not buying  those10 properties.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is that it?12 Ms. Holder.13 MS. HOLDER:	Most of the people14 in rent regulated housing have median incomes of 15	$3 11 000 a year.16 Most of the real estate  owners17 of New York City have median incomes of over 18	$150 , 000 a year.19 I think what people need to20 understand and what we need to be real about  -21 because  I've been to the neighborhoods that  you22 are talking about. I don't think I have been  to23 some of the neighborhoods that other people  might24 talk about such as I don't think I've ever  been25 to Bayridge 1  but I've been to Mott Haven 1	I'veROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES 1  INC.521 Fifth Avenue 1  New York, New York 10175
2 been to East New York. I've been to  East3 Flatbush. I've been to various parts of Queens.   I4 know how people live and I understand the  burdens5 that those have to sustain .6	And , again, time and t ime again,7 year after year, we hear small landlords  talk8 about the concerns they have about  increased9 costs. And we are sympathetic to some of  them.10 Not all of my colleagues are sympathetic to  all11 of them, but I'm sympathetic to all of them.  And12 I'll tell you why.13 Because we know that they have  a14 different type of market that they are  dealing15 with. And , again, their market can't sustain or16 absorb those increases. They are, most of  those17 units, at the market rate. And so the same  way18 that we have the owner representative who  asks19 one of our advocates, well , what are you doing  to20 increase incomes for low income folks, what  are21 you doing to make sure that they have stable   jobs22 and supportive services, I ask what is the  Rent23 Stabilization Association doing to assist  those24 landlords in real terms about their taxes  and25 lobbying to get their taxes down, to see  about7 
1	322 giving them subsidies  if that ' s what  they need .3 But what I don' t seem to4 understand  is why people go for increases that5 this populat ion of owners, that everyone6 proclaims to really care about , are telling us7 that they cannot sustain these increases .8	And we hear it time and  time9 again. The lowest rents  - -  there's a  correlation10 between the lowest rents and folks who have  the11 lowest income. And as a result , that is a problem12 that we see. But there' s nothing that the Rent13 Guidelines Board can do about it. That is  the14 market , something that the owners seem to15 embrace, the market working.16 And that 's what we see.17 And so to ask for any type  of18 increase that would be unreasonable at this time ,19 at this time, would be unconscionabl e and20 irresponsible.21 We do have to bail our City  out22 and it is unfortunate that it 's taking the role23 of increased taxes to everyone, increased  fares24 to everyone , increased fees for everything on25 everyone.9 
1	332 But , again, we have to look. We3 have a responsibility and we have an  opportunity4 to try to take some of this burden off of low   and5	moderat e income New Yorkers who constitute  the6	majority of folks in these  units.7	And , again, I would hope that8 folks would vote this year - we do this yearly  -9 on a one and two percent  increase.10 (Audience participation. )11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.12 Schleider.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you, Mr.14 Chairman.15 Yes, the landlords have  had16 reasonable operating experiences with these17 properties up unt il this past year.18 A PARTICIPANT:	Then why did you19 get a rent increase?20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Because this21 Board wasn' t - - didn' t have the foresight  to22 anticipate the type of  increase.23 The landlords are still  behind24 the curve here.25 (Audience participation. )12 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Eighteen3 percent real estate tax increases is very  real.4	Now, Ms. Holder mentioned	that5 some landlords can't collect increases in  rent6 because those rents are already at market.   Yes,7 it ' s diff icult to attract more than market  rent8 for an apartment.9	However, what she failed to10 point out was that within a building you can   have11 disparat e rent levels. You can have one tenant  at12 market and one tenant hundreds of dollars  below13 that level for a comparable apartment that   the14 landlord is providing the same level of heat ,15 services and habitability.16 The Rent Guidelines'  increases17 are meant to bring that tenant' s rent up to  or18 closer to or approach a market rent so that  the19 landlord can become whole.20 You are having disparate  classes21 within a building of tenancies. The tenants  at22 market rents that come in after other tenants  in23 the building are picking up the slack for  those24 other tenants who had been there  for  - -25 (Audience participation. )10 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	for a longer3 period of time and enjoy a posit ive leasehold4 posit ion relative to what their neighbors just5 moving into the building are  paying.6 How can you face your neighbors7 knowing that you have that type of   - -8 (Audience participat ion.)9	MR. DIANA:	Excuse me. Can we10 get quiet the same way we were quiet for  the11 tenant representative?	It goes both ways.12 (Audience participat ion.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sir, sir.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	There is no15 grand design here as nefarious as the  tenant16 representat ive would make it out to be. It 's just17 an equalization, an equalization  of sharing18 amongst the tenant class  themselves.19 (Audience participation.)20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The burden21 needs to be shared.22 (Audience participation.)23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The burden24 needs to be shared.25 And a one and two percent  just10 
2 takes advantage of a situat ion that the tenant3 representative  knows exists.4 (Audience participation .)5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sir, sir .6	This is not a debate.7 Mr. Schleider, continue.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	One benefit of9 the rent stabilization law is assured right  of10 lease renewal for tenants . You have a leasehold11 to stay for as long as you want . That doesn' t12 exist in most cities and certainly for this  City13 it has been a building block .14 But that right needs to be15 valued. It needs to be valued by the tenants to   a16 point that they say, yes, we are willing  to17 share , we are will ing to share in the expenses to18 provide for our housing. We understand that  we19 have securities here that don't exist in  most20 cities.21 Let 's face it . This is the best22 city in the universe .23 (Audience part icipation. )24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Why not have25 the right for lease renewal? But it comes at  a9 
2price. You needto share the cost of  maintaining3the properties.4(Audience participation.)5CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' re done?6Thank you.7Mr. Pagan, go ahead .8MR. PAGAN:	I just quickly want9 to bring out that our job is not to  bring10 apartments to market  rent.11 And I'm just going to quote  Dan12 Margulies  who mentioned  that and  indicate that ' s13 not our job. Our job is to ensure that   whatever14 increase is a fair increase for both the  tenants15 and the owners.16 We' re not here to be looking to17 make things right of what happened in 1900.  We18 are to make sure that those increases are in   line19 with the things that we have been doing over  the20 last ten to twelve years.21 At  the same time the issue of ,22 when we look at what is it that the owners  are23 getting, the owners are getting insurance  that24 when they bring those leases over to the  tenants,25 they' re almost accepting whatever we say here9 
2 verbatim .3 And that was part of the  things4 that came out in the hearings when our  people5 were asking us to approve a percentage  because6 although they were at market , it made it easy  for7 them to raise the  rent .8 And if we are looking to  bring9 things back to market , most of the small owners10 will have to roll back  - - we will have to   bring11 back the rents lower in order to meet most of   the12 small owners.13 The larger owners, which have14 most of the apartments, would probably benef it15 even with one percent with no problem. But  that 's16 where most of the apartments  are.17 In the smaller units, the18 smaller owners don't have the same share of  units19 out there and are probably struggling more.  But20 they are unable to raise those rents as high  as21 they would like because their market doesn' t22 allow them to do that.2 3	MS. HOLDER:	Could I - -24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure. You25 have the floor as long as you  want.24 
2MS. HOLDER:	You know, be3careful.4(Laughter.)5CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No problem.6MS. HOLDER :	People out there7	know me. So be careful.8 (Audience participation. )9 MS. HOLDER:	RSA' s own treatise10 or document or testimony acknowledged that  many11 buildings and owners benefit  from revenue12 enhancements other than the guidelines  authorized13 by RGB.14 And this is an important  factor15 that  I really want  the RGB  to consider .16 While RSA claims that  many17 owners must rely only on the guidelines,  it gives18 no indication of how many or how extensive   this19 may be.20 And  I just say that , again, to21 go towards this whole issue as we continue   to22 talk about it. Units that still comprise  less23 than thirteen percent of the universe, but as  we24 talk about those units we must remember that  many25 of those units and the owners of those  units10 
2 still are getting other types of  revenue3 enhancements.4 Tenants are still sacked with5 MCI increases and a number of other  revenue6 enhancements that the landlords know the   tenants7 have to live with forever even after  those8 improvements,  so- called improvements, are done.9 So, again, I would just  hope10 that this Board would seriously consider  my11	motion for one percent on a one -year lease and12two percenton a two-year lease.13(Audience participation. )14CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any more15debate?16(No response.)17CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We are going18to call theroll now.19The motion is for a one and  two-20year lease:21One percent  for a one-year;22Two percent  for a two-year.23Ms. Adams?24MS.

LUBELL:  - - and not as they18 are predict ed for next year and not as they  are19 sure to be for next  year.20 So I think that two and  four21 percent in this climate is just as  irresponsibl e22 as one - -23 (Audience participation.)24 MR.

2 MS. HOLDER:	Again,  last year3 there were increases when there should not  have4 been increases.5 (Audience part icipat ion. )6	MS. HOLDER:	All the data7 supports that.8 And I have made it  perfectly9 clear and I have said publicly that the  problem10 that I have is that , because of the11 overcompensation  that owners have had through  the12 years given to them by the Rent Guidelines   Board,13 there has never been a  readjustment.14 These increases are  compounded15 yearly. It is a gross injust ice16 (Audience participation.)17 MS. HOLDER:	to tenants that18 they have to continue to sustain these types  of19 increases.20 Yes, we know, and we are  real21 about what are the various expenses  that22 everybody has to endure, the affordabil ity to23 live in New York, be you a renter or an  owner.24 But , again, we' re talking about proport ionality.25 We are talking about what 's real.7 
1	462	And the fact is is that it  is3 unconscionable  to continue to put these burdens4 on working class and middle income New  Yorkers.5 (Audience participation.)6	MS. HOLDER:	It can't be done.7 We can't let it happen.8 I second my colleague' s motion9 for a two and four, although as unfortunat e as  it10 is, given the fact that tenants deserve much  less11 this year.12 And I would hope that the  Board13 gives serious considerat ion, and with the  expert14 information that has been present ed to us would15 seriously vot e for this motion.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any17 addit ional debat e?18 Go ahead , Mr. Zelnik.19 MR. ZELNIK:	I'm a new Board20 Member. Five of us were appointed on April   15th.21 And obviously we've had nothing to do with  the22 past increases the past fifteen, the past   twenty23 years.24 We are responsibl e for making a25 decision today. And I think these are special7 
1	472 times . These are extraordinary times from my3 perspect ive.4 The tenants in New York  City5 have been hit very hard over the last couple  of6 years from more than just increases,  basic7 increases in rent . But they have actually been8 taxed , if you will ,  in many ways or many  indirect9 ways .10 I'm looking at my  determination11 based on how people are being impacted in  New12 York City, taking into consideration issues   such13 as the fifty percent fare increase . I'm taking14 into consideration that a lot of people who  can't15 afford it will be hit in the next year or so   with16 CUNY and SUNY college tuition costs that  are17 going up.18 (Audience part icipat ion. )19 MR. ZELNIK:	I think that there20 are many indirect areas where the people  who21could leastafford  it , living  in rent stabilized22apartments,are being hit in so many  different23ways.24A PARTICIPANT:	Layoffs .25(Audience participation. )
1	482 MR.  ZELNIK:	In my - - I don' t3 have to enumerate all the ways. I think  everybody4 knows. They've all been mentioned here by  members5 of the Board.6 But clearly unemployment	is not7 gett ing better. The economy is not getting8 better. It 's attributable certainly to what9 happened on 9/11, but the economy was not  getting10 better even prior to that .11	The situat ion here is pretty12 bleak.13 I think it 's important when I14 consider my vote to consider not only  the15 position of the landlords - and I can tell  you16 objectively  I appreciate all the costs that  they17 are talking about. I think these are real. I  also18 at the same time appreciate the position from  the19 tenants' point of view and how they will  be20 impacted. And I think that 's real.21 I've been almost watching  since22 I've joined the Board a pingpong or a  tennis23match, ifyou will , hearing one side and hearing24the otherside.25If I were up in my Yiddish
1	4 92 history, I would tell you that I'm sure there' s a3 rabbinical story where someone says, well , I'll4 agree with you and I'll agree with you . And5 that 's basically the way I felt.6 I've been hearing test imony and7 each t ime I heard testimony from one side or the8 other, I find myself saying, you know, I  really9 do agree, I think you're right. Heating  costs10 have gone up, taxes have clearly gone  up,11 util ities have gone up . And at the same time12 these are impacting the people who can  least13 afford it .14 At the same time I think  there15 needs to be a sharing . And I hear the words16 "proportionate  sharing. " And  that doesn' t mean17 though, at least from my point of  view,18 fifty/fifty sharing . I think there has to be some19 form of an increase. The initial increase  was20 voted down. There' s now a proposal on the  table21 of two and  four percent .22I'm not sure where we will  end23up in terms ofany final votes. But I do  believe24that these arespecial t imes, and when I vote, I25will be votingfor what I think is not in  the
2 best interest of tenants and not in the  best3 interests of the building owners, but what is   in4 the best interest of the City.5 (Audience part icipat ion. )6	MR. ZELNIK:	I think the City7 has to be helped in any way it can . And I think8 the morale of the City is important. I think  the9 economic condit ions of the people living in the10 apartments are important. And I think we have   to11 look at what is best for the City now and for  at12 least the next twelve months.13 Thank you.14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Adams.16 MS. ADAMS:	I'm Betty Phillips17 Adams. And I too am one of the new Members of   the18 Board.19 A PARTICIPANT:	Louder.20 MS. ADAMS:	Can you hear me21 now?22 A PARTICIPANT:	Yes.23 MS. ADAMS:	I'm Betty Phillips24 Adams and I too am one of the new public  members25 of the Board.7 
2 I share much of what my3 colleague who spoke just before feels  because,4 yes, there are increases in cost and , yes,5 tenants are being hit right and left and  every6 other way by increases and salaries are not  going7 up that fast.8 (Audience participation. )9	MS. ADAMS:	By the same token10 we have a responsibility to the City of New  York .11 We've got to have good housing stock  for12 everyone.13 I am encouraged that we are  now14 even talking about integrat ed housing,15 economically  integrated housing in the Borough  of16 Manhattan .17 And so I felt that - - I said  I18 shared a lot of my colleague' s views because I19 have the feeling both to this side and both   to20 the other and I'm not sure where my final vot e21 will come out .22 But there are costs that have  to23 be borne by all. The tenants, it seems to be,   are24 being hit from more directions than everyone   else25 is and I'm sure that that will be reflected in  my10 
2 vot e.3 (Audience participation.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Now I will5 call the question.6 The question before the house  is7 a :8 Two percent one year increase;9 And a four percent two- year10 increase.11 Is that correct?12 MR.

That ' s what a fair proposal was in  my17 estimation.18 (Audience participation.)19 MR. LUBELL:	I agree with Mr.20 Zelnik.

1	552	(Audience participat ion.)3	MR. LUBELL:	And I think that4 if we don' t provide5 (Audience participat ion.)6	MR.

2 MR. LUBELL:	And I think that3 the sharing, the sharing  is a  - -  the sharing has4 to come from most tenants. It may not be some  of5 you or a large number of you sitting here,  but6 most tenants in New York can afford an   increase.7 (Audience participation. )8	MR.

2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do we have3 any other motions?4	Go ahead. Ms. Kaufman.5	MS. KAUFMAN:	I'd like to make6 a motion.7 May I say a word prior to  the8 mot ion?9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure. You can10	introduce, say whatever you want.11	MS. KAUFMAN:	As another new12 public member on the Board, we spent a lot  of13 time reviewing the reports that were provided  to14 us this year.15 We met with tenant groups and16 owner groups formally and informally. And   our17 charge is to be fair and  balanced.18 We are balancing the need  for19 rental income that' s sufficient to maintain this20 housing stock with the tenants' ability to  pay.21 We are charged to protect  the22 tenant s against rent spikes due to a housing23 shortage and to preserve the return to the  market24 with a greater than five percent vacancy rate   and25 to prot ect the viability of this housing  stock.12 
2 We heard issues and there  are3 pressures on both sides this year, with  the4 building owners facing a very high level of  real5 price and cost increases.6	(Audience part icipation. )7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet .8 MS. KAUFMAN:	And we also know9 that all of us, residents in the City,  and10 particularly many residents in stabilized  housing11 are feeling the pressures of this  recessionary12 period with the loss of over 115,000 jobs in  the13 last year, very high  unemployment.14 We've been told a bit about15 smoothing and trying to keep rent increases at  a16 consistent level taking into account the  cost17 that the owners are  experiencing.18 So my proposal ,  in the interest19 of balancing  between  the two, is - -20 (Audience participat ion .)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet .22 MS. KAUFMAN:	5. 5 percent23 for one year,24 (Audience participat ion.)25 MS. KAUFMAN:	- - 8.5 percent9 
2 for two years.3 (Audience participation. )4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet .  5 Quiet.6 Do we have a second on that7 motion?8 Do we have a second on that9 mot ion?10 MS. LUSSKIN:	I'll second it.11 (Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	The second is13 by Ms. Lusskin.14 Any debate?15 Ms. Holder?16 MS . HOLDER :	Yes .17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Yes .19 MS . HOLDER :	I have to tell you 2021 (Audience part icipation .)22 MS. HOLDER:	- - just like so23 many folks out there, I know there' s a lot of24 owners out there,25 (Audience participation.)21 
2 MS . HOLDER:	- - and there' s a3 lot of rent regulated tenants out there and  folks4 who work with them.5 (Audience part icipation.)6	MS. HOLDER:	This is my second7 year on the Rent Guidelines Board. But I  think8 I'm one of the only rent regulated  tenants.9 And I have to tell you  housing10 has been my life as a Legal Aid attorney for   the11 past twelve years. Rent regulation is my   reality12 as a person living here in New York  City.13 And a 5.5 and a 8.5 percent14 increase hits me in the gut and hits me where  I15 live in terms of professionally	and personally.16 (Audience participation.)17 MS. HOLDER:	I think this year18 we have tried very hard I think as folks  who19 advocate for housing here in New York City, and   I20 think David and I as your tenant  representat ives,21 I think we have been  - - we've tried really   hard22 this year to be real and to tell the  truth.23 And we've never pretended  that24 there hasn' t been a lot of increases going around25 this City. And we understand that there have  been7 
1	612 increases in property taxes, there has been  an3 increase in insurance.4	But , again, when we look at how5 landlords have prospered  through the years, they6 are more than capable of dealing this year  with7 lower guideline increases.8 (Audience part icipation.)9 MS. HOLDER:	People on this10 Board, as well as my Chair, Marvin Markus,  told11 us on Thursday, when David and I had  invited12 folks to testify, that we had very even  and13 balanced testimony because we wanted to be  real .14 These are no times for15 theatrics. These are no times to play  games.16 These are serious times that we live  in.17 But , again, balance  doesn' t mean18 fifty/fifty. And proportionality	to me is given19 what folks start out with and what can be  borne.20 It has been shown to us that21 owners in the residential property sector  are22 making money. They are the only folks  who23 continue to make money in New York  City.24 (Audience participation.)25 MS. HOLDER:	I want us to be10 
1	622 real here as a Board and understand. To be  real3 as a Board is not to, in my colleague' s words,4 say that we are going to be gatekeepers  of5 widespread abandonment. That 's not what' s going6 to happen. That ' s not what 's going to happen  this7 year.8 This year tenants are9 shouldering the majority of  the bailout	for this10 City.11 (Audience participation.)12 MS . HOLDER:	We've got to be13 real about how it is, given this opportunity as  a14 Board , that we decide this year how we are going15 to deal with it .16 And I would urge as a rent17 regulated tenant myself that we vote down a  5.518 percent increase19 (Audience part icipation.)20 MS. HOLDER:	- - for one year21 and an 8.5 percent increase for two  years.22 (Audience participation.)2 3	MS. HOLDER:	I believe that24 it 's unconscionable and it 's unrealist ic.25 (Audience participat ion.)

LUBELL :	I defer to you .8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oh! Thank9	you .10 I am planning to vote for  the11 guidelines suggested and just made by the  public12 members . I think it is - -13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	- - a fair and15 balanced guideline that attempts to balance  and16 succeeds in balancing the very real problems  that17 both owners and tenants in New York City  feel18 today .19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	This is21 (Audience participation. )22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	This is an23 extraordinary t ime for both of them and24 extraordinary  times do require extraordinary25 measures.
3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I think the4 Board , if they were to adopt this guideline, will5 be showing that they have at heart the needs  of6 both tenants,7 (Audience participation. )8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	owners9 and , most importantly, because at the end of the10 day this Board are the stewards of the  housing11 stock of New York.12 (Audience participation. )13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So I plan to14 vot e for this guideline.15 (Audience part icipation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there any17 other debate?18 MR.

LUBELL :	Historically we12 have moved for and will move for a,  upon13 sublet ting, an allowance in the amount of ten14 percent.15 That is one of my mot ions in16 connection with  rent .17 And  I have a further motion  - -18 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Well , let ' s19 take that one.20 MR.

1	692	The sublet , the ten  percent3 sublet mot ion.4 Go ahead , Mr. Pagan.5 MR. PAGAN:	Mr. Chair,6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.7 MR . PAGAN:	- - this is one of8	the motions that we feel is  unjust.9	There is	right now there is a10 ten percent sublett ing that is set up by the11 State and another ten percent makes it a  little12 difficult. The idea of the  subletting13 MR. LUBELL:	No, no. It doesn' t14 work that way.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Just a16 second.17 MR. PAGAN:	is that the18 issue is that sometimes people do have to  leave19 the apartment for a short period of time. And  the20 idea here is to make - - to keep - - they  provide ,21 they keep their furniture in the apartment  and22 that 's - - they are allowed to get the ten  percent23 for the use of their property by someone  else.24 The idea of getting another  ten25 percent for the owner, who at this time has  very10 
2 little work that they have to do for  that3 addit ional ten percent , I think is unthinkable.4 Thank you.5 (Audience participation. )6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell ,7	do you have a response?8 MR. LUBELL:	No.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	He said no.10	MS. HOLDER:	I want to comment.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One second.12 Have Mr. Lubell respond.  Go13 ahead.14 MR. LUBELL:	I think Mr. Pagan15 misunderstands16 A PARTICIPANT:	Use the17 microphone. We can hardly hear  you.18 MR. LUBELL:	I think Mr. Pagan19 misunderstands	the ten percent sublet  allowance.20 When the tenant that the owner21 has approved	when the tenant that the  owner22 has approved seeks a subtenant and he  is23 permitt ed to do by statute for any two-year24 period out of any four-year period , then this25 is - - he' s getting  a subtenant  that he has not12 
2 originally  approved , he gets one ten percent ,  he3 doesn' t get twenty percent , he gets one ten4 percent based on our recommendation  for this5 additional amount of ten  percent.6 The tenant can charge - -  if the7 apartment  is furnished ,  an additional  ten percent8 over and above the legal maximum rent to  the9 subtenant. But there' s not a double hit for the10 owner. The owner is getting paid to have - - he' s11 getting an additional ten percent because he' s12 got someone in there that he didn' t bargain for.13 And he' s got to go through the14 work  of approving  that person - -15 (Audience participation.)16 MR. LUBELL:	- - of having to17 involve the approval process.18 (Audience part icipat ion. )19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma' am, ma' am.20 Please.21 (Audience participat ion. )22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' ll be23 able to testify in a couple of weeks and you  can24 tell Mr. Lubell then.25 (Audience participation. )2 
1722CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.3MR. PAGAN:	Mr. Chair, I just4wanttorespondto Mr. Lubell .5(Audience part icipat ion. )6MR. PAGAN:	Yes, this ten7 percent goes to the tenant. But the idea  of8 having the sublet and adding ten percent here  and9 five percent there, $20 here, $20 there,  suddenly10 we are looking at rents that are skyrocketing  and11 moving out and being unaffordabl e.12 The idea here is to be able  to13 allow persons who leave for a short period  of14 t ime from their home without the fear of losing15 the apartment and at the same t ime ensuring that16 their rent for that apartment is  paid.17 The tenant is still responsible18 for that rent if their sublett ing doesn' t pay it .19 It ' s not where - - sure he' s getting someone else20 that ' s paying it , but if that person doesn' t pay,21 the tenant is going to have to respond or  lose22 the apartment .23 So I just don' t see why we need24 to keep on hitting people for  additional25 percentages when there is no need in this  case.7 
1	732	(Audience participat ion.)3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any4 additional debate?5 If not - -6 Adriene, go ahead .7	MS. HOLDER:	Again, I agree8	with my colleague' s remarks, David' s remarks.9	What we see, especially  now10 given the economic climate, that  increasingly11 more people  - - and I even have clients  in  this12 position	- -  are having  to go outside of New York13 for short periods of t ime on special assignments14 or to look for special work, to be able to  afford15 to live and stay here in New  York.16 The idea that they would then  be17 penalized in terms of trying to find folks  to18 watch their units, people who would  be19 responsible and care for their units and  the20 property that they leave there with  additional21 charges like this just doesn' t seem to me to make22 much sense.23This Board hasn' t had any24opportunityto look at this, if this really  is25approachingsomething that would be  beneficial
2	for owners, what would be the  impact.3	And I would ask that before  we4 go and jump and just add a whol e bunch of5 addit ional charges, that if this Board is serious6 in wanting to consider such things, that we  would7 actually look into, study, perhaps review  and8 debate whether these kinds of charges would  be9 necessary.10 But I know being a practitioner11 out there, that it 's just one more charge to12 tenants that owners get to reap the benef it of.13 And I would hope that my14 colleagues on this Board would vote against  this15 mot ion.16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'm sorry. Go18 ahead, Mr . Lubell .19 MR. LUBELL:	To paraphrase one20 of my colleagues, let 's get real.21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. LUBELL:	The law permits a23 tenant to sublease an apartment every two  years24 within a four-year period of time .25 There are as many instances  of4 
2 overcharging by tenants against other  tenants3 then there are overcharges by  owners.4 But I think that the  important5 thing is it 's important for the owner to know who6 that subtenant  is - -7 (Audience part icipation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.9 MR. LUBELL:	to maint ain the10 security of the building. And there is a  cost11 involved in doing that.12 It is not a frivolous charge.13 It 's a real charge.14 And so, again, I reiterat e that15 motion is a legitimate motion. We have had  that16 payment for many, many years except for the  last17 two years.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right.19 Hold it. Go ahead.20 MS. HOLDER:	This is the reason21 why to me this motion should actually be  tabled22 because there is a lot of misinformation on  this.23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	This motion25 will be discussed. Remember this is a  preliminary10 
23	A PARTICIPANT:	Democracy. Where4	is it?5	(Audience part icipation.)6	MS. HOLDER:	The concern I have7 is that the members don't have enough  information8 before them.9 (Audience part icipation.)10 MS . HOLDER:	The fact is that11 you can sublet your apartment and it 's true under12 the law, but  it ' s considered  an illegal sublet if13 you don' t get the permission of the owner.14 (Audience participat ion. )15 MS. HOLDER:	Without16 permission, a legal sublet , the owners def initely17 have rights to get those people out .18 And so, again,19 MR. LUBELL:	Mr. Chairman, I20 don' t want to debate - -21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We will22 MR. LUBELL:	this.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We will vote24 on this motion and we will clarify the  law25 between  - - whether  the motion passes or fails,  we7 
2 will clarify the law. We will get a memorandum . I3 think both of you are leaving things out in  the4 discussion of the law quit e frankly . And we will5 get a memorandum out whether the motion passes  or6 fails.7 MS. HOLDER:	Well , I would like8 to make a motion to table  this.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there a11 second to the motion to table it?12 MR. ZELNIK :	I ' ll second it.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Fine.14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Adams,16 mot ion to table, yes or no? Voting yes tables the17 motion.18 MS.

ZELNIK:	As I said16 previously,	I and several other members of  the17 Board are very new to this procedure, new to   this18 process .19 I can tell you that all of  us,20 what ever side you're on, have been spending  an21 awful lot of time trying to do research and   to22 get the facts.23 It is extremely difficult for  me24 at this point trying to hear what my   colleagues25 are saying when peopl e are, in fact , speaking8 
2overthem .3I want to hear the positions4fromboth sidesso that I can make the best5 decision that I can possibly make. And  I6 respect fully ask the peopl e here to pl ease permit7 both sides to make their positions known so  that8 those of us here who are really trying to  hear9 the nuances of their decisions  - -  of their10 debate, that we can hear it  clearly.11 Having said that , with respect12 to the longevity allowance, if these  were13 ordinary times, if these were ordinary  economic14 t imes, this is something that I would not15 necessarily	find unreasonabl e.16 I think these are,  in fact ,17 extraordinary t imes and at least for this next18 year I would hope that we would not have  to19 impose a longevity increase.20 (Audience participation .)21CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Allright.22Ms . Lusskin.23MS . LUSSKIN:	I agreewith my24colleague.25I think, as we 1   ve bothnoted ,
2 these are extraordinary times. We've tried  to3 strike a balance in the first thing, which I  know4 many people are not going to agree with  that5	balance.6	Nevertheless, we know this  is7 not , no mat ter what we do here, is it going to8 solve all of the inequities or save every  person9 who is having a problem.10 But I think to add  something11 like a longevity increase on top of  historic12 increases is really not merited.13 And we can take a year and  see14 what the impacts are, see what 's happening next15 year. But there is nothing that we can do  here16 that is going to bring equity to every  rental17 situation either on the landlord side or  the18 tenant side.19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Call the21 quest ion to vote on a longevity as read into  the22 record by Mr.  Lubell .23 Ms. Adams?24 MS .

2	Mr . Pagan .3	MR . PAGAN:	Mr. Chairman, I've4 been here seven or eight years and every year  the5 same poor tax comes up. And I call it a poor  tax6 because it hits the people who least are able  to7 afford it.8 In many cases the reason the9 rents are below $500 is because the  market10 doesn' t allow it to increase above $500. People11 in those neighborhoods cannot pay for it. I  don't12 believe there are too many places in  Manhattan13 below 96th Street where this poor tax will  apply.14 It would probably apply to peopl e in the outer15 boroughs more than it would be  local.16 The biggest probl em I have is17 that we have just passed a 5.5 and an  8.518 percent , and I'm repeating that. But this one19 woul d probably hit the people with a larger20 increase than a 5.5 and 8.5 . And when you put it21 together, some people would be hit with 20, a  2522 percent increase.23 And this is without  considering24 what other action we may take tonight or at  the25 final vote. So actually we are looking as a  Board
2 to pass a motion to get people above $500  whether3 they can or cannot pay for  it.4	Now, from the test imony that we5 had the other day, and I remember the person  from6 Brooklyn, that indicated that her rents  were7 around the $350 range and she couldn' t get8 anything else.9 We are asking only  certain10 people to pay for it and the people who are  going11 to pay for it are those who could least afford   it12 in the areas that are highest market , that you13 have the highest market . We are going to see14 people in Williamsburg,  around certain parts  of15 the Pratt area, some of the North  Brooklyn,16 probably Western Queens if there are  apartments,17 north of 96th Street , then part of Manhattan18 where they are going to be forced out of  the19 neighborhood because we keep on hitting them   with20 the addit ional taxes. This is a tax rather than21 an increase on their income because they have the22 misfortune of being low-wage earners living in   a23 neighborhood  that is now wanted by somebody  else.24 So we' re going to have25 displacement as part of the things that come  out
2 of this .3 And that 's one of the  shames4 that I see when we try to get increases of  this5	kind.6 Thank you.7 (Audience participation.)8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Call the9	question.10 The motion before the house is  a11 $15 below $500 increase in addition to the12guidelinesincrease;  is that  correct , Mr. Lubell?13MR.

LUBELL:	This, as we know,19 is for apartments coming out of rent  control.20 That 's the sixty some odd thousand apartments21 coming out of  - -  those that become vacant  coming22 out of rent control and go into stabil ization.2 3	As we know, this does not  affect24 a tenant in place25 A PARTICIPANT:	Yes, it does.24 
2 MR. LUBELL:	- - because the3 apartment is one that has been at a  depressed4 rental.5 I propose initial rents  for6 decontrolled units entering stabilization, which7 whet her you are new on the Board or old on  the8 Board , we always have. And  it 's a maximum	- - I'm9 proposing a Maximum Base Rent plus 150  percent ,10 plus the fuel adjustment11 (Audience participation.)12 MR. LUBELL:	or the13 appropriat e fair market rent for Sect ion 814 housing as established by HUD for the New   York15 City PMSSA adjust ed for gas and electric  charges,16 whichever  is greater.17 (Audience participation. )18 MR. LUBELL:	If you would like19 me to repeat that - -20 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	It ' s okay.21 You don' t need to repeat it. We' re okay.22 Mr. Schleider, do we have  a23second?24MR. SCHLEIDER:Yes, we do.25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Any debat e?
2 Would you accept an amendment  to3 that to make  it , instead of 150 percent , to  make4 it 50 percent?5 (Audience participation. )6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sir.7	Would you entertain such a8 motion as an amendment , Mr. Lubell?9 MR. LUBELL:	Yes.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.11 The mot ion as amended would be12 the same exact motion that passed last year  which13 would be 50 percent above the MBR or the   fair14 market rent.15 Would you also  - - did last16 year' s - - yeah, the greater of , plus fuel17 adjustment .18 MS. HOLDER:	Wait. I'm sorry.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.20 MS. HOLDER:	Was the amendment21 accept ed?22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, he did.23 MS. HOLDER:	Can I have24 clarification on what is the motion  now?25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The motion is8 
2 For dwelling units subject  to3 the Rent  Stabilization Law on September  3 0 , 20034 which become vacant after September 3 0, 2003 , the5 special guideline shall be the greater of :6 50 percent above the Maximum7 Base Rent as existed or would have  existed;8 Or the fair market rent ....9 I won' t go through all the other10 language associated with the fair market  rent.11 Such fair market rents that  will12 be published in the Federal Register to  take13 effect on October 1, 2003 .14 MS . HOLDER:	And you' re15 saying16 I just want a clarif ication.17 I 'm sorry.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And it is19 adjusted  for, if you read  it ,	go ahead. I 'm20 sorry.21 MS . HOLDER:	Is that the same  -2223 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	As last year .24 MR . LUBELL :	The same as  last25 year.23 
1	1032 MS. HOLDER:	That 's the same3 proposal .4	MR . LUBELL:	Adriene, you were5	here last year.6	MS . HOLDER:	I was here. You7 know, I'm still reeling over the increases  we8 have, that we voted in.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Go10 ahead .11 MS. HOLDER:	You' re tell ing me12 that that 's the same - -13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.14 MS. HOLDER:	proposed15 increases as last year?16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	It was17 originally 150. He accepted the amendment  and18 made it 50.19 MS. HOLDER:	He accepted the20 amendment. Okay.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.22 It 's the same exact language.2 3	MS. HOLDER:	Was the fuel24 included with fair?25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It says here,24 
2 based on last year, with such fair market  rents3 to be adjusted based upon whether the tenant  pays4 his or her own gas and/or electric charges  as5 part of his or her rent , as such gas and/or6 electric charges are accounted for by the  New7 York City Housing Aut hority.8	So it depends on whether it 's in9	or out. It 's the same language as last year.10 You may not have liked  last11 year' s, but - -12 MS. HOLDER:	No, I didn' t.13 Do we have a14 Go ahead, Mr. Zelnik.15 MR. ZELNIK:	I just need16 clarif icat ion on this particular motion.17 Is it 50 percent  or Section 8 ,18 whichever is higher? Is that the way it  works?19 MR. LUBELL:	Yes.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. The21 greater of .22 And this is just one of - -  just23 to clarify further, this is one of the   factors,24 and we can discuss in detail with DHCR when   they25 come in a couple of weeks,  it ' s one of  the10 
2 factors that DHCR takes into consideration  in3 considering a protest  associated when they  switch4 from rent control to rent stabilized  status.5	MR. PAGAN:	Mr. Chairman?6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead , Mr.7	Pagan .8	MR. PAGAN:	I just want to talk9	against the mot ion at this time.10 I don't have a problem with11 having a percentage	increase bringing it from  the12 base. But I do have a problem with the use of  the13 fair market value as set up by  HUD.14 The problem I have is that  the15 HUD standard in general I have found to be  much16 higher than needed because HUD has a  high17 mortgage  in most  of their projects and that ' s how18 they figure it out .19 And their cost per room tends  to20 be much, much higher than what it is now in  the21 stabilized units.22 And for that reason alone I  have23 to say that I cannot support this  motion.24 I do realize that we do need  a25 motion to begin the first rent after it comes  out10 
2 of rent control. But I believe that this mot ion3 is just too rich for the  apartment.4 Thank you.5 (Audience participation.)6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. Ms.7	Holder .8	MS . HOLDER:	That 's the point9 right there. Controlled rents are already  high.10 There are so many increases because of  the11 changes in the law that landlords are able  to12 sustain. And as a result, what we have  been13 seeing and what I know will be presented to  us14 later on during the season following tonight  is15 that we have  - -  the rent controlled  units  in our16 universe that end up going into  stabilization17 actually don' t get there. They hop right over.18 And the enrichment of  the19 special guideline that landlords have enjoyed   is20 one that takes these units right out of any   type21 of regulated market.22 And so the idea, again	the23specialguidelines to me should be lower.  Fifty24percentto me is rich.25However, I have to agree with  my
2 colleague that , in addition to that , I do have a3 probl em with the special guideline. In addition4 to that , the idea that we would tag along the5 Section 8 fair market rental as something to  be6 considered , I would ask that we would vote this7 down.8	And , again, this is a9 preliminary vote. And if members on this  Board10 are confused or need more information,  perhaps11 there should be a motion to table  it.12 I hope that this would be voted13 down. But , you know, if we need to do more14 research to satisfy folks, but I 'm telling  you15 the increases right now for rent  controlled16 units,  they already have put  those  - -17 (Audience participation .)18 MS. HOLDER:	- - at very high19 levels, and as soon as those units then  are20 vacant , they go right out of any type of rent21 regulated housing stock into the free market.  And22 it 's way too high for tenants of New York.23 (Audience participation. )24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell.25 MR. LUBELL:	Mr. Chair, one, we9 
2 need a guideline and it 's just a guide to DHCR.3 And that 's one.4	Two, the fair market rent  for5 Sect ion 8 housing, and I assume the Board has6 done their research, these are very modest  rents7 and we need this guide. It does not  - -  I8 reiterat e, it does not affect tenants in place.9 It goes from rent control back into another  form10 of rent control which is rent stabilizat ion. It11 does not leave the market .12 So that - -13 (Audience participat ion. )14 MR. LUBELL:	we have15 traditionally passed a guideline to DHCR and  last16 year' s guideline was much lower than the prior17 guidelines which were 150 percent . I just18 accepted your friendly amendment because it  is19 last year' s guidel ine.20MR. SCHLEIDER:	Move the21question.22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Just a23second.24Mr. Zelnik.25MR. ZELNIK:	Again, looking at
2 this logically, I would say an increase,  a3 percentage	increase when an apartment becomes4 vacant is reasonable.5	The question in my mind  is6 what  - - how much. And the quest ion in my mind  is7 fifty percent too much or not.8	The other quest ion in my mind  9 is, and I have tried to do due diligence in  terms10 of gett ing these facts, but how onerous is, in11 fact , the Section 8 rent guideline . Is it or is12 it not?13 So I 'm a little confused  about14 Section 8 even though I 've read it . I had   numbers15 coming out of my ears to tell you the  truth.16 I believe the fifty percent  at17 this point is higher than I would like to see . My18 sense would be19 (Audience participat ion.)20 MR . ZELNIK:	and , again,21 this is the preliminary vote and I deserve  the22 right to later on amend this, but I wish  the23 motion would be talking about something  like24 twenty- five or thirty- three percent and not fifty 25	percent .9 
2 And I wish it could  somehow3 state, and maybe this would be a further  motion,4 that whichever is less as opposed to whichever   is5 more.6	MR. LUBELL:	I move the7 question.8 (Audience part icipat ion.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let ' s take a10	vote .11	MS. HOLDER:	Motion to table.12 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell ,13 what is the motion? There is a motion on  the14 table.15 I'll repeat it. Mr. Lubell  did16 not accept the amendment suggested or made by  Mr .17 Zelnik.18 The motion on the table is  to19 adopt the special guideline in the same  form20 and I can read the whole thing if you  would21 like - - as was last year' s:22 Fifty percent above MBR ;23 Fair market rent adjusted  by24 utilities, HUD;25 The great er of .12 
2	That 's the motion.3 Okay.4 A PARTICIPANT:	Stay the same.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No. It hasn' t6 been voted on yet. That 's the motion before the7 house.8 Go ahead.9 MS. ADAMS:	I would like to10 abstain at this point , Mr. Chair, because I feel11	the need for addit ional informat ion.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay. No13 problem.14 Ms .

2	proceedings were resumed .)3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I would like4	to discuss now rent stabilized hotels, and  the5	other one for lofts .6 Do we have a mot ion on the floor7 affecting rent stabilized hotels? I mean not  that8 we have to - - would anybody like to make    a9 motion?10 Adriene or - - a motion  - -11 actually, somebody, who went first? You should   go12 first , Adriene  for the hotels .13 MS. HOLDER:	Mr. Chair, can we14 take these one at a time?15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	No .16 MS. HOLDER :	Okay.17 For residential Class A  hotels,18 we know that there are only two that are   left.19 When we are talking about these hotels, it 's very20 difficult for us to compare this to the  other21 rent regulated housing stock . They are the22 housing of last resort for most of the folks   that23 I know, that I see .24 But they are also turning  into25 housing for and they have and they continue to   be
2 housing for tourists and for students. That  is3 where the landlords are making the lion's  share4 of their profit and they continue  to.5 This weekend I was at a6 conference and met with a whole bunch of  housing7 advocates. And I met a gentleman who told  me8 about all the fliers he sees all over the  City9 with numbers for brokers who are assisting  these10 landlords into getting tourists and students  into11 the apartments.12 The folks who are living  in13 these units pay anywhere from $900 to $1500  a14 month in various parts of Manhattan and some  of15 the outer boroughs .16 We know this. We see this . We17 are concerned with the way that we deal with  this18 housing, that it be preserved and we allow  our19 tenants who live there to be able to cont inue to20live therewithaffordable rents that meet  their21income.22The landlords don't need an23increase.24And so my mot ion will be for:25A zero percent increase on  rent
2 regulated hotels, and that would include all  five3 classif ications.4 And I assume we are dealing  with5 No. 3 , Chair.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Excuse me?7 MS. HOLDER:	We are only8 dealing with Item No. 3 now, rent  stabilized9 hotels?10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.11	MS. HOLDER:	And so that would12 be my motion.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on one14 second.15 You asked that question16 because	- - okay. But you meant	- - yes, it 's 3 .17 MS. HOLDER:	If you recall , I18 originally asked if we were going to deal with  319 A and originally one by one and you all said   no.20 So I'm just wondering  - -21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Correct.22 Correct.2 3	MS. HOLDER:	Okay.24 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Well ,25 historically this Board has not made  a
2	distinct ion .3 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.4 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	So - - and I5	don' t imagine it is going to do it this time .6	Why don' t we take the whol e7 class.8 MR. PAGAN:	I second the9 mot ion.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Pagan11 seconds the motion.12 Any debate?13 Mr. Lubell.14 MR . LUBELL:	This lS	if we15 are going to be consistent , and we are16 overlooking the fact that we have a proviso  which17 protects most tenants in a large number  of18 hotels.19 But we are also overlooking  the20 fact that costs increased by seventeen  percent21 for hotels. We are also overlooking the fact  that22 as far as transients are concerned , hotels are23 doing lousy, that the hotel business in New  York24 City is way down and people are not   - -25 transients, the hotel business in midtown is  notROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2that great. Occupancyis really down and I don' t3think that transientsare going to Harl em,4Brooklyn or the UpperWest Side.5 I've heard from clients  that6 their business  is way down.7 I think we do a disservice  to8 rooming houses, we do a disservice to  SROs.9 And I'm concerned about  the10 SROs. They have a very effective advocat e. And  I11 think that we pretty much protect the SROs by  the12 proviso that if there is a certain  percentage13 that are not tenants, and that percentage is  a14 very large percentage, we give no  increase.15 So I think that as far as  hotels16 are concerned, a zero percent  increase just17 doesn' t make sense.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any19 addit ional debat e?20 MR. PAGAN:	Mr. Chairman?21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.22 MR. PAGAN:	Mr. Chairman, I23 don' t remember that we were voting on the proviso24 at this time. So to say that the proviso  affects25 anyone when we haven' t actually vot ed for a5 
2 proviso doesn' t sound to me like logical.3 Thank you.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.5 Go ahead , Mr. Zelnik.6 MR. ZELNIK:	Yes, I actually7	agree with Mr. Pagan on  that.8	I would offer an amendment to9 the motion even though it 's a zero, but maybe we10 can get the ball rolling, that we include  the11 proviso of the seventy percent occupancy for   SROs12 at this point. Even though it 's a zero increase,13 I would like to at least have that as  something14 that we base our traditional votes  on.15 I would just like to say that  in16 this situat ion I think if a rent increase is17 deserving  for the rent stabilized apartments18 throughout the City, then I would say whatever   we19 vote on ultimately should be the same for  the20 hotels as long as the seventy percent proviso   is21 included.22 MR. LUBELL:	Mr. Chair,23 MS. HOLDER:	He had made an24 amendment to my motion; right? He offered   that25 and I accept that as a friendly  amendment.9 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.3	Go ahead.4	MR. LUBELL:	There should be no5 debate about this. There is something that  is6 terribly illogical that says when I'm giving  you7 zero, I'm putt ing a proviso at seventy percent.8 There is something totally illogical about  it.9 You got a zero increase. The proviso is  totally10 unnecessary.11 Give a one percent , two percent ,12 three percent , four percent increase, then put13 the proviso in and the proviso then makes  some14 sense.15 But with a zero percent16 increase, it is totally  illogical.17 But let 's vote on it.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I agree with19 Mr. Lubell . That 's likely to be a dist inction20 without a difference by the time we are  done.21 So let 's - -22 MS. HOLDER :	But  I actually23 disagree because, again, this Board comes  back24 year after year. And all we are saying is  that25 this is a guideline that we  will leave	you5 
2 know, if this were to pass, that we believe  that3 the proviso should always be attached to  it.4 And perhaps in other years  there5 will be increases. We would only be saying  that6 for this year those guidel ine increases would be7 zero. And I mean I don' t see why that seems to be8 illogical to vote. It 's the idea though that the9 Board look at the proviso as an important part  of10 the guideline that needs to be included when  we11 report out what our guidelines are each  year.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Lusskin.13 MS. LUSSKIN:	I have difficulty14 with saying	and I deeply believe this,  that15 the SRO, the true SRO housing stock is a  vital16 part of the safety net in the  City.17 In fact, I noticed in the18 information that was presented to us that  the19 median income is, in fact , rising on SRO tenants20 which to me says that this is an issue that  is21 starting to affect a higher level of income  than22 we used to think would need SRO  services.23 But I find it inconsistent to24 say we have to preserve this housing stock  for25 that populat ion by not allowing the owners to2 
2 cover rising costs, and there have been  several3 years where we gave no increase for those  owners,4 and it is not the economics of the world  that5 costs stay fixed.6 So I'm very mindful of the  fact7 that there' s a lot going on with this housing8 stock that is depriving the City of this  vital9 safety net , but for that port ion of it which is10 remaining within that safety net , we have to11 maintain its viability which doesn't allow for12 you to say no increases.13 Yes, no increases if someone  is14 not running their SRO as an SRO but , as has been15 said, running it as a transient  hotel.16 So dealing with the issue  of17 zero percent , I don' t  think  that  in the situation18 where there is a true SRO that' s viabl e and I19 find it somewhat absurd to be voting on a  zero20 percent	a proviso attached to a zero  percent21 increase.22 If we want to deal with  the23 proviso because we feel that it has a valid   place24 in this universe , let 's deal with  it as  something25 real istic.2 
2CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We will take3avote.4Ms . Adams?5So a zero increase including  the6	proviso.7	MS. ADAMS:	Let me go back over8	the thirty percent . That 's in the proviso, right?9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It 's in the10 motion.	I mean some people made an argument  that11 the proviso is unnecessary when the number  is12 zero. That doesn' t mean that people are making an13 argument here that the proviso is unnecessary  if14 the number is higher than  zero.15 MS. ADAMS:	Right. But thirty16 percent is the number in the  proviso.17 MR. LUBELL:	Seventy.18 MS. ADAMS:	And zero percent19 for the other classes or for  everything?20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No, for21 everything. This is zero for everything  whether22 you are subject to the proviso or not , which  is23 why the debate about whether or not the  proviso24 makes  sense. So this is a zero  - -25 MS. ADAMS :	Some years it may.10 
2	But  I would  agree with that .3	MS. HOLDER:	That is my4	argument .5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Correct. I6 think the issue is whether or not this year you  -7 -  well , you believe  that  the rent  increase for8 the hotel units that are not subject to  the9 proviso, in other words, that are run  as10 residential hotels should be zero. That 's I think11 the question because the proviso will come  up12 again  - - unless  this motion passes,  the provision13 will come up again as to a one percent increase   a14hundredpercentincrease.15MS.

LUBELL:	I move for an16increase offive percent for hotels that have  had17a seventeenpercent increase in the Price  Index18 and almost an eleven percent Core Price  rise.19 And I move for a five percent20 and , of course, with the proviso that we voted21 for.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any debate?23 Ms. Holder.24 MS. HOLDER:	Again, I know that25 there was testimony and I hear what my  colleague,18 
2	Ms. Lusskin, was saying about incomes going   up.3	But we have to remember the4 population that we are talking about and the   fact5 is that these kinds of increases for the  manner6 in which this population tends to get paid,  and7 some of them actually being on fixed income,  it8 doesn't warrant ,  and history  will  show, that the9 Board has never had guideline increases   for10 hotels, this whol e class of rent stabilized11 hotels, that is the same as the increase or   as12 high as the increase for  apartments.13 And so history being a guide ,   I14 hope that we could look to that and  understand15 there is a reason for that. And that 's not only16 because of the type of tenant that lives  there17 but also has to do with the services that  are18 provided and the mix of income that those   owners19 get out of those buildings.20 And it 's always been a mix in21 the past that I have heard from advocat es in New22 York, it 's very difficult for anyone to get  into23 these buildings because of the mix and  the24 different	folks that are going in there who  are25 not long- term rent regulated tenants.4 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms . Lusskin.3	MS. LUSSKIN:	I just wanted to4 clarify. I was not cit ing the income figure to in5 any way indicate that I thought that people  could6 afford more in terms of rent , but rather that to7 me it is a sign that this is a - - that the    safety8 net that this provides is being relied upon  by9 people who previously we would have thought  were10 more in the normal apartment developer  category.11 I did not cite that in any  way12 to say that I thought that the SRO  population13 could afford higher rents because of that  figure.14 I was using that figure in a different  way.15 And I don't believe that  that16 figure indicates that because it doesn' t change17 the ent ire populat ion's income, just that there18 are some peopl e entering the system now who are19 at a higher income level. But  certainly20 $15 , 000 a year, which I think the figure is,21 certainly not a Rockefeller.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Pagan.23 MR . PAGAN:	I just would like24 to indicate that when we are looking at  the25 hotels, we are looking at a whole gamut  of4 
2 different populations.3 And from the test imony that I4 was listening to, and I went home and tried   to5 look at some of the math, it came out that  people6 were paying anywhere between fifty to a  hundred7 dollars a square foot for rent. I don't know  of8 too many buildings in Manhattan that  are9 commercial buildings that pay that kind of  rent10 with no services outside of having to util ize  a11 combined bathroom.12 We have wire mesh to  separate13 some of the places, 5 by 7 at best. And we  are14 asking them to pay anywhere between fifty to  a15 ninety- six dollars a square foot of rent . It16 sounds a little bit ridiculous to  me.17 And I think that is the  only18 argument that I really could put out to  indicate19 that this is not the type of increase that  I20 would like to see in general for this type  of21 population .22 Sure , there may be  some23 increases merited  in some of the different  types24 of facilit ies, but to paint it with the same25 brush, all of them, at one time, doesn' t  sound2 
2	right.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chairman?4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.5	Schleider.6	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chairman,7 we heard testimony that owners of SROS,  small8 business peopl e, are struggling to make ends  meet9 to maintain this valuable housing stock  within10 the City. For the past eight years or so  we've11 had five years at least of zero  increases.12 To perpetuate a zero increase  I13 feel may actually contribute to the loss of  these14 SRO units. By taking away any incent ive for a15 landlord to maintain and preserve this  valuabl e16 asset as a safety net  is unconscionable.	How can17 you do it to the City? The landlords, the   owners18 of these small buildings, need relief , a modest19 increase. Modest  increases should be allowed.20 The proviso maintains  that the21 landlord maintain  seventy percent  of these units22 as rent regulated apartments or dwellings.  That23 is a large percent when there are  other24 opportunities  for these landlords to make money25 that the tenant advocat es say they are making.7 
2 To preserve this stock for  the3 good of the City modest rent increases  are4 necessary.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Zelnik.6 MR. ZELNIK:	I must say I heard7 compelling test imony both ways when we heard the8 people test ify at previous Guidelines Board9 meetings.10 I share Mr. Pagan' s concern11 about  the habitability	- I can't say it tonight   -12 - of some of these units that was described.   I13 think it 's somewhat shocking. And I wish that it14 were within the guidelines for us to  do15 something. And obviously it's  not.16 At the same time I  heard17 testimony from some people who manage properties18 who are, in fact , businessmen who are trying  to19 do a good job and trying to be  fair.20 The last few years there  have21 not been increases. And I think for those   people22 who are trying to do a fair and reasonable   job23 and not exploit the poor, I think they  are24 deserving of an  increase.25 I must say today I got  some7 
2 information . I think you sent us a series   of3 websites of SROs in New York. I just  arbitrarily4 picked out a couple. And the first SRO I  picked5 out , Ian Schrager, was renting rooms for $125 or6 $200 or so. And I said this is an SRO? I couldn' t7 afford it .8	So - - but that is another9 situat ion. But I do believe there should be some10 reasonable increase for those people who own  the11 buildings, who manage them within the  seventy12 percent proviso .13 And we need to encourage  those14 people to go on and not have those buildings   fall15 by the wayside.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any17 additional debate?18 (No response.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The mot ion20 before the house is, subject to the proviso,   for21 a five percent	increase in the hotel sector .22 Is that correct? Am I  restating23 that - -24 MR. LUBELL:	Yes.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Adams?9

2Second?3MR. LUBELL:	Second.4CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any5discussion?6Ms. Holder.7MS. HOLDER:	Again, I still8think this istoo high. Historically  these units9 do not have increases as high or  commensurat e10 wi th the increases that go to apartments.11 We are looking at a universe  of12 housing that is very mixed. And, again, I   would13 urge the Board  - -  I can feel on the Board  folks14 want an increase. These increases that are   being15 proposed  so far are too high.16CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No more17debat e.18Call the question.19Ms. Adams?20MS.

2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The mot ion3 passes 6-3 - -  6-2, one abstention.4 I think - - and we passed  the5 proviso earlier.6 So we now move on to the  loft7 guidelines.8	MR. PAGAN:	Mr. Chairman?9	CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Go ahead , Mr.10	Pagan.11	MR. PAGAN:	I move that there12 be no increase on the  lofts.13 And the reason for this is  in14 most loft spaces the tenant is responsible   for15 all the expenses in the loft . They provide their16 own heat and pay for many other  expenses17 themselves.18 And to that extent I move a  zero19 percent	increase.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Second?21 MS. HOLDER:	Second .2 2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder.23 Any debate?24 Mr. Lubell.25 MR. LUBELL:	Very briefly.23 
1	1372 There' s so few lofts. But we3 heard test imony over the years, people who are4 paying  $600, $700 ,  $800 for a loft , 2000 square5 feet of space in Soho. If it weren' t controlled6 by rent stabilization, they would be paying  maybe7 a hundred times more. Certainly the value  of8 those units is so enormous, plus there are  costs.9 They may be providing  services,10 but they don' t pay the taxes. They don' t pay for11 the insurance. And these are costs that the  loft12 owners actually have to pay.13 But  this is valuable  space . Most14 of those loft tenants have had a boon for  years.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay .16 Any additional debate?17 (No response. )18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Call the19 question.20 This is for a zero rent  increase21 for the loft sector.22 Ms. Adams?23 MS.

I have a7 mot ion for a one percent increase on lofts,  one8 and two.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One and two.10 MS. HOLDER:	Right .11 I regretfully make that  motion.12 I understand this Board feels that an increase  is13 in order.14 But , again,  I would  just like to15 emphasize that we are talking about tenants  who16 pay a lot of the other charges that go along   to17 maintain the unit including the fuel . So I would18 just hope this Board would take that  into19 consideration.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Second?21 MR.
