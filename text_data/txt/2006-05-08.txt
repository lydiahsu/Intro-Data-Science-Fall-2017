2 Apart ments and Lofts, rent levels for leases3 commencing  October  1, 2006 through September 3 0 , 4	2007.5	Notice is hereby given pursuant 6 to the authority vest ed in the New York City Rent7 Guidelines Board by the Rent Stabilization Law   of8 1969, as amended , and the Emergency Tenant9 Protection Act of 1974, as amended , implemented10 by Resolution 276 of 1974 of the New York  City11 Council and extended by Chapter 82 of the Laws  of12 2003 , and in accordance with the requirements  of13 Section 1043 of the New York City Charter,  that14 the Rent Guidelines Board hereby proposes  the15 following levels of fair rent increases  over16 lawful rents charged and paid on September 30, 17	2006.18 These rent adjustments will19 apply to rent stabilized apartments with   leases20 commencing on or after October 1, 2006  and21 through  September 30 , 2007.22 Rent guidelines for loft units23 subject to Section 286 subdivision 7 of  the24 Multiple Dwelling Law are also included in   this25 Order.

2 from the existing lease and all subsequent   leases3 for such dwelling unit , the increased  rental ,  if4 any, due under such escalator clause shall  be5 offset against the amount of increase  authorized6 under this Order.7 Special Adjustments Under Prior8 Orders.9 All rent adjustments  lawfully10 implemented and maintained under  previous11 apartment orders and included in the base rent   in12 effect on September 30, 2006 shall continue to  be13 included in the base rent for the purpose  of14 comput ing subsequent rents adjust ed pursuant to15 this Order.16 Proposal Special Guideline .17 Under Section 26- 513 (b)(1) of18 the New York City Administrative	Code, and19 Section 9(e) of the Emergency Tenant  Protect ion20 Act of 1974, the Rent Guidelines Board  is21 obligated to promulgate  special guidelines to  aid22 the State Division of Housing and  Community23 Renewal in its determination of initial  legal24 regulat ed rents for housing accommodations25 previously subject to the City Rent  and

2 Rents will be published  in The Federal  Register3 to take effect on October 1,  2006.4 Credits.5	Rentals charged and paid  in6 excess of the levels of rent  increases7 established by this Order shall be fully   credited8 against the next month' s rent.9 Statement of Basis and  Purpose.10 The Rent Guidelines Board  is11 authorized to promulgat e rent guidelines12 governing apartment units subject to the  Rent13 Stabilization Law of 1969, as amended , and the14 Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974,  as15 amended.16 The purpose of these  guidelines17 is to implement the public policy set forth   in18 Findings and Declaration of Emergency of the   Rent19 Stabilization Law of 1969	(Section 260- 501 of the20 New York City Administrative  Code) and in  the21 Legislat ive	Finding contained in the  Emergency22 Tenant Protect ion Act of 1974	(Laws of 1974,23 Chapt er 576 , Section 4, subsection 2).24 The Rent Guidelines Board  is25 also authorized to promulgate  rent guidelines  for
2 loft units subject to Sect ion 286 Subdivision  73 of the Multiple Dwelling  Law.4 The purpose of the loft5 guidelines is to implement the public policy  set6 forth in the Legislat ive Findings of Article 7-C7 of the Multiple Dwelling Law	(Section 280)8 Let me indicate there' s I think9 one mistake in this, which is, just for  purposes10 of everybody to know, New York City extended  by11 Chapt er 82 of the Laws of 2003 should be amended12 to be as extended by Chapter, whatever  the13 Chapt er is, of the Laws of 2006.14 We' ll clarify. Okay.15 Do I have a motion?	I think you16 guys go first.17 MR. PAGAN:	Good evening.18 (Audience participation.)19 THE CHAIR:	Mr. Pagan. Mr.20 Pagan.21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. PAGAN:	Good evening.23 Good evening to you who are here24 to listen to the Board deliberat e this evening as25 well as my fellow Board Members .2 
1152VOICES:	We can't hear you.3MR. PAGAN:	Okay . Let' s see.4Bett er?5VOICES:	Yes.6MR. PAGAN:	Okay. Let me start7again.8 Good evening to you who are here9 to listen to the Board deliberat e this evening  as10 well as to my fellow Board  Members.11 As we go through the  yearly12 ritual , one that would probably satisfy very  few13 of us, I'm going to ask the public to be  patient14 and respectful of the Board  Members.15 The recent information given  out16 by the press was speculative. What  happens17 tonight  does not mean  - - does not  necessarily18 mean that it ' s the increase that will take   effect19 on October 1st , as the Chairman mentioned.20 This is only a preliminary vot e.21 There will be a final vot e on June 27th in  this22 place at approximat ely the same t ime. We will be23 doing our best for those we represent in order   to24 reach an agreement. The Public Members are   trying25 to formulate what they believe to be a  just8 
2 guideline.3 This has been a very  difficult4 year for the tenants of stabilized housing,  as5 well as owners, fueled by a Federal  Government6 that has provided very little leadership to  the7 citizens.8 Today I was reading a  report9 from the Center for an Urban Future and  the10 Schuyler Center for Analysis and  Policy11 describing how working  families within New  York12 with reference to New York City face   continuing13 challenges.14 Between  2002 and 2003 , which  is15 the latest information they have, of  working16 families who earn less than twice the poverty17 level , nearly  eighty percent  spend more  than one -18 third of their income on  housing.19 The figure increased by20 approximately five percent in one year. And  this21 is happening almost every  year.22 One/f ifth of all workers are23 without health insurance. There is  continued24 increase in the shift to low-wage  work.25 There was also a report by  Juan2 
(  2 Gonzal ez yesterday and today in The Daily  News3 talking about Pinnacle Group, LLC. They  own4 approximately  20,000 rent stabilized apartments.5 As soon as they take over a building,  they6 immediately make improvements in the lobby  and7 begin legal actions against the  tenants.8 Over fifty percent of the9 tenants at their last building acquisition  were10 taken to court trying to evict them.  Those11 apartments that are vacant are improved  and12 rented bringing much higher rents. The  tenants13 that remain get very little as far as repair,  but14 they do get harassed. Many move out from   shear15 exhaustion; others are moved out by the  marshals.16 With  actions like this  -  it may17 not be typical of an owner - we can see how  the18 NOI increased nine percent  this year.19 Today, it 's difficult for me to 2 0	vot e for any increase that does not take  into21 consideration the plight of today' s tenants that22 are in general less affluent than past  years.23 With this, I move for a  rent24 freeze for one and two- years;25 (Audience participation.)
2 MR. PAGAN:	- - No supplemental3 adjustments;4 No sublet allowance;5	And no sublet allowance or no6 senior citizen tax.7 Thank you.8 (Audience participation.)9	THE CHAIR:	Is there a second10 for that motion?11 MS. HOLDER:	I second that12 motion.13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. HOLDER:	I hope that this15 year we can really talk as a Board  about16 affordability, the conditions of the  housing17 stock, as well as the  market.18 I hope that we can have a  full19 discussion on what it is that we see here in  New20 York. Just as David outlined , there are a lot of21 things going on with the housing stock here in22 New York City.23 And we know that costs have  gone24 up , prices have gone up. But what we see,  though,25 is that landlords still are doing very well  here
2	in New York City.3	(Audience part icipation. )4	MS . HOLDER:	Landlords - -5	(Audience participation. )6 MS. HOLDER:	Landlords of rent7 stabilized housing are part icularly doing well8 here in New York.9 But let 's look at New York.10 I see two New Yorks. I see  one11 increasingly,  increasingly affluent and I see12 another one increasingly,  increasingly becoming13 more and more poor.14 (Audience participation.)15 MS. HOLDER:	I see a New York16 where luxury housing throughout the City,  in17 neighborhoods that we never would have  expected18 luxury housing to so quickly and earnestly go   up,19 I see luxury housing throughout New  York.20 But I also see increasingly21 dilapidated tenements next to some of this   luxury22 housing throughout New  York.23 There has to be something  that24 we can do. We know - -25 (The meet ing was interrupted by
2	audience part icipation. )3	THE CHAIR :	Ms. , there' s a4 public hearing in a couple of weeks. You' ll be5 able to talk.6 Thank you . Thank you.7	(The meeting was interrupted by8	audience participation.)9	THE CHAIR :	Could you sit down,10 pl ease.11 (The meeting was interrupted by12 audience participation. )13 THE CHAIR:	Ma' am, ma' am,14 (The meet ing was interrupted by15 audience participation.)16 THE CHAIR :	The meeting stands17 adjourned .18 (At 6:00 o'clock p.m. there was19 a recess in the proceedings .)20 (At 6:06 o'clock p.m. the21 proceedings were resumed.)22 THE CHAIR :	Ms. Holder was23 seconding a mot ion.24 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.25 Just like what our neighbor  was
2 talking about earlier, we have real probl ems  with3 New York City housing stock. We have low, we   have4 moderate and we have the disabled and the  elderly5 who are suffering because of the exorbitant   rents6 that are being asked of them .7 We know that it 's harder and8 harder for families to make ends meet and  that9 their real incomes are steadily declining. And  we10 watch as the price of food , transportation  and11 clothing go up.12 And this Board has  an13 obligation, has an obligation to mit igate  against14 that , to really look at the reports, to weigh all15 of the different factors and to not add to  the16 problem that we have here in New York  City.17 New York City ranks elevent h in18 the nationalized	survey of housing costs but  only19 thirty- seventh in median income . We have a20 problem in this City.21 Let 's talk about , let' s really22 try to talk about this year and I hope that   the23Public Members will aidin this discussion this24year. Let ' s really talkabout affordability.25Let ' s really talk aboutconditions in the market
2and what wecan as a Board do to really make  a3difference ,to really matt er.4We know, just as our  neighbor5was talkingabout conditions in her building,  we6 know that New York City' s Code enforcement7 standards, which are meant to preserve  housing8 standards in multi - family housing developments9 often fall short in the City' s most at - risk10 neighborhoods,  neighborhoods where  the tenants11 are least able to afford to move,  neighborhoods12 where the health and safety of their children   is13 severely compromised. Consequently,  the social14 and economic costs are  extraordinary.15 The condit ion of New York City' s16 housing stock is an issue that affects  the17 quality of life of all New Yorkers. The  direct18 effects of a lack of Code enforcement can  prove19 devastating,  at its worst  - - at its worst , the20 infestation of rodents, cracked ceilings,  pealing21 paint , and inadequate heat and hot wat er to make22 a living situation unhabitable,  deadly in  some23 instances, def initely resulting in unhealthy24 conditions for tenants, their children,  the25 disabled and the elderly, and ultimately  in6 
2	deterioration of the structure of the  building.3	Unfortunat ely, due to the4 current housing shortage, rising rents and  a5 worsening economy, thousands of tenants who   are6 unabl e to pay inflated rental prices are often7 faced with these or similarly perilous  housing8 conditions.9	Look around. We see  it.10 Poor housing stock is a drain  on11 the City' s resources either for repair or to12 provide alternat ive shelter when a family can  no13 longer live there safely. Often these low- income14 tenants are housed in aging properties in15 financially and socially  distressed16 neighborhoods.17 In addition to the direct18 negative effects on tenants, without proper Code19 enforcement  all other preservation  efforts are20 greatly undermined.21 So what are we doing?22 Everyone knows this.  Everyone.23 What is encouraging is  a24 coalition of housing advocacy groups and   large25 banks that hold mortgages on hundreds  of10 
2 apartment buildings in New York City announced   a3 precedent - setting agreement on April 6th of this4 year, under which they will use the  bank' s5 leverage as lenders to pressure  landlords  into6 repairing dilapidated buildings.7 The agreement between  the8 coalition, Housing Here and Now, and the banks  -9 CityGroup and New York Community Bank  -10 represents a new weapon against  landlords11 refusing to make repairs.12 Landlords  - - we know these13 landlords are the same landlords who take  the14 increases, the very high increases that  this15 Board grants every year.16 Under the agreement a bank  that17 receives an application for a mortgage or an18 apartment building must first evaluate  the19 owner' s and building's track record using  the20 records of the City, Department of  Housing,21 Preservation and Development , and those of22 Housing Here and Now. The bank will consider   past23 housing code violat ions, emergency repair  lengths24 and litigation.25 The bank then would require  that2 
2rundownconditions and violations be fixed  before3closingon the sale.4One bank has agreed to  hold  5 repair money in escrow for release when repairs6 are done. The banks are also to annually   inspect7 buildings and those considered  severely8 distressed are to be given a repair plan and   a9 t imetable for complet ion.10 So I ask what are we on the  Rent11 Guidelines Board going to do. How can we make   a12 difference? There has to be something that we   can13 do to account for these units, so many of   them14 that we see, so many that we know about , one that15 we were told about even today. There has to  be16 something that we can do.17 All the studies and  reports18 produced by the expert staff of the New York   City19 Rent Guidelines Board this year show that   owners20 of rent stabilized properties continue to   do21 well. So let 's talk about how well they are22 doing.23 The mortgage  study reports  that ,24 although interest rates went up slightly, from  25	5.51 percent to 6.3 percent after years  of5 
2 decline, lending terms remain generous.  This3 still is a borrower' s market.4	For several years now landlords5 of rent stabilized housing have taken  advantage6 of cheap and readily available financing  and7 refinancing. This is healthy for  them.8	This report to me shows  that9	there are good things going on for  landlords.10 The 2006 Income and  Expense11 Study is a powerful rebuttal to call for  large12 rent hikes that the landlords are making for   this13 year. The 2004 Income and Expense data show   that14 on average net operating income of  rent15 stabilized properties  increased  slightly, from16 37. 8 percent to 38 percent. This gain in or17 maint enance of the net operating income  occurred18 despit e enormous upward pressure  on operating19 costs experienced  in 2003 as evidenced by a  surge20 in the Price Index that year to 16.9  percent.21 Do you remember when that22 happened? Do you remember all the calls that  the23 landlords said about disast er and doom? Do you24 remember? Think about  it.25 Faced with what Michael  McGee10 
2 has called - Michael McGee of the  Tenant3 Political Action Committ ee has called the perfect4 economic storm of 2003 - and it was,  remember,5 with the 18.5 percent real property tax  rate6 increase imposed by the Mayor and the  City7 Council and skyrocketing fuel costs  driving8 operating costs up dramatically,  this Board9 adopted rent increases of 4.5 percent and  7.510 percent . Do you  remember?  I remember.11	I remember quite well. I was12 here. I remember quite well because I had  to13 renew my lease that year as one of your  only14 rent ing members on this Board.15 (Audience participation.)16 MS. HOLDER:	Remember.17 (Audience participation.)18 MS. HOLDER:	It was high19 (Audience participation. )20 MS. HOLDER:	It was high21 (Audience participation.)22 MS. HOLDER:	It was high, it23 was painful. But at the time we were told that   we24 actually as renters had gotten off much  better25 than what really should have happened that  year.12 
2 And there still continue to be calls by  the3 landlords of doom and disast er of abandonment , of4 an inability of them to be able to keep  or5 maintain their building.6 Remember how outraged  everyone7 was?8 Landlords collected these9 increases of 4.5 percent and 7.5 percent during10 the first nine months of calendar year 2004,   and11 for the last three months of 2004 landlords12 collected lower increases of 3 .5 percent and  6.513 percent. Remember?	I remember.14 So now we look at the  reports15 that show us what happened during that year.  And16 so we have the Income and Expense data for  the17 calendar year 2004. And what do we see happen?18 We see that landlords'  economic19 health is holding despite this perfect storm,   a20 constellation of circumstances that we  will21 probably not experience again anytime  soon,22 certainly not this year.23 And with the Price Index  this24 year that is less than half of the 2003   Price25 Index, there can be no justification for  rent2 
2 hikes great er than the ones adopted last year, if3 any at all.4 (Audience participat ion.)5	MS. HOLDER:	Landlords are6 hardly impoverished. Landlords are  hardly7 hurting. Landlords are hardly  poor.8	Let' s face it . Thirty- eight9 cents on a dollar is a healthy net by  any10 standards. I've said it for years and I say   it11 again because that is what we continue to   see.12 In fact , it 's the same ratio13 since 1967 before rent stabilization, all  despit e14 the fact that the housing stock has  aged15 considerably  since then.16 It has aged. And despit e the17 fact that the housing stock has aged,  landlords18 continued to receive large rent increases  over19 the years that have enabled them, that despit e20 the aging of the stock, to continue to reap  huge,21 huge prof its from their buildings.22 The RGB is always there  to23 prot ect the landlords. And we need to be  there24 now to prot ect the tenants.25 (Audience part icipation.)9 
1	302	MS. HOLDER:	This Board is3 supposed to protect against the damage that   this4 skewed market here in New York City because of   a5 lack of space, because of probl ems with zoning,6 because of a lack of affordable housing,  because7 of the actual need for housing, because  we8 actually have a very low vacancy rate , this  Board9 is supposed to prot ect against all of those10 factors that tend to skew this market , that does11 not favor tenants, that makes things  very12 difficult  to maintain affordability.13 Everyone knows what 's going on.14 Everyone knows that landlords are more  than15 whol e. Landlords are doing quite well.16 And even Jack Levy knows. Jack17 Levy, the Senior Managing Director of  Rose18 Associates, Inc . on Madison Avenue wrot e to the19 Board today to clarify a quote attributed to   him20 in a New York Times article dated April   30th,21 wher he , or I guess a colleague of his exclaimed22 to a reporter " it 's a great time to be a23 landlord. "24 (Audience participation.)25 MS. HOLDER:	I'm so glad that3 
(2 he' s so honest or perhaps it was his colleague3 who said that. But they' re so honest.4 And so to clarify it , this is5 what he stated in a letter to the Board and  I6 quote .7 The writer' s story was focused8 on the condo conversion market which is  quite9 strong and free market rents  in Manhattan.	In10 this context , yes, if you are a converter or have11 a building with a substant ial number of free12 market rents, the strength of the market  is13 evident.14 I emphasize that he stated  a15 building with a substantial number of free  market16 rents the strength of the market is evident . He17 knows the deal. We all know the  deal.18 If a landlord is rent ing a19 number of apartments as unregulated units,   then20 that landlord is presumably  collecting rents21 which are hundreds or perhaps even thousands  more22 than the regulated rents.23 Owners in these circumstances24 don't need increases to their rent  regulated25 stock.2 
2 So how can the RGB change  this?3 How can we make a difference? What should we   do?4 I'm not sure , but  I'd like to5 discuss it and I hope that we will have  an6 opportunity to discuss it more during  this7 hearing and as we proceed through this  season .8 (Audience participation.)9 MS. HOLDER:	Right now I second10 my colleague.11 I will hold everyone12 accountable. You should hold me accountable.  And13 so I am seconding my colleague' s motion for a14 rent freeze this year. And I hope that we   can15 have a more  fuller discussion  - -16 (Audience participat ion. )17 MS . HOLDER:	- - as a Board as18 to what it is that we can  do.19 (Audience participation.)20 MS. HOLDER:	The circumstances21 are dire.22 (Audience part icipation. )23 MS. HOLDER:	We need to do24 something that really does consider what 's going25 on in the market  today, that  takes into - -2 
3 MS. HOLDER:	- - consideration4 the fact that landlords are not reinvesting  their5 profits into their buildings,  that takes into6 consideration that no matter what the City   does,7 no matt er what legal services groups are8 available or what tenant lawyers are out  there,9 that the need is overwhelming, the resources   are10 never enough. People are  suffering.11	We need to talk about what' s12 really going on in this market. I hope that  we13 can have that discussion.14 So, again, I second my15 colleague' s motion for a rent freeze.16 Thank you.17 (Audience part icipation. )18 THE CHAIR:	To clarify, just to19 make sure we got the right mot ion.20 Under proposed renewal21 adjustments for apartments, you're saying zero22 for a one, zero for a two, no vacancy  allowance ,23 no supplemental adjustments  and no proposed24 equalization adjustments.

2	Go ahead.3	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you, Mr.4	Chair.5	Thank you, Board Members, and6 welcome to the assembly gathered  here.7 (Audience participation.)8	MR. SCHLEIDER:	This year's9 deliberations have not been easy for the  owner' s10 members in spite of the reports illustrating   an11 easy case to be made for double- digit rent12 increases as a result of continued  higher13 operating costs.14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Housing16 af fordability is a chronic issue for New Yorkers,17 has been for as long as I can remember and  will18 probably be an issue for some time to  come.19 However, there are some positive  developments.20 Last August ,  Mayor Bloomberg21 signed legislation to increase the  income22 threshold  for SCRIE eligibility  and provide23 similar relief for disabled tenants in  rent24 stabilized buildings. That 's a great move.25 New York City will offer  housing9 
2 subsidies of up to $14,600 to entice new  math,3 science and special education teachers to work   in4 the City' s most challenging schools, in one of5 the most aggressive housing  incentive programs  in6 the nation to address the chronic shortage  of7 qualified educators in these specialt ies. That' s8 another great move.9	This is what 's needed , this is10 what has been needed, a workabl e public policy  to11 address housing affordability.12 The largest affordable  housing13 initiative ever undertaken by any American  city14 is moving ahead on building and  preserving15 165,000 units of affordable housing, to  be16 completed in less than seven years, providing17 enough housing for half - a -million New Yorkers.18 (Audience part icipation.)19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	This is being20 done without raising taxes because  the21 Administration	found creative ways22 (Audience participation.)2 3	MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - to use the24	hot housing market	for the greater publ ic good - 25
2 (Audience participation .)3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	and promote  4 ethnically and economically  diverse5 neighborhoods .6 (Audience participat ion.)7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	This is what8 has been needed , a workable public policy to9 address housing affordability,  a workable public10 policy to address housing affordability that  puts11 responsibility where it needs to be, on  the12 shoulders of government , and off the shoulders of13 the private landlord.14 (Audience participat ion.)15 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Tenants, a16 sizable voting block, need to help  the17 Administration	further focus these initiat ives18 and need to work with landlords to petition  the19 City to lower property taxes on rent - stabilized 20	buildings,21	(Audience participation .)2 2	MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - to petition23 the City to lower the water and sewer costs  for24 rent - stabilized buildings, to do something to 25	lower these costs for existing property in  step23 
2 wi th the City init iatives for new affordable3 housing.4 (Audience participat ion.)5	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Respect that6 the landlords have been shouldering the cost  of7 providing what has become an expensive  public8 subsidy program and help to shift  this9 responsibility10 (Audience participation.)11 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - back to12 government where housing  subsidies belong.13 (Audience participat ion.)14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Some say15 landlords don' t need help in shifting the burden16 for subsidizing tenants or meeting  costs.17 Although the City' s housing18 stock condition has improved in recent years   and19 residents are noting  improved neighborhood20 condit ions, we've seen the staff reports that21 show the large increase in distressed  housing22 where expenses are greater than rents. And   this23 is frightening.24 (Audience participation.)25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The percentage6 
2 of distressed rental property doubled in  five3 years to almost twelve percent of the  rental4 properties.5 (Audience part icipation.)6	MR. SCHLEIDER:	What does this7 mean for the future of rent  stabilization?8 The damage from inadequate  rent9 increases so far has encouraged the sale  of10 barely profitable  rent stabilized buildings  from11 long- term stable ownership to speculators that12 have no other agenda but to clear the  building13 for higher rents or convert the properties  to14 condos which will permanently remove  those15 apartments  from rent regulation.16 (Audience participation. )17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	In testimony to18 us a City Council Member reported a series  of19 harassment by a property manipulator.	She20 correctly would not call the owner a landlord   as21 the only purpose was to clear the building  of22 low- rent tenancy and go for condominium23 development.24 No amount of rent increase  will25 satisfy that property manipulator because  that7 
2 property manipulator doesn' t want any tenants to3 collect rent from.4 But unless a commensurate  rent5 increase is passed this year, more and  more6 landlords, folks willing to remain as  landlords7 providing rental housing  for the City,8 (Audience part icipat ion.)9	MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - more10 landlords will sell to property  manipulators11 because the landlords can't keep up with  the12 rapid rise in operat ing costs.13 (Audience participat ion.)14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	This Board15 can't regulate the market forces but we need  to16 be responsive to them.17 (Audience participation.)18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The vast19 majority of owners, the large number of   landlords20 own small buildings. About  forty percent of  the21 regulat ed rental housing stock is in buildings  of22 less than eleven units.23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The vast25 majority of landlords have been suffering   from10 
2 the cost increases of real estate  taxes,3 insurance, fuel oil, labor and services for years4 without a commensurat e increase in rents.5 (Audience participation.)6	MR. SCHLEIDER:	These are the7 gatekeepers of the existing affordable  housing8 stock. These gatekeepers are the private  citizens9 that the City has inequitably forced to  shoulder10 a public cost with higher real estate taxes,   a11 9.4 percent upcoming increase in water and   sewer12 charges and dozens of administrative  fees.13 The tenants must share in  these14 cost increases.15 (Audience participation. )16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	This year's17 cont inuing cost increase of 7.8 percent on top  of18 last year' s 6.9 percent  increase on top of the19 prior year's 16.9 percent  in operating costs must20 be shared.21 This is a 3 1.6 percent increase22 in costs in three years.23 (Audience participation. )24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The Board' s own25 calculations show rent increases as high as  13 .57 
2 percent for a two- year renewal lease is3 warrant ed.4 (Audience participation.)5	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Landlords ask6 us what can the Board do to help keep  our7 properties  from ruin.8 The Board must allow  landlords9 to prot ect New York' s housing and to equitably10 share the burden.11	Well , this Board can and must12 respect the expectations of a reasonable   return13 if the market	is to maintain its investment  in,14 what is referred to as, the largest inventory   of15 affordable housing in the  City.16 This Board cannot frustrate  the17 expectations of a steady and  predictable18 operating income for landlords and expect them   to19 preserve the housing stock called the backbone   of20 this great City.21 To be fair, there should be  a22 sharing of the cost increases. The landlords   have23 been burdened with the lion's share of  cost24 increase and will continue so given the Board' s25 reluctance to provide for adequat e rent12 
2 increases.3 (Audience participation.)4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Part of the5 probl em is the layering of one and two-year6 renewal leases. Only half the two-year  tenancies7 come up for renewal each year. This shifts  the8 burden onto the one-year leases to bear most   of9 the rent increases.10 (Audience part icipat ion.)11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So we propose a12 compromise for one and two-year lease  renewals.13 (Audience participat ion.)14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Although15 tenants have a right to a two-year renewal  lease ,16 there is nothing in the Code that mandates  the17 renewal rent be frozen for two years for a  two-18 year lease. We can set the increase for the   first19 year of the two-year lease now with the   second20 year' s rent adjust ed by the following year's one-21 year  adjustment ,22 (Audience participation.)23 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - a two-year24 statutory right to occupancy but with annual   rent25 increases.2 
2 (Audience participation.)3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	This somewhat4 reduces the need for the double- digit necessary5 rent increases calculated by the staff reports  to6 meet the huge operating cost  increases.7 (Audience participation.)8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That being9 said , in the spirit of sharing the burden, I call10 for a vote for a commensurat e rental increase11 limited to 7 percent for a one-year renewal  lease12 and 7 percent increase on the initial year of   a13 two- year renewal lease with the second year' s14 rent adjusted by the following year' s one -year15 renewal lease adjustment.16 In the event that this17 compromise is deemed unlawful , then we move for  a18 6 percent one- year renewal lease adjustment and  919 percent  two-year renewal lease adjustment.20 (Audience participation.)21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Additionally,2 22 3	(Audience participat ion.)24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	for a25 longevity allowance, move that upon renewal  a24 
2 one- t ime equalization allowance equal to an3 additional $15 per room increase for  apartments4 rent ing for $600 or less and continuously5 occupied for ten years or more.6	Additionally, we are going to7 move that upon renewal an additional 3  percent8 increase for all apartments renting for $600   or9 less per month.10 And legal apartment  sublets,11 upon subletting an allowance in the amount of   ten12 percent.13 And for initial rents for14 decontrolled  units entering stabilizat ion,15 Maximum Base Rent plus 150 percent plus  fuel16 adjustment , or the appropriat e Fair Market   Rent17 for Sect ion 8 Housing as established by HUD  for18 the New York City PMSA adjust ed for gas and19 electric charges, whichever is great er.20 Thank you, Mr. Chair.21 (Audience participation.)22THECHAIR:Do we have a second23onthat?24MR.LUBELL:Second.25THECHAIR:Mr. Lubell seconds.

LUBELL:	Mr. Chair,9THE CHAIR:	Yes, Mr. Lubell.10MR. LUBELL:	- - I second the11mot ion.12And if I can't be heard,  I'm13 going to reiterate my request that Mr. Pagan   read14 my notes if he so desires.15 (Audience participat ion. )16 MR. LUBELL:	The law requires17 the Rent Guidelines Board to look at the  economic18 condition of  - -  this is the law that requires19 this  - -  to look at the economic  condition of the20 resident ial real estate industry not just in  core21 Manhattan but all over the City and the , quote,22 prevailing and project ed costs.23 This year24 (Audience participat ion. )25 MR. LUBELL:	- - our very able13 
2 staff underestimat ed cost s for this year, and3 they' re usually good at projections.4 But predicting  costs in advance5 is extremely difficult. That is why we  should6 consider,  if it is lawful , the suggestion   and7 proposal of my colleague for 7 percent  one-year,8 7 percent the second year.9 In any event in determining  a10 guideline beginning this October 1st , we can't11 ignore current12 (Audience participat ion.)13 MR. LUBELL:	- - events.14 Here  - - these are not my15 personal observations. Here are some of  the16 headlines and newsworthy comments of the  past17 week or so - -18 (Audience participation.)19 MR.  LUBELL:	- - that we need to20 consider in voting on a  guideline.21 Quot e , quote, oil prices will22 have short - term ups and downs but over the long-23 term prices are going up,  unquote.24 (Audience participation.)25 MR.  LUBELL:	Freddie Mac ,2 
2 quote, quote, mortgage rates hit four-year  highs,3 unquote.4 (Audience participation.)5	MR. LUBELL:	And all of us here 6 know that it 's not going anyplace but higher.7 We all heard the Water  Board8 made a proposal for a 9.4 percent increase   for 9 2007. That 's to go along with escalating fuel , 1011	(Audience participation.)12 MR. LUBELL:	- - contractor,13 labor costs and not to exclude real estate  taxes.14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. LUBELL:	Let 's remember16 all of us, let ' s remember that costs in pre- war17 buildings - -18 And I'm sure many of you,  but19 not most of you, live in pre- war buildings, and20 according to the 2006 Price Index 91 percent  of21 the buildings in the City are pre- 1940 .22 - - those costs increased by  7.823 percent , but  for 91 percent  of the buildings24 those costs increased by 8.4  percent.25 (Audience part icipat ion. )
2	MR. LUBELL:	Now, let 's talk a3 moment	- - let 's talk a moment  about the reality4 of those supposed high real estate values  which,5 as we know sitting here, all of you know,  are6 meaningl ess to owners in Far Rockaway, East  New7 York, Morrisania and dozens of areas outside   of8 Manhattan and a few discrete areas in  Brooklyn9 and Queens that aren't conversion targets,  most10 buildings in the City of New York, the  large,11 vast majority, are not targets for  conversion.12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. LUBELL:	CNN - -14 If you own a building15 (Audience participation. )16 MR. LUBELL:	- - and even if the17 value is high, you can't unlock that value   in18 most instances particularly if you don' t want  to19 sell it.20 CNN reported just last week,21 just last Friday, that , quote, we are living in  a2 2	real estat e dead zone . .	There' s an ill - wind23 blowing through the housing  market.24 (Audience participation. )25 MR. LUBELL:	On the other hand ,
2 we should not overlook that the Labor  Department3 report last week  - that 's not my report , it 's the4 Labor Department' s report - that hourly wages5 rose at an annual rate of 5.8 percent , not for6 all of us - -7 (Audience participation.)8 MR. LUBELL:	- - and not for9 many of you, but at an annual rate of 5.8  percent10 for the first three months of the year. That' s11 the fastest pace in five  years.12 Again, that' s not for many of13 you sitting here, but for hundreds of  thousands14 of citizens of New York who are not  here.15 And according to a columnist ,16 just last week, quote, you can expect  the17 unemployment	rate to keep falling and the  growth18 of labor compensation to keep  accelerating.19 Let' s hope that' s true.20 Finally,21 (Audience participation. )22 MR. LUBELL:	- - let 's not23 forget that 11.6 percent of buildings that  are24 reported  to us are distressed.  That means  - -25 distressed buildings mean that they had costs   in
2 excess of gross income. That 's not good. That 's3 just not good.4 (Audience part icipation.)5	MR. LUBELL:	And that number6 excludes buildings  from six to ten units.7 I have two questions for  the8 Board.9 How many buildings are on  the10 cusp of being distressed because of  soaring11 costs?12 And , two,13 (Audience part icipation.)14 MR. LUBELL:	- - do we want to15 see the number of distressed buildings  grow16 simply because we don' t grant adequate increases?17 I ask the Board to bear this  in18 mind when you consider your balancing act.19 (Audience participation.)20 THE CHAIR:	Is that it?21 MR. LUBELL:	Yes.22 THE CHAIR:	That was a second23 on a motion  that , if I understand	it , is:24 A one-year increase of 7  percent25 with a 7 percent for a two-year with a , for  lack6 
1	532	of a bett er term, a re-opener in the second year;3	Alternatively, and I'm not sure4 how this alternative	- -5 (Audience participat ion.)6	THE CHAIR:	I'm just restating7	the motion.8	- - how this motion,  this would9	exactly work, a 6 and 9 I think it  was.10	MR.

HOLDER:	Okay. Thank you.24 It was interesting listening to 25	Mr. Schleider and Mr. Lubell  talk.21 
1	562	VOICES:	Louder.3	MS. HOLDER:	I understand and I4	actually agree on a couple of points that  Mr.5	Schleider raised in his motion.6 He said that when it comes  to7 the issue around housing, that we need  to8 remember that the responsibility should be  on9 government and hold government accountable  to10 solving some of these problems.11	And  I think he 1    s right.12 I would like to remind the Board13 and Mr. Schleider, however, that we are part  of14 that government.15 (Audience participat ion.)16 MS . HOLDER :	Every member17 the Rent Guidelines Board is a nine- member Board18 consisting of two owner representat ives, two19 tenant representat ives, and five public members,20 all appointed by the Mayor of New York  City.21 And we are a part of the  problem22 and hopefully we can try to become a part of  the23 solution, and remember that we do have  a24 responsibility because we are that government he 25	speaks of .12 
1	572 And with all due respect to  Mr.3 Lubell , if we all would leave core Manhattan  and4 look around in the other boroughs, we' ll find5 that gentrif ication is taking place at a rapid6 pace throughout this City.7 (Audience participation.)8 MS. HOLDER:	In East New York9 as well as in the Rockaways, throughout   Brooklyn,10 throughout the Bronx, we are seeing  extreme11 gentrif icat ion going on.12 (Audience participation. )13 MS. HOLDER:	And there is no14 disincent ive for that , and there needs to be more15 checks and controls on maintaining affordable16 housing.17 (Audience participation.)18 MS. HOLDER:	I really would19 like for this Board to consider what it is  we20 have been doing because even in previous years,21 even in years when the Price Index of  Operat ing22 Costs actually was a negative, we have  granted23 increases over and over  again.24 And even when we saw that  the25 economic circumstances weren' t as dire as
2 predict ed, there has never been a correct ion in3 tenants' rent .4	And tenants' rent  gets5 compounded yearly by the increases that  this6 Board approves.7 So I am asking this Board  to8 seriously consider my  proposal.9	A one -year guideline of	.510 percent ;11 And 1 percent for a two- year12 renewal  lease guideline;13 (Audience participation.)14 MS.

LUBELL:	On the other hand ,18 we can make an effort to reduce   - -19 (Audience participation. )20 MR . LUBELL:	- - we can make an21 ef fort to reduce the number of distressed22 buildings. We can make an effort by making   sure23 that those people who can afford to pay more  -24 and there are some, you have to concede  that25 there are people who can pay increases in  rent.10

And17 certainly we have the right in the  final18 adjustment to make a different ial for that.19MS.KAUFMAN:	I'll second the20motion.21THECHAIR:	The motion is22seconded.23Anydiscussion?24MS.HOLDER:	Yeah, there' s25discussion.
2	THE CHAIR:	Go ahead.3	MS. HOLDER :	This year I would4 really like if the Board would consider that  we5 get away from this pract ice of having ranges.6 It 's a concern7 (Audience participat ion.)8	MS. HOLDER:	I would like the9 Board to adopt proposed preliminary guidelines   so10 that the public can comment on what we  are11 proposing will be set  guidelines.12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. HOLDER:	It 's a real14 it 's a major difference and it may be  - - it  may15 violat e CAP or the City Administrative	Procedures16 Act for us to cont inue to proceed in this  way.17 I think that we should be18 definitive and we should let the public know  what19 it is that this Board is actually thinking   about.20 (Audience participation. )21 MS. HOLDER:	And we should stay22 here until we figure what that  is.23 (Audience participation.)24 MS. HOLDER:	I would like for25 the Board to abstain from a range and try to  have
2 a real discussion about what we are doing   this3 year with the apartments and loft  guidelines.4 THE CHAIR:	We have a second on5 the mot ion.6	Any additional debate?7	MR. LUBELL:	I move the8	question.9	THE CHAIR:	Move the quest ion.10	The quest ion is a range:11	3 to 6.5;12	5 to 8.5;13 And all the other  guidelines14 that were indicated in my  motion.15 Ms. Adams?16 MS. ADAMS:	Mr. Chairman,17 THE CHAIR:	Sure.18 MS. ADAMS:	- -  I think everyone19 on the Board - -20 VOICES:	Can' t hear you.21 MS. ADAMS:	Hello?22 I think everybody on this  Board,23 probably particularly  the Public Members,  are as24 frustrated now as we were last year and the  year25 before.13 
2	And it is because of the3 overwhelming  housing affordability probl em in our4 area, New York; not just New York City but   other5 places as well.6 (Audience participat ion.)7	MS. ADAMS:	I think we also8 know that the paramet ers within which we are able9 to operat e are very small given the total10 problem.11 What I think we have begun12 tonight and hopefully will continue is  what13 Adriene calls a discussion of what 's at hand.14 What has happened with the  April15 the 6th agreement that she referred to and  the16 Mayor' s housing policy get at part of the17 problem.	I don' t know that anyone has what it18 takes to deal with all of  it.19 But clearly we got to  keep20 trying. And we can do that only in areas where   we21 can hear each other talk and really discuss  it.22 With that I will also  speak23 against Adriene with regard to the ranges. I   am24 comfortable with the range that has been  set25 forth because  there  is - -8 
2 (Audience participation. )3 MS. ADAMS:	- - there is a lot4	to learn.5	And although we don' t like the6 result , what we receive between now and when we7 take a final vot e, for me if not for other people8 on the Board , does have a  bearing.9	(Audience participation.)10	MS.

And you are   fully7 ent itled to make this mot ion, but you are making8 a mot ion to the item that just passed.9	MS. HOLDER:	No.10 What I'm doing is I'm making  a11 separate motion that says that despit e what the12 guideline is, that there is another  provision13 that would apply to apartments. It 's a separate14 motion. It 's not an amendment to the current15 motion.16 THE CHAIR:	It is an amendment.17 But go ahead. Go ahead.18 (Audience participation. )19 MS. HOLDER:	I'd like for the20 Board to consider  - -21 (Audience participation. )2 2	MS. HOLDER:	- - a proposed23 renewal adjustment  for apartments.24 I think it is clear that we  need25 to think of other ways in which we look at  the
1	732 housing  stock and what 's going on between  - - with3 certain landlords and tenants in the  City.4 So I propose that the  annual5	adjustment for a renewal lease commencing on or6 after October 1, 2006 and on or before  September7 3 0 , 2007 shall be zero if :8	(1) 75 percent or less of the9 resident ial units in the building are occupied  by10 rent stabilized or rent controll ed tenants11	(Audience part icipation.)12 MS.

HOLDER:	Three, number11 I 'm sorry?12 THE CHAIR:	Go ahead.13 MS. HOLDER:	Three rent14 impairing violat ions or five 5	(b) and	(c)15 violations exist and have not been  corrected16 within the required statutory t ime frame and will17 remain zero until such time as HPD can  verify18 through  its own inspection  - -19 (Audience participation. )20 MS. HOLDER:	that the21 violations have been  corrected.22 (Audience participation. )2 3	MS. HOLDER:	I offer these24 (Audience participation.)25 MS. HOLDER:	I offer these as
2 addit ional provisions to whatever gets adopted by3 this Board because it is time that we look  at4 what is going on with the housing  stock.5 We know that tenants are not6 being informed of which apartments are  being7 regist ered so they don' t know whether they are8 being subject to overcharge  claims.9 We need to make sure that10 landlords comply with that  obligation.11 We need to make sure that12 landlords are actually putt ing their profits or13 some part of their money back into the  buildings14 so that people don't continue to live  in15 substandard conditions.16 Those landlords certainly  don't17 deserve an increase.18 And we really - -19 (Audience participation.)20 MS. HOLDER:	- - need to be21 clear. And we know and the landlords  know,22 everyone knows, that when you have a  substantial23 number of unregulated units in your  building,24 that you are being more than  compensated.25 And so I ask that this  proposal
2	meet with the Board' s approval.3	And that 's my proposal	in terms4	of adjustments  for apartments.5 THE CHAIR :	Do we have a second6 on that?7 MR. PAGAN:	Second.8 THE CHAIR:	Any discussion?9 (Audience participat ion. )10	THE CHAIR:	Mr. Lubell.11	MR.

LUBELL:	I suggest that we17 consider whether this is consist ent with the law.18 THE CHAIR:	Right.19 As indicated at the last	one20 of the last meetings that the Board had , I21 referred these suggested amendments  to22 Corporation Counsel and without going  into23 detail , every Board Member has in their packet  a24 ten- page memorandum which indicates that all  four25 proposals are, in fact , not consist ent with the
2	powers of the Rent Guidelines  Board.3	With that I intend to vote  no.4	Any addit ional debat e?5	(No response.)  6 MR. LUBELL:	Move the question.7 MS. HOLDER:	I would hope that8 we could continue this conversation though and   I9 hope that during the rest of the season we   will.10 No one has really been able  to11 look at the research that 's come through. We' ll12 look at it together. Hopefully we can have  a13 fuller discussion about what it is that  this14 Board can do differently to address the needs   of15 the New York City housing stock, the tenants  and16 the landlords.17 We need to have a  fuller18 discussion about all these  issues.19 THE CHAIR:	No probl em. I'm20 sure we can't cut off discussion no matter if  we21 chose to.22 On the mot ion:23 Ms. Adams?24 MS. ADAMS:	Because of the 25	ruling we got from Corporat ion Counsel , I vote6
