10 set it for two- and- half minutes now so we can get 11 through tonight.12 Go ahead. Mr. Lasher.13 MR. MICA LASHER:	Thank you.14 I' m Mica Lasher here on behalf of 15 Congressman Nadler who could not be here. But  he 16 urges you not to vote for a rent increase that   is 17 not supported by the data.18 Over the last year, average  growth 19 in income was two times the growth in  operating 20 expenses.	So why how a hardship increase  on 21 tenants?22 Why at a time when 100 , 000 units 23 over the last decade have left rent  regulation,24 14 , 000 in the last year alone.25 Why now at a time when  affordable 10 
2 rents are the last hope for economic diversity  for 3 our neighborhood at a time when one- in- four New 4 Yorkers pays more than half of their income  in 5 rent, at a time when our seniors can' t afford  to 6 stay here and young people can' t afford to come 7 here and at a time when illegal hotels,  phony 8 demolitions and abuse of the personal use  provision 9 have hemorrhaged affordable units out of an  already 10 too tight housing market.11 We are already seeing the  results.12 Thirty- five thousand people in shelters every 13 night, up eight percent from last year. Members  of 14 families and individuals sleeping in the streets  in 15 greater numbers than before. We can do better  in 16 this City and we must.17 You are right.	We must find 18 solutions for small landlords. And as  Borough 19 President Stringer said, we must do so  without 20 pitting them against tenants and without a poor  tax 21 that puts the burden squarely on those least  able 22 to afford it.23 The solution perhaps must indeed 24 come from other bodies.	But the RGB should not act 25 as the cure- all, as the automatic release valve for 2 
2 landlords at the expense of  tenants.3 We can do better in this City.  We 4 can expect better. And we are hoping for better.  We 5 are hoping for a surprise for your better angels  to 6 act and to vote against a rent increase that  this 7 City cannot afford.8 Thank you.9 ( Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any questions?11 ( No response.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you 13 related to Howard Lasher?14 MR. MICA LASHER:	No.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No. Okay.16 Thank you.17 Heather Borstein.18 MS. HEATHER BORSTEIN:	Hi.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hi.20 MS. HEATHER BORSTEIN:	Thank you 21 for hearing our testimony today.22 There' s a myth that' s being 23 perpetrated by a lot of the tenant advocates  that 24 are speaking today and that is, that being  a25 landlord equals being wealthy. And that' s just not 2 
2 true. That might be true for the large  landlords.3 It might be true for the private  equity firms.	It 4 might be true for some of the big developers,  but 5 there' s a big contingency of us that are  small 6 property owners that own one or two or  three 7 buildings.8 I own one building in Harlem. It' s9 all rent stabilized. I have watched, over the  past 10 year, my water increase over  fourteen percent.	My 11 fuel has nearly doubled. My taxes have gone up.  The 12 cost of labor, the cost of repairs, the cost  of 13 maintaining this property so it is comfortable  for 14 my rent stabilized tenants to live in has gone  up 15 significantly. The rent has not gone up with  my 16 expenses, not even close to  proportionate.17 Because we, small property owners 18 are having trouble keeping up with prices, there' s19 more of an incentive for us to sell our  properties 20 to larger businesses to people with bigger  pockets 21 who then might be inspired to turn the  buildings 22 over into condominiums, probably higher rates,  thus 23 decreasing even more affordable housing.24 We -- with these expenses,25 there' s very little incentive for small property 2 
2 owners to improve their building to make  necessary 3 adjustments, even if it' s something like repairing 4 the sidewalk. It gets expensive. And when you' re 5 barely breaking even, there' s no money in the 6 budget.7 Last summer I had a huge  expense.8 There was a leak from the main valve in the   street 9 to the water in my property. I had three days   to 10 find somebody to repair the building. Because I  own 11 one building and not several, there' s only one 12 building that can absorb that  cost.13 I was seven months pregnant. I  had 14 to find somebody within three business days to do  a15 $ 20 , 000 job and they needed fifty percent of the 16 money before they could begin work. I had  three 17 days to do this.18 It' s very hard. Affordable housing 19 does not equal landlords' subsidized housing.  It 20 just doesn' t.	Unfortunately, the way the system is 21 designed, it' s not based on need. Somebody else 22 mentioned it' s based on longevity. I know people 23 who are living in rent stabilized apartments on  the 24 Upper East Side, on Park Avenue, on  Lexington 25 Avenue, on Third Avenue. They take fancy  vacations.2 
 2 They have two or three cars. They have second  homes 3 out in the Hamptons.4 There was an article in The  Times 5 about that about a family that was renovating  their 6 house in South Hampton. And this is  being 7 subsidized by the landlords. And that' s not to say 8 the majority, but they do  exist.9 ( Audience participation.)10 MS. HEATHER BORSTEIN:	I was quiet 11 for everybody else. You can be quiet for  me,12 please.13 Tenants also have an insane  amount 14 of rights. Last year -- two years ago I   went 15 through a legal suit for a man that had --   before 16 he applied for the apartment he  showed 17 documentation of working for a reputable attorney 18	--19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 20 wrap up.21 MS. HEATHER BORSTEIN:	-- showing 22 significant income.	It cost me several thousands 23 of dollars.	He did not pay his rent. And in  the 24 middle of this legal consequences, I had to  offer 25 him a lease renewal. It' s not a problem --  small 19 
2 landlords have to break even. I am one person.  I3 have one building. And subsidized housing does  not 4 mean -- you know, I work with my tenants. I help   my 5 tenants if they' re behind, but I want to  break 6 even. It' s a business.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 8 wrap up.9 MS. HEATHER BORSTEIN:	It' s a10 business.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any questions?12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Question, please.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 ( Audience participation.)15 MR.

SCHLEIDER:	How many units 24 in your building, please?25 MS. HEATHER BORSTEIN:	I have 2 
2 eight rent stabilized units.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And they' re all 4 registered.5 MS. HEATHER BORSTEIN:	That' s6 correct.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Any violations8 on the property?9 MS. HEATHER BORSTEIN:	No.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And your average 11 rent for the property?12 MS. HEATHER BORSTEIN:	I would say 13 it' s around $ 600 .14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 Corey Green.16 ( Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Green.18 Quiet.	Mr. Green. Ms. Green.	I' m sorry. Go ahead.19 MS. COREY GREEN:	That' s all 20 right.	I' m actually -- I' m here speaking on 21 behalf of Assemblymember Richard Gottfried.22 Okay.23 My name --24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Pick the mike 25 up. Take it out.2 
2 MS. COREY GREEN:	All right.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That' s it.4 MS. COREY GREEN:	My name is 5 Richard N. Gottfried. I represent the 75 th Assembly 6 District in Manhattan which includes  the 7 neighborhoods of Chelsea, Clinton, Midtown, part  of 8 the Upper West Side and Murray  Hill.9 I regret that due to  the 10 legislative session in Albany I am unable  to 11 testify today in person.12 These proposed increases,13 three- and- a- half percent to seven percent for 14 one- year leases, and five- and- half to 15 nine- and- a- half percent for two- year leases in rent 16 stabilized apartments and lofts, are  unjustified 17 and would make life harder for all New  Yorkers.18 Last year this board approved a19 three percent increase for one- year leases and a20 five- a- three- quarter percent increase for two- year 21 leases. Those increases were large and tenants  are 22 struggling as a result.23 I strongly oppose this year' s24 proposals and urge that the Board reject  them.25 In the past years the  RGB 2 
2 justified high, permanent increases in rents  by 3 citing unusual temporary price surges reflected  in 4 the Price Index of Operating Costs. The fact  is 5 that current rents are already well above  landlord 6 costs. If costs are rising, they are only  now 7 catching to up the unwarranted increases of  the 8 past and should not be used to justify further  rent 9 increases.10 The Board should be enacting  a11 rent freeze this year or at least  dramatically 12 scaling back its proposed increases. If the  Board 13 does adopt rent increases, it should adopt a  narrow 14 spread between one- year and two- year leases - past 15 tradition is a two percent spread - rather  than 16 institute a longevity tax on long- term tenants.17 The Board should not ignore 18 widespread practices by which landlords cheat 19 tenants and steal from the housing.	Many landlords20 have extensive violations on their buildings 21 because they don' t pay for basic maintenance or 22 services and yet they collect full rent  increases.23 Landlords are stealing needed 24 units from the housing market by renting them  out 25 as illegal hotel rooms. They are able to make  more 2 
2 money than they could be renting them as  rent 3 regulated apartments and their tenants suffer  from 4 having a building loaded with strangers coming  in 5 and out at all hours of the day and night. Yet   the 6 landlords are given rent increases as if this  was 7 not going on.8 Higher rent increases on low  rent 9 apartments tend to be occupied by low- income people 10 and they already pay a higher rent  burden.11 Median income for renters in  rent 12 stabilized apartments under $ 600 is $ 20 , 000 a year.13 The Price Index looks at increases in prices  of 14 items such as fuel, insurance premiums,  utilities 15 and property taxes. But a price increase only  means 16 a spending increase if the landlord continues  to 17 buy the item at the same pace rather than  cutting 18 back on services.19 Studies have shown that many 20 landlords do exactly that. More importantly,  the 21 Price Index does not take into account the  income 22 of tenants.	And its data on landlords and  income 23 expenses is outdated by the time the Board  makes 24 its decision.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 2 

2	wrap up.345	you think.6
MS. COREY GREEN:	All right. CHAIRMAN MARKUS:		Tell us what MS. COREY GREEN:	Tenants are 
7 paying high rents in a shrinking market  of 8 affordable housing. Housing policies make  this 9 situation worse. Every administrative body that 10 oversees New York City housing issues has  a11 responsibility to tell Albany where they stand  on 12 the call to repeal the Urstadt Law and return  Home 13 Rule to the City.14 I urge the Board to vote  against 15 these unjustified rent increases.16 ( Applause.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 Any questions?19 ( No response.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 Melyvn Trepper;22 Followed by Lucille Carrasquero;23 Followed by Irwin Seltzer.24 You' re all here, right?25 A VOICE:	What number are you up 7

My 5name is Melvin Trepper.6I own a sixteen- family building on 7West 16 th Street in Chelsea.8I want to speak about the need  for 9 an increase, a kicker, for long- term, low rent 10 tenants. And the reason for this need is that  the 11 increase that you' re going to grant and the 12 increases that you' ve granted in the past have 13 never been sufficient to compensate for  the 14 increases in expenses.15 An increase -- for example, on  a16 $ 3000 apartment, a five percent increase is $ 150 a17 month. An increase on a $ 650 apartment is $ 32 . 50 a18 month.19 These type of increases don' t20 allow for compensation for the increases  in 21 expenses.22 I want to give you some  --23 ( Audience participation.)24 MR. MELVIN TREPPER:	I want to 25 give you some actual examples which I  think 9 
2 disputes what a lot of the Council people  and 3 tenants have been talking about for my  own 4 building.5 This is a first floor -- this  is 6 16 th Street between Seventh and Eighth.7 Five- story, walk- up building. First floor, two- room 8 apartment. The rent is $ 640 . 70 a month. The lease 9 was signed originally February of 1979 , 29 years.10 Another two- room apartment on the 11 first floor. The rent is $ 687 . 49 . The lease was 12 signed July of ' 93 , fifteen years ago.13 A fourth floor, two- room 14 apartment, the rent is $ 756 . 56 .	The lease was 15 signed June of ' 83 , 25 years ago.16 Two more.17 A second floor apartment,18 five- room. The rent is $ 859 . It' s rent controlled.19 I don' t have the data release.20 And the third floor also a21 five- room apartment at $ 853 a month. Rent 22 controlled. The lease date is  unknown.23 These five apartments constitute 24 31 percent of my building. So you can see that   it 25 becomes a burden when I have increases in water  and 2 
2 sewer and repairs and real  estate taxes.	And the 3 five percent or six percent increase on this  base,4 on this base rent is not going to allow  for 5 sufficient increase.6 ( Audience participation.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Did you say 8 thirty- one percent?9 MR. MELVIN TREPPER:	Thirty- one 10 percent of the whole building is in those  five 11 rents.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.13 MR. MELVIN TREPPER:	I' m on a14 first- name basis with probably every tenant in that 15 building. When they call for electric  repair,16 plumbing repair, the electrician or  plumbers,17 they' re either there that day or the next day.  The 18 roof is in good repair. The halls are kept  clean.19 The mechanicals are upgraded as they' re needed. The 20 halls are painted.21 Here' s the rub: When you' re a22 responsible landlord, you get no turnover. There' s23 a perverse, and I would say inverse, incentive  not 24 to keep your building up because then the  higher 25 probability is you will have a turnover and  get 2

Go ahead.MS. LUCILLE CARRASQUERO:	Never My name is Lucille Carrasquero. I am Chairperson of the  Cooper 
7 Square Committee.	Our organization has seen a8 great deal of deregulation of rent  stabilized 9 housing in recent years.10 We estimate that only about 11 one- third of apartments on the Lower East Side are 12 now rent stabilized. Landlords are  regulating 13 apartments through a variety of practices,  both 14 legal and illegal.15 On the Lower East Side, many  of 16 our neighbors are facing an onslaught  of 17 displacement pressures from phony demolition 18 filings to personal use evictions and  from 19 aggressive litigation followed by buyout offers.20 These tactics have recently been 21 effective, removing thousands of units from  rent 22 stabilization in our community in the past  few 23 years. These landlords are making huge profits  on 24 the deregulated apartments.25 Rent increases are part of  a7 
2 dynamic process whereby buildings are bought  and 3 flipped, tenants moved in and out, renovations  take 4 place to drive up rents.5 To see annual rent, RGB  rent 6 increases in a vacuum is to miss the  bigger 7 picture. Rents have been going up at a far  faster 8 pace than the official inflation rate. And  building 9 sales prices have skyrocketed as  well.10 For example, last year, Westbrook 11 Partners purchased seventeen buildings from the 12 Extell Development Corporation for $ 97 . 5 million.13 Extell had paid $ 72 million for those seventeen 14 buildings just eighteen months earlier. So  Extell 15 flipped these buildings for a $ 25 million profit.16 Not bad for an eighteen- month investment.17 These seventeen buildings contain 18 251 apartments.	So Westbrook paid an average  of 19 over $ 380 , 00 per apartment. What happened next is 20 no surprise. They have vacated forty percent  of 21 these apartments in eighteen months.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 23 wrap up, ma' am.24 MS. LUCILLE CARRASQUERO:	Oh!25 All of them have been  deregulated.2 
2 The loss of rent regulated  housing 3 is not just about rent increases. It' s about the 4 loss of the right to a lease renewal, a right   that 5 deregulated tenants do not have.

IRWIN SELTZER:	Anyway, I' ve 8 been waiting for a couple of hours to speak.  I9 don' t know how long he' s been waiting.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.11 MR. IRWIN SELTZER:	But I don' t12 like to use the term landlord.	I' m a small 13 apartment building owner along with a bank,  who 14 supplies my mortgage.15 And the fuel cost, the taxes,  the 16 water and sewer, environmental fines for a piece  of 17 napkin in front of your building have made  it 18 pretty hard for a small landlord to make things  go.19 I have a four- story walkup with 20 four family cousin members living there,  children 21 of older cousins of mine. And I do love my   tenants.22 And that' s one of the reasons -23 even though I' ve been offered a nice sum of  money 24 for my building - I' m not selling because  where 25 would my tenants go if the new landlord, in   order 2 
2 to pay me what he would like to pay me, would   have 3 to raise the rents astronomically to somehow,  I4 don' t know who they would do, but apparently 5 they' re willing to.6 But the cost increases to  the 7 small property owner have made it very difficult  to 8 manage your property properly.9 And I' d like -- so especially 10 long- term tenants.	My family members pay 100 11 percent more to me than people who have been in   my 12 building for fifteen years and that' s really not --13 it doesn' t please me take so much money from  my 14 family members.15 And that' s it.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 Mr. Williams.18 ( Applause.)19 MR. JUMAANE WILLIAMS:	Good 20 evening.21 My name is Jumaane B. Williams  and 22 I' m a small landlord in Brooklyn. Again this year  I23 will not be raising my tenants' rent and I   come 24 here embarrassed at this farce.25 There are plenty of owners that 2 
2 will show you how destitute rent stabilized  tenants 3 in this city are. I' m sure you heard they' re well 4 below the median income for the City as a   whole,5 even lower in comparison to homeowners or  even 6 unregulated tenants.7 The number that strikes me  the 8 most this year is that even with the  modest 9 increase of $ 60 on 350 , 000 households -- 350 , 000 10 households will be paying 63 percent of  their 11 income in rent. This is government  sponsored 12 economic oppression period.13 The rent stabilization system was 14 designed to help all New Yorkers with the  ability 15 to live in this great City. Today it helps  the 16 City' s most abused taxed and neglected population,17 low income people of color and  immigrants.18 Yes, landlords are in this to  make 19 money and by all means they should. However,  this 20 battle ensures what they do while oppressing  the 21 very people it was designed  to help.	And every 22 year the pressure gets worse.23 Of course, landlords are not 24 welfare agencies for their tenants. But  the 25 viability of the RGB will make sure of the  rent 2 
2 increases for landlords. How can you force  hundreds 3 of thousands of people deeper into poverty  every 4 single year?5 And it' s the media and Mayor who 6 are left to say it' s the annual fight.	As long as 7 the increase is somewhere in the middle than  the 8 board has gone a good job. But that' s not  it.9 Because it' s never in the middle. If tenants are 10 asked for a decrease and then the landlords ask  for 11 an increase, the middle would be zero and  tenants 12 have never gotten that.13 The mere fact that every year  that 14 there are increases means the landlord has won.  It 15 was a zero sum game.	The fact that of the  matter 16 is no matter what the economy is doing,  although 17 the landlords make a million dollars or  ten 18 dollars, tenants will get an increase. How is  that 19 a job well done?20 Since the inception of this Board 21 it has never given a zero percent increase  or 22 decrease.	Never, ever. It' s never been even 23 seriously discussed.	So the media and Mayor should 24 get it right. Tenants will use this system  always.25 There are small landlords like 2 
2 myself who need help, but we should not be  linked 3 to large landlords who own hundreds of units. It' s4 two different animals. For God' s sake, the large 5 landlords won' t even show us the books. Why?6 Because they know where all the rents stand,  greed 7 to the point of pushing people into poverty. As  I8 said, last year this Board was a sham. What  happens 9 here is not only immoral, but unethical and  an 10 disgusting example of a democratic  society.11 ( Audience participation.)12 MR. JUMAANE WILLIAMS:	The 13 landlord members appear to be heartless to  the 14 plight of tenants.	The public members seem 15 anything but.	And Marvin Markus, you should be 16 ashamed of yourself, ashamed of the  legal 17 oppression of hundreds of thousands of people  every 18 year.19 ( Applause.)20 MR. JUMAANE WILLIAMS:	And ashamed 21 of the Jim Crow Rent Guidelines Board. But you' re 22 not and neither is the Mayor and that makes it   oh,23 so much worse.	Tenants themselves feel that no 24 matter who testifies here they will be getting  an 25 increase. And in the same way systems change,  to 2 
2 all the good people in the City, keep fighting  the 3 good fight.4 Thank you.5 ( Audience participation.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 Jimmy McMillan.8 MR. JIMMY MCMILLAN:	The Rent is 9 Too Damn High!10 I mentioned before, I' m Jimmy 11 McMillan, the founder and Chairman of the Rent  is 12 Too Damn High movement for the twelve  million 13 people I represent that come to my web  site,14 including children who graduated from high  schools15 following the attacks on the World Trade Center  who 16 can' t find an apartment.17 For the senior citizens who can' t18 afford to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner  because 19 they don' t have the money to pay the rent or  when 20 they pay the rent they' re broke. After they take 21 the medication they can' t buy food after the buying 22 the medication.23 We ask you to make a good  decision 24 and make the right decision. Your decision is  a25 stimulus package for the people of  this City.	Put 2 
2 a cap on rents, freeze rent and reduce rent,  reduce 3 rent to the landlords who fail to comply with  your 4 laws that are already on the books, landlords  who 5 have refused to register the buildings. They' re not 6 entitled to a rent increase  --7 ( Applause.)8 MR. JIMMY MCMILLAN:	-- landlords9 who have violations against them.	They have had 10 these violation since 1990 . They are not entitled 11 to a rent increase.12 Landlords who have failed to 13 return the interest to the owner from the  security 14 deposit, landlords are not entitled to a  rent 15 increase.16 To the Board I say we have  a17 problem. The nation is at war. The decision  you 18 make here will be crucial for the people in  this 19 City. Restoring family values, someone is not  going 20 to be like a heavy weight fight. Someone has  to 21 lose. But the tenants are people. We have  suffered 22 long enough following the attack on the World  Trade 23 Center.24 Look at them.	Listen to them. Go 25 to the streets to watch how the children are  day 2 
2 fighting because mommy and daddy got to work  three 3 jobs to pay the rent to make ends  meet.4 ( Audience participation.)5 MR. JIMMY MCMILLAN:	It' s your 6 decision.	You have uncles, you have cousins,  your 7 grandchildren. You have gray hair like me, some  of 8 you. Some of you have no hair at  all.9 ( Laughter.)10 MR. JIMMY MCMILLAN:	But on behalf 11 - don' t get offended.	I apologize for that. But  on 12 behalf of all the children -- I' m a  Vietnam 13 Veteran.	I suffer from Agent Orange and I   have 14 scrap metal within me. The Veterans  Administration 15 take care of me very  good.16 But that is not why I' m here. I  am 17 here to fight for those who have died because  the 18 landlord have refused to give them and keep them.  I19 say, make it a provision within your decision  that 20 if the landlord has not made the repairs, they  are 21 not entitled to the rent of that  month.22 And that is all I  have.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,24 sir.25 ( Audience participation. )2

I love that shirt, too, by  the Mr. Fierstein.MR. ALAN FIERSTEIN:	Good I own a single building in  SoHo.
16 It' s a loft building.17 MR. LANGUEDOC:	What' s your name?18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Fierstein.19 MR. LANGEDUOC:	I' m sorry.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.21 MR. ALAN FIERSTEIN:	And my 22 building is five stories high. I have  three 23 residential tenants.	One is the second floor, one 24 is the third floor and one is the fourth floor.   One 25 floor for each of the three residential  tenants.16 
2 Three tenants pay between $ 1 , 021 3 and $ 758 for their floors. These are people, one  of 4 them just bought a house Upstate, a country  house.5 Drives into the City. Has a car parked  somewhere.6 They' re entitled to the rent that they have. But  my 7 costs have gone up quite a bit. Fuel cost has   gone 8 up thirty percent since last  year.9 My insurance cost has gone  up 10 eight percent since last year. And my real  estate 11 tax went down four percent because of, I guess,  my 12 RPIE filing. However, it did go up 38 percent  the 13 year before.14 So I do a lot of work in the   SoHo 15 and Tribeca area in my business. And I   basically 16 subsidized and have subsidized, for many years,  my 17 building by making money in one business and  paying 18 it to the building, which is okay with me, but   I19 think that tenants should, who have the means  to 20pay for it and who are getting a windfall on a   very 21low rent in some of these loft buildings,  should 22pay the fair increases in expenses.23That' s all.24CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25MR.

2345	questions, sir.6
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any questions? MS. HOLDER:	Yes.CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	There are MS. HOLDER:	I' m sorry. I just 
7 want a clarification and I apologize  --8 MR. ALAN FIERSTEIN:	Yes.9 MS. HOLDER:	-- because maybe I10 did not hear you.	Maybe I didn' t hear you properly 11 when you first came up so I  apologize.12 Thank you for coming out this 13 evening.14 You said that your buildings are 15 in SoHo and you have three  units?16 MR. ALAN FIERSTEIN:	Three 17 residential units, yes.18 MS. HOLDER:	Three residential 19 units. And they' re rent stabilized?20 MR. ALAN FIERSTEIN:	Yes, they 21 are. There were loft buildings. It was a lot  unit 22 and it was under the auspices of the Loft  Bard.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	They' re loft 24 stabilized.25 MR. ALAN FIERSTEIN:	Yeah, for 7 
2 fifteen years. There was a Loft Board case  which 3 was finally disposed of around 1999 and it  became 4 rent stabilized.5 MS. HOLDER:	Okay. Thanks.6 And so you said that you had  three 7 residential units. What else do you have in  that 8 building in SoHo?9 MR. ALAN FIERSTEIN:	Well, I have 10 my business in there. That' s the reason I  bought 11 it. I had a recording studio for 29 years. I had   a12 recording studio on the first floor and a  recording 13 studio on the fifth floor. Now I rent out  the 14 recording studio on the fifth floor and  I15 subdivided the first floor space into  commercial 16 spaces, little cubicles for people to make  music 17 in.18 MS. HOLDER:	And how long have 19 you owned the building?20 MR. ALAN FIERSTEIN:	Since 1981 .21 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.22 MR. ALAN FIERSTEIN:	You' re 23 welcome.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 Mr. Sherwood, you' re next.2 
2 MR. ROBERT SHERWOOD:	Okay.3 To just with -- it is  criminal 4 that the smalltime operations and the big- time 5 operations be handled equally and as  one.6 I believe the old incentive 7 programs, tax abatements and so forth  and 8 subsidization should exist for the smalltime 9 operators.10 Next, be advised that many of  us 11 only got a mere 2 . 3 percent from a Social Security 12 increase. That was a kick in the privates. That  was 13 insulting and criminal and we need a lot more  than 14 that here in New York City. We need to have   higher 15 rates in New York City.16 Next, SROs are not full and 17 complete homes therefore, we should not have  full 18 and complete rents. An SRO has -- some have  no 19 bathrooms. Some have no kitchens. That' s why 20 they' re SRO' s. They' ve been pushed out of the 21 market by the criminal establishment of  illegal 22 hotels.23 What is the process of  the 24 dispensation of building permits? I think  that 25 needs to be examined and  investigated.2 
2 The oil prices -- illegal  hotels 3 facilities and SRO buildings and those who live  in 4 SRO units, should get a rollback in both cases,  a5 double rollback. First, they are already  incomplete 6 homes.7 Second, they are being impinged 8 upon by these illegal hotels.	We need a break and 9 we should have a rollback in these  areas.10 We' ve got to search for justice.11 And remember, the greatness of any country,  any 12 society is judged upon what you do to the  very 13 least of the needy.	Keep that in mind.14 Also, I think the bottom line  here 15 is that the main problem today is that there is   too 16 much capitalism. Nikoli Illiat, ( phonetic) where 17 did you fail? How did you fail us? You  were 18 supposed to free us from this but you have let   us 19 go asunder.20 Do the right thing and let  there 21 be truth, justice and rightness for all  with 22 liberty and justice and equality and freedom  for 23 all.	May you have  justice.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Sherwood,25 am I correct that for the last, I don' t  know,2 
2 period of time between when we do a zero and   when 3 we do a rent increase, we had a proviso, that   your 4 rent has not gone up because of your  abode?5 MR. ROBERT SHERWOOD:	That is 6 correct.	And it' s my position, as I had  mentioned 7 it before on previous occasions, that those in  SRO 8 units should have a rollback because SROs units  are 9 not full and complete homes that you gentlemen  and 10 ladies probably enjoy.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So while your 12 rent has been frozen effectively, you' re advocating 13 a rollback.14 MR. ROBERT SHERWOOD:	I' m15 advocating a rollback for all SRO units in  this 16 City because these units are not full and  complete 17 homes.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 MR.

I have six units in  Sunset 11 Park, Brooklyn. I have tenants living there for 20 ,12 25 , and 37 years.13 You understand people living there 14 so long, of course, the rent is very  small.15 Meantime, all the tenants, I have problem with  them 16 because they come, they pay three months and  nine 17 months is rent free because I have to take them   to 18 court and because they have to -- of course, if   the 19 judge give them the right. Okay.20 I have one last year that  after 21 nine months she got an Order to Show Cause and   then 22 she said because she needed to go to the 20 th  day 23 April. And finally she left. When she left, I got   a24 letter from HPD saying that I have a   violation.25 When I checked, she had  removed 6 
2 the smoke detector. She had removed the  carbon 3 monoxide. She had removed the door of the  bedroom.4 My God. I have another tenant  that 5 did the same thing. You know, it' s just people  talk 6 about oh, all the money that we get. So where   is 7 the money that we getting?8 I would like an increase  from 9 fifty percent to two and ten percent one  year.10 Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 Any questions?13 ( No response.)14 ( Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Meryl Stein.16 Meryl Stein.17 MS. MERLY STEIN:	Here.18 Good evening.	My name is Meryl 19 Stein. I' m a fourth generation New York City 20 resident.21 My grandparents and my parents  had 22 to leave New York when they retired because  they 23 couldn' t afford to stay here. They were living in 24 rent regulated housing and the rents continued  to 25 rise and they couldn' t stay on fixed incomes. And  I2 
2 probably will have to do the  same.3 I live in a rent  stabilized 4 apartment and I won' t be able to afford it with  the 5 rent increases.6 I also represent low and  moderate 7 income tenants and my clients don' t live in 8 Manhattan. I mean we' re talking about housing 9 throughout the five boroughs. And I have  clients 10 living in Brooklyn, in the Bronx who pay, you  know,11 $ 1400 , $ 1500 a month for two bedroom apartments 12 that they can' t afford and they have no place  to 13 go.14 And this is due in large part  to 15 the huge increases because, excuse, me of  the 16 vacancy increases, the twenty percent vacancy 17 increases on top of the one- fortieth apartment 18 increases on top of the Rent Guidelines  increases.19 So you' re talking about huge increases that are 20 permanent. And then they get deregulated so that' s21 why the housing is permanently lost to the  market.22 And when you' re talking about the 23 small property owners who are here, I think a   big 24 problem is that people in the New York real  estate 25 market expect huge returns like they' re playing the 2 
2 stock markets.	So the hardship -- the fact is  that 3 property owners can put in for hardship  increases.4 Okay? And they have to open their  books.5 ( Audience participation.)6 MS. MERLY STEIN:	They have to 7 open their books to get hardship increases.  But 8 that allows for reasonable profits not  forty 9 percent, fifty percent, sixty percent returns.10 Maybe a ten percent return or a twelve percent,  not 11 huge returns.	Okay?12 And the fact is that 77 percent  of 13 all regulated housing in New York City is owned  by 14 only thirteen percent of landlords.  Okay?15 ( Applause.)16 MS. MERLY STEIN:	So we' re 17 talking about huge property owners. All right?  The 18 fact is the small landlords have a way to   get 19 relief.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you wrap 21 up, please.22 MS. MERLY STEIN:	Well, that' s23 really all I have to  say.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And when you 25 say you represent people, you' re a lawyer?2

KAREN ABINACER:	Sorry.20 Members of the Board, my name  is 21 Karen Abinacer.22 I' m in a unique position because I23 am not a landlord. Standing before you is a   tenant.24 And I used to complain about the lease  increases 25 until I began working for  a landlord.	It wasn' t16 
2 until then that I realized the amount of work  and 3 money it takes to maintain a rent  stabilized 4 building.5 Operating rent stabilized 6 apartments in the Bronx is not about making  a7 profit.	It' s about making ends meet.8 I will give you an example  after 9 reviewing the numbers for three buildings  totaling 10 63 rent apartments units.11 In 2007 the amount of  rents 12 increased totaled approximately $ 18 , 900 . That same 13 year, compared to 2006 , the insurance also 14 increased by $ 1200 .15 Water increased by $ 3200 .16 The taxes increased $ 11 , 000 17 And the oil increased a  staggering 18 $ 26 , 500 . Now that is a total of $ 41 , 900 in 19 additional monies spent operating the building 20 alone. Compared with the $ 18 , 900 increases earned 21 you can quickly realize that there were no  earnings 22 but instead a deficit of $ 23 , 000 .23 Small landlords' main concern this 24 year is the oil. Everyone is crying about high  gas 25 prices. But imagine having to fill up a 2 , 000 2 
2 gallon tank, four times a month during the  winter.3 Oil companies will stop delivering 4 oil, fuel if the bills don' t get paid. We  still 5 have $ 30 , 000 of unpaid bills to pay -- do deal with 6 over the summer. If you look around you, you don' t7 see the million- dollar corporations begging for a8 fair increase. What you see are small  landlords,9 many of which own their buildings for years  and 10 with them, the tenants who live in those  buildings 11 who only pay three and five percent increases  on 12 rents around $ 600 a month. That is only $ 360 extra 13 a year. That doesn' t even pay for one month of  the 14 building' s Con Edison bill.15 You need to focus your  attention 16 on the long- term occupancy, low rent apartments 17 which are creating an imbalance in the  market.18 Because there are so many two and three- bedrooms 19 paying a little over $ 600 a month. It' s when you 20 see those new vacancies starting at $ 1300 and up.21 It is new tenants who are  somewhat 22 helping the landlords carry the buildings.  A23 building is supposed to be able to carry itself  and 24 have some money left at the end of the year   period.25 Being a small landlord is a job and they have   to 2 
2 work year around to maintain these  buildings.3 We don' t really want high rent 4 increase percentages on the apartments that  are 5 already paying market rent. That would be an  unfair 6 increase. But a high percentage on an  apartment 7 that pays around $ 700 , it' s fair. It sounds 8 reasonable.9 These are tough times for everyone 10 but if the small owners are driven out of  business,11 there will be serious deterioration of  community 12 and affordable housing stock in New York  City.13 To say no to rent increases is  as 14 ridiculous a notion as saying no more taxes in   New 15 York City. You will see how soon the City  will 16 crumble and that will happen the same with  the 17 small landlords if no increases are  approved.18 I have copies of the statement  and 19 also 2006 , 2007 and so far up to 2008 .20 ( Applause.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' ll take it.22 Now, you work for the  owners?23 MS.

We 20 eat each other up.	And all the members on  the 21 board, minus, of course, the tenant 22 representatives, are the sharks.23 Now, a lot of little sharks  have 24 come here tonight. The big ones, nobody  touches 25 because if the big ones had to open up their   books,6 
2 it would -- nobody would -- nobody would  survive.3 Now, anybody who looks to buy  a4 building that has renters in it is looking to  make 5 a profit. They' re not renting apartments because 6 they want people to have a place to live. They   want 7 to make money.8 ( Audience participation.)9 MS. IDA POLLACK:	And when you 10 listen to them here - and the big landlords don' t11 give a damn about them either - when you listen   to 12 them here you would think that the prices that  keep 13 going up on everything only affect  them.14 We pay gas. I' m a tenant, by the 15 way, and I will stay a tenant for the rest of   my 16 life, however long it will be. And I have been   a17 tenant for forty years and  more.18 And I have tried to  organize 19 tenants because I think we' re being given the shaft 20 all the time.	And you guys are the ones that  let 21 it happen. See, in the twenty years or so that  I' ve 22 been here, never once was there no increase  voted 23 on. Always there was an increase. Our  economy 24 wasn' t as sick as it is now. What motivated  the 25 increase in all those years? And don' t give me  this 2

MR. MARTIN DUFT:	Thank you and My name is Martin Duft. I' m
6 Australian. I' ve been living in New York for close 7 to one year.8 I' m here because my wife and my 9 mother- in- law are in a nine- apartment building here 10 in the East Village. They' ve had it in their  family 11 for over thirty years.12 Of that building there' s five rent 13 stabilized apartments, two rent controlled 14 apartments. And out of these, five of them  are 15 paying less than $ 500 a month. There is no  mortgage 16 on the building.17 They have always been good 18 landlords. There' s always been regular repairs.19 There' s no violations, all essential services but 20 yet their bank account has between sort of 1   and 21 $ 3 , 000 in it on average, whether or not it' s during 22 the winter heating season or the summer taxes  and 23 what have you season.24 I was effectively forced here  to 25 start doing maintenance on the building. I am  a6 
2 lawyer by profession. I' m a banker by profession 3 but yet for the eleven months I' ve been here I' ve 4 been effectively a general contractor.5 I' ve also	--6 ( Audience participation.)7 MR. MARTIN DUFT:	I' ve put $ 30 , 000 8 of my own money into this building since  arriving 9 which is effectively on essential services:10 Partial roof repairs, repointing, and doors  and 11 floors in the interior of the building which  are 12 all out of level.13 I' m here to ask tonight for a14 double- digit rent along low rent, long term 15 occupancy increase of, I would say $ 100 for any 16 apartment in Manhattan that' s less than $ 1000 . And 17 also an oil surcharge would be comparable to  what 18 is given in respective rent control tenants  for 19 rent stabilized tenants.20 I will tell you that in  our 21 building this would not cause any burden.  The 22 reason why, there are two tenants, elderly  tenants 23 who are SCRIE- protected and none of these increases 24 would affect them.25 Two of our tenants are  insanely 2 
2 rich and they happen to be paying $ 450 and $ 500 a3 month. We have one young tenant approximately  my 4 age who is paying $ 711 a month who is more  than 5 capable of paying a fair increase and I don' t  think 6 he would care about paying a larger  increase 7 either.8 And we have two other middle- aged 9 professional- type tenants who would be more than 10 capable of carrying that burden.11 I would just ask you not to  listen 12 to all the sub- stories of either myself or the 13 tenants here tonight. You are given figures  which 14 believe your heart whether or not they' re 15 legitimate cost increase, operating costs for 16 owners of buildings in the city. I think a lot   of 17 you could be without a job. And, you know, you   just 18 pass on the genuine audited increased costs of  the 19 increase operating costs to tenants.20 Why should my wife and  my 21 mother- in- law, who had this building for thirty 22 years, be forced out of apartments to  basically 23 subsidize other tenants? I' m not about putting 24 anyone on the street.	My tenants will not suffer.25 I think you should pass through a decent  rate 2

SUSANNE SCHROPP:	Honorable 21 members of the Rent Guidelines Board, my name  is 22 Susi Schropp and I have served as a board member   of 23 the Cooper Square Committee for six years  now.24 Our organization specializes in 25 the preservation and development of  affordable 8 

2	housing.3
Over the past six years, we  have 
4 seen steep and steady increases in eviction  cases 5 and the loss of rent regulated housing. Our area  is 6 under attack by predatory owners like  Croman,7 Shaoul, Economakis', Scharfman, the Shaloms,8 Extell, Westbrook, you name it.9 The expense most owners are 10 complaining about are the soaring oil prices  and 11 the recent increase in water bills. I believe  that 12 our society has reached the magic threshold of  peak 13 oil.14 Oil prices will not drop 15 significantly from here on out. It' s time to face 16 reality. The RGB' s expectations that the least 17 fortunate in our society would carry the burden  of 18 high fuel costs is highly unrealistic  and 19 devastating to society.20 We already see unit after  unit 21 leave rent stabilization. And it has been in  the 22 past proposed, increases and surcharges and  would 23 further accelerate this process.24 For the past two decades the  RGB 25 has increased rents without taking into 4 
2 consideration profits of landlords, the  profit 3 landlords have reaped in this booming real  estate 4 market. I have never seen an owner testify  that 5 they have been forced to sell their home. I   would 6 think that the Rent Stabilization Association  would 7 jump at such an opportunity.8 In contrast, we see evictions  en 9 mass.	Last week DC 37 testified that a portion of 10 their members are forced to live in  shelters 11 because they cannot afford the soaring  rents.12 The RGB has a golden  opportunity 13 to promote positive change.14 Along with the Mayor you can  work 15 on programs that allow owners to wane  themselves 16 away from their dependency on oil. We  receive 17 report after report from tenants who complain  that 18 it takes five to twenty minutes before  water 19 becomes hot, that owners refuse to repair  drafty 20 and broken windows, that owners adjust  their 21 furnaces so that the heat is on nonstop 24 / 7 .22 We have even heard of owners  who 23 turn up the heat during hot summer days to  harass 24 tenants.25 We see owners waste a lot  of 2 
2 energy because they have the guarantee that the  RGB 3 will raise rents every year.4 Owners will not pursue the  new 5 energy saving technologies unless they' re gently 6 nudged. The RGB has the power to give that nudge   by 7 refusing owners increases.8 The City can provide zero- percent 9 interest loans and programs that help owners  with 10 this visionary step.	Owners with solar panels can 11 save 25 percent or more on energy costs and  even 12 generate income --13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 14 wrap up.15 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	-- by 16 selling excess energy back to the main  grid.17 The Cooper Square Committee 18 Supports the Real Rent Reform and it' s time for 19 change now.20 Thank you for listening.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 Thank you.23 ( Applause.)24 MS.

2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.3 MS. HOLDER:	Do you think that the 4 cost of installing alternative energy sources  would 5 impose a great burden on landlords?	You seem to 6 speak very knowledgeably about that.7 MS. SUSANNE SCHROPP:	Yeah. You 8 know, we' ve heard testimony today and last 9 Wednesday about the insane increases owners  are 10 subject to. And I believe a portion of that   to 11 install alternative energy sources would, within  a12 few years, pay for itself.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 ( Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Juan Alers.16 Mr. Alers.

JUAN ALERS:	My name is Juan 6 Alers.7 On behalf of 53 Avenue B  Realty 8 Corp, I would like to say that the tenants  are 9 unfair in the sense of circumstances where  they 10 take roommates and RSA allows them to. And  those 11 roommates I know are paying as well, or helping  pay 12 the rent.	And they have $ 700 , $ 800 rents for two 13 bedrooms and immaculate, I must  say.14 We put in new beams. We haven' t15 charged MCIs for a new roof, a new  boiler,16 sidewalk, things of that nature. And if we were  to 17 do so, they would oppose it as well. It' s damn  if 18 you do and damn if you don' t.19 53 Avenue B Realty Corp is not  a20 slumlord. We do all repairs when needed and  now 21 they' re bringing in dogs. And these things -- okay.22 I love dogs and everything  else 23 but they shed and they piss on wood floors.  And 24 these things, okay, have to be taken  into 25 consideration.	Put in a new floor and we don' t2 

2	charge you?3
I think that, you know, a  fourteen 
4 and a half percent water increase and now it' s  the 5 summer, don' t tell me you' re not going to not take 6 a bath.	Landlords are going take greater  expense 7 in water from five and -- from 5 , 500 to almost 8 10 , 000 in one year is the difference.9 So fourteen and a half percent  is 10 where I would start to consider as double  digits 11 have to be enforced.

ELIZABETH GARDNER:	Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Melzer.13 A VOICE:	If we could find out 14 how many units each landlord has, it would  very 15 helpful to know.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What' s your 17 question?18 A VOICE:	It would helpful if 19 every landlord would tell us how many  units.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, if they 21 want to.22 MR. ROGER MELZER:	I' m ready to 23 go.24 My name is Roger Melzer.25 I' m a apartment building owner. I5 
2 have one 27 - family unit which I own and manage.3 I' ve been an owner in New York City for  thirty 4 years.5 I' ve prepared a chart of cost 6 increases which you probably can' t see in just 7 three critical areas: Heating oil, water and  sewer 8 and real estate taxes.9 My fuel costs are going up $ 2 a10 gallon between April of 2007 / 2008 using 13 , 000 11 gallons a year.	That means an increase of $ 26 , 000 12 a year which is the equivalent of $ 80 per  apartment 13 per month.14 Water and sewer is also going  up.15 People have said that.16 The total cost to me will  be 17 $ 2 , 000 per year which is $ 6 per apartment per 18 month. And the real estate taxes, the  assessed 19 value is going up.	So if the tax increase --  the 20 tax rates stays the same -- taxes are going up   by 21 $ 3200 .	If Bloomberg drops the -- or raises the  tax 22 rate again, it' s going to go up $ 6 , 000 per year.23 So that' s a total added cost of 24 the building of between 31 and $ 34 , 000 per year 25 which is the equivalent of about $ 100 per month  per 2 
2 apartment. These are real costs without  even 3 considering maintenance or any other  issues.4 I also analyzed the alleged 5 Draconian rent controlled system versus rent 6 stabilization going back five years, June of 2003 ,7 June of 2008 .8 I have a rent controlled in  that 9 period of time, 2003 , paying $ 526 .	Through the 10 formulas of rent control, which everybody  despises 11 allegedly, that apartment has gone up $ 220 per 12 month in five years.13 The rent stabilized apartments in 14 the same period of time in the $ 400 or $ 500 , $ 600 15 range have gone up by 67 to $ 87 per month. That' s16 cumulative over five years. That' s virtually 17 nothing.18 And some of these people have  just 19 renewed under the old guidelines so their  increases 20 are going to be, over a seven- year period, a  total 21 of $ 94 a month and $ 100 a month. And I' ve just 22 documented we' re going up by $ 100 per month this 23 year alone.24 So the past history of the  Board 25 is we haven' t had adequate increases for the  last 2 
2five years. And we certainly need a lot more  in 32008 to make ends meets.4And we definitely need a  minimum 5rent of --6( Audience participation.)7MR.	ROGER MELZER:	-- a $ 100 8 increase plus the guideline increase.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you 10 leave us that chart, please?11 ( Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.13 ( Audience participation. )14 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Elizabeth 16 Gardner --17 MR. ROGER MELZER:	Who should I18 give the chart to?19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sorry. Mr.20 Meltzer, question.21 MS. HOLDER:	I' m sorry.22 So you say you own one  building 23 with 27 units.24 MR. ROGER MELZER:	Yes, yes I do.25 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.	Thank you.8 
2 And are they all rent  regulated?3 Rent regulated meaning rent controlled and  rent 4 regulated, rent stabilized.5 MR. ROGER MELZER:	Well, some of 6 them are deregulated.7 ( Audience participation.)8 MS. HOLDER:	How many units do you 9 have that are deregulated?10 MR. ROGER MELZER:	About twelve.11 MS. HOLDER: Twelve.12 And so what are the ranges  of 13 rents that you see on the regulated as well as   the 14 unregulated units?15 MR. ROGER MELZER:	Those rents are 16 substantially higher, I' d admit that, $ 1500 , a17 month, $ 1600 . But the point I want to make is for 18 those people that are paying low rents who  can 19 afford to pay a higher increase, they' ve been 20 subsidized by everybody else in the building  for 21 over five years.	And I want an increase that' s22 commensurate with the cost of running those  units 23 as well.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 Betty.2 
2 MS. ADAMS:	Would you give us 3 the breakdown in terms of how many units are  rent 4 stabilized and how many are  not?5 MR. ROGER MELZER:	How many are 6 rent stabilized?7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Of the fifteen 8 that are left, you have 27 , twelve are market.9 MR. ROGER MELZER:	One is rent 10 controlled.11 MS. ADAMS:	One is rent 12 controlled.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That makes 14 fourteen rent stabilized.15 MR.

2 Good evening. My name' s Elizabeth 3 Gardner. I' m the tenants representative/ president 4 of the Van Buren Hall Tenants Association  in 5 Sunnyside, Queens.6 I' m sorry, I need my glasses to 7 see far away, to look you in the eye, but I need   to 8 take them off to read  so.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We understand.10 We' ve all got choices to make.11 MS. ELIZABETH GARDNER:	Last year 12 I testified and told you about the $ 404 , 000 major 13 capital improvements increase that is, major 14 capital improvements in quotes, that our  landlord 15 petitioned to the Division of Housing and  Community 16 renewal.17 He wanted $ 27 . 05 per room per 18 month. Now, I want to note here that the   building 19 has 58 units.	Five are rent controlled, 49  are 20 rent stabilized and two are market rent. And  the 21 other two I don' t know. One is vacant and the  other 22 one, I think somebody moved into but I' m not  sure 23 what its status is.24 In other words, meaning $ 54 . 10 per 25 month for studios, in which I live,  I live.	$ 81 . 15 2 
2 per month for one- bedrooms, and $ 108 . 20 per month 3 for two- bedrooms.4 Our landlord lied to the 5 Department of Buildings in order to inflate  the 6 costs, for example, of the work permit so he  could 7 foist even an extra $ 6 , 000 onto us. He told the 8 Department of Buildings that he was going to  do 9 $ 1 , 010 , 000 worth of work on our building and then 10 he later filed papers with DCHR saying it  was 11 $ 404 , 000 . And then he filed papers with HPD saying 12 it was less than that, like $ 396 , 000 . Okay?13 So none of his papers between  DHCR 14 and HPD matched. Okay?15 And then he put a fence on one  of 16 his other buildings called Wyckoff in  Eastern 17 Queens about, you know, seven miles away from  us.18 And he' s attempting to charge our building and 19 another building across the street from mine.	And 20 he even told DHCR that the roof grew not once   but 21 twice from 10 , 400 square feet to 11 , 000 square and 22 then again to 11 , 400 square feet.23 Now, why is he doing that?  Because 24 he wants to gouge us. Okay? So I would like   the 25 board to take into account these  illegal,2 
2 fraudulent major capital improvement increases  that 3 a lot of large landlords are  asking for.	But I4 also want to talk to you tonight about  preferential 5 rents.6 If I could have a dispensation  to 7 speak for just one more minute.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.9 MS. ELIZABETH GARDNER:	As the 10 president of the tenants Association, I' ve had 11 seven different tenants units come to me in  the 12 last year and say as a result of  --13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	To us. You' ve 14 got to talk to us.15 MS. ELIZABETH GARDNER:	-- of 16 preferential rent, okay, as a result  of 17 preferential rent, the rent has gone up  between 18 $ 250 and $ 300 . And these were leases where the rent 19 was $ 900 , $ 1200 , and all of a sudden the new 20 landlord is kicking them out of preferential  rent 21 and attempting to go to market  rent.22 This is outrageous. And then  on 23 top you voting in an increase and then you have   the 24 MCI increase. We' ve already lost one young family 25 with two young children due to this.  Okay?2 
2CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3You need to wrap up.4MS. ELIZABETH GARDNER:	This 5could be discrimination.6I' m wrapping up right now.7This could be discrimination 8 against people who are lower or middle  income,9 people of color and people whose first language  is 10 not English or it could be greed and an   outrageous 11 level of callousness or it could be all of   these 12 things.13 So I ask you not to raise rents  on 14 any buildings where an MCI increase was  just 15 implemented or is pending and ask you not to   raise 16 the rent on any apartment that was formerly  under 17 preferential rent in its last weeks. And not  have 18 the rent go up by more than this year' s  Rent 19 Guideline Board increase in the interest  of 20 fairness and of preserving our  communities.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 Thank you.23 ( Applause.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Zella Jones.25 Zella Jones.8

2 initiatives calling for reform of this process,  as 3 well as the Rent Guidelines Board itself,  our 4 purpose today is to offer testimony  toward 5 reduction of this year' s proposed increases.6 Because our district is showing a variety  of 7 interrelated issues affecting 14 . 4 percent of our 8 households in rent regulation and reflective of  the 9 City' s one million stabilized households.10 Tenants of Chinatown, Little 11 Italy, Lower East Side, Greenwich Village,  the 12 South Village, SoHo, NoHo, Nolita and  Hudson 13 Square, have recently testified at a public  hearing 14 held by Community Board # 2 .15 In anguished terms they have  made 16 it clear that there are many issues which,  in 17 addition to rent increases, have benefited  owners 18 while at the same time seriously affected  tenants 19 causing emotional pain, the threat of  displacement 20 and the livelihood of their  families.21 It is clear that the actions by  at 22 least some real estate professionals, landlords  and 23 developers, are intended to drive regulated  tenants 24 out of their homes altogether.25 Ground floor commercial rents in 2 
2 Community Board # 2 , in qualifying residential rent 3 buildings for stabilization, command a low  of 4 $ 20 , 000 a month and a current high of $ 60 , 000 a5 month. Many of them have more than one ground  floor 6 commercial tenant. This is hardly a scenario  for 7 hardship.8 54 . 6 percent of our apartment 9 rental stock is rent regulated. A median  monthly 10 rent increase of rents was No. 1 in the City   at 11 $ 1 , 691 a month. In 1990 it ranked No. 5 .12 Vacancies are at 3 . 2 percent. The 13 average age of buildings in Community Board # 2  is 14 94 years.	Twenty- three percent of our total 15 households earn below $ 35 , 000 a year. This means 16 that the majority of renters in CB 2 pay well  above 17 50 percent of their annual  income.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Zella, could 19 you try to wrap up,  please?20 MS. ZELLA JONES:	I certainly can,21 sir.22 Serious housing code violations 23 have doubled since 2005 . We rank No. 3 in the  City 24 for elevated blood level of led.	This is in spite 25 of the fact that tax delinquencies are down  to 2 
2 point four percent.	Foreclosures are zero percent.3 Home ownership has increased by 6 . 2 percent and 4 median condo prices have moved from $ 383 , 000 to -- 5	$ 383 , 000 to over $ 1 . 1 million.6 You have the testimony. I  will 7 flip through the closing paragraph.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.9 Thank you. I appreciate it.	Thank you.10 MS. ZELLA JONES:	Therefore,11 , therefore Community Board # 2 advocates on behalf 12 of more than 21 , 000 rent stabilized citizens for 13 the lowest possible increase in new  leases.14 We are also submitting our 15 resolution of April 2008 as a result of our  public 16 meeting on housing conditions and tenants  rights.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 MS. ZELLA JONES:	Thank you.19 ( Applause.)20 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you so much 21 for your testimony.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Loren Renz,23 please.24 MS. LOREN RENZ:	Good evening.25 My name is Loren Renz.6 
2 Like other owners here tonight I' m3 here to tell you about the very  difficult 4 environment in which we are now  operating.5 I am part of a large, but I   think 6 invisible group of long- time small owners. I have 7 owned my brownstone on the Upper West Side for  28 8 years. It' s my home, my only property.9 The house has five stabilized 10 units including three that have been  continuously 11 occupied for thirty years or  more.12 I weathered some pretty bad  times 13 in the early 1980 ' s when mortgage rates soared. But 14 the last few years have brought  unprecedented 15 increases in operating costs that wiped out  any 16 small income gains from the 1990 ' s. Rent increases 17 have simply not kept pace with rising  costs.18 Besides managing the house 24 / 7 , I19 do have a full- time job that helps pays the  bills.20 In the old days when costs rose more gradually,  I21 could afford to wait for low rent apartments  to 22 turn over about every five years and boost  the 23 bottom line.24 But in the past few years  fuel 25 costs have skyrocketed and that was before  the 2 
2 latest increase.	And my insurance has gone up  35 3 percent. Water rates have increased twice and  my 4 taxes jumped more than $ 8 , 000 . And that' s not 5 counting any sidewalk and normal ongoing  capital 6 costs.7 The Board has proposed a range  of 8 modest increases for one and two- year leases this 9 year. In my house, such increases on renewal  leases 10 will not even cover the jump in fuel costs that   we 11 face this winter.12 Operating costs are out of 13 control. Heat, water, insurance and taxes are  well 14 outpacing rent increases. But the Board  must 15 address not only this year' s issues but also the 16 fact that last year' s increases shortchanged owners 17 and failed to provide crucial and needed long- term 18 tenancy adjustments.19 In my house, three one- bedroom 20 apartments that have been occupied for thirty  years 21 or more have rents between $ 611 and $ 660 . Under 22 last year' s guidelines, these tenants all signed 23 two year leases in early 2008 . Their rents 24 increased just $ 35 to $ 38 per month. And they' re in 25 place until 2010 .2 
2 To fairly compensate owners I  urge 3 the Board to raise guidelines by double digits  and 4 to pass a long- term occupancy adjustment of at 5 least $ 100 per month.6 Finally, I urge you to apply  the 7 adjustments retroactively so that apartments  with 8 two- year leases under the latest guidelines will be 9 covered. It is critical that small owners get  fair 10 increases so that we can maintain our houses.  They 11 represent a vital part of affordable housing in  New 12 York.13 Thank you.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 ( Audience participation.)16 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any questions?18 We have a question here.19 ( Audience participation.)20 MS. HOLDER:	I' m sorry.21 I didn' t catch your name. What is 22 your name?23 MS. LOREN RENZ:	My name is Loren 24 Renz.25 MS. HOLDER:	I' m sorry.2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Loren Renz.3 MS. LOREN RENZ:	Loren Renz.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	R- e- n- z.5 MS. HOLDER:	And then how many 6 buildings do you own?7 MS. LOREN RENZ:	I own one 8 building. The building that I live in that is   my 9 home. It' s also the home of a nephew, two  nephews 10 and my mother.11 MS. HOLDER:	So how many units do 12 you have in your building?13 MS. LOREN RENZ:	Eight units. And 14 then my -- the place that I  live.15 MS. HOLDER:	That includes the 16 place you live.	So it' s nine units or --17 MS. LOREN RENZ:	It' s nine units.18 Some of them are rented.19 Out MS. HOLDER:	And how many of 20 those are rent regulated?21 MS. LOREN RENZ:	Five, which I22 said in my testimony.23 MS. HOLDER:	No, I just wanted to 24 make sure because I heard you say five but you   have 25 eight units.2 
2 MS. LOREN RENZ:	Yes, I do.3 MS. HOLDER:	Or nine units.4 MS. LOREN RENZ:	And the 5 interesting thing is that the deregulated units  are 6 the units that my nephews live in and they pay   a7 lot more rent than these people are paying who  are 8 paying $ 600 a month.9 MS. HOLDER:	So what' s the range 10 of rents with --11 MS. LOREN RENZ:	$ 1400 for --12 between $ 1400 and $ 1700 . Really, deregulated rents 13 are, you know, Roger can tell you as well, we  can' t14 just keeping charging more rent because it' s15 deregulated. Deregulated rents have a limit  as 16 well.17 You know, we have people who  are 18 walking up -- we want to keep the good tenants.   We 19 certainly -- they' re concerned also about big 20 increases.	They' re already paying a rate that 21 we' re happy with.	They' re helping to support the 22 other costs in the buildings that are  very 23 important, especially capital costs.24 MS. HOLDER:	Right. They' re paying 25 what the market will bear is what you' re saying.2 
2 MS. LOREN RENZ:	Well, my nephew 3 -- no, I mean probably one nephew, you know,  could 4 charge a little bit more.5 ( Audience participation.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank 7 you.8 MS. HOLDER: Thank you.9 MS. LOREN RENZ:	But I' d like to 10 give you --11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Monroe Litman,12 please.	Mr. Litman.13 ( Audience participation.)14 MR. MONROE LITMAN:	Yes. Right 15 here.16 I' d like to put a different slant 17 on things.18 I was here at a number of  these 19 meetings and last year there was pandemonium  here.20 Also I went to Cooper Union and my father  spoke 21 from this platform where Abraham Lincoln spoke.  And 22 that speech they say was important for  his 23 election. That' s how important Cooper Union is and 24 it' s a great school and it' s scholarship school.25 There are decent people who lived in this  world.2 
2 Now, last year there was 3 pandemonium here because of what this Board  does.4 And what I' m trying to say is that I was  sitting 5 over there and the only time that you were able  to 6 quell the noise and the demonstration was when  you 7 spoke to Adriene Holder.	And I was sitting over 8 there.9 And The New York Times  mentioned 10 what she said the first time you spoke to her.   But 11 the second time she said that this Board is  a12 fraud, Mayor Bloomberg should investigate it.	And 13 then she said because any landlord who has  a14 problem can open their books and can show --  show 15 the world --16 ( Audience participation.)17 MR. MONROE LITMAN:	-- that they 18 need help.	Now, I didn' t say it. She said it. Then 19 I went onto WBAI to report on this. I spoken   once 20 when she wasn' t there. And then when was she  at 21 WBAI, I spoke.	And then you said, well, I didn' t22 really say that. And I say, my memory, this  brain 23 here hasn' t gone senile. And you said it. You  said 24 it and I' m proud of you that you said it. I don' t25 know how you survived.2 
2 ( Audience participation.)3 MR. MONROE LITMAN:	But the point 4 is that why did you say it if it wasn' t true.  Why?5 MS. HOLDER:	Oh, I' m sorry.	I' m6 being questioned. I' m sorry.7 No, no, no, no.8 What I told you at the time  --9 what I told you at the time is I did not say   it 10 like that. But I  --11 MR. MONROE LITMAN:	Well, I don' t12 know the way you said it. You know, you' re a  lovely 13 lady. I have nothing against  you.14 MS. HOLDER:	We agree. We agree.15 I just had a different presentation. But  the 16 substance was --17 MR. MONROE LITMAN:	But you' ll 18 ruin my reputation. I' ve been a member of the  WBAI 19 for 48 years and why isn' t Mayor Bloomberg here  at 20 this meeting right now?	He could walk and then  say 21 something.22 And I was very proud of  Scott 23 Stringer for what he said.24 And I thank you.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We appreciate 2

Thank you.( Audience participation.) CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.By the way, you want  pandemonium,
7 come back Thursday night.8 Next, Danny Ghadush. Yes? You 9 coming? Is that you?	Great.10 MR. DANNY GHADUSH:	Hi. My name is 11 Danny Ghadush.12 And I' m here together with four 13 other friends and 22 units of co- ops.14 I have some charts here, some  list 15 of expenses that could show the raise of  the 16 maintenance that we pay to the management  company 17 from the year January 2005 .18 By the end of November 2005 it  was 19 some kind of 10 , 12 percent raise on  the 20 maintenance and then recently someone in  the 21 neighborhood asked at least 67 percent raise in  the 22 maintenance.23 Of course, everybody knows that 24 increase of the maintenance --25 MS. HOLDER:	What did you say,7 
267 ?3MR. DANNY GHADUSH:	67 percent.4And this rate is because of  the 5higher expenses that we have for the  electricity,6 gas, taxes, water and it doesn' t even consider the 7 repairs that we have to put in the  building.8 But during this three years, those 9 tenants that we have, we have eight of them  rent 10 stabilized. The amount of the increase on  their 11 rents is not anywhere even close to together,  two 12 times five percent.13 I really believe that you could  do 14 something in order to let the small owners stay  in 15 business because we did say that we are  losing 16 money.	We cannot stay and we to just sell and  go.17 I' ll give the paper.18 Thank you.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 We' ll take it. Thank you.21 Now, all I have is yellow  sheets 22 left.23 Let me read the names:24 MR. MONROE LITMAN:	I didn' t say 25 one last thing.	And that was The New York  Times 6 
2 gave a report of what Adriene  Holder said.	And 3 they have two reporters here.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank 5 you, Mr. Litman.6 I think she needs a PR agent.

18 lifelong resident of Stuvyesant Town.19 And what we are experiencing  today 20 is a rapid erosion of affordable housing for  the 21 working class taxpayers of New York  City.22 In Stuvyesant Town and Peter 23 Cooper Village, many of our tenants have  been 24 unjustifiably challenged that their rent stabilized 25 apartment is not their primary residence.  The 18 
2 majority of these tenants do receive their  renewal 3 leases ultimately but only after having to  spend 4 money to hire a lawyer to defend themselves  against 5 baseless charges.6 Our senior citizens see their 7 rents rising constantly due to MCI rent  increases.8 Also, we are seeing many of our newer market  rate 9 neighbors moving in only to move out in a few   years 10 after being offered huge lease renewal  increases.11 What can New York City do  while 12 its taxpayer erodes?13 We urge you to help reform  this 14 rent guidelines process. We need to look at  all 15 aspects of housing. New York City needs to  sustain 16 its taxpayer base so that working class  taxpayers 17 can continue to pay the taxes to pay the bills   of 18 new York City.19 Thank you very much.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 MS.

6 could you give me the range of the rents  that 7 you' re seeing in the apartments in Stuy Town now?8 MR. AL DOYLE:	Well, the rent 9 regulated apartments are going for, I pay  almost 10 $ 1600 . My base rent is almost $ 1600 . And it goes 11 anywhere from there up to $ 2000 down to $ 1000 . And 12 of course, the market rates are much, much  higher.13 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.14 MR. AL DOYLE:	Thank you 15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Cynthia, let' s16 go.17 MS. CYNTHIA NEBEL:	Thank you.18 I' m speaking on behalf of my mom 19 who owns a six- unit home in Queens.20 Ten years ago the average  annual 21 price of crude oil was $ 11 . 91 a barrel.22 Five years ago the average annual 23 price of crude oil was $ 27 . 69 a barrel.24 Last June the price of crude  oil 25 was around $ 67 a barrel.6 
2 On the first trading day of  this 3 year, crude oil reached a milestone of $ 100 a4 barrel. Ever since then, crude has been on a   tear.5 It raced through $ 110 . It raced 6 through $ 120 . Raced to $ 130 to an all- time high of 7 $ 139 . 12 a barrel on June 6 th.8 Last Friday it closed at $ 134 . 86 a9 barrel.	Crude oil is 500 percent higher than  it 10 was in 2003 . Crude oil is 1 , 100 percent higher than 11 it was in 1998 .12 The numbers paint a  terrifying 13 picture. These skyrocketing crude oil prices  are 14 nothing less than catastrophic citing tight 15 supplies due to declining production in  some 16 oil- producing regions like Russia, Mexico and the 17 North Sea, along with strong overseas  demand.18 Goldman Sachs oil analyst Arjon 19 Murte ( phonetic) said that the price of crude oil 20 will reach between $ 150 to $ 200 a barrel in the 21 next six to 24 months.22 Mr. Murte is a well  respected 23 analyst on Wall Street.24 In March of 2005 , when crude oil 25 was $ 55 a barrel, Mr. Murte correctly predicted 2 
2 that crude oil would reach $ 105 a barrel. This  is 3 untenable. This will be like a winter of  discontent 4 for landlords because at $ 200 a barrel that  would 5 translate into more than $ 6 in heating oil costs 6 when it was around $ 2 last year and $ 4 now. So  how 7 can people do this?8 Whatever the fundamentals are,9 small owners have more pedestrian concerns  like 10 providing heat and hot water.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 12 wrap up.13 MS. CYNTHIA NEBEL:	Look, $ 134 oil 14 is a shock to the system. $ 134 crude oil is  an 15 emergency situation that necessitates much higher 16 rents, --17 ( Audience participation.)18 MS. CYNTHIA NEBEL: -- particularly 19 a long- term tenant occupancy increase for the 20 tenants who have been there when crude oil  was 21 eleven --22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We understand 23 you.24 Thank you.25 MS.

2 be frozen considering the affordable housing  crisis 3 in this city.4 Mr. Markus, you gave a  pretty 5 silly speech before the final vote last year.

2 are more, by far, than the legal rents for  their 3 rooms.4 For these reasons I say  my 5 landlord deserves no rent increase.6 I am designated disabled with  a7 serious heart condition and live on a  combination 8 of Social Security retirement benefits and  SSI.9 Increasing my rent would make necessities harder  to 10 afford.11 That' s enough about the specifics 12 with me.13 I want to say a few things  about 14 landlords. And certainly this is not true of  all 15 landlords but it' s true of enough of them that  it 16 deserves to be said.17 Okay.18 What' s wrong with these landlords?19 With all the wealth they own, they still  trouble 20 and harass many of their fellow citizens who  are 21 tenants and have much less so that they,  the 22 landlords, can gain still more dollars  for 23 themselves.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 MR. WALTER GAMBIN:	I say it is 2

KENNY SCHAEFFER:	Thank you,20 Mr. Chairman and Members.21 My name is Kenny Schaeffer. I' ve 22 lived my whole life in rent regulated  housing,23 raised four daughters, who I hope will be able  to 24 afford to live in New York  City.25 I' m a Legal Aid Housing attorney 8 
2 in Queens. I' ve handled clients' calls for the last 3 two- and- a- third years.4 I presented copies of some 5 statistics that I compiled.6 I' m here today because I7 understand that the Board is seriously  considering 8 returning to the poor tax of previous years and/ or 9 a longevity increase. And I understand that there' s10 a misconception about what rents people pay  in 11 Queens.12 So I quickly went through my  fifty 13 active cases and have set forth the rents that  my 14 clients are paying, other than people who  are 15 living in Housing Authority or who have  fully 16 subsidized rents.17 And the average, rents of  my 18 clients is approximately, just a little bit  under 19 $ 950 . And these are people who are either working 20 minimum wage jobs, are on SSI, on fixed income,  on 21 public assistance, and against the landlords  which 22 the state has set for the rents they pay on   public 23 assistance which is $ 950 for a family of three,  and 24 with children, if they take $ 100 out of their  food 25 money. Even people on Welfare cannot pay  rents 2 
2 higher than what people are paying  now.3 Some of my clients are living  in 4 unregulated housing and many of them are  finding 5 out the landlords are not renewing their  leases 6 because they could charge even more for  other 7 people.8 Welfare -- I see I have about  a9 minute left.10 I want to address the  public 11 members.12 I think everyone knows why  the 13 tenant members are here, to get the rent  increases 14 low or and everyone knows why the landlord  members 15 are here, to get the biggest rent increases  they 16 can. But will all respect, and I' ve been coming to 17 these meetings for many years, I believe that  the 18 public members are a little unclear of  your 19 mission.20 It' s seems as if your concern is 21 to make sure that landlords' profits are  protected.22 You' re not here to legislate or to make policy, but 23 to enforce the Rent Stabilization Law,  the 24 Emergency Tenant Protection Act and to  protect 25 tenants form unjust, unreasonable and  unaffordable 2 
2 rents which could affect the public health,  safety,3 and general welfare.4 ( Applause.)5 MR. KENNY SCHAEFFER:	We hear all 6 these stories of landlords who cannot afford  their 7 rents.	And as many people have said, there' s a8 hardship application that' s available to landlords.9 I' ve never heard a landlord say 10 that they' ve applied for a hardship application 11 that they' re eligible for and didn' t get it. A12 hardship application is not meant - I' ll wrap up.  A13 hardship application is not much more  difficult 14 than an MCI application except for one thing,  FOR 15 some reason that it cannot pass and not too  many 16 landlords in New York could show they' re entitled 17 to a hardship application.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 MR. KENNY SCHAEFFER:	It' s not a20 reason to raise rents across the board when  your 21 job is to protect tenants. We' ve got an incredible 22 housing affordability crisis in the  City.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 24 wrap up.25 MR. KENNY SCHAEFFER:	And that' s2

Thank Justin Haines.A VOICE:	Any questions for Mr.CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No questions. Justin Haines.MR. JUSTIN HAINES:	Hi. Thank you,( Audience participation.)MR. JUSTIN HAINES:	This is my 
17 first year testifying.	This is my first year 18 testifying.19 I' m a staff attorney at the Legal 20 Aid Society. I work in the Bronx  Neighborhood 21 office.	I' m also the Vice President of the 22 Association for Legal Aid attorneys for the  Civil 23 Practice.	And I represent UAW 2325 .24 I work in Bronx Housing Court.  And 25 I' d just like a show of hands of about how  many 17 
2 people on the Board have ever been to Bronx  Housing 3 Court.4 ( Show of hands.)5 MR. KENNY SCHAEFFER:	So we' ve got 6 three people.7 For those of you who have  never 8 been there, everyday it' s like a crowded mall at 9 Christmas except that everybody standing in  there 10 is black or brown and they' re women, they' re 11 children. They are disabled. They are  elderly.12 These are the most vulnerable 13 people in our entire society and everyday they' re 14 facing eviction.15 And in the Bronx they' re facing 16 eviction at record numbers. This year there was  yet 17 another steep increase in the number of  evictions 18 in the Bronx. And why I bring this to  your 19 attention is that we' re seeing gentrification and 20 its effects in the Bronx have finally  hit.21 Right now people are at rents  that 22 are right at the threshold of what the  Family 23 Eviction Prevention Supplement, the major  welfare 24 supplement that keeps people in their homes  and 25 prevents evictions, their rents are right at  that 2 
2 limit or right above that limit which means that  as 3 a tenant attorney I have to, everyday, try and  get 4 that preferential rent for them.5 If they are able and lucky  enough 6 to get a preferential rent, then they' re 7 effectively taken out of the rent  stabilization 8 code because in order for a landlord to get rid   of 9 a tenant who exercises their rights to  get 10 conditions repaired in their apartment, all  they 11 have to do is return to the legal regulated  rent 12 which exceeds what the public assistance will  ever 13 pay for them and that person' s evicted.14 So you' re putting an entire 15 borough, one the poorest boroughs in the City,  and 16 certainly one of the poorest counties in the  entire 17 United States. We' re talking about the most 18 vulnerable people in our society and you have  to 19 look out for them because no one else  is.20 And in addition, it also leads  to 21 extreme overcrowding.22 I went through my cases just  so 23 that I could share some of the rents. There' s  a24 misconception that there' s low rents in the Bronx.25 I have a two- bedroom with four 2 
2people in it for $ 1117 amonth.3I have a two- bedroom with three 4people in it for $ 1181 amonth.5I have a two- bedroom with three 6 people in it, $ 948 a month.7 I have a one- bedroom with four 8 people in it for $ 945 . 98 a month.9 I have a two- bedroom, six people 10 in it for $ 1 , 014 a month.11 I have a one- bedroom, three people 12 in it, $ 931 . 69 a month.13 And every apartment that I see  -14 and I actually go to my clients' apartments  when 15 they say that they have repair issues - and I   see 16 ceilings that are fallen in. I see rats,  roaches,17 bedbugs, everything in every single  apartment.18 And in the nonpayment context 19 we' re not able to get them the repairs that  they 20 need because the money and the need for  the 21 preferential rent is so desperate that we can' t22 effectively fight for their rights for repairs.  So 23 then they file an HP action in retaliation  and 24 often the landlord will take it back  up.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 6 

2	wrap up.3
MR. JUSTIN HAINES:	So I' m calling 
4 for the smallest, if not, zero increase that  you 5 possibly can give because the people in the  Bronx 6 are going to be homeless and there' s going to be  an 7 extreme crisis of homelessness in the  Bronx.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 We have a question.10 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I know you 12 have a question.13 ( Applause.)14 MS. HOLDER:	Justin, thanks for 15 your testimony.	And I' m quite well aware that 16 you' re a leader in the union.	And thank you for 17 keeping me honest with the staff and with  our 18 clients.19 Justin, can you tell me what' s20 happening in the City in terms of their  commitment 21 to any anti- eviction programs so that the Legal Aid 22 and the Legal Services and other nonprofits  can 23 actually try to be of assistance to tenants who  are 24 in this position?25 MR. JUSTIN HAINES:	Well, both 4 
2 initially at the State level they were going to  cut 3 $ 400 , 000 out of Legal Services to prevent eviction.4 And then on the City level they' ve 5 cut the major grant, the DHS, the Department  of 6 Homeless Services grant that funds the majority  of:7 Legal Service providers in the City by 23  percent.8 That' s the Mayor' s office.9 We' re looking to --10 MS. HOLDER:	Twenty three and a11 half percent.12 MR. JUSTIN HAINES:	Twenty three 13 and a half percent which is like $ 1 . 5 million.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Twenty three 15 point six nine actually.16 MR. JUSTIN HAINES:	Thanks for all 17 the corrections.18 Basically it means jobs of 19 unionized workers are going to be going away.  But 20 more than that, the Legal Aid Society can only  help 21 a fraction of the people we see in Housing  Court.22 That' s just representation but we provide advice 23 and other resources to thousands of  others.24 And my colleagues are also  here 25 from the Bronx to testify about what we see on   a2 
2 daily basis in terms of rents. It' s a myth  that 3 there' s low rents. We have people on the  threshold 4 of the very same that can save  them.5 And honestly we lost -- we won  the 6 Jiggets lawsuit, which you may or may not be  aware 7 of, which is suing to get the social  service 8 solution that people talked about to get the  social 9 services to pay adequate rents in the  City.10 We' ve got a program called FEPS as 11 a result of that twenty- year lawsuit. However, we 12 lost the final stage, the final hearing  about 13 whether the rent limits that they set were  adequate 14 or not.15 MS. HOLDER:	The shelter 16 allowance.17 MR. JUSTIN HAINES:	The shelter 18 allowance.19 So we' re talking for a family of 20 four, $ 950 is determined to be adequate. When I21 just read to you just a smattering of my cases   with 22 rents $ 1100 which means that we' re going to 23 preferential rents which means no protections  for 24 these tenants.25 MS. HOLDER:	And so --2 
2 MR. JUSTIN HAINES:	In addition,3 the other thing that I just have to bring to   your 4 attention, is that we' re seeing increasing 5 discrimination against poor tenants who rely  on 6 these social service programs.7 Everyone -- you know, we' ve had 8 landlords come up and say how easy it is to   get 9 Section 8 . Well, it' s not easy. It takes ten years 10 waiting on a list.11 And then finally last year, we  got 12 22 , 000 new vouchers in a city of eight million and 13 in a borough where you have people 30 , 40  percent 14 living below the poverty line. That' s not an 15 adequate solution. And the city has come up  with 16 programs like HSP and Work Advantage. But we  saw 17 HSP was a complete failure.18 But in addition to that, if  a19 person' s ever been in Housing Court, even for an 20 HP, it shows up on a credit check, a   blacklist 21 against tenants. So these tenants are trapped  in 22 these affordable apartments and they can' t find new 23 apartments.24 And so it' s vital that you give no 25 increases this year because these people are on  the 2 

2	threshold.34
( Audience participation.)MR. JUSTIN HAINES:	And I know 
5 you roll your eyes and think it' s ridiculous.	But 6 we' re talking about -- you cannot equate a single 7 property owner, someone who has privilege and  power 8 in our society to own property. I' m talking about 9 thousands of people who in their best dream  could 10 own something.11 These people will never own 12 anything. We' re talking about a flat fee increase 13 of $ 60 or $ 100 .	That is half of someone' s food and 14 other budget for an entire year or for an  entire 15 month. They' re taking half their money -- that 16 would be half their money that public  assistance 17 gives them.18 We' re talking about children.19 We' re talking about the most vulnerable people and 20 I just hope that you are really listening to   this.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you, Justin.23 ( Audience participation. )24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Joan Robinson.25 MS. JOAN ROBINSON:	Hello.	My 5 
2 name is Joan Robinson.	I' m also an attorney with 3 the Legal Aid Society in the Bronx  Neighborhood 4 Office.5 We represent --6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Which office?7 MS. JOAN ROBINSON:	The Bronx 8 Neighborhood office as well, just like  Justin.9 We represent hundreds of tenants  a10 year who are in nonpayment proceedings  facing 11 eviction due solely to not being able to  afford 12 their rents.13 I' m also a rent stabilized tenant.14 And these protections allow me to continue  my 15 position with the Legal Aid  Society.16 I would strongly encourage all  on 17 the RBG to visit the Bronx Housing Court to see   the 18 direct impact of rental increases. Just like  Justin 19 said, the first thing you' ll notice about those 20 facing eviction and homelessness in the Bronx,  the 21 vasty majority of whom are in  nonpayment 22 proceedings, is that they are almost all  African 23 American and Latino.24 Loss of their apartments often 25 means loss of their ethnic, racial or  language 2 

2	communities.3
From my experience, most of  the 
4 owners bringing nonpayment proceedings are 5 Caucasian and live in New Jersey, Westchester,  and 6 Nassau County.7 To qualify for our services  the 8 household income must fall below 200 percent of  the 9 poverty line. Even so, my clients' rents  typically 10 range from $ 850 to 1200 . And I' ve seen rents many 11 times up to $ 1500 .12 In my buildings in the  Bronx,13 particularly around Grand Concourse, Riverdale and 14 Arthur Avenue, rent increases have racial 15 implications. Often tenants in such buildings  are 16 the last African American family in the  building.17 Despite all of the increases, I' ve 18 had the opportunity to visit scores of  rent 19 stabilized Bronx buildings. And they are almost  all 20 in substandard condition.21 I want the Rent Guidelines  Board 22 to understand even small increases have a  huge 23 impact on poor people.24 Just last Thursday, just a  couple 25 of days ago, I met a woman, a single mother of   four 4 
2 small children who' s rent was $ 1 , 143 and who had 3 already received a notice of eviction due  to 4 inability to keep up with the  rent.5 With five people in her  household 6 she was nearly eligible for a program to  prevent 7 her families' eviction but her rent was $ 43  too 8 high.9 At 3 p. m. I called the City 10 Marshall who told me she was scheduled for  eviction 11 at 9 a. m. on Friday. This mother of four  had 12 nowhere to go. I asked her specifically, do  you 13 have anywhere to go? And she said  no.14 And I explained to her what to  do 15 when the Marshall came to her apartment the  next 16 morning.	I said, take your most  important 17 belongings, your valuables, your prescriptions  and 18 any needs for your small children. And it' s not 19 something -- it wasn' t the first time I' ve said 20 this, by the way. I' ve said this many times  to 21 people.22 For this mother and many like  her,23 $ 43 means the difference between a home and 24 homelessness.	At the Legal Aid Society in  the 25 Bronx, we see these situations very  often.2 
 2 As such, I would strongly 3 discourage the RGB from any high increases or  any 4 increases at all and would particularly  discourage 5 the adoption of any proposed longevity increases  on 6 the poorest New Yorkers.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 MS. JOAN ROBINSON:	Thank you.9 ( Applause.)10 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.11 Joan, I have a  question.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.13 MS. HOLDER:	Joan, thank you for 14 coming to testify today.15 As we know in the last U. S. Census 16 showed that Bronx County is the third  poorest 17 county in the country. The only two counties  that 18 are poorer than Bronx County are actually  border 19 Counties in Texas.20 Can you tell me in the short  time 21 that you' ve been with the Legal Aid Society - and  I22 hope that we can continue to keep you because  I23 know that we don' t pay you a lot - but you do have 24	--25	MS. JOAN ROBINSON:	That' s very 

2	true.3
MS. HOLDER:	We' re trying. But you 
4 do have your own expenses.5 But can you tell me in the  short 6 time that you' ve been with the Legal Aid Society 7 what trends you' ve seen happening in terms of the 8 types of housing cases that come through  our 9 offices and in particular in the poorest  counties 10 in our trial office?11 MS. JOAN ROBINSON:	Certainly.12 Since I' ve been with the Legal Aid 13 Society, which has been about three years at  this 14 point, there have been a number of increases.  And 15 like Adriene said, the rents have continued to  go 16 up and up.17 But as Justin explained a  little 18 bit earlier, the subsidies that are available  to 19 people, particularly state subsidies and  city 20 subsidies, those amounts have not gone up. So  while 21 people' s rents have continued to increase, the 22 numbers of evictions have only continued  to 23 increase.24 Meanwhile there are certain 25 neighborhoods in the Bronx where gentrification  is 4 
2 actually starting to happen. And nobody  believes 3 that this happens in the Bronx or that rents  are 4 $ 1200 , but it' s true, particularly, like I said, on 5 the Grand Concourse near Riverdale.6 I actually have a client who  is 7 the sole African American left in her building  and 8 she lives in Riverdale and they are doing  anything 9 to get her out. And I' ve defended her at 10 depositions. And they' re just making up stories 11 left and right.12 And it' s a tragedy. And this woman 13 is on a fixed income but she' s not eligible  for 14 SCRIE or DRIE. And frankly, if she gets evicted  out 15 of this apartment, she' s going to have to move  out 16 of the city. And it' s a shame.17 She' s in her upper 50 ' s.	And 18 additionally, we' ve see, while I' ve been there,19 buildings turn over and over and over and  by 20 different new landlords all the time. They don' t21 know what' s going on in the building. People get 22 sued repeatedly for the same reasons but there  are 23 wrong proceedings and people -- it' s the landlords24 who don' t even live in the City who are owning  the 25 -- the large landlords who they are just  getting 2 
2 them for a profit. And I understand that it' s  a3 business. But it doesn' t have to be the  most 4 lucrative business in the City. I mean it' s  a5 business and those who fail at that business,  they 6 should move to something else.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 ( Audience participation.)9 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Hello, Joan.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Joan.11 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I' m sorry. Just to 12 clarify.13 When you' re talking about, like 14 the example you gave of the  --15 A VOICE:	Use the microphone,16 please.17 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I' m sorry about 18 that.19 When you' re talking about someone 20 whose rent is $ 1143 and it' s a family of four,21 under the program you' re referring to, the $ 1100 is 22 the cap so that there' s no possibility of making  up 23 the $ 43 by a relative or someone outside the  home 24 contributing. They' re just not eligible; --25 MS. JOAN ROBINSON:	Yes.2 
2 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Is that correct?3 MS. JOAN ROBINSON:	Would you like 4 me -- it' s the Family Eviction Prevention 5 Supplement. And it' s for eligible families who have 6 children in the household who receive some sort  of 7 public assistance and who are facing  eviction.8 And this particular woman also 9 works but she makes like eight bucks an hour,  you 10 know, as a home health aid or something and so   she 11 still qualifies for public assistance.12 And there are five people in  the 13 her household. And the maximum for that is  a14 thousand dollars but you can add one $ 100 .	And 15 that is the absolute cap. And you can' t come  up 16 with -- $ 43 times twelve months of the year, it' s17 not a huge amount of money for many of the   people 18 here today.19 But there' s no way you can say oh,20 your friend or Adriene Holder or Joan Robinson  or 21 someone else or your brother who lives in  New 22 Jersey can pay for that. So there is absolutely  no 23 way to get that for  her.24 From my perspective it was  a25 financial issue. And I said to her, if we   could 2 
2 address the financial issue with you, then I  would 3 be more than happy to address the legal issue  with 4 you.	But that was a barrier that we had   to 5 overcome first.6 And it really -- and  basically 7 what would of had to happen is we would have to   had 8 negotiated a preferential rent for her. And  there 9 are plenty of people who, you know, once in  blue 10 moon I have a friend who' s a landlord attorney  who 11 I deal with on a daily basis in Bronx Housing   Court 12 who I can call say, could you please talk to   your 13 client and ask them to give her a preferential  rent 14 of $ 1100 . And maybe they' ll say yes.15 But in many, many cases  either 16 tenants are -- most all tenants are  unrepresented 17 or we don' t know the landlord and we can' t ask for 18 that. And this is in the Bronx. This is a   single 19 mom with four little kids like  this.20 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And Joan, could 21 I just ask, there' s tens of thousands of  families 22 that are on this program at this time; isn' t  that 23 right?24 MS. JOAN ROBINSON:	Yes.25 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And there are an 2 
2 untold number of other tens of thousands who  are 3 looking for apartments so that they can be on   this 4 program so they can have an affordable place  to 5 live.6 MS. JOAN ROBINSON:	Yes.	There 7 are many, many tenants who are seeking  these 8 programs because right now the shelter allowance  in 9 New York State --10 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Because that' s11 all there is.12 MS. JOAN ROBINSON:	-- is very 13 low. And many people are just on the border  line.14 So $ 60 -- and for her family it' s a high maximum 15 because she has five people. But for a family  of 16 one mom and two kids, the border line is a   lot 17 lower.18 So for a mom with two kids,  the 19 absolute max is $ 950 . And right now she has a rent 20 of $ 920 and if this board adopts a $ 60 increase,21 she' s out of luck.	It makes a huge impact on  her 22 because the maximum is so low, particularly  for 23 small families.	And most of my clients are one  mom 24 and two kids. Frankly, that' s what it is. And  for 25 them, the maximums are so low. And in the  Bronx 2 
2 it' s hard for them to even find apartments at  that 3 level anymore.4 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And so that the 5 -- basically this is the City solution to  families 6 in poverty who need housing is to find  rent 7 stabilized housing below these levels otherwise 8 they are homeless.9 MS. JOAN ROBINSON:	Yes.10 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And then if they 11 go into a homeless shelter, then there are  other 12 city programs which have similar criteria which  is 13 also putting people in rent stabilized  housing 14 because there' s not enough public housing and 15 there' s not enough Section 8 .16 MS. JOAN ROBINSON:	And all of my 17 clients have applied -- I ask my clients, have  you 18 applied for Section 8 ?19 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Right.20 MS. JOAN ROBINSON:	Of course, I21 applied, five years ago.	Hopefully I' ll get a22 call.23 MR. LANGUEDOC:	We always ask 24 our clients --25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Can we get the 2

Thank you Mr.  Chairman.7 ( Audience participation. )8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Matthew Troop.9 ( Audience participation.)10 MR. MATTHEW TROOP:	Good evening,11 ladies and gentleman of the Board.	My name is 12 Matthew Troop.13 I' m a staff attorney in the Bronx 14 Legal Aid Society in the Housing Unit. I' ve been 15 working there for approximately two  years.16 The people I don' t serve, first 17 off, are people who summer in the Hamptons  or 18 weekend in the Hamptons. Those are not  the 19 population in the Bronx.20 I serve indigent clients. I  serve 21 people on fixed incomes. I serve the elderly.  I22 serve the disabled. I serve the people on  Welfare.23 I serve the single mothers with children who  are 24 unable to pay their rent and as a result have to   go 25 on programs to subsidize apartments.2 
2 I' d like to speak of those people 3 in the examples that I see to enlighten the  board 4 on what the rent means and what this increase  would 5 mean for them.6 The rents of my clients -- and  I7 went through the list of my rent stabilized  clients 8 in the last twenty nonpayment petitions that I' ve 9 seen. And I would say the median rent for  those 10 people is approximately $ 900 to $ 950 .11 I would like to premise that  fact,12 though with the Board on the fact that the  Legal 13 Aid Society is not going to unfortunately be  able 14 to help people who have rents much  higher.15 So as a result, that is what  we 16 are dealing with. And it doesn' t include many of 17 the rent stabilized and rent regulated tenants  in 18 the Bronx who have rents much, much higher that  are 19 unaffordable to them because of increases  and 20 unfortunately because of the subsidy programs  that 21 don' t cover enough of their rental expenses.22 I' d like to highlight one of those 23 tenants who I just recently saw, what this  increase 24 would do to them.25 This particular tenant lives in  a2 
2 two bedroom apartment. She pays $ 903 . 13 . The reason 3 and the only reason she can afford this  apartment 4 is due to the Family Eviction Prevention  Supplement 5 program, the FEPS program.6 The maximum for her for  that 7 apartment is $ 950 .	I would like the board to  keep 8 in mind that if they increase a longevity  increase,9 or as I like to call it, a short- term eviction  plan 10 increase, that it would make that rent  unaffordable 11 to her and not only would she not have been able   to 12 afford that apartment going forward, but she  would 13 have been evicted.14 This is because a lot of  the 15 subsidies available to our clients, it matters  one 16 or two dollars. This isn' t a matter to  take 17 lightly.	This is the future of tenants in   the 18 Bronx, of their family, of their children, of  the 19 elderly, of the disabled.20 I would just like to end on  one 21 note.22 The doubling of the increase,23 which is what it essentially would be for a   family 24 of $ 900 , if you took a normal increase using the 25 rent stabilized percentage right now, it would  be 2 
2 roughly $ 50 , provided with a longevity increase or 3 any poor tax rate that the Board is suggesting,  it 4 would make it $ 110 . That puts them -- that puts 5 almost any family beyond the FEPS threshold  limit 6 which is the main subsidy we use to help  people 7 avoid eviction.8 So I would ask you that you don' t9 increase the rents at all and that you keep  them 10 where they' re at because they' re unaffordable 11 almost as it is.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question,14 Chair.15 Thank you, Matthew, for coming 16 this evening. And I know you' ve been here for  a17 while as have all your  colleagues.18 Can you tell me about  the 19 condition of the Bronx housing that you and  your 20 colleagues see?21 MR. MATHEW TROOP:	Well, in my 22 experience, while our research is limited, it  seems 23 like the eviction proceedings in the Bronx  keep 24 increasing. I think we' re one of the boroughs where 25 it' s increased by almost $ 15 , 000 in eviction 2 
2 proceedings last year.3 That makes the eviction rate 4 almost unreasonable when you consider that  the 5 eviction rate I believe increased as well. It' s  an 6 unfortunate dilemma that this Board has to  monitor 7 the interest of both parties.	But when one party 8 is a profit- seeking party and the other party 9 doesn' t have a roof over their head, I think  the 10 answer becomes a little more  clear.11 ( Applause.)12 MS. HOLDER:	What about the need 13 for repairs in these apartments?14 MR. MATTHEW TROOP:	I can testify 15 with the utmost certainty that in most of  my 16 clients' apartments I would say 85 to 90  percent 17 are apartments with major conditions that are  not 18 being repaired in that they are only  getting 19 repaired through the repeated assistance of  the 20 Legal Aid Society to force landlords to come  back 21 to court and have contempt motions,  unfortunately 22 and HP proceedings.23 And when they put a little bit  of 24 speckle and paint over a water leak that' s  damaging 25 four apartments, it' s not going to do the job.2

CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.MS. HOLDER:	Thank you, Matthew. ( Audience participation.) CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ellen MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	Good evening. I am a proud alumnus of the  Bronx 
9 Neighborhood office from the Legal Aid Society.  But 10 I am currently a staff attorney at the Legal  Aid 11 Society in the Law Reform  Unit.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	From where?13 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	Law Reform 14 Unit.15 MS. HOLDER:	We have many units.16 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	We have many 17 units, yes. It' s a citywide unit.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Law 19 Reform Unit.20 MS. HOLDER:	She engages in 21 affirmative litigation in areas of  housing.22 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	It' s true.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Welcome.24 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	I was just 25 going to throw, I guess, a couple of numbers at   you 9 
 2 as opposed to talking about my  clients.3 Just so you know, if you are  on 4 public assistance and you have a family of two,  you 5 get, other than your rent, $ 218 . 50 to pay for Con 6 Ed, phone, clothing and other  necessities.7 If you' re family of three, you get 8 $ 291 . At Legal Aid we represent very poor people.9 If you are a family of four,  you 10 get $ 375 for that entire family for the entire 11 month. The increases that you are considering  have 12 very significant -- would have a very  significant 13 effect on all of our  clients.14 I know Vick Bott was here  earlier 15 and I think he didn' t have all of these  numbers 16 with them. I have them.17 Rent stabilization serves low 18 income people, people of color and immigrants.  The 19 median household income for rent stabilized tenants 20	is $ 34 , 000 a year.21 The median household income for 22 tenants in rent stabilized, who are rent  stabilized 23 with rents below $ 600 a month, is $ 20 , 000 a year.24 These are not people with houses in the  Hamptons.25 The median household income in 21 
2 tenants in rent stabilized units with rents  below 3 $ 1200 a month is $ 30 , 000 a year. With a $ 60 a month 4 rent increase for a tenant whose median low  income,5 if they get a $ 60 rent increase, that tenant  will 6 be paying 44 percent of their income as  rent.7 There are 99 , 000 tenant households 8 in this category.9 If you have a median low  income,10 someone with an income below 200 percent of  the 11 federal poverty line and the tenant is in  an 12 apartment with a rent stabilized rent below $ 1200 a13 month who' s currently paying 53 percent of income 14 as rent with a $ 60 a month increase, that  tenant 15 will now be paying 63 percent of income as  rent.16 Obviously the issues that you will 17 be considering are extremely weighty to my  clients 18 who live throughout the city.19 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.20 Thank you, Ellen.21 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	You' re 22 welcome.23 MS. HOLDER:	Can you tell me,24 because we' ve heard testimony today about all of 25 the subsidies that are so readily available  for 2 
2 tenants throughout New York City, can you tell  me 3 more specifically about those tenants who are  lucky 4 enough to get Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers  or 5 HPD city vouches, what actually happens  currently 6 in New York City, and then also why would --   you 7 know, what happens currently besides the fact  that 8 you are a Legal Aid attorney, but maybe you  could 9 talk about some litigation around that  too?10 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	Well, it --11 there' s lots going on with the Section 8 .12 First of all, currently the 13 Section 8 waiting list is 125 , 000 people. There are 14 -- that' s the NYCHA waiting list. HPD doesn' t15 really give out vouchers except for their  own 16 housing programs.17 NYCHA has started giving out,18 after ten years of giving no vouchers except  for 19 extreme emergencies, NYCHA gave out 22 , 000 vouchers 20 last year. And what tenants found was  that 21 landlords didn' t want to accept them.22 Actually, in particular, landlords23 didn' t want -- their current landlords didn' t want 24 to accept them because they knew that because  these 25 tenants were often people who were paying 40 , 50 2 
2 percent of their income, they knew if they didn' t3 accept them, the tenants, because they could  no 4 longer afford their rents, would then take  their 5 vouchers and try to find a landlord  elsewhere.6 Through a lot of effort,  through 7 tenants throughout the City, this year there was  a8 law passed, Intro 61 , which now makes it illegal  to 9 discriminate against tenants based on source  of 10 income.11 Additionally, there a lot of 12 landlords in this city who accept J 51 rent tax 13 credits to get major improvements. And what' s in 14 that law, it says that you can' t discriminate 15 against someone based on your source of income.  You 16 can' t -- you can' t hinder the participation of a17 tenant in a number of programs, including  the 18 Section 8 program.19 And these tenants -- these 20 landlords really accepted these tax credits, got  a21 lot of benefit for it. And then when the  tenant 22 came to them and said, here, I have a voucher   and 23 by the way, there is this law that is in   existence,24 the landlord said they didn' t want accept.25 So we had to bring a lawsuit.  We 2 
2 currently have two lawsuits on the J 51 issue each 3 one with I think 24 tenants.	Eventually we will 4 have to stop accepting more tenants who need  help 5 on this issue because the truth of the matter  is 6 there' s only so many resources we have.7 There' s been one -- there' s been 8 one directly on the J 51 issue already. The judge 9 has decided in New York Supreme that that  is 10 indeed, our reading in indeed what the J 51 Law 11 says.12 I will say that it was a part  of 13 an earlier case, the Rosario Case that had  a14 secondary issue.15 Also on Section 8 , when their 16 landlord should continue to accept Section 8 , which 17 landlords didn' t want to because, again, it was a18 good way of getting long term tenants  out.19 That case went up to the Court  of 20 Appeals and was won by my colleague,  Judith 21 Goldner.22 Yes.23 MS. ADAMS:	Is there any program 24 that comes to mind that was intended to help  school 25 teachers, policemen, firemen, people like that?2 
2 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	You know,3 every once in a while I know that HUD has   some 4 programs out to help through the Section 8  program 5 to help teachers and -- school teachers,  and 6 police.	The problem is that we are rapidly  losing 7 all of our Section 8 housing in New  York.8 Additionally, I think that a  lot 9 of -- the idea of the Mitchell- Lama developments 10 that came -- that went into existence,  was 11 specifically for the people who make New York  City 12 work to be able to live in the communities  that 13 they work in --14 MS. ADAMS:	Initially, who was 15 rent stabilized housing intended for?16 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	I heard rent 17 stabilization was intended for all the citizens  of 18 New York City. It was a rent emergency that was   put 19 into effect in the postwar years that they then,  as 20 an experiment, lifted that.21 And it was immediately, I guess,  I22 mean I was not around at the time. But  my 23 understanding was immediately apparent that  having 24 a City that was completely unregulated was bad  for 25 the City which is where we got the Emergency  Tenant 2

MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.        ( Audience participation.) CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.You have a question? MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.Just one quick question, please.
9 You' re very enthusiastic. You' re very bright. I' m10 sure you can make an answer  succinct.11 Quick question: You were talking 12 about -- maybe I misunderstood something. You  were 13 talking about immigrant families come in and  they 14 are paying 68 percent of their rent and they  have 15 $ 1200 per month rents.16 So did I misunderstand you.17 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	I think 18 that' s not exactly what I said.19 I' ll read from what I did say 20 which is what I' m reading from is actually part  of 21 the Legal Aid Society and Legal Services  testimony 22 that was handed in with David  Robinson.23 And what I think I said was  the 24 stats we have is for median low income  families 25 whose income is below 200 percent of the  federal 9 
2 poverty line, a tenant in an apartment with a   rent 3 stabilized rent below $ 1200 a month is paying 53 4 percent of income as rent currently, according  to 5 the Census Bureau information. With a $ 60 month 6 rent increase, that tenant will paying 63  percent 7 income as rent.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Now, how long 9 has that tenant been in that  apartment?10 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	I don' t know 11 that it matters.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So you don' t know 13 if there actually is a tenant  --14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It' s a15 hypothetical.16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	It' s a17 hypothetical, right? But you' re presenting it as if 18 it' s a tenant that you' re representing or did I19 miss something here?20 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	It is a21 hypothetical.22 My understanding is the longevity 23 increase that is being suggested --24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right, but if 25 you started at $ 600 a month instead of 1000 or  1200 2 
2 a month, then your percentage  --3 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	I did start 4 at $ 600 a month.5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yeah. But then 6 why did you stop at $ 1200 ?	Why don' t you go up to 7 $ 2000 a month? Why don' t you go up to $ 3200 . I8 don' t understand.9 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	These were 10 some of the excerpts of testimony. I didn' t have  --11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank 13 you.14 MS. ELLEN DAVIDSON:	If I had 15 twenty minutes, I could have testifying about  every 16 number.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m sure you 18 could. But thank you.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 Appreciate it.21 MS. HOLDER:	Ellen, thank you.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next -- by 23 the way, the emergency started during World War  II.24 Susan May Tell.25 A VOICE: How many more  names?2 

23	fourteen.45
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	About fifteen,MS. SUSAN MAY TELL:	Hi.Scott Stringer said a lot of  what 
6 I wanted to say and said  it better.	So I' ll skip a7 lot.8 The Mayor has an ambitious 9 five- year plan which he expanded to maintain and 10 create affordable housing.	Currently you, the RGB,11 holds the key to maintaining this  affordable 12 housing, at least until your November  reelection.13 In 1979 I began looking not for  an 14 apartment, but a home, albeit a rental. It took  me 15 a year before I found that home, a rental. I' m  not 16 a homeowner I' m a home renter.17 Landlords buy and keep their 18 buildings and see their apartments as a  business.19 This is all well and good. I see my apartment as   my 20 home. Longevity is a good  thing.21 I was born in Manhattan many  more 22 years ago than I' ll admit to in public. The 23 apartment I moved into in October 1980 , almost 28 24 years, was a warehouse that had been converted  in 25 1978 with a J 51 tax abatement.6 
2 There are 144 apartments.	And in 3 1980 all 144 were stabilized. Now, 32  are 4 stabilized and the rest, 78 percent are rented  at 5 market value. The landlord is receiving  some 6 SCRIE' s.7 My last two- year lease was set in 8 2006 for 7 . 75 percent. If this Board votes even a9 seven percent increase, that would mean my next  --10 my rent would be going up a whopping  fifteen 11 percent in the last four years or in four  years.12 Back to Stringer.13 The tenants and small landlords14 shouldn' t be pitted against each other. The system 15 is broke. I hope the RGB does make a   statement 16 out- of- the- box and not just put a Band- Aid on it.17 Although you may not be able  to 18 call a moratorium on the item, if you pass a   very 19 token increase, election changes are on the  way,20 which will truly help tenants and small  landlords.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 Any questions?23 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Yes, a quick 24 question.25 Ms. May Tell, thank you for  coming 2

How much is your rent?MS. SUSAN MAY TELL:	About $ 1200 MR. LANGUEDOC:	A studio? MS. SUSAN MAY TELL:	Yes.MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you. CHAIRMAN MARKUS:		Thank you.Okay. We' ve got fourteen names David Baise.MR. DAVID BAISE:	Yes. My name is I noticed my landlord when even  it 
16 was very warm out, he was running the heat  and 17 someone else mentioned that too. We had a very   warm 18 winter. And heat, heat, heat and more heat to  run 19 up the bill, I guess so they claim there' s a lot  of 20 expense.21 And if oil is going up so much,  I22 would rather take a reduction in the  requirement 23 for landlords to have a certain temperature  for 24 heat in apartments rather than be thrown out in  the 25 street for many of us through rent increases  and 16 
2 this sort of thing.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Baise, do 4 you live in a  hotel?5 MR. DAVID BAISE:	I live in an 6 apartment --7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	An apartment?8 MR.

I' m12 a rent stabilized tenant.13 I' ve been a member of the Tenants 14 and Neighbors, which has 18 , 000 New York State rent 15 stabilized tenants. And I want to speak for  the 16 middle class.	And I care very much about  those 17 vulnerable poor that we' ve been hearing about right 18 now. And I care tremendously about the well  being 19 of this city.20 And that is what is at risk  with 21 what you' ve been doing for years and years and 22 years. The Rent Stabilized Board in  Westchester 23 last year, and I know the man who' s the head of  it,24 I' ve met him. There was a tiny increase.25 In Nassau they tried to do  it.2 
2 They got a tiny increase and it was  annulled.3 There' s something about this board 4 that we' re playing with a stacked deck because on 5 this board we' ve got two tenant members. We' ve got 6 everybody else is either a banker or real  estate 7 professional.	There are no public members. There 8 are public members on those other  boards.9 And it breaks my heart because  new 10 York is a city.	And someone said it, a  Professor 11 said it who works in the areas of the  French 12 Revolution. Sometimes I' d like to guillotine these 13 other members of the board for the harm they' ve 14 done to this City.15 ( Applause.)16 MS. MAXINE ZEIFMAN:	You know,17 because this city is so important for the  financial 18 health of the country and of the world.

And you have a  tremendous 22 responsibility not only to those vulnerable  poor 23 that have been -- that have been talked about  so 24 movingly, but the middle class.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you wrap 2

If you Google that, you  can 16 Google Disabilities Network of New York City  and 17 you will get that.18 And also I just wanted to say  that 19 also that well, it' s quite an honor to follow 20 Borough President Scott Stringer being that he' s21 such a good Borough President.22 And Chairman Markus, I' d like to 23 compliment you too on the bang- up job that you' re 24 doing with this Rent Guideline Board in not  making 25 it an actual mockery.	And I don' t think that the 2 
2 makeup of the actual Rent Guidelines Board  should 3 change. You' re doing a good job.4 Good evening.5 My name is Matt Shotkin. I  reside 6 at 307 East 44 th street. I also belong to  DIA,7 Disable in Action, which is the organization  which 8 favored DRIE, the Disability Rent  Increase 9 Exemption, which was passed in 2004 .10 I' m also a brand- new member of 11 Tenants and Neighbors which is a  tenement 12 organization for the Lower East  Side.13 I wish that NCIL, the  National 14 Council of Independent Living, would do  something 15 about the high rents in people' s condos here in  New 16 York city as well as in high rise  apartments.17 I pay $ 1400 in rent living in the 18 Bozarts, which is one of the oldest  apartments 19 buildings in New York City. Pretty amazing, don' t20 you think.21 My apartment has nineteen units 22 including an actual laundry room which is  very 23 convenient. My rent went down,  not up.	Like most 24 people here I hope to be paying that same amount   in 25 the unforeseeable future, just a little bit  more.2 
2 Also, according to USA Today,3 people' s electricity bills are going up and this 4 could be another reason why apartment prices are  so 5 high.6 Mark Up, please do something about 7 this actual increase.8 Thanks.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 Very good.11 MR.

Thank you.19 MR. DANNY LAYTART:	Thank you.20 I didn' t expect to say the 21 following.	But I resent, you know, so much  time 22 given to the Legal Aid cadre and there are many  of 23 us who have something to say.	And I really -- I24 don' t sympathize.	I don' t shed tears for someone 25 who has a family of four kids. Where' s the  father?2 
2 Hey, you shouldn' t of had four kids. Excuse me.  I3 don' t have a family. I would of had a family but  I4 chose, I went to law school and Masters  Degree,5 this that and the other thing. I chose a career   in 6 the arts, if you will.	So I suffer a little  bit 7 with -- I live in an  SRO.8 So I' d like to have a family but  I9 sympathize with those whose rents are going up  like 10 mine that are scraping, you know, for  pennies,11 dollars to make the rent and other  expenses.12 Although, like has been said,  not 13 expecting to say that because of her cry  towel 14 about some lady with four kids. I want to say   that 15 all these people and myself, I' ve been coming for 16 years and this will be the last  time.17 You can all go home because  I18 know, I know as sure as I' m standing here and  under 19 quotes, if you will, " I' m on to you." I know that 20 the rents are going to be going up. No matter   how 21 eloquent or how cogent your arguments are, they  are 22 going -- you' re not going to -- they' re not going 23 to recommend that the rents stay the same. And  it' s24 just not going to happen. And  --25 ( Audience participation.)2

I have to learn myself in this moment  to 7 express myself in thinking of what you' re going to 8 do tomorrow, but saying this -- what you' re going 9 to be saying to me tomorrow or whenever you  vote,10 you' re going to be going like this. Like I do  that 11 to you, I put a curse on  you.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 MR. DANNY LAYTART:	Yeah, you 14 don' t like that.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 Jeremy Eagle.

JEREMY EAGLE:	Well, I' m a21 sculptor, but I' ve made my living as a  freelance 22 historical map maker for an educational  reference 23 publishing company --24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Take the mike.25 MR. JEREMY EAGLE:	-- here in the 2

Can you hear me?I' ve made my living as aCHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Louder.MR. JEREMY EAGLE:	I' ve made my 
8 living as a freelancer my entire adult life.  There 9 are some advantages but in today' s economy the 10 disadvantages are taking their toll.11 I' ve not been able to raise my 12 rate of pay for several years partially due to  the 13 threat of being outsourced.	My situation is not 14 unique here in New York City. Freelancers  are 15 becoming a larger and larger part of the  workforce.16 At the same time, my  rent,17 utilities, health insurance and all other  basic 18 necessities have increased in cost 30 , 40 , 50 19 percent and more.	I do not have a weekend home,  a20 car. I don' t even have a cell phone.21 My landlord is typical for a  New 22 York City landlord, I believe.	He and his family 23 own five apartment buildings with approximately  500 24 total units. All but one of these buildings  is 25 owned outright.8 
2 After years of neglecting his 3 buildings' maintenance, he is on an MCI  rent 4 increase binge. This last year alone he has  applied 5 for two large MCIs.6 He' s the kind of landlord who 7 would have purchased fuel oil at bulk frozen  rates 8 so energy costs would not have affected him  so 9 much.	If we were able to look at his books,  I' m10 convinced that they would show the larger --  the 11 profit that he has -- that he has had over   these 12 difficult times.13 This while a larger and  larger 14 percentage of my income is being diverted  to 15 housing that' s approaching fifty percent of my 16 income now.17 Yes, there are some small business 18 landlords who are struggling.	But if you look at 19 their property values, the increase of the  values 20 of their property over the years, they' ve increased 21 hundreds and hundreds percent.22 So I understand that I am out  of 23 time.	But so I' m speaking --24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What are you 25 recommending, Mr. Eagle?2 
2 MR. JEREMY EAGLE:	Well, I -- I' d3 like to tell actually one other very short  story.4 I' ve heard a number -- I' ve heard 5 a number of landlords complain about long  term 6 tenants.	When I moved into my apartment in   the 7 early 90 ' s -- I live in Inwood, Inwood, Upper 8 Manhattan in the 34 th Precinct -- it was the  murder 9 capital of New York City. There were many  vacancies 10 in my building. There were cars burning in  the 11 streets. My landlord was grateful to have me  and 12 have me move in --13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 14 wrap up, Mr. Eagle.15 MR. JEREMY EAGLE:	I will.16 And I was paying the highest  rent 17 when I moved in in the early 90 s. So now that I' ve 18 been there, now that the neighborhood  is 19 gentrifying and he' s getting market rates in his 20 building, he' s adding rents with MCIs that are 21 there forever, even if we pay for the cost of   the 22 improvements he' s finally making. Now he wants me 23 out even though I -- he was grateful to have   me 24 when I moved in there when  --25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We understand.2 

23	time.456
MR. JEREMY EAGLE:	In a different CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.Thank you, Mr. Eagle.MR. LANGUEDOC:	Excuse me, sir.
7 Can you just tell us how much you' re paying  for 8 rent.9 MR. JEREMY EAGLE:	My rent now is 10 just over a thousand dollars.11 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And how many 12 rooms?13 MR. JEREMY EAGLE:	It' s four 14 rooms.15 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Do you have any 16 roommates?17 MR. JEREMY EAGLE:	No.18 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.19 MS. HOLDER:	For rooms meaning 20 like two bedrooms?21 MR. JEREMY EAGLE:	It is, yeah.22 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.23 MR. JEREMY EAGLE:	I don' t feel 24 like I' m, you know -- I feel like I am lucky  where 25 I am. But I do know I can calculate the number   of 7 
 2 years just a few years from now when the rent   will 3 be such a large percent of my income that  I' ll 4 really have to consider moving out of the City.  I5 won' t be able to find any other place in the  City 6 that I can afford if I moved out of this place   now.7 It' s -- he can get twice as much as what I' m paying 8 for it.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	He' s in the 10 Heights right now.11 MR. JEREMY EAGLE:	It' s --12 MS. HOLDER:	Do you know what 13 some of your neighbors who are moving are paying  in 14 your building?15 MR.

I' m coming.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.8 State Senator Eric Schneiderman.9 MS. YUVI RIVERA:	Good evening.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Tell him you 11 worked overtime.12 MS. YUVI RIVERA: I sure  did.13 Interesting.14 My name is Yuvelki, Yuvi  Rivera.15 And I' m going to be speaking for State Senator  Eric 16 Schneiderman.17 My name is Eric Schneiderman.  And 18 I represent the 31 st district which includes parts 19 of the Upper West Side, West Harlem,  Washington 20 Heights, Inwood, and Marble Hill in Manhattan  and 21 Riverdale in the Bronx.22 I' m going to condense this for the 23 sake of time.24 New York City is in an  affordable 25 housing crisis.	The decontrol of regulated 2 
2 apartments and yearly rent increases approved  by 3 the Rent Guidelines Board, which is you,  have 4 pushed thousands of previously regulated apartments 5 out of the system and eroded the stock  of 6 affordable housing.7 Between 1994 and 2007 , over 8 71 , 000 , 71 , 000 rent stabilized units were lost to 9 vacancy decontrol and over 40 , 000 units were 10 converted into co- ops or condos and close to 26 , 000 11 Mitchell- Lama units were removed from the program.12 An increasing number of renters,13 as we' ve heard all evening and all day, are  paying 14 over fifty percent of their income for rent. And  an 15 additional increase would be detrimental to  their 16 already strained budgets.17 Again, I' m just going to condense 18 this for the sake of  time.19 He recommends that he -- I  mean 20 that he joins with tenants in urging the Board  to 21 reject the rent increase approved in  the 22 preliminary vote last month.23 The proposed increases combined 24 with the exorbitant increases for the past  several 25 years are unreasonable and unfair to tenants  and 2 
2 will result in the continued financial hardship  for 3 low and moderate income families.4 Instead, I urge the Board  to 5 approve substantially lower rents, if any, on  both 6 one or two- year leases for all rent regulated 7 tenants including those tenants who live in  SROs 8 and residential hotels.9 He also recommends that some 10 landlords -- excuse me one second. I' m trying to 11 condense this as much as  possible.12 He also recommends that landlords13 that don' t take the -- that are abusing the  Major 14 Capital Improvement expenses not receive  their 15 increases, their yearly increases and that  also 16 must end the practice of awarding RGB  rent 17 increases to landlords who do not deserve  them 18 because the failure of maintaining their  buildings.19 If landlords need help, they 20 experience hardships, then let them open  their 21 books. However, if they are padding their  pockets 22 at the expense of our tenants, then they should  be 23 denied any further increases.24 In conclusion, every week my 25 office receives dozens of calls for tenants who  are 2 
2 unable to find affordable housing who cannot  afford 3 to live in the places that they have called  home 4 for so long and who are alarmed by the scarcity   of 5 affordable housing in the City.6 There is a clear connection 7 between the RGB increases and the loss  of 8 affordable housing which is in turn creating  havoc 9 on the lives of our City  residents.10 And so I join with the  tenants 11 once again this year to urge the RGB to  protect,12 not erode the diminishing stock of  affordable 13 housing in New York City.14 Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.17 ( Applause.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Denise Alamo.19 Denise.20 MS. ADAMS:	Here she comes.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Here she 22 comes.23 MS. DENISE ALAMO:	Okay.	Let me 24 just try to make this real  quick.25 Good evening, ladies and gentlemen 2 

2	of the Board.3
My name is Denise Alamo.	And I' m
4 here today on behalf of my mother who, at 74   years 5 of age, is a long- term tenant of a recently  sold 6 Mitchell- Lama building that is subject to the 7 proposed rent increases.8 The reason my mother is not  here 9 today is simply because she is literally unable  to 10 speak for herself. My mother suffers  from 11 Alzheimer' s. She cannot be left alone. She is 12 unable to prepare meals for herself, manage  her 13 finances or administer her meds, to name a   few.14 She requires and has a live- in 15 care provider at her own expense, a modest $ 1700  a16 month compared to an exorbitant cost of in- home 17 care.18 She currently, despite her 19 conditions, does not qualify for medical  benefits 20 because according to the insurance companies  she 21 requires custodial care as opposed to  skilled 22 nursing care.23 Given her current income --  excuse 24 me. Given her current income any increase  would 25 pose a considerable financial hardship for her  as 4 
2 her financial resources are primarily absorbed  by 3 the care that she requires at home. This does  not 4 include rent, food, utilities or any of the  other 5 basic living expenses.6 I have no extensive list of  facts 7 and figures for you today. What I can share  with 8 you is that as I have stood by and watched   the 9 progression of this devastating disease, the  one 10 constant that has always comforted her is the  place 11 that she has called home for the last thirty  years.12 Having firsthand experience at her 13 disorientation when removed from the home, if  she 14 were to lose her apartment because of  these 15 increases, I know that she would take a turn   for 16 the worse.17 She has no options and I  cannot 18 unfortunately accommodate her as I live in a   small 19 apartment with my husband in the Bronx. This  City 20 becomes more and more a place of the haves  --21 have- nots rather than the haves. People should not 22 be robbed of the basic necessities of life  because 23 they can no longer afford  them.24 We cannot disregard or displace 25 our aging and ailing population. And we have  a2 
2 responsibility to them as well. Some day we may  all 3 be in her situation.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is she not 5 eligible for -- is she not eligible for  SCRIE?6 MS. DENISE ALAMO:	No, she is 7 not.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.9 MS. DENISE ALAMO:	Thank you.10 MS. HOLDER:	I really --11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have 12 another question.13 ( Applause.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Alamo.15 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you. I just 16 really wanted to say thank you. We  really 17 appreciate you staying to give that very  personal 18 testimony and all our well wishes to your  mom.19 Thank you.20 MS. DENISE ALAMO:	Thank you very 21 much.22 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I want to say 23 thank you too as well.24 ( Applause.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Judy 2 
2 Richheimer.	Are you here?3 MS. JUDY RICHEIMER:	Yes, I am.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Great.5 MS. JUDY RICHEIMER:	First I want 6 to say that I appreciate that the Board is   serving 7 here on an unpaid or a very low pay per diem. But   I8 have to just raise this question:	Perhaps your 9 volunteer efforts are in vein, that is, if you  are 10 truly here to create a solomonic meaning  between 11 finding a level of raising rent or perhaps  not 12 raising the rent and looking at this over a   long 13 term basis whereby landlords reach a  reasonable 14 level of profit and at the same time the poor   and 15 middle class are able to remain in new York,  I16 would like to suggest that it is almost  impossible 17 for you to succeed in the second half of   this 18 mission.	Why? Because any raise, if done,   often 19 enough will lead to the elimination of  rent 20 regulation.21 So if your mission here  is 22 intellectually honest and you are truly  committed 23 to keeping the spirit of rent regulation in  terms 24 of the law as written, then I think you really   need 25 to consider that there is a subtext when  landlords2 
2 come forward and talk about putting in  longevity 3 clauses and putting in what all tenants consider  to 4 be onerous raises, then I think it' s time to  go 5 back to first principles.6 Regulation is a necessary 7 component of our economy.	Even Adam Smith said 8 this. The hardship clause - and this has been  said 9 ad infinitum - provides for a comfortable  profit 10 for the landlord.	And I have not heard  landlords11 questioned as to the -- whether their profit  level 12 as opposed to the amount of raise that they' re 13 experiencing over a period of time for their  oil 14 increase, et cetera, are they still reaching  a15 reasonable profit level.16 A VOICE:	Yes.17 MS. JUDY RICHHEIMER:	And I' m18 sure the answer is yes, but I would have like   to 19 heard the landlords feet held to the  fire.20 And on the other hand, I  would 21 like you to consider what long- term tenants, now 22 long- term tenants have been painted as the bane of 23 the landlords' existence.24 We have, on the other  hand,25 provided -- I' m a 35 - year tenant of Chelsea.	I was 2 
2 in Chelsea not only before Chelsea was cool, I   was 3 a tenant in Chelsea before Chelsea was safe. And  we 4 have provide the kind of human capital that  have 5 made districts, neighborhoods that were once 6 undesirable so desirable we can no longer afford  to 7 stay there. And yet we' ve provided the stability 8 that have made these neighborhoods salable  --9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 10 wrap up.11 MS. JUDY RICHHEIMER:	Sorry?12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 13 wrap up.14 MS. JUDY RICHHEIMER:	Yes.15 That have made these -- that  have 16 made these neighborhoods saleable to these  new 17 tenants.	We are the tenants who have supported   the 18 local businesses who have volunteered, who  have 19 been there when people did not want to stay. We   are 20 the capital.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What' s your 22 recommendation?23 MS. JUDY RICHHEIMER:	My 24 recommendation is, first of all, that you should  be 25 laughing, laughing at the proposal that  there 2 
2 should be a long- term tenant liability. If 3 anything, we should be paid for -- we should  be 4 seeing some of these profits.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So what' s your 6 other recommendation?7 MS. JUDY RICHHEIMER:	My other 8 recommendation is that there should be the  smallest 9 possible rise for every tenant.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 MS. JUDY RICHHEIMER:	And 12 long- term tenants, if anything, should see no rise.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 Susan Slocum.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me read 17 the names and if these people could come  down:18 Jeanie Dubnau;19 Aileen Schif;20 Martin Attarian;21 Dawn Jones;22 Yuhada Rubenstein; and 23 Edrie Cote.24 Go ahead.25 MS. SUSAN SLOCUM:	Hi. I' m Susan 2 
2 Slocum. I' m a long- term tenant. I work part- time 3 for the Citywide Task Force in Housing Court. I' m4 in the Manhattan Housing Court every  morning.5 I invite the public members  to 6 come join me at the table to see that the   tenants 7 that are coming in in tears because they are  going 8 to be evicted. The rents go up. A lot of them   are 9 losing their jobs because they' re working in Wall 10 Street. They did make big money and now the  money' s11 gone. You just can' t keep raising rents on people.12 Something' s got to stop and it' s13 got to be the rents.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 Jeanie Dubnau.16 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	Yeah. My name 17 is Jeanie Dubnau and I' m from RENA, Riverside 18 Edgecombe Neighborhood Association.19 We invited all members of  the 20 Board to come to visit certain apartments  in 21 Washington Heights.	And only two members, Madga 22 Cruz and Jonathan Kimmel saw fit to accept  that 23 invitation.	Betty Phillips Adams did want to 24 accept, but however, she could not go because  there 25 are no -- either no elevators or the one  elevator 2 
2 that was present in one of the buildings that  we 3 invited them to wasn' t even working that particular 4 day.5 Now, first of all, I just want  to 6 read the testimony of one of our members.  She 7 couldn' t come because as Magda and Jonathan know,8 since they met her, she is the mother of two   very 9 young children.10 My name is Marian Rivera. I  live 11 on 155 th Street near Broadway.	I have two children 12 ages two months and 23 months and a husband.  My 13 husband Arian and I met in college. And when  he 14 secured a job at Columbia University, we  returned 15 to New York and married with our first child.  We 16 were extremely worried about our situation.17 Rents in New York were and are  so 18 out of control with a family of three  making 19 $ 33 , 000 a year - that' s what her husband earned -20 we wound up taking the only thing we could,  a21 basement apartment in a poorly maintained  apartment 22 next to the boiler at $ 1 , 150 a month.23 The apartment is so small we  bump 24 into each other. Now we are family of four and   the 25 situation remains.2 
2 When the RGB makes decisions, it 3 affects families like mine in a drastic  fashion.4 Now, I' d like to address the 5 public members because the tenant members  are 6 already in favor of a zero percent increase.  The 7 landlords, there' s no point even talking to you.8 The public members, you are 9 supposed to and you are charged with keeping  rents 10 affordable in New York City. And yet however,  all 11 you seem to be interested in doing is listening  to 12 the small landlords who are crying about  their 13 increase in their costs.14 Now, my question is this:  What 15 kind of a board is this when the Chairman of   the 16 Board is a banker? What kind of a Board is   this 17 when the incomes of almost all of you is  several 18 times that of our tenants that we' re talking about?19 You' re deciding their fate and you do not represent 20 the public of New York City at  all.21 ( Applause.)22 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	How is it that 23 we can sit here for hours and hours and not   one,24 not one of you brings up the issue of the   hardship 25 clause.

5 hardship. You know damn well  --6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma' am.7 MS.

JEANIE DUBNAU:	I will tell 21 you in a minute.22 When -- how come it is true  that 23 only two landlords in the City of New York  applied 24 for this hardship increase? How is that  possible?25 Because they know that you' re going to give them 5 
2 rent increases no matter what.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What' s your 4 recommendation?5 MS. JEANIE DUBNAU:	My 6 recommendation:	Zero percent increase and zero!7 Zero!

And I20 actually live in the same part of the City  as 21 Jeremey did, Inwood.22 We' re faced with severe 23 gentrification. And as our management company  said,24 when I asked to go into a two- bedroom to share  and 25 bring down my costs -- we' re talking market share.2 
2 We' re not talking about helping tenants.3 When I asked if we could get  cable 4 for our buildings so that we could save some  money 5 because a lot of us -- my income -- by the   way,6 the reason I' m here tonight, because I was sure 7 this was theatre and nothing more, it was  the 8 anniversary -- I worked for Robert Kennedy and  we 9 had a symposium in D. C. And I had to come  because 10 my God, we stood for  something.11 And I' ve had a career throughout 12 the United States. I was away for 25 years and   I13 always used to walk around,	I' m from New York. I14 came back and I said, you want to know what   new 15 York is, it' s constipated in old ways, old values,16 and no one thinks out- of- the- box.17 What do I suggest? Hold off on  the 18 rent control -- on the rent vote. Take six or   eight 19 months.	This is a giant elephant. You' ve got small 20 businesses, you' ve got landlords like mine that 21 suck us dry.	My rent will have gone up 35  percent 22 ' cause he waited twenty years to fix the leaky 23 roof. Jeremy had floods.24 Our elevator didn' t work so we had 25 to -- for three years so we went to DHCR. Now  we' re 2 
2 paying for new elevators. My rent will have gone  up 3 several hundred dollars on top  of it.	And I am the 4 one who had to watch my neighbor going into  labor 5 and run down five flights of stairs because there' s6 no elevator.7 My other neighbor had open- heart 8 surgery at 85 and they had to lift him up   five 9 flights. We fought that. And now we' re paying huge 10 MCI bills and we' re fighting one.11 I suggest you do something  gutsy 12 and do it out- of- the- box and say, let' s hold off.13 Let' s bring all the divergent voices across the 14 table.	Because when I sat here all afternoon, I' m15 going, Penn Station. The expedient stupidity of  not 16 connecting the dots, of not looking at the  big 17 picture. And if you could tell, I had 25 years   in 18 Washington so I know my system. I was in   federal 19 and state government.20 Look at the whole picture. This  is 21 like you' re doing a shooting match every year. And 22 then people come and they talk for hours,  some 23 sane, some not, and what does it matter in the   end.24 Because people said, when I came in, they  already 25 voted in their minds.2 
2 Do something gutsy for our  City.3 Someone said to me this week, five years from  now 4 New York will be a city of wealthy white  people 5 with people of color commuting in to do their  jobs 6 and leaving again for long trips  home.7 And I would add, older  people 8 because I was a national leader and now I   am 9 struggling. My business had not done well. I had  to 10 give up my health care insurance because of  my 11 landlord' s greed. And let me tell you, there' s12 nothing beautiful about how my building' s kept. So 13 we' re not talking about a poor sacrificial animal.14 We need some things like  cable,15 ways to save people money, ways to live  better,16 ways to have communities that are livable.  Those 17 are big picture stories you need to really do  some 18 thinking.19 This kind of sitting here  and 20 voting on a -- I don' t know what today will  bring 21 but I' d like my voice to be heard.

MARTIN ATTARIAN:	Plain and 6 simple:	As a landlord, you are in business  subject 7 to economic highs and lows and everything else  that 8 affects any business.9 Rent stabilization and rent 10 control, established during World Ward II to  deal 11 with runaway inflation, with limitations imposed  by 12 law, also to ensure you are making a  specific 13 profit as compensation. By statute, it demands  you 14 open your books and show income to  expenditures.15 Yours is the only business guaranteeing a  profit 16 but you have to open your books. It' s the  law.17 You file income tax and then  also 18 file for a guarantee by statute profit or else  no 19 increase.	All other businesses with no  guaranteed 20 profit have to close their doors if they are  not 21 making it.	So why not you?	Shut down. Close up.22 Or sell if you' re not making it.23 ( Audience participation.)24 MR. MARTIN ATTARIAN:	Recap: If 25 you don' t open your books, no increase.2

But I just wanted to add  --8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You guys are 9 our cleanup hitters, Mr. Attarian and you,  always 10 at the end.11 MS. DAWN JONES:	No, well, it' s12 just a couple of things that I want to add   on.13 When I sent an e- mail out about 14 this hearing to a couple of people who asked  why 15 isn' t there a hearing in Queens.	Because as I16 stated before, I work for Human  Resource 17 Administration.	There are now so many cases  in 18 Queens that our office is open on Sunday  on 19 Northern Boulevard.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We let it go.21 We alternate boroughs. Queens was last year so  it 22 will be 2010 .23 MS. DAWN JONES:	Okay. I' ll let 24 them know.25 And secondly --2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It won' t be 3 me. But it won' t be me.4 MS. DAWN JONES:	Okay. Okay.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That will give 6 them a cheer too.7 MS. DAWN JONES: Okay.8 Well, as I stated, I' ve been 9 working for nineteen years and this increase  this 10 year I will not be able to do it. I had bought   my 11 timesheet into show that I  am maxed.	I can' t even 12 get paid overtime anymore. I am now working  for 13 time. So it is impossible for me to pay my   rent 14 with another increase.15 And as the Legal Aid  attorneys 16 have said, I' m about to go back to work at  14 17 Boreum but it is so many cases that we' re 18 processing. I left work early today to come here  to 19 testify.	If I don' t get to work tomorrow by 8 : 30 ,20 there will be a lot of people who will not   have 21 rights or may be facing eviction because of  the 22 cases I' m working on.23 So I just strongly urge that  you 24 all please do not do another increase. You' re 25 really hurting the fellow citizens of New  York.2

I11 just -- I really only work one job and this is   from 12 2006 .	This is the places that I' ve applied.	So 13 I' ve been applying for jobs. I' m not able to get 14 anything. I do have a degree. But I was   considering 15 getting a second job.16 But the thing is I work a lot  of 17 times from 9 : 00 in the morning to 8 : 00 at night.18 After 8 : 00 they do not pay us overtime but as I19 said, when I go to put in my overtime, I' m  not 20 allowed to get paid overtime.21 MS.

So we' re going to have three 20 more after you.21 Go ahead.22 MS. EDRIE COTE:	My name is Edrie 23 Cote. I' m President of the Tenants Association of 24 London Terrace Gardens. I' ve lived there for thirty 25 years.2 
2 I would like to say that, first  of 3 all, that London Terrace Gardens is about 1 , 000 4 apartments. We are now at fifty percent market.  We 5 have about ten percent rent controlled  tenants 6 left, forty percent rent stabilized thanks  to 7 vacancy decontrol.8 I would like to backup a  little 9 bit.10 Well, I' ve testified over the 11 years about my fears about retirement and  rising 12 costs of housing and facing a fixed income. I' m13 there. I' m living on Social Security now.14 Forty- seven years ago I was 15 fortunate enough to be able to leave home and  move 16 into a one- bedroom apartment. Today, young people 17 can' t afford to leave home because they can' t18 afford -- I was working as a secretary and I   could 19 afford my own apartment.	And I could afford to  be 20 in the City that I dreamed of being in and   that 21 I' ve had the pleasure of living in and enjoying  all 22 of these years.23 And hopefully I' ve been a24 productive citizen and a good citizen and a   good 25 tenant. But young people don' t have that 2 
2 opportunity anymore. I really bemoan that fact.  And 3 that' s because rents have just gotten -- rents in 4 relation to income, there' s just no relation 5 anymore.	It' s certainly not what it was.6 I really feel very strongly  that 7 it is a terrible mistake to think about  assessing 8 $ 60 to tenants with low rents because these are 9 tenants with low incomes.	And it has been spoken 10 about here this evening, these are the people  who 11 cannot afford this.	There' s a whole ripple effect 12 with the rents.13 I am living in Chelsea in  the 14 middle of Manhattan. I' m blessed to be able to  live 15 there. But many of my neighbors have been  priced 16 out of their apartments and they' re moving to 17 Washington Heights. And they' re displacing people 18 in Washington Heights who are moving to the  Bronx.19 And they' re displacing people who are now homeless.20 And this is what' s happening in 21 New York. And it' s a very sad thing. And I am  very 22 unhappy to see this kind of pattern of happening  in 23 the City that I love. It' s really effecting the 24 whole quality of life in the  City.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2

11 Board, good evening. And good evening Mr.  Chairman,12 Marvin Markus.13 Twenty- three years ago we worked 14 together at Kidder Peabody and I' m very pleased to 15 see you again tonight.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Who' s this,17 Lynn?18 MS. LYNN DAVIDSON:	Lynn Davidson.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oh, my God!20 ( Laughter.)21 MS. LYNN DAVIDSON:	Yes. That is 22 the one.	I wanted to close the evening.	I' m23 always the last to leave a  party.24 I wanted to talk for the  tenants 25 and I am much -- not a low- end in terms of  middle 11 
2 income is more the way I would like to   present 3 myself.4 For the last twelve years I  have 5 been employed a as full- time faculty member at New 6 York University.	Each year, since 1997 , I have 7 received a salary increase of three percent  except 8 for the last year which was five  percent.9 During that entire time I  have 10 lived in the same rent stabilized apartment  which 11 excessively exceeded my salary increase. This  year 12 I will be up for full professor and no   salary 13 increase will be accompanying that  promotion.14 I make in the mid $ 60 , 000 range 15 only as a full professor in total compensation,  no 16 bonuses and I draw on my retirement to  supplement 17 my expenses.18 I moonlight at JPMorgan Chase  and 19 Shearman and Sterling as a consultant to  simply 20 afford expenses. I am 65 years of age and  please 21 don' t tell anyone, Marvin. I am 65 years old,  but 22 cannot even think of retirement.23 Since NYU owns my apartment at  424 Washington Square Village, Community # 2 , I would 25 have to leave the premises if my contract is  not 2 
2 renewed or if I retire. Obviously there is  no 3 convenient place or affordable place that I  can 4 move to.5 I speak on behalf of the  middle 6 class professionals who are tenants who you  might 7 not realize are so strapped. I sat for two  hours,8 I' ve just added this, during the testimony and was 9 appalled by some of the differentials in this  room 10 and the very small sampling of both the tenants  and 11 the landlords and some disdain that I noticed  on 12 the faces of certain board members. And the  process 13 seems troubling.14 I hope you will understand  and 15 think more about your tenants and from my  own 16 observation, the very dire need to restructure  the 17 entire RGB Board.18 Thank you very much and wonderful 19 to see you, Marvin.20 ( Applause.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 Good to see you.23 MR. LANGUEDOC: Thank you.24 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you so much for 25 your testimony.2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next 3 gentleman who wanted to speak. There' s two? Okay.4 You two. This gentleman and this lady and then  that 5 last gentleman. Go ahead.6 MR. EDWARD LEWIS:	Hello. My name 7 is Edward Lewis.8 I' m a rent controlled tenant not 9 affected by any action this Board might  take.10 However, I would like to point out a few   issues.11 Respectfully I would like to 12 direct the board' s attention to the recent real 13 estate bubble that has been speculated to have  been 14 caused by real estate and banking fraud. And we  now 15 are experiencing a new -- we' re in the middle of  a16 new bubble and that bubble is the bubble of  oil 17 prices.18 And if you take a good close  look 19 at that bubble, you' ll notice that even the Arabs 20 don' t believe that that price is a legitimate 21 price. So I think that you should  completely 22 disregard any issue about oil at this  time.23 Secondly, it' s a little difficult 24 to explain, but all of these landlords claim  that 25 none of their prices that they pay are  regulated.2 
2 That' s not correct. The price for electricity, the 3 price for telephone, the price for utilities  in 4 general are regulated by the PSC. And yet none  of 5 them have decided to voluntarily go to the PSC   and 6 say hey, raise my gas price, raise my  electric 7 price, raise my telephone rates. They don' t seem to 8 feel an inherent hypocrisy about accepting  this 9 regulated telephone, electric and gas at the  same 10 time that they are decrying the fact that they' re 11 prices are not regulated.12 So I think you' re not dealing with 13 a group of, shall we say, aware  individuals.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 Ma' am.	You. Give us your name.16 MS. JOANNE JOVINELLY:	My name is 17 Joanne Jovinelly, J- o- v- i- n- e- l- l- y.18 And live in the East Village  on 19 11 th Street and First Avenue. I' ve lived there 20 since 2000 . I was very fortunate to get  the 21 apartment.22 When I moved there, my rent  was 23 roughly around 850 . Now it' s over $ 1400 a month. I24 work as a book editor in the publishing  industry,25 which as you know, is centered here in New York.   I2 
2 understand what many of the landlords here  are 3 facing the oil crisis and peak oil and the  expenses 4 have gone up.	But to put that burden just to  the 5 lower and middle classes, the people who  really 6 want to strive to stay in the City that they   love,7 is particularly unfair.8 I understand that rent increases,9 that' s just a matter of course especially here in 10 Manhattan and all the five boroughs.	But please 11 consider the lowest possible increase this  year.12 Anymore money I cannot -- I mean I' m a woman  so 13 obviously my rent -- I mean my ability to   earn 14 money is going to be capped out at a certain   point,15 especially in the publishing industry where a  lot 16 of the workers who were once staffers with  full 17 benefits have now been forced to take  freelance 18 jobs with no benefits and no health  insurance.19 That' s where I am right now after 20 working ten years in the same place. I lost my   job 21 in 2006 at Christmas and I' ve since only been  able 22 to employed as a  contractor.23 Now the money' s good but I haven' t24 been paying taxes for a while so I' m going to  get 25 hit up very soon.2 
2 In addition to that, I got  my 3 apartment through a sublet.	And when I asked my 4 landlord to make repairs in the building,  which 5 were extensive, I was told that I signed the   lease 6 in an as- is condition.	Like I said, my rent  has 7 gone up quite a bit. I' m now paying $ 1406 and 8 change a month. It' s still affordable to me  but 9 very soon it will no longer  be.10 And for me to get work  in 11 publishing I would have to commute an  extremely 12 long distance back here to the City which  I13 probably couldn' t afford to do either. If I  went 14 back home to New Jersey and my situation is  not 15 much better. And there are no jobs there. I   love 16 this city. I want to stay here for as long as   I17 can.18 I don' t have a family. I couldn' t19 possibly think of having a family with the  prices 20 the way they are right now. So just me   supporting 21 myself with any more rent increases it' s just going 22 to be impossible.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 ( Applause.)25 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3 The last gentleman.4 MR. JULIUS TAJIDDIN:	Julius 5 Tajiddin, T- a- j- i- d- d- i- n. Harlem resident.6 I e- mailed and faxed this factual 7 statement and notice of motion to the Board so I' m8 going to read it on the  record.9 The factual statement supporting 10 tenants' or Rent Guidelines Board' s motion calling 11 for rent guidelines board to grant landlords a  zero 12 percent increase for leases that are  renewed 13 between October 1 , 2008 and September 30 , 2009 ; and 14 Motion seeking a directive from 15 the Rent Guidelines Board demanding that  landlords16 wishing for a rent guidelines increase in  rent,17 open their books for inspection justifying  their 18 request for such increase before any increase  can 19 be considered.20 Paragraph one.21 Neither the Rent Guidelines Board 22 nor New York City landlords of rent  stabilized 23 apartments have shown to the public anything  that 24 warrants landlords owning rent stabilized 25 apartments in New York city to receive a  rent 2 

2	increase.3
The Rent Guidelines Board,
4 however, has these fact by testimony, mail or  quasi 5 judicial local government body notice:6 A), minimum wage is at $ 7 . 15 an 7 hour in 2007 and it' s still 2008 .8 B), a high unemployment or 9 extremely low income rate in New York City  with 10 tenants living in affordable housing,  especially 11 among Blacks and Latinos.12 C), warehousing of apartments 13 therefore contradicting landlords' need for money,14 higher rent.15 D), landlords of buildings under 16 some type of construction utilizing  illegal 17 immigrant workers.18 E), hundreds of buildings with 19 numerous code violations, Class A, B and C that   are 20 years outstanding etc, etc.21 F), a letter that came from  the 22 Comptroller, William C. Thompson, dated June 15 ,23 2007 outlining the following facts:24 The City has recently given  a25 property tax relief of a seven percent  tax 4 
2 reduction and $ 400 homeowner rebate, a reflection 3 of the City' s robust budget surplus.4 Unfortunately this effort in no 5 way addresses the financial hardships being felt  by 6 renters who comprise the majority of our city' s7 households.8 2 ), as part of the Rent 9 Stabilization Law, the RGB is required to  consider 10 prevailing and projected operating and maintenance 11 costs as the Board establishes rent  increases.12 In 2007 , taxes, fees and permits 13 account for more than 25 percent of  this 14 calculation.15 3 ), the market for rental and 16 coops/ condos is so strong that owners are able to 17 ask for rents and prices well above what the  median 18 renter can afford in virtually every  neighborhood 19 of the City. Already one- third of the City 20 households devote at least half of their income  for 21 rent.22 This reflects the critical 23 shortage of the City' s available affordable 24 housing.25 4 ), rent stabilized housing is the 2 
2 only affordable housing resource left to many  low 3 and moderate income tenants. However, the City  has 4 not kept pace with the rapidly  diminishing 5 availability of this housing stock.6 For many, once families have 7 priced out -- for many, once families have  been 8 priced out of their apartments, there will be  no 9 other options.10 Three, paragraph 3 .11 The cost of living is going up  but 12 there are no concessions for tenants. The  landlords13 continue to get concessions. Therefore, the  balance 14 of equity is extremely lopsided and  overwhelmingly 15 in favor of the landlords.16 4 ), the testimony of landlords in 17 the past for the public to hear so the public   can 18 challenge them have been few.19 5 ), landlords of rent stabilized 20 apartments have never made there books available  to 21 the Rent Guidelines Board or public for  that 22 matter, showing a need to justify an increase  in 23 rent pursuant to the Rent Guidelines  Board.24 6 ), therefore, we, the tenants in 25 rent stabilized apartments have concluded that  if 2 
2 the Rent Guidelines Board does not adopt a  more 3 substantial process in this matter, we will  deem 4 such process a denial of due process because  the 5 RBG failed to give tenants of rent  stabilized 6 apartments/ hotels substantive due process and such 7 actions as a majority will be in violation of   our 8 14 th Amendment right.9 Furthermore, the RGB will have 10 acted in an arbitrary and capricious  manner.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you 12 almost done?13 MR. JULIS TAJIDDIN: Wherefore,14 your movant -- let me see, and the other tenants   in 15 like kind and character support a motion based  on 16 the statements made herein requesting that the  Rent 17 Guidelines Board deny landlords owning rent 18 stabilized apartments request for Rent  Guidelines 19 Board increase of rent for this rent  guidelines 20 period and making their expense account  books 21 available to the Rent Guidelines Board and  public 22 before an increase of rent can be  consider.23 Now, I won' t read the whereas, the 24 actual notice of motion that I sent to you. But   I25 just want to stress the one whereas clause in  that 2 

2	notice of motion.3
The alleged rents skewing does  not 
4 result in lower rent levels than are required  to 5 adequately operate and maintain rent  stabilized 6 apartments because such alleged results are  based 7 on theory.8 Owners have all kinds of ways  to 9 offset expenses. Furthermore, they' ve been getting 10 compounded increases year after year.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 12 wrap up.13 MR. JULIUS TAJIDDIN:	Yeah. That' s14 it.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' re in your 16 eighth minute. You' ve submitted this to us, right?17 MR. JULIUS TAJIDDIN:	Yes.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' ll take it.19 Anything else?
