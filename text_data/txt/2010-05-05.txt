2 The Rent Guidelines Board is 3 hereby authorized to promulgate rent  guidelines 4 governing apartment units subject to the  Rent 5 Stabilization Law of 1969 , as amended, and the 6 Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974 , as 7 amended.8 The purpose of these guidelines  is 9 to implement the public policy set forth  in 10 Findings and Declaration of Emergency of the  Rent 11 Stabilization Law of 1969 (§ 26 - 50 l of the N. Y. C.12 Administrative Code), and in the  Legislative 13 Finding contained in the Emergency Tenant 14	Protection Act of 1974 ( L. 1974 c. 576 , § 4 [§ 2 ]).15 The Rent Guidelines Board is  also 16 authorized to promulgate rent guidelines for  loft 17 units subject to Section 286 Subdivision 7 of  the 18 Multiple Dwelling Law.	The purpose of the loft 19 guidelines is to implement the public policy  set 20 forth in the Legislative Findings of Article 7 - C of 21 the Multiple Dwelling Law ( Section 280 .)22 ( Audience participation.)23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is there a24 motion?25 Sorry. Mr. Languedoc.15 

23	Mr. Chair.4
MR. LANGUEDOC:	Yes.	Thank you,I would just like to first  say,
5 to first welcome you to your position as Chair  --6 VOICES:	Use the mike.7 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay. I do this 8 every year. I' m sorry. I don' t speak into the mike.9 Is that better?10 VOICES: Yes.11 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I' d just like to 12 say, to welcome you into your new position as  Chair 13 and welcome our new public member, Mr.  Scheinberg.14 And do that -- once again, I  would 15 like the board and -- I move that the board   adopt 16 as preliminary guidelines a zero percent  increase 17 for one- year renewal lease.18 ( Audience participation.)19 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And zero percent 20 for two- year renewal lease.21 I also move that there be  zero 22 vacancy allowance and zero vacancy allowance  on 23 lofts, and zero increase on  lofts.24 ( Audience participation.)25 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And in support of 5 
2 the motion, I don' t have a speech. I just have  a3 couple of remarks.4 The Price Index of Operating 5 Costs, which was just released to us last week  by 6 the staff of the board, indicated a price  increase 7 of 3 . 4 percent, which is the lowest, certainly the 8 lowest is my time on this board, which is  four 9 years, and it' s the lowest in several years, I10 think, I believe since 2002 .11 Secondly, the data that was  given 12 to us by the staff of the board regarding  owner 13 income, specifically net operating income - the  net 14 income that an owner receives on an  apartment 15 building after deducting owner expenses -  has 16 remained stable for several years and over  time 17 since 1990 has gone up  substantially.18 In contrast, we were -- the  board 19 was given, you know, devastating data about  the 20 state of the economy and the effect of  the 21 recession on the rent stabilized tenants of  the 22 City of New York, specifically high  unemployment 23 and the fact that tenant income has declined  in 24 real dollars in recent years.25 Last year the board adopted 2 
2 increases that were higher than what was  necessary 3 under the commensurate, at least lower level of  the 4 commensurate increases that were provided to us  by 5 the staff of the board.6 And I would just, as one  final 7 thing, I would just commend all the members of   the 8 board to the written statement that was provided  to 9 us by Timothy Collins who testified  last week.	And 10 this written statement specifically discusses  in 11 detail why rent increases should not be  adopted 12 during a recession, which is what have, and it,  in 13 comparing New York City to other places around  the 14 United states where rents are actually  declining.15 So for those reasons and  many 16 others, which we will, I' m sure be discussing over 17 the coming weeks, I move for a zero increase, as   I18 said.19 ( Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is there a21 second?22 MS. HOLDER:	Yes, Chair.	I23 second the nomination -- I mean  --24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is your mike 25 on?	Okay. Now it' s on.2 
2 MS. HOLDER:	Okay. Yes.	I3 second the motion for a rent  freeze.4 ( Audience participation.)5 MS. HOLDER:	My apologies to the 6 Chair and for the members, my colleagues on  the 7 Rent Guidelines Board for being late.	I apologize.8 It is spring and here we are  yet 9 again during the Rent Guideline' s Board season. So 10 good evening.	And a special welcome to our  new 11 board member, Ronald Scheinberg.	Welcome.12 ( Applause.)13 MS. HOLDER:	But lastly, welcome 14 to the Rent Guideline' s Board process. We' re here 15 yet again in New York City.	And hello to all of 16 you.17 In light of the current  economic 18 climate and the steady rent increases the RGB  has 19 approved in years past, I' m proposing a rent 20 freeze.21 Let' s just review quickly the 22 increases of the last several  years:23 In 2003 we had four- and- a- half and 24 seven- and- a- half for one and two- year leases.25 In 2004 we had three- and- a- half 2 
2	and six- and- a- half.3In 2005 it was 2 . 7 percent and a45 . 5percent.5In 2006 we had 4 . 25 percent and 67 . 25 percent.7In 2007 we had three percent and 85 . 75 percent.9	And then in 2008 we had 4 . 510 percent and 8 . 5 percent, with the supplemental 11 increase or what we also call a poor tax of $ 45 ,12 and $ 85 for individuals who are both renting an 13 apartment for less -- for a thousand dollars  or 14 less as well as having been in the apartment  for 15 six years or more.16 And then again, last year we  saw 17 increases of 3 and 5 percent with the  same 18 supplemental increase, or poor tax applied, of $ 30 19 or $ 50 . Both those guideline orders, 40 and 41 ,20 have been struck down in Casado v. Markus  --21 ( Audience participation.)22 MS. HOLDER:	-- which challenged 23 supplemental rent increases for the over 347 , 000 24 rent stabilized tenants who have lived in  their 25 homes for six or more years and have rents under  a10 
2 thousand dollars, most of them seniors, most  of 3 them low income, most of them  disabled.4 The case could result -- it' s on 5 appeal and the City has appealed. But the  case 6 could result in over a hundred million  dollars 7 being returned to tenants from  landlords.8 ( Audience participation.)9 MS. HOLDER:	Again, the prospect 10 of passing additional financial burdens  onto 11 tenants, many of whom are still reeling from  prior 12 increases, would be an unfair and  unnecessary 13 hardship, particularly when the RGB' s own yearly 14 Income and Expense studies from 2007 to 2010  have 15 shown landlords' net operating income has  increased 16 8 . 8 percent, 9 . 3 percent, 5 . 8 percent respectfully 17 ( sic.)18 These are just the facts. We  know 19 that these are especially difficult times for  New 20 York' s working people. New York' s economy has 21 shrunk by three percent in 2009 compared to a 1 . 222 increase during 2008 . The City lost an average of 23 106 , 800 jobs in 2009 resulting in a 2 . 8 decrease 24 from the 2008 total employment levels.25 The unemployment rate rose for  the 2 
2 second consecutive year to an average of 9 . 10 3 percent. But we know that it went over 10  percent.4 And in boroughs such as the Bronx, well over  that 5 number.6 Inflated adjusted wages decreased 7 3 . 4 percent in 2008 compared to a 6 . 3 percent 8 increase in 2007 . And on average, there were --9 35 , 950 homeless people were staying in City 10 shelters. And we know currently there are more  than 11 39 , 000 .	It' s an all- time record. The average 12 number of families temporarily sheltered each  night 13 increased to 9 , 719 in 2009 , a 9 . 7 percent increase.14 And we know that currently, tonight, more  than 15 10 , 000 families and 16 , 000 children are in the 16 shelter system. That' s another record.17 And we also know the number  of 18 nonpayment filings in Housing Court has  increased 19 2 . 3 percent while the number of evictions have rose 20 7 . 5 percent.	These are just the facts.21 The RGB has historically justified 22 annual rent increases by citing its Price Index  of 23 Operating Cost. This year' s Price Index found that 24 operating costs for rent stabilized buildings 25 increased by 3 . 4 percent, down from 4 percent in 2 
2 2009 and 7 . 8 percent in 2008 . In addition, the 3 Price Index measured changes in the cost of  items 4 landlords typically purchase to run their  buildings 5 rather than actual expenditures and it contains  no 6 information about the incomes landlords  collect.7 As a result, I agree, although  for 8 the reasons that I have just stated, that the   PIOC 9 is a misleading and is not an appropriate tool   to 10 use to justify rent increases. A more  meaningful 11 report is the RGB' s annual Income and Expense Study 12 because it shows landlords' net operating  income.13 And the RGB' s 2009 expenses 14 studies showed that even while landlords  operating 15 costs increased by 5 . 2 percent over the prior year,16 their rental income increased by 6 . 5 percent, and 17 net operating income increased 9 . 3 percent. And 18 that was last year. And last year they still got  a19 substantial increase.20 This year, during the continued 21 recession, we see that landlords' operating  costs 22 increased by 6 . 4 percent.	Their rental income 23 increased by 5 . 8 percent, and net operating income 24 increased 5 . 8 percent. Although this is less than 25 what the owners want to see, during the  worst 2 
2 economic period since the Great Depression, this  is 3 actually quite substantial. And they have  been 4 insulated by the record increases granted by  this 5 board in the last six  years.6 The RGB must reject increases that 7 serve only to enhance landlord profits and  further 8 destabilize New York City' s affordable housing 9 stock.10 ( Applause.)11 MS. HOLDER:	As you all are very 12 much aware, New York continues to be in a   housing 13 crisis with our affordable housing stock  rapidly 14 dwindling in the midst of this recession.  According 15 to the RGB report entitled, " Changes to the Rent 16 Stabilized Housing Stock in New York City in 2008 ,"17 because we have yet to release the new  report,18 there was a net decrease of 8 , 267 rent stabilized 19 apartments throughout the five boroughs last  year.20 Over 3 , 000 more units were lost in 21 2007 .	The report cites the Division of Housing  and 22 Community Renewal rent registration records that 23 indicated 12 , 800 units were deregulated in 2008 24 because of the Vacancy Decontrol law - an  alarming 25 increase of about 24 percent from 10 , 342 in 2007 .2 
2 Furthermore, loopholes in state 3 law, including allowances for phony demolitions  and 4 owner occupancy scams have allowed countless 5 landlords to empty buildings of rent  regulated 6 tenants whose former homes become fair game  for 7 exorbitant, non- regulated rent.8 The RGB is meant to determine  rent 9 adjustments based on the relative cost  of 10 maintaining and financing buildings of  the 11 available housing supplies as defined by  the 12 vacancy rate, and the cost of  living.13 If we begin to base our  decisions 14 yet again on these -- if we base our decisions   on 15 these standards and not on simply the issues  of 16 trying to enure high owner profits -- and  I17 strongly urge this board to start considering  all 18 factors as well as income and affordability  for 19 tenants in New York City -- we would impose  a20 freeze on rents for all rent regulated  apartments 21 as well as for lofts, hotels, rooming  houses,22 single room occupancy buildings and lodging  houses.23 And given all the facts, the  only 24 acceptable outcome of this board' s vote is for no 25 rent increases now in 2010 .2 
2 ( Audience participation.)3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	With Ms. Holder 4 having seconded that motion, Ron, let just  repeat.5 It is -- you are proposing a  zero 6 for a one- year;7 A zero for a two- year;8 A zero vacancy allowance;9 A zero on vacancy on  lofts;10 And a zero increase for lofts;  is 11 that correct?12 MR. LANGUEDOC:	That' s correct,13 Mr. Chairman.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.15 Okay?16 ( Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Let' s go.

SCHEINBERG:No.8CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:Mr. Schleider.9MR. SCHLEIDER:Look, --10( Laughter.)11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	For the past eight 12 years as a member of this board, I, and other   board 13 members have recognized that housing  affordability 14 is a chronic issue for  New Yorkers.	And I, and 15 other board members have consistently called  for 16 the government to rise to the challenge of  making 17 housing affordable by expanding the safety nets  and 18 legislating new safety nets.19 And last year we had  testimony 20 stating that less than half of those eligible  for 21 SCRIE and DRIE have applied.	Unfortunately, this 22 is still the case. And this needs to be  corrected 23 by those advocates and support groups  directly 24 concerned with those residents of our  City.25 Clearly, these programs need to  be 11 
2 fully embraced and other programs initiated  to 3 extend the social safety nets, and doing it as  only 4 government can when motivated by political  will.5 Unfortunately, I don' t see that political will 6 really being wielded.7 However, no one has come forth  in 8 testimony to convince us that those not at  risk,9 those with jobs could not afford their rent.  In 10 fact, the overwhelming majority of tenants can  and 11 do pay their rent.	No one likes to pay rent,  but 12 that doesn' t mean they can' t.13 ( Audience participation.)14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Some say the 15 landlords don' t need help in shifting the burden 16 for subsidizing tenants or meeting costs. No  one 17 denies that landlords have been shouldering  the 18 cost to providing what has become an  expensive 19 subsidy.20 As a community, we need to  shift 21 this responsibility back to government- based social 22 safety nets, back to the government where  housing 23 subsidies belong. And in that spirit, I have  to 24 vote no to the zero percent  increases.2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Excuse me. I3 would ask you to please provide Mr. Schleider  with 4 some respect and let him finish his  comments.5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, I did. I6 said no.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Oh, I' m sorry.8 I didn' t hear you.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Absolutely no.10 Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Wenk.12 MR. WENK:	In short, no.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	The Chair votes 14 no.15 Motion fails, 7 - 2 .16 I' m sorry.	Let me repeat that.17 Motion fails, 7 - 2 .18 Do I have -- is there  another 19 motion?20 ( Audience participation.)21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes, Mr. Chair.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.24 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank 25 you, board members and welcome to the  public 2 
2 assembly gathered here.3 And first I also would like  to 4 publicly recognize the leadership of the  newly 5 appointed chair of the board, Mr.  Kimmel.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And wish him 8 success in his term as Chair and to welcome  the 9 board' s newest member, Mr. Scheinberg.10 MR. SCHEINBERG:	Thank you.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So far this year' s12 scheduled meetings and reports, deliberations and 13 airing of points of view, highlight the fact  of 14 life that stress, worries, trouble and  uncertainty 15 brought about by the continued economic  insecurity 16 affecting most everyone in this Great Hall  and 17 throughout New York city, Both tenants  and 18 landlords.19 Though the individual 20 circumstances are varied in both type and  depth,21 nonetheless, living in New York City has  become 22 more of a challenge and providing safe,  affordable 23 housing has become more of a challenge, a   great 24 deal more challenging.25 But the current year has  shown 2 
2 that all New York City residents were impacted  --3 ( Audience Participation.)4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- by economic 5 strains and pains.	The economy has reduced income 6 for all owners through rent collection losses,  rent 7 reductions and vacancies.	Although larger building 8 incomes may carry the impact from rent loss  from 9 individual tenants for a little while without  much 10 harm, small building owners still cannot afford  to 11 carry such a burden.12 This will hurt all the tenants  in 13 the building if operations cannot be continued.  As 14 for tenants, again, landlords are sympathetic  to 15 the realities the hard- pressed and out- of- work 16 tenants face. Landlords, again are sensitive to  the 17 real world hardships of tenants at risk.	And 18 landlords --19 ( Audience participation.)20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- are concerned 21 that tenants with strong payment history  are 22 falling behind in these times.	And I' m not 23 speaking of the tenant, 15 percent of the  tenants 24 that cannot meet their rent in any economic  climate 25 - no one denies that those tenants are  perpetually 2 
2 as risk - I' m speaking of those tenants  newly 3 vulnerable due to losing their job over the past  18 4 months because of the deep  recession.5 Yet the figures presented to  the 6 board do not rise to the level of low from   last 7 year' s invited testimony because the recent 8 unemployment rates have nominally improved,9 stopping the downward trend, and the  government 10 reports that the economy is  improving.11 ( Audience participation.)12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But we know the 13 cost of living has risen, the cost of living  has 14 risen and risen sharply with hidden  price 15 increases.16 ( Audience participation.)17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Usually these 18 hidden price increases are a smaller packaging or  a19 less product in the same size package. Coffee  cans 20 used to hold 16 ounces of ground coffee. Now  they 21 hold less than 12 ounces, same size can, 33   percent 22 price increase.23 A pint size container of  ice 24 cream, 16 ounces this year now holds only 14  ounces 25 in the same size container. That' s a 14  percent 2 
2 price increase. Even if the market price didn' t go 3 up, that is a hidden price increase, 14 percent  in 4 one year. Less paper towels in the same size  roll,5 smaller portions than you used to get. All  hidden 6 price increases, and many of those within the  past 7 year alone.8 ( Audience participation.)9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Looking at the 10 cost of food and household items over the past  ten 11 years, the rate of price increase, just what  you 12 pay at the cash register, has  dramatically 13 increased.	And when you also consider the  smaller 14 amounts you can get for that high price,  your 15 dollar has shrunk. The dollar doesn' t go as far  as 16 it used to go. Food and household items cost  way 17 more than they did. However,	--18 ( Audience participation.)19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- your apartment 20 didn' t get smaller. And the rent increase you pay 21 is far, far lower than the increase you pay  for 22 food and household items, far, far lower. In  fact,23 the rate of rent increase has never kept up  with 24 the rate of real price  increases.25 We' ve seen the staff reports that 2 
2 illustrate years of falling property incomes  and 3 followed by some years of rising property  incomes.4 We' ve seen the staff reports showing the meager 5 property incomes for Bronx apartment  buildings 6 contrasted with the higher incomes and  luxury 7 buildings in core Manhattan neighborhoods. We' ve 8 seen the incomes for properties in the Bronx  move 9 down year after year despite some upward  property 10 income movement in other boroughs.11 Clearly there is no consistent 12 movement in property income Citywide let alone  year 13 to year. In fact, the Citywide average rate  of 14 property operating income growth is 38  percent 15 lower than last year.	Average cost growth is 23 16 percent higher than last year. Costs rose  23 17 percent faster than the prior year' s rate of 18 growth.	In fact, the staff report show the  only 19 consistency is that stabilized rent increases  have 20 roughly mirrored inflation and that owner' s costs 21 have increased far, far faster.22 This means that the repairs,23 renovations and improvements are made with  more 24 expensive dollars as inflation eats into  the 25 purchasing power over time. Yet property  owners,2 
2 the vast majority of landlords demonstrating  pride 3 in their property make the commitment to  providing 4 safe, clean housing for their tenants. We' ve seen 5 the evidence of this.6 Yet, still one in nine  properties 7 are distressed, an increase over last.  Distressed 8 because the rents don' t cover expenses. A rent 9 stabilized apartment offers protection and 10 stability, maintains the fabrics of  neighborhoods 11 and allows long- term tenants the comfort of calling 12 someplace home.	And it' s no secret I grew up in  a13 rent stabilized apartment and said I always  thought 14 of it as home.15 I say this again, a  rent 16 stabilized apartment is not a birth right and  the 17 opportunity the rent stabilization laws  provide 18 tenants of that long term stability and  protection 19 is not without cost.20 The tenant members do not deny  the 21 cost of operating a rental building have  been 22 rising. However, the tenant member still hold on  to 23 the thought that owners as a group are making  out 24 well and that no increases are necessary  or 25 warranted. Yet tenants as a group maintain  they 2 
2 need not pay their fair share. I ask the  question 3 on this board, who on this board says that  tenants 4 should not pay their fair share?5 I say we need to move as a   board 6 to a more realistic attitude that supposes not  all 7 landlords are able to make it without assistance  in 8 meeting rising costs. Crimped cash flows  and 9 draining on their savings and that most tenants  can 10 and should bear their share of the rising  real 11 estate taxes.	Water and sewer charges, unfunded 12 mandates and prospect of rising interest  rates.13 Without proper and fair rent increases,  the 14 landlords are again shouldering the expense of  what 15 is a public subsidy.16 ( Audience participation.)17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The vast majority 18 of landlords, this large number of landlords, as  I19 said before, own small buildings.	About 40 percent 20 of the regulated rental housing stock is  in 21 buildings of less than 11 units. The vast  majority 22 of landlords have been suffering operation  cost 23 increases for years without a real  commensurate 24 increase in rents.25 These are the gatekeepers of  the 2 
2 existing affordable housing stock. These 3 gatekeepers are the private citizens that the  City 4 has inequitably forced to shoulder the public  cost 5 with higher real estate taxes, another  upcoming 6 increase in water and sewer charges, and dozens  of 7 administrative fees.8 The tenants must share in  these 9 costs. The rent stabilized apartment is not a  birth 10 right. The obligations of being a good  tenant 11 include paying a rent that fairly reflects the  cost 12 of running safe, habitable and affordable  housing.13 Last year' s RGB order, the prior 14 year, Order 40 and 41 , which called for 15 supplemental increases on tenants paying under  a16 thousand dollars per month on apartments they' ve 17 lived in for six years or more, was  effectively 18 taken off the table by the court. That  supplemental 19 rent increase was passed by this board as  a20 necessary assist to landlords struggling in  the 21 face of skyrocketing fuel cost and real estate  tax 22 increases.23 Much discussion and deliberation 24 went into addressing the challenge facing  those 25 landlords who are subsidizing long- term, low- rent 2 
2 apartments.	And not all landlords would have  seen 3 any benefit. It was an imperfect solution but  it 4 addressed a specific and realistic problem.  And 5 without such assistance, the struggle to keep  their 6 properties in good repair was further  challenged.7 This is most important as the  rate 8 of distressed apartment properties increasing 9 because operating expenses rise faster than  rents 10 in some buildings. Low rents means small  monthly 11 increases, which might not be a troublesome  issue.12 However, expenses tend to rise higher and  faster 13 per apartment than the small monthly rent  increases 14 on low- rent apartments.15 And expenses are rising fast,  very 16 fast. Our staff reports are thorough. But  this 17 year' s reported operating cost price increases 18 understates the rise in fuel oil prices  and 19 overstates the decrease in gas heating prices,  with 20 the overall effect of grossly understating  the 21 general rise in operating cost increases.  This 22 understated the staff' s calculation of commensurate 23 rent increases.24 Testimonies from owners and 25 managers of apartment buildings confirm the  rapid 2 
2 rise in operating costs and were surprised at  the 3 low percentage increase in the report. The  staff 4 report focusing on the rent increase formula  noted 5 that the rise in core expenses were 3 . 4 percent and 6 that next year' s core increase will be 6 . 7 percent.7 These suggest modest one and 8 two- year guideline increases will be necessary to 9 protect the viability of the regulated  housing 10 stock.	However, reality says costs have risen  far 11 more with testimony suggesting that  minimum 12 one- year renewal lease increases up to ten percent 13 are necessary.14 ( Audience participation.)15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	However, in 16 keeping with the economic realities and  concerns 17 for those newly- at- risk tenants and those likely to 18 join their ranks before the year is out, I   again 19 propose that the owner member not seek a  rent 20 increase to this maximum level for the  upcoming 21 year' s guideline.22 I propose a continuation of  the 23 tempering of our usual position. And we will not  be 24 reaching for double- digit increases, as to do so 25 would not be in the spirit of recognizing  current 2 
2 demands and hardships.3 So, to mitigate a portion of  the 4 cost increases and redress the loss suffered  by 5 losing the supplemental rent increase from  last 6 year, I propose that the guideline account for  the 7 realities in the rise in operating costs with  a8 five percent increase for a one- year renewal, and a9 nine percent on a two- year renewal lease.10 ( Audience participation.)11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The board must 12 allow landlords to protect New York' s housing and 13 to equitably share the burden.14 Furthermore, I call for a  20 15 percent vacancy allowance, which is  already 16 provided by the law, ten percent sublet  allowance.17 And for those guidelines applicable in  accordance 18 with Article 7 C of the Multiple Dwelling Law, five 19 percent on a one- year lease, nine percent on  a20 two- year lease, 20 percent vacancy allowance.21 For dwelling units subject to  the 22 Rent and Rehabilitation Law --23 A VOICE:	500 percent!	Isn' t that 24 better?25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- we recommend 2 
2 150 percent of fair market rent to achieve  60 3 percent prevailing market rent adjustment. And  for 4 decontrolled units, the same, under 50 percent  of 5 fair market to achieve 60 percent of  prevailing 6 rent adjustment.7 Thank you, Mr. Chair.8 ( Audience participation.)9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.10 Is there a second?11 ( Audience participation.)12 MS. CRUZ:	I second.13 Mr. Chair, if I might just say  a14 words, please.15 MR. SCHLEIDER: Is your mike  on?16 MS. CRUZ:	I want just to  express 17 my reasons why I support my colleague' s guideline 18 proposal.19 I just -- private rental  housing 20 in New York City is predominately provided by  small 21 property owners.22 ( Audience participation.)23 MR. CRUZ:	Small property owners 24 are more than half of the rental buildings in   New 25 York City. And they contain at least one- third of 2 
2 the rental housing stock in New York City. That' s3 approximately 330 , 000 rental units. Eighty percent 4 of these buildings are more than sixty years  old.5 And sixty percent are more than eighty years  old.6 These buildings need constant repairs and  major 7 system replacements.8 ( Audience participation.)9 MS. CRUZ:	These buildings sustain 10 enormous tax burdens. These buildings  constantly 11 require owners to face enormous amounts  of 12 regulation from the Department of Housing, from  the 13 Department of Finance, from the Department  of 14 Buildings, from the Housing Court.15 While my colleague, Adriene Holder 16 points out the net operating income margins  appear 17 to increase, in fact, those margins are  more 18 than --19 ( Audience participation.)20 MS. CRUZ:	Those margins do not 21 meet the cost that small property owners face  in 22 running these buildings. And if we do not  support 23 these property owners in maintaining  their 24 buildings, there will not be housing for  the 25 tenants in this audience and across New York  City.2 
2 And for that reason, I ask  this 3 board to consider the proposal that we have  made 4 for the rent guidelines at five and nine  percent.5 ( Audience participation.)6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.7 Mr. Schleider, if you' ll just help 8 me fill in some of the  blanks.9 The proposal before the board 10 right now is a one- year at five percent, two- year 11 at nine percent?12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Correct.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Vacancy 14 allowance at 20 percent?15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Correct.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Sublet 17 allowance at 10 percent?18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Correct.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Lofts, one 20 year, five percent?21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Correct.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Two- year nine 23 percent?24 MR.

SCHLEIDER:	On both the 11 decontrolled units and the proposed special 12 guideline for, being subject to the Rent  and 13 Rehabilitation law.14 ( Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.16 The following motion is presented 17 to board for a  vote.18 Ms. Adams.19 MS. ADAMS:	No.20 ( Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz.22 MS. CRUZ:	Yes.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Holder.24 MS. HOLDER:	We are often reminded 25 by the owner representatives that the RGB was  never 7 
2 meant to serve as an adjunct to social  welfare 3 programs or housing subsidies.	I want to remind 4 them that the RGB was never meant to guarantee  an 5 owner a profit or save an incapable owner or   an 6 investor from his own poor business  judgement.7 ( Audience participation.)8 MS. HOLDER:	In addition, in 9 addition, just for clarification.	Although small 10 landlords own the majority of buildings, they  still 11 only house less than one- third of all rent 12 stabilized tenants in the City.13 ( Audience participation.)14 MS. HOLDER:	Closer to 70 percent 15 of all units are owned by large businesses or   large 16 landlord companies.17 All I want to make sure that we' re 18 clear about is that the same way that I am told   by 19 owner representatives as well as owners that  come 20 to testify that the Legal Aid Society and  other 21 groups should be doing more in Albany, and that  the 22 tenant movement should take it to Albany and  make 23 sure that affordability is secure, to make  sure 24 that tenants are getting all that they deserve,  I25 would also say that we know that what' s driving  the 2 
2 Price Index of Operating Cost and so many of  the 3 things that a lot of extremely  sympathetic 4 landlords come to us, is property  taxes.5 And I' d like to see that they do 6 something in terms of advocating for that. I  hear 7 that many are, same as we' re in Albany doing what 8 we can. And without Home Rule it is  extremely 9 limited. But we' re doing all that we can to  ensure 10 affordability.11 This board, however, is a part  of 12 what it is that we can do. And as members of   this 13 board, we are contributing to the success or  the 14 failure of the process of maintaining  affordable 15 rents and maintaining the housing stock  and 16 securing people' s livelihoods as well as be they 17 owners or tenants here in New York City,  we 18 contribute or distract from this  problem.19 And I would again like to say  that 20 we should own that as a responsibility and  think 21 very hard about what' s going on here.	At a time of 22 a recession, we are still guaranteeing owners  high 23 levels of profits and we' ve been doing it year 24 after year after year. Easily, there should  have 25 been a rent -- freezes as well as rollbacks  from 2 
2 prior years. But we keep on piling the  increases 3 that get compounded year after year after  year.4 This proposal just adds insult to 5 injury, and this year yet again, and I vote  no.6 ( Audience participation.)7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 Mr. Languedoc.9 MR.

2 expand and to enforce the existing safety  nets,3 social safety nets. It just feels disingenuous  to 4 me.

Y. C.17 Administrative Code), and in the  Legislative 18 Findings contained in the Emergency Tenant 19	Protection Act of 1974 ( L. 1974 c. 576 , § 4 [§ 2 ]).20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	With that 21 language being read, is there a  motion?22 Mr. Languedoc.23 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you, Mr.24 Chair.25 Mr. Chair, last year this  board 20 
2 voted for a rent freeze and adopted as its order,   a3 rent freeze for hotel tenants.	In the data that 4 was provided to the board this year, it was  shown 5 that again, that the price increase, price  index 6 for hotel owners was lower than what was last  year.7 And also in spite of there  being 8 several hundred hotel buildings in the City of  New 9 York, not one hotel owner or representative of  a10 hotel owner saw it fit to appear and testify at   the 11 invited testimony day last week to explain why  the 12 board should do anything different from what it  did 13 last year, namely a rent  freeze.14 My mike just went off.15 Namely a rent freeze for  hotel 16 tenants. I would ask the board -- and in  contrast,17 the board was provided with not only  detailed 18 information from the staff of the board,  but 19 detailed testimony from experts in the field  of 20 advocacy for hotel tenants who made it clear  that 21 the situation for hotel tenants has not changed  or 22 hotel owners, has not changed significantly  since 23 last year, namely, that hotel owners by and  large 24 do not rely upon the income they receive from  their 25 stabilized hotel tenants to make a profit or  to 2 
2 even meet their expenses.3 I therefore, would urge the 4 members of the board to adopt a  preliminary 5 guideline of an across- the- board rent freeze on all 6 classes of hotel units.7 ( Audience participation.)8 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Let' s send a9 message to the hotel owners of the City of New   York 10 that if they truly need and feel that they' re 11 entitled to an increase, something has  changed 12 since last year, that they have an obligation  to 13 come before this board and explain their case  to 14 the board and otherwise, this is what should  be 15 done.16 So, that' s my motion.17 ( Audience participation.)18 MS. HOLDER:	I second the motion.19 Sorry, it came back on, of zero percent  or 20 across- the- board rent freeze. This is the housing 21 of last resort. Some of our most vulnerable  New 22 Yorkers reside in these units.23 And, again, as Ron has  so 24 eloquently stated, there is no increase that  would 25 stem the tide of the loss of these units.  Landlords 2 
2 are making -- the landlords for these units  are 3 making exorbitant profits and do not need  any 4 assistance from the rent guidelines board to  meet 5 their needs of cost and expense for running  these 6 buildings.7 ( Applause.)8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Languedoc 9 has proposed a zero increase across the board  for 10 all classes, as previously mentioned.11 Ms. Holder has seconded that.12 The motion is on the table for  a13 vote.14 Ms. Adams.15 MS. ADAMS:	I pass.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz.17 MS. CRUZ:	No.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Holder.19 MS. HOLDER:	Yes.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Languedoc.21 MR.

2 ( Applause.)3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, first, I5 really take issue with Mr. Languedoc' s6 characterization of because a class is  not 7 represented, they don' t deserve to be heard or 8 considered. I find that -- I find that type   of 9 punishment extreme and uncharacteristic.10 But needless to say, there have 11 been exclusion provisions for rent increases  for 12 hotel owners going back to 1973 or ' 74 , it' s13 roughly 36 , 37 years, to address the fact  that 14 hotel owners, some hotel owners do lease out  units.15 And we have heard testimony that there are  hotel 16 operators that do, in fact, operate 100 percent  or 17 close to 100 percent SRO  hotels.18 And in terms of hotel increases  on 19 operating costs not meeting a certain set  standard 20 that the tenant advocate has put forth, I  might 21 remind you that since 1985 -- and since you  did 22 read some numbers, let me read some to you --   the 23 price increase for hotels in 1985 was up 4 . 124 percent.25 In 1986 it was up 6 . 4 percent from 2 
2the prior year.3In 1987 it was up 4 . 6percent from 4the prior year.5In 1988 it was up 4 . 4percent from 6the prior year.7In 1989 it was up 6 . 2percent from 8the prior year.9	In 1990 it was up 10 . 9 percent 10 from the prior year.11 In 1991 it was up 5 . 7 percent.12 ' 92 it was up 2 . 5 percent.13 ' 93 it was 4 . 7 percent, all the 14 way up through current days when we go from 7 . 415 percent increase from ' 07 to ' 08 ,16 ' 09 to ' 10 , 3 . 5 percent, and 17 ' 10 to ' 11 , projected 3 . 9 percent.18 So we' ve had zero rent increase 19 effectively for decades.	And yet you tell me  that 20 the hotel operators aren' t considering that in 21 their reposition units to compensate themselves  for 22 operating these buildings. I think it' s23 disingenuous and I don' t doubt the loss of hotel 24 units is directly related to your proffering  zero 25 percent rent increases all these  years.10 
2 I say no.3 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Mr. Chair, could 4 I very briefly respond to that  statement?5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	No, no. Let' s6 complete the vote.7 The chair passes.8 Ms. Adams.9 MS. ADAMS:	Yes.10 ( Applause.)11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I thought you 12 voted. Oh, I' m sorry. Mr. Wenk.13 MR. WENK:	Yes.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Chair votes yes.15 Motion passes, 7 - 2 .16 ( Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Languedoc,18 did you have --19 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I just wanted to 20 say that --21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.22 MR. LANGUEDOC:	-- I did -- it' s23 not that we didn' t consider the possibility or  the 24 data that' s been presented about price increases,25 it' s that owners -- we' ve also considered the 2 
2 evidence that was, the substantial evidence  that 3 was provided that hotel owners are  making 4 substantial profits and that their income stream  is 5 other things than rent stabilized rents.  And 6 there' s no need to raise the rents of these 7 tenants.8 ( Applause.)9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Again, you' re 10 going against our mandate.	We do not consider 11 profit.	Profit can' t be measured. I' m sorry, Ron.12 But your argument really doesn' t hold water.	And 13 I' m really surprised at your insistence on holding 14 forth that because somebody doesn' t show up they 15 don' t need to be considered.16 MR. LANGUEDOC: It' s not a question 17 of someone not showing up.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I think we' re 19 done.20 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I think we are.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I think we' re 22 done.23 Any other business?24 ( No response.)25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,2
