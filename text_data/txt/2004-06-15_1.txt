2	P R O C E E D I N G  S34	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good morning.5 My name is Marvin Markus and  I6 am Chair of the New York City Rent  Guidelines7 Board.8 I would like to welcome you  to9 this, one of a series of public meetings  and10 public hearings leading towards the adoption of   a11	guideline that affects both guidelines, a series12 of guidelines to affect apartments,  apartment13 lofts and hotel lease renewals beginning  October14 1, 2004 and running through the end of September 15	of 2005.16 I would like to have the Board17 introduce themselves and then we will go right  to18 the speakers.19 Beginning on my far right , Mr.20 Schleider.21 MR .

HOLDER:	Adriene Holder,14 tenant member.15 (Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The first17 speaker will be New York City Council 's Speaker18 Gifford Miller.19 COUNCILMAN GIFFORD MILLER:	Good20 morning.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	See, we' re22 eff icient .2 3	COUNCILMAN GIFFORD MILLER :	That24 is impressive.25 Well , good morning .24 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good morning.3 You are absolutely our  first4 speaker.5	COUNCILMAN GIFFORD MILLER :	I'm6 proud to kick it off.7 And I want to thank all of  you8 for giving me the chance to testify here  today9 and to express my strong opposition to  rent10 increases for the 2004/2005 period on  tenants11 living in rent - stabilized units.12 I am deeply concerned about  the13 effect that higher rents would have on more  than14 two million lower and middl e- income tenants who15 are already confronted with high rates  of16 unemployment	and an increased and rising cost  of17 living.18 These are still diff icult times19 for many New Yorkers, with seniors, the  disabled20 and people living on fixed incomes  left21 especially vulnerable.22 I want to remind the Members  of23 the Board that your own analysis in the  200424 Income and Affordability	Study reported that in25 2003 "New York City' s economy still struggled to6 
2 recover from recession, rising  unemployment3 rates, falling employment levels, and stagnant  to4 declining  real wages. "5	I'd also like to add that in  the6 last three years New York City has lost  nearly7 200, 000 jobs and the average wage has fallen by8 almost two percent.9 During  the same period ,10 allowable rents for stabilized units have  climbed11 10.9 percent , a rate that far outpaces inflation.12 At the same time, New York' s13 stock of affordable housing is declining at  an14 alarming speed, thanks in large part to the  Bush15 Administration' s assault on the Federal Section  816 housing program and because of changes in  New17 York State' s rent laws that make it easier to18 evict tenants through the process of  luxury19 decontrol.20 We must not heap  further21 hardship on people who are already being  forced22 to the breaking point. Affordable housing is  the23 bedrock of a strong middle class and we are  only24 courting long - term decline by chipping away at it25 with higher rents.6 
2 I would also like to register  my3 opposition to any attempt to impose a so- called4 longevity tax . Rent regulation is an important5 tool to help tenants remain in their homes in  the6 face of rising rents. Punishing these people  who7 have struggled to maintain their homes for  eight8 or more years will destabilize our  neighborhoods9 by uprooting long- term tenants.10 Such a surcharge is a tax  on11 senior citizens and others who have managed  to12 remain in long- term affordable housing against13 increasing odds against them .14 I am pleased that the Board15 voted down this surcharge at its last meet ing and16 I urge the Board not to include a longevity  tax17 in its final recommendat ion .18 All this is not to say  that19 costs for property owners have declined. Over  the20 past three years the Price Index of  Operating21 Costs has gone up. But certainly property  taxes22 represent a large portion, twenty percent , of the23 operat ing cost of rent - stabilized buildings in24 the City. It is the single largest operating  cost25 and typically exceeds the cost of labor and  fuel .2 
2 The solution to this problem,  as3 I've outlined and my colleagues in Council  have4 outlined , is to lower property taxes across the5 board through lower property taxes in the  City.6 That 's one of the reasons why I 've supported a7 two percent across- the- board because it would8 provide the basis for the Rent Guidelines  Board9 and for others looking at declining costs so  that10 we can actually really put a brake on the  rising11 and extraordinary burden of the cost of  housing12 in the City.13 With that I would just ask  that14 you once again reject the increases in this  year15 given the extraordinary increases that we've  had16 in the past in order to reflect the hardship  of17 our times and the need for affordable housing  in18 the City.19 (Audience participation.)20CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Questions?21(No response.)22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Thank you.23COUNCILMAN GIFFORDMILLER:24Thank youvery much.25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Thank you.

I'm  the19 songwriter for the Metropolitan Council on20 Housing.21 I of all people should know  how22 bad a winter this was. I broke my hip on the   snow23 and ice and had to use a walker until last  month.24 However, let 's look at the big25 picture. Over the last fifteen or twenty  years,10 
2 even during mild winters such as 2000 and 2002 ,3 when you should have voted a rollback or at   least4 a rent freeze, you gave the  landlords5 unconscionable	increases which negatively6 impacted on disposable income and on  local7 businesses and the job market , forcing people  to8 choose between food medicine  and rent.9 Have you no conscience?10 I have read most of your  reports11 and I found out that the small landlords did  not12 suffer as much as their crocodile tears  would13 indicate.14 The PIOC went up less this  time15 than it did last time. And as far as the lead   law16 is concerned , it affects very few of the rent17 stabilized apartments and the lead can be  sealed18 with some stuff that only costs  $35.00.19 Your proposed range of  increases20 is much too high. Any increase will result in   an21 increase in homelessness which will cost  the22 taxpayers in the long  run.23 If you say are there no  prisons,24 are there no workhouses,  remember  that we ,  the25 taxpayers, will be shouldering the burden of  the2 
2 prison- industrial complex.3 If children are removed from4 loving homes due to lack of proper housing,  we5 will have a whole generation left to the  tender6 mercies of the foster care system and  what7 happens when they turn  eighteen.8 I enjoy reading Charles  Dickens'9 novels, but do you want to be responsible  for10 Dickensian conditions in our fair city?11 Laissez faire, mon derriere.12 Okay. Questions?13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 (Audience participation. )15 MS. ANITA ROMM:	Thank you.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 The next speaker is Mr.  Freund18 for the Rent Stabilization  Association.19 MR. JACK FREUND:	Thank you, Mr.20 Chairman, Members of the  Board.21 Last year you asked the property22 owners to absorb most of the nearly  seventeen23 percent increase in building operat ing costs,24 allowing owners to pass along increases of  only25 4.5 percent and 7.5 percent for one and  two-year2 
2 leases.3 This year owners face another 74 percent , nearly 7 percent increase in costs, a5 staggering 24 percent	increase in costs over two6 years.7 And yet this Board' s preliminary8 range of guidelines barely encompass the  rent9 increases needed to cover this year' s cost10 increases without any room to catch up for  last11 year' s deficit.12 Today you will hear from13 property owners who will draw a different  picture14 than the one conjured up by the data presented   to15 you. You will hear from small building owners   who16 use #2 oil and have seen their heating  bills17 increase, not decrease, as indicated by the  Price18 Index.19 You will hear from owners  who20 are only barely covering their expenses and  who21 can only dream of harvesting the so- called22 typical net operating income characterized  in23 your Income and Expense  Report.24 You will hear from owners  whose25 real estate taxes have increased by far more   than2 
1	152 the 3 1 percent over two years and whose insurance3 bills have increased by far more than 87  percent4 over the three years recorded by the Price  Index.5 And the cases you hear  from6 property owners are not mere anecdotes. As  we7 have demonstrated , the income and expense data8 you receive does not paint a  representative9 picture of rental housing economics. You  need10 only look at the recent increase in  tax11 delinquencies and the decline in net  operating12 income to see where rental housing economics  is13 heading.14 Rents must rise significantly  to15 prevent  further economic deteriorat ion.16 We understand that many  renters17 cannot easily afford any increase in rent.  That18 is why the RSA has joined with its  sister19 organizations to try and prevent any reduction  in20 Section 8 funding.21 We support increases in  the22 income limits for the Senior Citizen  Rent23 Increase Exemption program; in fact , support the24 expansion of that program to all income- eligibl e25 tenants, not just the elderly. It is, after all ,2 
2 government 's role to provide the safety net of3 income or rent subsidies for those tenants  who4 cannot afford even regulated  rents.5 If you feel you must balance6 the interests of the owners and the  tenants,7 pl ease consider another balance  point , a  point8 when inadequate rent guidelines will  force  owners9 to cut back on their maint enance and investment10 in their propert ies, a point when ult imately your11 good intentions will backfire and result  in12 deteriorating  housing conditions.13 In the last two years building14 operating costs have increased by nearly  twenty-15 four percent , and much more than that in terms of16 what owners have actually  paid.17 The current year' s cost18 increases alone, as measured by the Price  Index,19 call for rent increases equal to or greater  than20 last year's rent guidelines.21 This year we ask you to provide22 the fair and reasonable guidelines necessary  to23 pay for the unavoidable increases in  operating24 costs to support the City's tax base and  to25 maintain the City' s rental housing.2 
2 Thank you for your3 consideration.4 (Audience participation.)5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Questions?6 Sure. Mr. Lubell.7 MR. LUBELL:	Mr. Freund, you8 said the Rent Guidelines Board was getting  an9 incomplete picture of rental housing  economics.10 Could you explain that?11 MR. JACK FREUND:	Sure.12 I would like to highlight , as we13 tried to indicate in our submission to you,  there14 are two aspects to your missing  data.15 One is the buildings that  are16 not in your Income and Expense Report. You  have17 represented there two- thirds of the units, but18 only one- quarter of the buildings. And the19 buildings that are missing are the  smaller20 buildings that have lower rents and  higher21 operating costs and smaller operating  margins.22 So the numbers that you have,  as23 I think you know, are being overshadowed  by24 Manhattan. And a complete picture would  include25 the small buildings that aren' t there.6 
2 In addition, the other3 shortcoming of the approach of the Income  and4 Expense Report is that you are looking at  an5 average apartment which does not  exist.6 In order to get a true picture7 of what housing economics is in the City,  you8 have to look at buildings. Owners  operate9 buildings. They don't operate the  average10 hypothetical apartment .11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any other12 questions?13 Thank you, Mr. Freund.14 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Quest ion.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'm sorry.16 Mr. Schleider. Go ahead.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you, Mr.18 Chair.19 You said that this year' s20 guidelines should be at least equal as  last21 year' s guidelines.22 What is your basis for  that23 comment?24 MR. JACK FREUND:	Thank you,25 Mr. Schleider.2 
2 The basis for that comment  is3 the Board' s own numbers, the numbers presented to4 the RGB by the staff , which indicate that the5 Commensurate Rent methodology,  which this Board6 has followed for decades now, the  Commensurate7 Rent methodology	indicates required rent8 increases of as much as 7 percent and 11 .59 percent just to meet this year's operat ing cost10 increases without making up any of the def icit11 from last year' s increases.12 Even the net revenue model  calls13 for increases of 5.5 percent and 9 percent .14 Both of those commensurate  rate15 adjustments produced by the staff are  outside,16 they are above the range of the  preliminary17 guidelines that are on the table  here.18 Therefore , you are almost  bound ,19 if you stay within that range, to pass  guidelines20 which are going to be  inadequate.21 And , in fact , let me just22 mention, that if you just average out , you have23 five different Commensurate Rent  methodologies24 that the staff has given  you. Coincidentally,	if25 you average those out , giving equal weight to all2 
2 of those methodologies, because they all  have3 pros and cons, and if you average them out , you4 come out with a required rent increase of  4.55 percent for a one-year lease and 7 .5 percent  for6 a two-year lease, which coincidentally  is exactly7 last year' s guidelines.8	And we think you need to go9	higher than that.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr . Zelnik .11	MR . ZELNIK:	I've read some of12 the RSA reports and I am also hearing you  today13 and I'm just curious. Can you make an  argument14 for different guidelines for different  building15 types in different geographic  locations?16 MR . JACK FREUND :	My Zelnik, I17 can't make that argument.18 The argument I can make to  help19 the small property owners who have the  smaller20 buildings with the lower rents and the  higher21 operating costs is to provide an  additional22 adjustment for those small owners, that is,  an23 additional adjustment across the  board.24 But it is the small owners  that25 will primarily benefit by any  additional12 
2 adjustment you make.3 That is why we have put on  the4 table such things as a longevity or long- term5 occupancy all0wance.6 We have put on the table a low7 rent adjustment that would apply not just below  a8 certain rent level, but that would apply  to9 different size apartments at different  rent10 levels.11 We have put on the table an12 additional adjustment for tenants who are  coming13 of f a low two-year  lease renewal  from 4 percent .14 We suggest to you that the  way15 to help the segment that you know needs help,  the16 small properties	in the outer boroughs, is to17 provide an additional adjustment above and  beyond18 whatever rent guidelines you pass, which  are19 almost certainly bound to be inadequate to  help20 those owners.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure, Mr.22 Zelnik.2 3	MR. ZELNIK:	Would you be24 opposed to an adjustment such as you are  talking25 about , longevity and so on, that would help the24 
2 small property  owner  -  let 's say twenty units and3 less - but would not necessarily be across  the4 board for all of the other  tenants?5	MR. JACK FREUND:	I think I6	would welcome any additional  adjustment.7	However, it would be difficult8 for me to support an adjustment that has  an9 artif icial cutoff and def ines a small owner as10 one who owns just twenty units. How about  the11 small owner who owns twenty-one units? Isn't  he12 just as much in need of that  additional13 adjustment? I think they  are.14 I don't think you can introduce15 an art ificial cutoff. A small owner I've been16 arguing to you can range anywhere from  under17 twenty units to under a hundred  units.18 I think in this City to be  a19 large owner, to really get economies of  scale,20 you need hundreds of units to average your  costs21 out and to increase your bulk purchasing  power.22 The majority of our members,23 more than half of our members, are small  property24 owners. They own one or two small units, one  or25 two small buildings totalling less than  twenty8 
2	apartments.3	But there are many more owners,4 over eighty- five percent of our owners, who own5 less than a hundred units.6 I would also characterize  those7 owners as small owners and equally in need  of8 additional adjustments to help them meet  the9 astonishing operating costs that they  have10 experienced over the past two  years.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any more12 questions?13 (No response.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,15 Mr. Freund.16 MR. JACK FREUND:	Thank you.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Barbara19 Brooks.20 MS. BARBARA BROOKS:	Good21 morning to everyone on this lovely  day.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You want to23 pull the mike down.24 MS. BARBARA BROOKS:	Oh, sure.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 
2 MS. BARBARA BROOKS:	Hi! And I3 won' t even take up the three minutes. I'm  just4 here to urge the Rent Guidelines Board to  do5 something that 's equitable to both parties.6 I have no antagonism towards  my7 landlord or anyone. I think to have to  pay8 every two years to be paying 7.5  percent9 increases, and the first speaker made  some10 excellent points, which I would like to,  hope11	people remember, that doesn' t have to be this big12 antagonism.13 I'm urging the Board to do  the14 right thing, perhaps give 2.5 percent for  one-15 year, 4.5 percent two years. Give us a  break.16 Thank you.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Marolyn20 Davenport.21 MS. MAROLYN DAVENPORT:	On22 behalf of members of the Real Estat e Board of  New23 York, owners, builders, managers and brokers   of24 high- rise residential property,	I urge the Rent25 Guidelines Board to set realistic rent   increases12 
2 which reflect today' s substant ially increased3 costs.4 Landlords are still trying  to5 capture operating costs from last year' s6 inadequate increases. We need  reasonable7 guidelines that reflect not only this year' s8 increase in operating costs, but  uncompensated9 cost increases from last year as  well.10 Last year the RGB PIOC  increased11 by seventeen percent while one-year rents  were12 permitted to rise by less than a third of  that.13 Led by fuel increases,14 skyrocketing  insurance rates and the largest15 property tax increase in the City' s history,16 apartment owners' expenses went through the  roof17 while rents rose only  modestly.18 Although the rate of  cost19 increases has slowed, the PIOC has gone up  nearly20 seven percent this year, substantially more  than21 the general inflat ion rate.22 On top of that , the City has23 just enacted legislation which will cost  owners24 of pre- 1960 buildings millions of dollars to25 comply with the lead paint  requirements.2 
2 We have just had two  consecutive3 years of high fuel prices and extremely  cold4 weather. As we speak, oil prices are at an all -5 time high and natural gas prices continue  to6 rise.7	Water rates are going up 5.58 percent this year and labor costs are  beginning9 to increase substantially.10 After two years of  exploding11 insurance rates, property insurance rates are  in12 a modest decline from their all - time highs. But13 now you have to get separate, very expensive14 policies for lead paint and  mold.15 Owners felt the full brunt  of16 the enormous property tax increase last year  and17 increased assessments add to that  burden.18 This year owners of pre- 196019 housing will face unprecedented	costs to attempt20 to comply with the City' s new lead paint law. The21 sidewalk sheds up all in the City attest to  the22 vast amounts of facade work going on  in23 anticipation of the new cycle of  facade24 inspections that will begin early next  year.25 Taken together the outlook  is8 
2 clear. Operating costs are rising  substantially3 and will continue to do so .4 Older buildings under rent5 regulation have fallen well below the  market.6 Many have an extremely low turnover which  creates7 a two- tier housing market.8	These buildings are in  trouble9	and need higher increases to  operate.10 For all of these reasons I  urge11 the Rent Guidelines Board to pass increases  at12 least comparable to what they did last year.  We13 can ill afford to permit our aging housing  stock14 to fall into disrepair.15 As we know from past  experience,16 that is exactly what happens when rent  increases17 do not cover housing  expenses.18 At the very least increases  at19 the top of the range under consideration  are20 essent ial to maintain our housing.21 Thank you.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any23 questions?24 (No response.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .10

6	MR. STEVE HERRICK:	H ,  I
I'm
7 Steve Herrick. I'm Executive Director of  the8 Cooper Square Committee.9 I'm here today to urge that  the10 Rent Guidelines Board rethink its pract ice of11 passing across- the-board rent increases for all12 rent stabilized tenants.13 Our organization has recently14 conducted a survey of sixty- six tenants in  twenty15 rent regulated buildings  in the Lower East Side16 and East Village. They encompass about six   census17 tracts.18 Among our findings are  the19 following.20 13 .7 percent of apartments21 surveyed now rent for over $2 , 000 per month and22 have been deregulated.23 The median rent is $925  per24 month. However, the median rent of tenants  who25 moved in before 1997 is $750 per month,  whereas7 
2 the median rent of people who moved  in after	' 973 is $1850 per month.4 While we expected to  find5 tenants who moved in more recently to be  paying6 higher rents, this finding was shocking  and7 outrageous. Tenants living in  comparable8 apartments as their neighbors are paying  1509 percent higher rents simply because they moved   in10 a couple of years ago instead of eight years  ago.11 Our study provided  startling12 evidence of harassment via Housing Court.  Fifty13 percent of tenants who have been living in   their14 apartments prior to '97 have been in court  with15 their landlords. In contrast , zero percent of16 tenants who moved in after 1997 have been  in17 court with their landlord.18 Longevity of tenancy in and  of19 itself can't explain this dramatic  disparity.20 Rent levels is the key factor. 62.5 percent  of21 tenants paying under $500 a month have been  in22 court with their landlord , whereas no tenants23 paying over $1100 per month has been in  court24 with their landlord .25 We believe that these  findings2 
2 about rent disparities and litigation would  be3 replicated to varying degrees if similar   studies4 were conduct ed in other neighborhoods, whether5 they be Washington Heights, Jackson Heights or6 Crown Heights.7 While the New York State8 Division of Housing and Community Renewal and   the9 New York State Legislature deserve a lot of  the10 blame for bringing about de facto deregulation   of11 apartments upon vacancy in our community, the12 Rent Guidelines Board only exacerbat es the13 disparities in rents by passing along 3 .5, 5.5,14 7.5 percent annual rent  increases.15 For tenants paying  $600, a seven16 percent rent increase for two years amounts to   a17 $42 rent increase. But for tenants paying   $1850,18 which is half the newer tenants in  our19 neighborhood, this would push their rents up to   a20 $129 rent increase or $1979 per  month.21 The Rent Guidelines Board  must22 take a stand now and stop being complicit   in23 deregulating  thousands of apartments.24 Forty- two percent of tenants in25 the Lower East Side have moved into  their2 
2 apartments since 1997. Of these nearly one - third3 have been deregulated. Assuming that these  and4 other apartments are vacated at least once in  the5 next seven years, we can assume that they  will6 all be deregulated.7 With over 40,000 rent  regulated8 apartments on the Lower East Side, we estimate  at9 least 5500 of them have already been  deregulated.10 We are at risk of losing  the11 majority of our rent - regulated housing stock to12 deregulat ion over the next five to seven years.13 The Rent Guidelines Board must14 take into account the vast array of  landlord15 practices that exceed the reach of the  Rent16 Guidelines Board' s jurisdiction. They include MCI17 rent increases, vacancy of apartments that can  be18 raised with improvements to those  apartments.19 The rent increases you propose20 for nearly one million rent - regulated units21 cannot be calculated in a  vacuum.22 I urge you to create a two- tier23 rent increase that spares tenants who moved  into24 their apartment after 1997. The evidence of  their25 unique rent burden is overwhelming  and2 
2 irrefutable.3 You have the power to slow  down4 deregulation by simply exempting these  apartments5 occupied by tenants after 1997 from the  rent6 increases that you approve this year .7 Thank you for your serious8 consideration of this  recommendation.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So you are10 recommending a longevity increase  then?11 MR . STEVE HERRICK :	Not the12 longevity increase that you are talking  about.13 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Well , what - 1415 MR . STEVE HERRICK:	I'm not16 talking about an added surcharge on tenants who17 have been  living  in their apartments  - -18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What is it if19 you say that some in pre- '97, moved in post - '97,20 those would get an increase, what 's the21 difference?22 MR . STEVE HERRICK:	Well ,23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It 's a24 lower - -25 MR . STEVE HERRICK :	- -	I think15 
2 that people who moved in the last five to  seven3 years, they are paying much higher rent. They   are4 paying market rate  rents.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	But you are6 advocating a differential	in rent regulation7 based on tenure, length of tenure; is  that8 correct?9	MR. STEVE HERRICK:	I think10	that 's something that should be considered.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12	(Audience participation.)13CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Susi Schropp.14I left youout.15MS. SUSI SCHROPP:Good1617morning.I live in a building which  is18ownedwhichis one of many examples of - -  I'm19sorrywheredrastic changes have caused  the20 elimination of all but one rent - regulated21 apartment in a t ime span of less than two  years.22 Approximately two years ago my23 building was purchased by the Ohebshalom   family,24 also known as the Shalom family.25 And since then, my landlord  has20 
2 engaged in illegal conversions of apartments   into3 a store, construction not conforming to  plans4 submitted and approved by the DOB,  construction5 without permits, drastic decreases in  services,6 and harassment of tenants until they flee  their7 homes of many years .8 Nineteen out of twenty rent -9 regulated units have been  destabilized.10 Apartments, which used to rent for  approximately11 $700 to $900 a mont h, are now renting for $230012 to $2800 a month, a 320 to 400 percent  increase.13 Due to the elimination of  my14 fraudulently registered preferential  rent of15 fifteen years, my rent is about to increase  by16 fifty percent.17 I believe the proposed  increases18 are not designed to help the few  landlords19 recover the increases in expenses but to  assist20 them in reaching the magical number of  $2000,21 which allows landlords to destabilize  rent22 stabilized apartments.23 With the proposed  increases the24 Rent Guidelines Board accelerates the  elimination25 of affordable housing stock never to be  replaced .2 
2The Shaloms, who operate  my3building underthe names of Sky Management	and4Target Realty,are one of many landlords  cashing5in on what hasbecome the real estate deal of  the6 century, the purchase of rent - regulated buildings7 and the displacement of tenants who depend  on8 their affordable housing.9	My landlord is about to  receive10 a fifty percent increase, has decreased  my11 services and harassed me in order to get me  out .12 There have been no increases in my salary in  the13 past two years.14 The recipients, like myself , of15 such high increases are mostly people  who16 struggle to make their rents and whose  salaries17 have decreased or remained the same in  past18 years.19 I ask the Rent Guidelines  Board20 to grant landlords low or no increases this  year21 and to preserve the little affordable  housing22 left in this City.23 If it were such a bad business, 24	I don't see landlords fleeing their  properties25	because they can't maintain them, yet tenants  do
2 that on a daily basis.3 Thank you very much.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 (Audience participation.)6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any7 questions?8 Mr. Lubell.9	MR. LUBELL:	You claim that10 there have been some illegal  activities.11 Harassment  is illegal among other act ivities that12 you ment ioned.13 Have you reported this to14 appropriate authorities?15 MS. SUSI SCHROPP:	Yes, I have.16 And I - -17 MR. LUBELL:	And they did18 nothing?19 MS. SUSI SCHROPP:20 Unfortunat ely, the DHCR sides with landlords.21 They don' t view  - - you know, like constant  leaks,22 constant decreases in services, they don' t view23 that as harassment.24 I  filed an harassment	- -25 MR. LUBELL:	They don' t? That 's10 
2	news to me.3 MS. SUSI SCHROPP:	No.4 MR. LUBELL:	Well , have you also5 reported the illegal conversions, for  example,6 the conversion of an apartment into a  store7 without approval , have you complained to the8 Building Department?9	MS. SUSI SCHROPP:	Yes, I have.10 MR. LUBELL:	And they did11 nothing?12 MS. SUSI SCHROPP:	It took13 about fifty phone calls. And with the help of  my14 Community Board , that was the first time we15 received the attention of the Department  of16 Buildings.17 Prior to that , inspectors came18 by probably at least ten times only to  determine19that everythingwas okay.20MR.

JAMES ANDERSON:	I will8 bring facts, evidentiary proof , if you ever  find9 the time, chief especially Pagan and  Holder,10 bring invitat ion to everybody to meet me in11 person to come to the facts .12 Everything go up . There' s no13 question about that.14 Tax, fuel oil , insurance,15 everything against the landlords .16 (Audience participation .)17 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Just be18 quiet.19 So in this situation probably20 got poor people with five/six/ten  apartments,21 broken building, very hard. Plus there is  a22 normal tenant complain, complain,  complain.23 (Audience part icipation .)24 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	We find25 this diff icult that we face .8 
2 So in this situation day by  day3 real estate coming down. And big shots  all4 they claim sometime , they cash money for5 themselves,  for commissioners, deputy6 commissioners and bosses.7 I belong small landlords and8 small tenant , also like me down - they will   be9 down. There' s no question about that.10 I just surprised that Pagan  says11 zero rent.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You should13 address the whole Board, not individual  members .14 MR . JAMES ANDERSON :	No. Not -15 - he' s from Puerto Rico .16 If everything going up, so17 increase in the rent does not go down. There' s no18 question . Doen't matter, from Puerto Rico, from19 Italy, from Mexico . That 's the story all the20 time: going up everything, or it coming down .21 So in this business you22 cont inue. And when apartment become vacant , you23 hear what one smart man says, no paint. No  one24 tenant cannot come in the apartment if not  paint25 the apartment . Before paint  the apartment ,2 
1	402 usually all buildings there' s some plast ering3 someplace. Definitely.4 So I do not appreciate to  hear5 liars who represent  tenant  and claim that  - - it 's6 not true, it 's not true landlords don' t touch7 nothing, landlords not necessary to  repair,8 landlords blah, blah, blah.9 In this situation find out how   -10 - and blame me.

1	412	Thank you .3	(Audience participation. )4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Gregory5 Brender representing Assemblymember	Deborah6 Glick .7 Welcome, Mr. Brender .8 MR. GREGORY BRENDER:	Thank you.9 Good morning.10 The Assemblymember  wanted to be11 here today but she's in Albany. She's grateful  to12 the Board for the opportunity to  present13 testimony.14 At a time when the economy  is15 not producing wage increases, a rent increase   is16 unjustif ied and unacceptable.17 Rent stabilized tenants  were18 punished by last year's enormous increase of  4.519 percent  for one-year leases and 7.5 percent  for20 two- year leases. To continue to increase rents at21 this pace will place a serious and undue  hardship22 on New York City' s middle class and working  class23 tenants.24 Nonetheless,  the landlord lobby25 continues to complain that rent protections  are4 
2 eating into their profits. However, ownership  of3 residential property in New York City  and4 especially Manhattan is still widely prof itable5 and there is a remarkable lack of evidence  that6 strong rent protect ions make a property7 unattract ive to real estate investors.8	In addition, interest rates  have9 been at an all - t ime low aiding landlords in the10 purchase of new properties or in  making11 improvements to older ones, the cost of  which12 landlords can and usually do perpetually  recover13 through rent increases from Major  Capital14 Improvements.15 There are better ways for  the16 City to address the concerns of the real  estate17 industry than slapping an increase on  tenants.18 Better regulation of the19 insurance industry could mitigate  the effects of20 insurance costs, for example. Furthermore, it   is21 important to note that when responsible  building22 management  makes timely and thorough repairs,23 owners experience lower than average costs for24 maint enance and repairs.25 We should not base the rate  of9 
2 adjustment upon the costs incurred by the  most3 irresponsible  landlords who allow conditions to4 go unrepaired until they reach dangerous   levels.5 This attempt to bring about  a6 large rent increase for rent stabilized  tenants,7 while landlords' profits are already growing   is8 inappropriat e. Large rent increases continue to9 steadily divide New Yorkers into enclaves of   the10 wealthy as other residents are pushed  further  and11 further out to the edges of the City and  beyond.12 Rent protections were enacted  to13 prevent rent gouging in a housing  vacancy14 emergency. If we do not vigilantly guard  these15 prot ections, this dangerous situat ion will16 continue to grow worse.17 Evidence of the crises caused  by18 skyrocketing rent can be found in the more  than19 3 0,000 individuals sleeping every night in City20 shelters and the more than 230 , 000 households who21 have been evict ed in the past decade here in  New22 York.23 In 2001, tenants received a  rent24 increase based upon the increase in fuel  and25 heating  costs  - - primarily  based  on the increase2 
2 in fuel and heating costs landlords  experienced.3 This year those costs have dropped and the  Rent4 Guidelines Board staff 's own projections for5 overall cost next year paints a rosy picture   for6 building owners.7 I urge the Rent Guidelines  Board8 to take this into account along with  the9 knowledge that while landlords continue to  profit10 in this difficult economy, many moderate  income11 New Yorkers struggle to make ends  meet.12 I urge the Rent Guidelines Board13 to reject the proposed rent increases and  instead14 vot e for a zero percent increase for one and  two-15 year lease renewals.16 Thank you.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on one19 second.20 Go ahead.21 MS. ADAMS:	I just wanted you to22 repeat your recommendation because  I couldn' t23 understand.24 MR. GREGORY BRENDER:	I'm for a25 zero percent increase for both one- year and two-2 
1452year renewals.3CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:Okay. Zero.4Okay. We are goingto take a5	brief recess while we fix the  tables.6	(At 10:45 o'clock a.m. there was7	a recess in the proceedings .)8	(At 10:50 o'clock a.m. the9	proceedings were resumed.)10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.11	Maude Boltz .12 Maude? Maude Boltz? Is she  here?13 Here she comes.14 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Let me,15 before you start  - - hold on a second. Let me   read16 the order we expect here so people can be  ready17 here.18 After Maude Boltz will be  Selma19 Sparks. After that will be Andrew Hoffman.  After20 that will be Robert Sherwood.21 Go ahead , Maude.22 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Good morning,23 Guidelines Board.24 I have two main points, but let25 me preface it by saying you know the basic  costs.12 
2 You're here because you know what insurance,3 what' s happened with insurance. You know what 's4 happening with oil. You know how these costs  have5 impinged upon landlords.6 But the main factor is  probably7 now you cannot get covered for lead in your basic8 policy.9 And, you know, the City Council10 has really done us a big favor, and  Gifford11 Miller has just been so much help that we are   so12 indebted to him.13 But the fact of the matter  is14 we've got to solve it  ourselves.15 And the best way to solve it  is16 to ensure your own building by renovation and   by17 the work that you can do in each apartment so18 that you don' t get some other person who is  just19 looking to make money come after  you.20 So that has cost me this  year21 over $7000 just in one place. And I'm going   to22 have to do it in seven more  apartments.23 So it' s a thing that has to be24 factored in.25 I do not like - - I'm  a2 
2 conscientious landlord. I do not like  smacking3 tenants with big increases. I carefully  consider4 what I'm doing with each person, try to make   it5 as equitable across the board with them and  not6 go the full limit . I save the full limit for  when7 I have a vacancy because that person, when  they8 come in, they know what they' re paying and they9 know what to expect , and it 's not being dumped on10 somebody else.11 But my problem now with  these12 extra costs is that I've got a longevity  tenant13 or two longevity tenants, but one definitely  more14 than ten years. And I would appreciate being  able15 to do something about that because it 's16 inequitable with the rest of the tenants.  That17 rent is very low and I can't have the  tenants18 that are a little big higher and put them   through19 the roof.20 So the only thing to do is  deal21 with the one that 's been there for over ten22 years. And he has a good  salary.23 So I'm looking for some  relief24 in that area. And I'm doing my best to  ensure25 myself  regarding lead.2 
2Thank you.3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,4Maude.5MS. ADAMS:	I have a question.6CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Maude , Ms.7	Boltz, a question.8	MS. ADAMS:	You mentioned the9 building where you spent $7000 this year  for10 lead - based paint removal I believe.11	How many units are in that12 building?13 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Eight.14 MS. ADAMS:	And why did it cost15 so much?16 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Because I17 removed all the - - I redid the kitchen floor and18 I leveled. And I redid the bathroom walls and   I19 redid the kitchen walls and I removed all  the20 woodwork and I lined the closets, I put up   new21 cabinets. And  then I had to repipe  - -  if I'm22 doing that much, I have to repipe and put in   a23 different sink and counter and so  forth.24 So that - - and then also by your25 doing walls, you are going to have to do  electric12 
2	because - -3	MS. ADAMS:	So the $7000 was for4	more than just removing lead - based paint?5	MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Oh I	it - - I6 wasn' t encapsulating, but gett ing rid of . That 's7 what I was doing.8	I wasn' t , you know - - I mean - -9 in fact , I had an elderly call me and she had10 about three inches of flaking paint in  her11 bathroom. And she was about ready to have a  heart12 attack because she didn't know what to do  about13 it because of the laws. And she did not  know,14 because the apartment was occupied , how she  was15 going to like remove this  paint.16 And the people had a baby.  The17 baby wasn' t even walking. But she was  - - she  was18 just about ready to have a heart attack over   the19 new law. She's like in her eighties. I'm  not20 chipper either.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.22 Gale.23 MS. KAUFMAN:	Do you have a24 specific recommendat ion for us on the one and25 two-year leases?9 
2	MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Pardon me?3	MS. KAUFMAN:	Would you have a4 specific recommendation for us for the one  and5 two-year leases?6	MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Wel 1, I7 definitely don' t think it should be zero. I  think8 last year was an important , you know, increase.9 And if I'm going to keep doing this kind  of10 renovation, I need at least , you know, seven on  a11 two-year lease because I have to factor it   in12 when I'm getting a new  tenant.13 I don' t factor it in with the14 old tenants. I factor it in with a new  tenant.15 MS. ADAMS:	What is your16 recommendation  for a one-year lease?17 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Pardon?18 MS. ADAMS:	What' s your19 recommendation  for a one-year lease?20 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Well , I think21 it should be like  - -  I think 4.5 was a  little22 low. I think it should be higher than that.  It23 should be 6 maybe.24 (Audience participation.)25 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Maybe the high7 
2 end for two years shouldn' t be that much more3 because it 's the same person, but the low end4 could be a little bit  higher.5 Thank you.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.7 Mr. Pagan.8 Ms. Boltz, you're not  done,9	unless you want to leave  us.10 Go ahead.11 MR. PAGAN:	Two quick questions.12 You mentioned ,  one, that you13 were looking at individual tenants and you   would14 not take the full increase, giving the  full15 increase in the past.16 So you were giving preferential17 rents.18 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Right. That 's19 my policy.20 MR. PAGAN:	Have you recovered21 those preferential rents?22 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Pardon?23 MR. PAGAN:	Have you recovered24 those increases now?25 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	No, I haven' t ,10 
2 no. Only when these tenants leave. Right now  it 's3 still close.4	MR. PAGAN:	But you can still do5	that.6	Second, listening I heard the7	improvements you did.8 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Yes.9 MR. PAGAN:	And to me some of it10	is MCI. Have you applied for  MCI?11	MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	I did , but the12 market right now - - you know, I had to come  down13 from what the full MCI would have been  because14 the market is low. So I won' t really get the  full15 increase until I get another tenant in  the16 future.17 MR. PAGAN:	So giving you an18 increase you're only looking at the  future19 tenants?20 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	That 's how I21 do it . I mean some people may not be able to  do22 that. It depends on what their rate  is.23 MR. PAGAN:	And you are asking - 2425	MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	But that 's
2 what I'm doing because of the people I have and   I3 don' t want to force them out. They' re all good4 people.5 MR. PAGAN:	But you would also6	get a twenty percent when you do  that?7 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Pardon?8 MR. PAGAN:	You get a twenty9	percent.10 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Yes. But , you11 know, I just paint ed the hallway too, you  know,12 and insurance has doubled and the oil bills  have13	gone up.14 And  I've got to have - - I don' t15 have now enough prepared to do the kind  of16 renovation I did in that apartment because  I17 don' t have the money. So I got to stockpile some18 money so I can do the next  one.19 MR. PAGAN:	So	just fine. So20 what ever increase we give now you would not be21 able to pass to your  tenants?22 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Well , all my23 lease renewals are in this year and most of   them24 will probably take two-year  leases.25 So, you know, probably the14 
2coming yearit won' t affect me personally that3much exceptthe vacancy  - -  I mean the longevity4clause. Andthat person has a rent that is not  in5	alignment  with the other tenants  - -6	MR. PAGAN:	And - -7	MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	and he8 could afford a higher rent. So I'm going  to9 even though I've been generous with this  person10 in the past , I'm going to have to do something11 because of what happened with the lead  insurance.12 And the City Council doesn' t like us either.13 MR. PAGAN:	So I'm confused.14 That person that' s come in with longevity has not15 received  - - you have not  recouped the16 preferential	rent?17 MS . MAUDE BOLTZ:	No. I have18 given them preferential  rents. But , you know,19 their rent was lower. And  so even with  - -  I gave20 them a small preferential  rent. Over the years21their renthasn' t increased that much. It 's22increased,but not relative to the  other23apartmentswith  vacancy  allowances .24CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25MS.  MAUDE BOLTZ :	I mean - - I'm
2 just trying to survive. I feel strange to have  to3 come here and plead my case to a committee.  You4 know, I'm trying to run my business. I don't  know5 where else - - what other business  they do  this .6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you.7 (Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Selma Sparks,9	please.10 MS. SELMA SPARKS:	Good11 morning, everyone .12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good morning .13 MS . SELMA SPARKS:	I'm Selma14 Sparks. I'm going to read  this.15 "New Yorkers who rent their16 homes, apartments throughout  the city are17 generally working people who form an  economic18 middle class.19 "There are seniors, retired20 workers now living on fixed incomes, paying  rent .21 Most of these seniors have inhabited  their22 apartments for many years .

2Do we really want to destroy  our3city totally?4" There goes our great  New York5City. "6You talk about these  increased7 charges you have. Fine. Put pressure on  the8 insurance companies regarding their escalat ing9 rates. And on the government  for allowing10 constantly  increasing owner costs.11 Let 's do that.

The PIOC  was10 6 .9 percent and it 's indicative of our escalating11 expenses.12 More importantly, the core  PIOC13 shows an increase of 9.2 percent and that 's with14 a 2. 8 percent decrease in fuel costs.15 Last year's guidelines didn' t16 even come even to keeping us on a level  playing17 field. One of the most telling signs in  your18 reports this year is the fact that net  operating19 income reported in the 2004 I & E Study  has20 declined by 0.1 percent.21 This decrease in NOI was  the22 first decrease since the Rent Guidelines  Board23 began to use computerized records in  1994.24 It 's obvious that the guidelines25 have not kept up with  expenses.2 
2 Next year the NOI will be  much3 lower if the Board stays with the range of  the4 proposed guidelines.5	Why is this important you may6 ask?7 NOI decreases are an indicator,8 along with tax delinquencies, that owners  are9 struggling and will continue to lead  to10 widespread  abandonment costing future  generations11 thousands of rent regulated apartments just   when12 we' ll need them most.13 We've been talking for years  of14 how flawed the est imates can be. Typically  owners15 come in front of the Board and say expenses   are16 going up and tenants come and say that it 's17 temporary. But expenses go up every  year.18 Even the expenses that go  down19 in the short run, like fuel , continue to jump20 around as evidenced by the high prices of fuel   in21 the past few months.22 I'm sure if you did a  PIOC23 adjustment today, the fuel would skew  everything24 the other way. You would see a huge increase  like25 last year.6 
2 I've been getting phone  calls3 from my vendors talking about how they need  to4 raise prices. They're paying  $2.40 a gallon  for5 their trucks and they just can't absorb  that.6 They need to pass those costs along to us.  And7 airline tickets are being surcharged  now.8 The high cost of energy  is9 affecting us all.10 If it 's not increased fuel , it's11 an increase in legislative requirements.  Local12 Law #1 concerning lead paint removal in  all13 apartments will go into effect on August  2nd14 dramat ically altering the way that we do15 business.  It 's going to affect our normal repairs16 and maintenance.  The cost will increase17 dramat ically.18 I know the Board has taken  much19 testimony regarding this fact and I hope that   you20 remember the new lead paint requirements when you21 deliberat e guidelines this year.22 I don' t envy your position.23 We've all come to realize that a system  which24 should be a straight forward  mathematical25 calculation has evolved into a political   circus.2 
2 Expenses are up; income is  down.3 It 's the responsibility of the4 Rent Guidelines Board to keep the housing  stock5 viable. And the way you are mandated to do  that6 is to promulgate responsible increases .7 And I thank the Board in  advance8 for guidelines that will keep the City' s housing9 stock viable.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11	A question from Mr. Lubell.12 MR . LUBELL :	Mr. Hoffman, what13 is the average age of the buildings of  your14 membership? Do you know approximately?15 MR . ANDREW HOFFMAN :	A lot of16 our members are third generation. We've  taken17 over the responsibility of maintaining  the18 apartments from our fathers and our  grandfathers.19 I would think the average age  is20 over fifty years old.21 MR. LUBELL :	And is there any22 pecul iar requirements because of those buildings23 being more than fifty years  old?24 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	Well , the25 cost of operating older housing obviously is  much12 
2 more than operating new housing. Our  plumbing3 systems are at the age where they've  exceeded4 their useful life. Our waterproofing,	our5 roofing, our boilers, everything is much older   in6 those buildings and have exceeded their  useful7 life.8	You know, it 's difficult to get9	MCis for everything. You know the answer is  MCI.10 You know what? A lot of  our11 owners can't afford to do a complete  replacement12 of a roof and they cannot do a complete  one13 hundred percent repointing of a  building.14 So if you have a leak in  an15 apartment , you know, apartment 5J, and you just16 fix that one leak on the outside of the  building,17 you don' t repaint the entire wall, you can't get18 an MCI increase for that.19 If you just patch your roof20 because of a leak and you can't afford to do  the21 whole roof , you can't do an MCI  for that .22 And the same goes for all23buildingsystems. You have to replace the  entire24buildingsystem in order to get an MCI  increase.25A VOICE:	Why don't you sell
2your building?3MR. LUBELL:	Thank you.4CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank5you.6	(Audience participat ion.)7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma' am, you're8	not a question.9	MS. ADAMS:	How many owners and10	how many units do you  represent?11	MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	CHIP12 represents approximately  1500 owners with 300, 00013 units.14 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Pagan.16 MR. PAGAN:	A quick17 clarification.18 You indicated  that the NOI ,  this19 year' s decrease was the first one since 1994.20 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	That' s21 straight out of the I &  E.22 MR. PAGAN:	My understanding of23 the last t ime it decreased was in fiscal year 24	1990 .25	MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	Just give
2 me a minute.3 I may be mistaken.4 I thought I had the I & E  with5 me. Do you have the I & E?6	MR. PAGAN:	Yes.7		MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	And it 's 8	1990?9	MR. PAGAN:	Yes.10 Along  with that , the	.1 percent11 is probably	- -  I haven' t seen that. That decrease12 is almost  - - is negligibl e.13 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	But every14 other year it 's been an increase. So the fact15 that it 's - -16 MR. PAGAN:	That 's correct.17 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:18 actually a decrease I think is hugely  important.19 MR. PAGAN:	Let me ask you a20 question.21 Does every business merit to  get22 a - -  to take a risk, and does risk   include23 increases and decreases in returns?24 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	Yes, but25 every business is not highly regulat ed like we10 
2 are.3 You know what? I go to the  local4 deli and I remember paying for a quart of milk   a5 dollar. I always used to go in and get a quart   of6 milk in the morning	for the family. And I used  to7 give the guy a dollar. All right? Now I give the   8	guy $1.30.9	They're not regulated. They10 charge whatever they want for  milk.11 MR. PAGAN:	And how many dairy12 farms are surviving?13 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	Exactly.14 Would you like other - - you know what? It's very15 important for us to survive. And if we get  low16 rent increases, we won' t be able to survive, just17 like the dairy farmers.18 (Audience participation. )19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder.20 Ms. Holder, go ahead.21 MS. HOLDER:	Mr. Hoffman?22 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	Yes.23 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.24 Are you finding in your25 membership that increasingly owners are able   to10 
2passoff energy costs to their tenants? I  know3I'venoticed it in my practice throughout  the4Citywhere tenants are actually paying  for5	electricity and the cost of heating the wat er.6MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	Out of the7units thatI manage, I don' t have one building8where theypass off the cost of heating or  hot9water.10There are some buildings  that11 are individually met ered. And actually when  they12 started the rent structure many years ago,   there13 were different rent charges for  electrical14 inclusion building  and for buildings that were15 not electricity included.16 And I believe that the  base17 rents today will reflect that if you go  back18 many, many years.19 But I don' t know of one building20 where you pass the along the cost of hot wat er  or21 heat.22 MS. HOLDER:	Electricity.23 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:24 Electricity, there are some buildings that  do.25 It 's not that they pass along the cost.	They11 
2 have their individual meters with Con Ed.  And3 actually for the buildings that don' t have4 individual meters, there is a  detriment.5 I have a couple of large6 buildings that have one master meter and   tenants7 don' t pay directly for electricity.	It 's included8 in their rent.9	So what happens in those10 buildings? Air condit ioners run twenty- four hours11 a day, people leave the lights on. They are  not12 paying directly for electricity.  So that13 adversely affects the people who have  electricity14 included in their rent.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Pagan.16 MR. PAGAN:	Just quickly, in17 reference to the utilities, I have noticed a   new18 change in providing services to a unit. And   I19 wondered if any of your members have started  to20 do that , and that is, to have the heating and hot21 wat er being provided to either electrical or  gas22 that is individually met ered?2 3	MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	I don' t24 know of one building that has done that and  I25 don' t even think that DHCR would allow that.24 
2 The DHCR allows to put  an3 individual electric meter in. They actually  just4 promulgat ed a new set of rules regarding  taking5 electricity out of the rent and,  therefore,6 reducing the rent.7 But there are no such rules  for8 the scenario that you  presented.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay Thank10 you.11 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	Thank you.12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Robert14 Sherwood.15 MR. ROBERT SHERWOOD:	For the16 umpteenth time it is wrong to mix big- time17 operations with small - time operat ions.18 Next , I want to remind you to19 keep in mind the proviso. I cannot afford  an20 increase. I've been operating on recessionary21 wages, no overtime. It 's out of the question.22 I told you last year about  the23 new arrangements at the Hotel Commander now   the24 Tempo. They've been gett ing plenty of money  from25 there. They don' t need to gouge us any further.10 
2 Next , to paraphrase Ronald3 Reagan I will say this. Mr. Pataki , Bruno,4 Silver, Bloomberg, Rent Guidelines Board,   kindly5 prot ect , strengthen and defend our humble walls.6 Now, everybody here knows how  we7 brag that we are the greatest city in the  world.8 But how can we be the greatest city in the  world9 when, in fact , we are a colony of Albany, being10 held hostage by the landed gentry of the State  of11 New York?12 I urge that the Mayor form  a13 bipartisan group of all of the delegations   to14 Albany from New York City to fight for home   rule,15 with the first order of business to repeal  the16 Erstadt Law. Get rid of  it.17 (Audience participation. )18 MR. ROBERT SHERWOOD:	Let us19 become the greatest city in the world by   ceasing20 to be the colony of Albany and the footstool  of21 the landed gentry.22 Let 's keep the increase at zero;23 if at all possible, please roll back for  economic24 just ice for the people.25 Thank you.2

Following  Ms.14 Justy is Bill Hunter, then Jimmy Silber,  then15 Napol eon Kates and then Chris Atheneos.16 Ms. Justy.17 MS. CLAUDIA JUSTY:	Good18 morning, Members of the  Board.19 My name is Claudia  Justy,20 Executive Director of the Community  Housing21 Improvement Program, a trade organization of mid -22 size property owners and apartment  building23 managers with over 1500 members.24 Thank you for allowing me  the25 opportunity to present  this testimony today  on10 
2behalf ofour membership.3Our membership owns and  operates4a varietyof housing stock within the  five5boroughs,most of it subject to rent  regulation.6 The deliberat ions and final actions of this Board7 affect our members in a variety of ways. We  feel8 that the proposed range of guideline increases  is9 not adequate to meet the increased costs  of10 maintaining	rent regulated properties  in New11 York .12 The Price Index has increased  by13 6.9 percent over last year' s 16.9 percent.14 However, looking at last year' s15 guidelines and the proposed range for this  year,16 owners may well wonder what effect these  numbers17 have had on the Board' s deliberations and final18 decision.19 Taxes have gone up  16.2 percent ,20 insurance costs have risen 14.7 percent , and21 labor costs, contractor services  and22 administrative costs have all risen in excess  of23 4 percent each. Yet the Board is proposing  an24 increase as low as 3 percent.25 We know from the Board' s own6 
2 research that the Net Operating  Income figures3 are the lowest in a decade. Net Operating   Income4 does not take into account basic costs  of5 property owners such as mortgage  expenses and6 necessary Major  Capital Improvements.7 The research has further8 demonstrat ed that the income received from  rental9 properties  is not keeping pace with operat ing10 costs.11 This means that owners  are12 receiving less income from which they  must13 provide the same amount of service to  their14 tenants. The rent regulatory system demands  the15 maintenance  and upkeep of all existing  services.16 Owners facing increased costs cannot choose   to17 reallocat e their expenses in any way that will18 alter existing building  services.19 Additionally, the cumulative20 rent guidelines increases of the past  decade21 result in a lower figure than the  cumulat ive22 Price Index. This places owners in the   continuous23 cycle of attempting to catch up with  inadequat e24 increases.25 Now we are faced with  the2 
2 certainty of a new lead law, which proposes  the3 placement of more demands and obligations   on4 owners. Owners of rent regulated propert ies  are5 on the frontline of available housing  for6 families with children. An owner who rents to7 families with children under seven years of  age8 will be incurring unknown future costs  in9 maintaining  each apartment.10 Owners will also see a rise  in11 insurance costs as a result of the new law.  The12 reality of the new law is that it will  increase13 labor and management	and administration  costs for14 each apartment building.15 There is an additional  element16 of potential	lost revenue during periods  of17 mandat ed abatement if families have to be18 relocated. A simple, routine apartment  painting19 will involve an unknown cost  factor.20 During my past year as CHIP' s21 Execut ive Director, I have observed a trend22 toward local legislation placing  a great er23 economic burden on property owners. In addition24 to the new lead law, which takes effect  this25 summer, owners will be responsible for  the2 
2 installation of carbon monoxide detectors in  each3 apartment starting in the  fall.4 The Rent Guidelines Board must5 assure owners that the housing market can  remain6 viabl e by adequately compensating owners for7 increased operating expenses. Tenants  are8 protected by virtue of the rent  regulatory9 system.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to11 wrap up now.12 MS. CLAUDIA JUSTY:	Okay.13 Can I finish my last line?14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.15 MS . CLAUDIA JUSTY:	Okay. I'm16 sorry.17 The actual amount of the18 increase should be based upon owner' s costs, not19 on what the Board reasons that tenants ought  to20 pay.21 I urge the Board to pass22 realistic guidelines taking the increased  costs23 of managing  rent regulated properties	in New York24 into due consideration25 Thank you.2

LUSSKIN:	Do you have a8	specif ic number that you could recommend?9	MS . CLAUDIA JUSTY:	We would10	recommend  - -  at  this point we would recommend11	that the range of guidelines, if it be considered12 a range, start at 7 percent and go up to  1013 percent.14 (Audience participation.)15 MS . LUSSKIN:	Do you have a16 specific number?17 (Audience participation. )18 MS. CLAUDIA JUSTY:	I'm sorry.19 I can' t hear you.20 MS. LUSSKIN:	We won' t be21 adopting a range. We' ll be adopting22 MS. CLAUDIA JUSTY:	No, I23 understand . I'm saying you have proposed a  range.24 If we had a range, our bottom number would be  at25 your higher number.12 
2 MS. LUSSKIN:	For a one- year3 lease?4 MS. CLAUDIA JUSTY:	Yes.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead, Mr.6 Lubell.7 MR. LUBELL:	Ms. Justy, you8 ment ioned the new law requires the  installation9 of carbon monoxide detectors.10 MS. CLAUDIA JUSTY:	Yes.11	MR. LUBELL:	Of course,12 appropriate in light of what 's happened recently.13 What would the cost of that  be14 for an apartment?15 MS. CLAUDIA JUSTY:	We' re not16 sure what the actual cost is going to be.  But17 we've received initial est imates from several18 companies that are making carbon  monoxide19 detectors that will be allowed to be used in  New20 York that range from $25 to $30 per  unit.21 Somet imes you may have to22 install more than one in an apartment. And you23 may have to place them also in certain  public24 areas depending on the configuration of  the25 hallways, the public  hallways.12

Thank4you.5A VOICE:	Sell your building.6(Audience participation. )7CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Hunter is8next.Butbefore  that , Mr. Gensler.9Go ahead, Mr. Gensler.10MR. MICKEY GENSLER:	God help11 Iraq if the kind of democracy they end up with   is12 that pract iced at City Council and Rent13 Guidelines Board hearings.  They're called14 hearings, but the Board does not  listen.15 I have gone to many of  these16 hearings	- -17 (Audience participation.)18 MR. MICKEY GENSLER:	and19 come away with one conclusion: they're a  farce.20 Elected officials depend upon the real  estate21 industry for campaign financing and the  Rent22 Guidelines Board was their  payback.23 The question is never  whether24 the landlords deserve or need a raise, but  how25 much to give them.11 
2 The Board was set up for the3 sole purpose of subsidizing landlords.  Every4 mayor has set it up to hasten the demise of  rent5 stabilization . They keep raising the guidelines6 so that renters are forced to double and  triple7 up , move out of the City or go on SCRIE.8 The poor attendance of City  and9 State Council officials at these hearings  on10 behalf of tenants shows their concern . Some of11 the officials who make speeches at these  hearings12 are never heard from until the next hearing .13 Some of the so- called public14 members do not live in rent stabilized   apartments15 or live out of town and are expected to  be16 neutral on the problem .17 Last year the excuse for  the18 very large increase was the real estate tax .  It19 turns out the tax was not necessary so the  Mayor20 and City Council are fighting on who has a  better21 rebate plan.22 The Mayor' s plan will give back23 rebates to co-ops, condos and one, two and  three-24 family homes.25 The Council 's plan includes2 
2 businesses  in the giveback.3 Nowhere is there a plan to  give4 renters relief from the Rent Guidelines  Board' s5 increase. The - -6 (Audience participation.)7 MR. MICKEY GENSLER:	New8 York State legislators in their infinite  wisdom9 decided to make every increase part of the  MBR.10 So even if they make a mistake, there is no  way11 to correct any injustice and the tenant keeps  on12 paying and paying and  paying.13 Where do people who live  on14 Social Security or other fixed incomes get  the15 extra money for these rent  increases?16 I know some senior citizens  who17 can no longer buy necessary drugs because  last18 year' s unconscionable increase took away those19 funds.20 Thank you.21 (Audience part icipation.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Again, just23 by point of information, every Board Member   is24 required by law to live in New York City.  So25 every Board Member - - nobody lives out - of - town.2 
2 The next speaker is Bill  Hunter.3 MR. BILL HUNTER:	Good morning,4 ladies and gentlemen.5	My name is Bill Hunter and I am6 an SRO tenant. I'm also  disabled.7 I truly hope that each of  you8 makes more than $120,000 a year. I hope  that9 because the middle class and the poor are  getting10 creamed.11 Last week I was watching12 Bloomberg  television and the statistic they  gave13 shocked me. And the commentators on that  show,14 they were very concerned, even though there  has15 been a housing boom in the last couple of   years16 because of low interest  rates.17 Ten years ago 65 percent  of18 people earning between $25,000 and $50,000 a   year19 were homeowners. Today that figure is 51  percent ,20 a twenty percent decline.21 The same has happened  to22 tenants. I think that any of you who are  parents23 realize that if your children want to live in   New24 York City, they have to live with two or   three25 other people because of these high  rents.6 
2 Do you think this is good  for3 their psyche?4	Do you think that it 's fair to 5 them when they try to stay in New York and   choose6 to fight on the frontlines of the war on terror  -7 - this war is not over?8 There is no reason for any  rent 9 increases. Last year' s rent increases were 1O	obscene.11	The price of fuel is often used12 as an excuse. Every tenant realizes  that13 landlords figured out this price cost a long   time14 ago. They've either switched to gas or  they15 occasionally turn off the  boiler.16 Our boiler was turned off  four17 times this winter.18 If this were not  the case ,19 landlords would be willing to open up their 2O	books.21 (Audience participation. )22 MR. BILL HUNTER:	I am asking23 you to please do the right thing, the  brave24 thing. Show all the tenants in this City that  you25 care for them. Show them that you are  thankful21 
2 that they didn't all move to  Florida.3 Thank you.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 (Audience participation.)6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Hunt er, a7	question.8 MS. LUSSKIN:	Sorry. A question.9 You live in an SRO hotel , is10 that correct?11 MR. BILL HUNTER:	Yes.12 MS. LUSSKIN:	And how many units13 are in that , in your hotel?14 MR. BILL HUNTER:	Well , this is15 - -  I didn't even get into this.16 There are six units and  this17 says a lot about some present day landlords.   Two18 tenants are old tenants like myself , myself  and19 another, and four apartments are renting now   for20 $1500 a month.21 And these poor people  went22 without heat during this period of time that  I 'm23 telling you when the boiler went off. I didn't  go24 without heat because HPD has considered this   guy25 a gangster for years and installed a unit for   me.10 
2 Of course , I have to pay for3 that when the heat goes off. But I don' t freeze4	to death.5	But can you imagine these  young6 single people , they are paying $1500 for a studio7 apartment , they go for three and four days8 without heat at a time. And guess what? The C  of9 0 hasn' t even been changed on the building.10 This is today' s quandary.11	MS. LUSSKIN:	Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 (Audience participation. )14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next15 speaker is Mr. Silber, then Napoleon Kates,  and16 Chris Athineos,  and then Manhattan Borough17 President Virginia Fields.18 Go ahead , Mr. Silber.12 
19 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Hl'  .I
I'm
20 Jimmy Silber. I represent SPONY, the  Small21 Property Owners of New York.22 In the last two years the  one23 cost increase of real estate taxes has  completely24 wiped out the small owners' budgets  for25 operating. Last year we saw in December  that12 
2owners were facedwith a 18.5 percent tax3increase and theyhad to come up with this,  half4of this tax bill,in just three weeks,  in5January.6 Last year, as a reflection  of7 this, the Price Index was the second highest   in8 history at 16.9 percent. And yet this  Board9 passed a one-year increase of 4.5  percent.10 That was the greatest11 differential	in the history of this Board , in the12 thirty- four years that this Board has been13 meeting. That differential of 12.5  percent14 between the Price Index and the one- year  lease15 increase was the great est.16 And it makes us think what  is17 different about this Board because  your18 methodology has changed. And I just want to   bring19 out to you a few facts in the history of  this20 Board because we feel that for this system   to21 work this Board has to be fair, it has to   produce22 continuity and a balance between what  has23occurred in thepast thirty- four years.24In the years that this Board has25been conductingthe Price Index seven times  the
2 Price Index has been in the 6.0 to 6.9  percent3 range, seven t imes. This year, of course, it 's4 6.9 percent.5 In those seven years of  history6 the Board' s one-year increases ranged from 57 percent to 7.5 percent. That 's for a one-year8 increase. But this year we see the Board  using9 that number as their range for a  two-year10 increase.11 So something has dramatically12 changed in the methodology of this  Board.13 And we want to remind you,  the14 small owners want to remind you that your  primary15 concern is to allow owners to recapture in   income16 what they have lost in increased expenses.  That17 is your primary concern.18 And we feel that you make  an19 error when you try to balance the general idea   of20 tenants' ability to pay rent with  reimbursing21 owners for lost revenues in expenses.22 And this system - - we want  to23 remind you this system is not a system  that24 allocates a subsidy according to a tenant 's25 ability to pay. There is no way to measure if   a2 
2 tenant can afford to pay the rent on  his3 apartment .4 Instead it 's a system that5 provides a rent limit for an apartment  regardless6 of who lives in it , regardless of the income of7 the tenant who lives in that apartment. It  is8	based solely on the tenure and the date  of9	possession of that  occupant.10	And we want to remind you  that11	many, many senior citizens in this City are12 eligible for SCRIE which means if you give a  low13 rent  increase or you give a higher  rent  increase , ·14 that SCRIE pays zero increase in rent .15 But the low increase that  you16 give directly hurts a small property owner  in17 this City.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you19 wrap up, Mr. Silber.20 MR . JIMMY SILBER:	I'm21 finished.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 Any questions?24 (Audience participation .)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 
2 Manhattan Borough President3 Virginia Fields. And then we' re going to go back4	to - -5 (Audience participation.)6 BOROUGH PRESIDENT C.  VIRGINIA7	FIELDS:	Thank you.8 Good  afternoon  - good morning9 still. Sorry.10 I'm here to add my voice to  the11 many I know who are essentially making the   case12 that there is absolut ely no economic13 justif ication for a rent increase to be made by14 this Board today.15 (Audience participation.)16 BOROUGH PRESIDENT C.  VIRGINIA17 FIELDS:	I think among the most urgent  issues18 facing all of New York residents today is that   of19 increasing	the lack of affordable housing  and20 resultant rent increases.21 A recent Rent Guidelines  Board22 report shows that not only is New York  City' s23 economy still in a recession phase , but that  the24 City is in the midst of a housing crisis that  is25 evidenced by the growing number of  homeless8 
2 peopl e who are in shelters, that is evidenced  by3 the growing poverty rate which has begun  to4 increase after a steady five-year  decline.5	Housing is extremely6 unaffordable in this City. And we have seen   since7 1997, as a result of a deregulation, a great  many8 rental units becoming deregulat ed. And in the9 year 2003 alone more than 7,500 rent  stabilized10 units were deregulat ed. And that also affects  the11 issue which we are addressing here  today.12 Currently it appears that13 residential building permits are surging  which14 shows that there is also a growth in  development15 due to the tight housing market and the  low16 vacancy rate. Even though here in Manhattan   we17 have the highest vacancy rate at 3 .86 percent ,18 this still falls below the State law  requirement19 of a minimum 5 percent that 's needed for rent20 regulation.21 So I say in the midst of a22 housing crisis we cannot deal with  the23 possibility of yet another year of  exorbitant24 rent increases.25 Instead of discussing rent6 
1	9 02 increases, I would leave you simply by saying  we3 should be formulating ways to solve  the4 affordabl e crisis that leads to the perceived5 need for rent increases.6 When we look at what is7 happening with Mitchell - Lama, when we look at the8 fact that people are being evicted and cannot  pay9 for rent , and as you heard about the number of10 young people who simply cannot move to this  City,11 I ask what kind of a city do we want New York  to12 be: only for those who can afford to live  here,13 which leaves out a far greater number of peopl e14 who cannot afford to live  here.15 I ask that at a time when  there16 is no economic feasibility or reason for  rent17 increases, that this Guidelines Board reject  any18 plans to increase the rents of the tenants in  New19 York City this year.20 Thank you.21 (Audience participation. )22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Fields,23 hold on a second. A  question.24 I want you to know - you  had25 perfect timing, exactly three minutes.  We2 
2	appreciate it.3	MS. ADAMS:	I'm one of your4 constituents. I'm very pleased to see you today .5 A VOICE:	Can't hear.6	MS . ADAMS :	The costs of7 operat ing apartments are going up . One of the8 dilemmas that we have is coming up with  something9 that allows us to maintain a decent housing  stock10 and also be thoughtful about the  tremendous11 pressures with regard to incomes and the  costs12 that we see from others.13 There are problems in the14 legislat ion that set up this Board as with many15 of the other nets around the  City.16 Are there any things that  you17 would recommend that this Board  do?18 BOROUGH PRESIDENT C. VIRGINIA19 FIELDS:	Well, first of all , we look at what20 happened last year . As you know, the Rent21 Guidelines Board approved rent increases of  8.522 percent for two-year leases and 5.5 percent  for23 one-year leases.24 So it isn't as though - - and  we25 were told that this was being done because of  the
2 18.5 percent property tax  increase.3 So it isn't as if steps have not4 been taken each year to address situations in   the5 economy. But at a t ime when we are seeing on the6 other side salaries aren' t going up and7 especially for the working people of this  City8 because they don' t even have contracts and have9 not had contracts in some years now for  four10 years, so salaries are not going  up.11 Unemployment  reported today is12 again showing a slight increase in this  City.13 So I think that when we look  on14 the other side of this equation, you  are15 absolut ely correct , we have to make efforts to16 balance. But the balancing act has created  an17 imbalance on the side of the tenants for the  last18 four or five years.19 So at a time when you are  not20 seeing growth there, I think we need to  perhaps21 at this year, because of what is happening,  not22 increase the rents at all as it relates  to23 tenants because24 (Audience part icipation.)25 BOROUGH PRESIDENT C.  VIRGINIA
2	FIELDS:	they' re not able to pay for it .3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.4	MR. ZELNIK:	You make a very5 strong case obviously for maintaining	affordable6 housing. I think a lot of us think that  is7 critical.8 But I wonder what case you  are9 also making for the building of new  affordable10 housing which this City has neglected for  decades11 at this point.12 BOROUGH PRESIDENT C. VIRGINIA13 FIELDS:	When we look at how you have been  able14 to bring on board affordable housing in the past ,15 admittedly it has been due to public subsidies  by16 way of government .17 I think you will recall when18 former Mayor Ed Koch began to build  affordable19 housing, there were significant subsidies  which20 enabled developers to be able to develop  housing21 at affordable rates. We do not see that  now.22 So one of the things that I23 think that we have to look at is the role  that24 government	is playing	- - is not playing  I should25 say as far as providing assistance in terms  of5 
2 actual dollars. That is not happening at  the3 City, State nor Federal  level.4 I think also when we look at5 some of the other policies and regulations  that6 prevent the private developers from investing,  we7 can make changes there . For example, instead of8 selling public land at these exorbitant  prices,9 which brings in dollars, I think we have to  make10 some consideration there in terms of being  able11 to allow land for less cost and  enabling12 developers to be able to develop, and that  lowers13 their rate also.14 We need to look at some of  the15 other regulat ions around, you know, the J- 5116 programs and other kinds of subsidies, because  as17 we look at , that has always been in place, even18 with the Mitchell - Lama. And now that we are19 facing buyout of so many owners of Mitchell - Lama20 housing, if that happens, we are going to be in   a21 much worse shape here in New York City  with22 respect to the lack of affordable  housing.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Napoleon2 
2	Kates.3	MR. NAPOLEON KATES:	Good4	morning.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good morning.6 MR. NAPOLEON KATES:	My name is7 Napoleon Kates and I'm here  - -  I am an SRO  tenant8 in Harlem. And I'm here before the  Rent9 Guidelines Board to encourage you to vote for  a10 zero percent increase for  SROs.11 For a little over a year  I've12 been in court with my landlord fight ing to remain13 in my home where I've lived in for thirty  years.14 I have lived in my SRO unit for thirty years,  and15 through the years I have seen a collection  of16 landlords that maintain the  building.17 Thirteen years ago my current18 landlord bought the building and since  then19 conditions have worsened. The building  started to20 deteriorate but he would not make repairs.  I21 would express to him my concerns over time  but22 nothing happened.23 The plumbing	in this building24 was shot. We have an old boiler that was unabl e25 to keep working. He replaced that boiler and  put7 
2 a new unit in, but two years later Con Edison  put3 a	(unintelligible) in the boiler because he  put4 faulty gas pipes on it . Therefore, for the last5	five or six months we were left without heat  and6	hot wat er because he didn't get around to fixing7	it.8 That ' s when  I finally took him9 to court for lack of basic  services.10 In 2003 , the City issued a11 Vacat e Order on the rear half of the building12 because the back wall was about to collapse.   I13 had to stay in the Redrose Hotel downtown for   two14 days. The agency basically they placed me at   the15 YMCA in Brooklyn, but I wanted to return to  my16 home in my community. I did not know where to   go.17 We went to court and the  judge18 want ed the landlord to figure out where to put19 me. Right now I'm living in one of my  landlord' s20 buildings  in Brooklyn temporarily until he  fixes21 the building and I can  return.22 Right now I'm far away from  my23 friends and the community that I have lived   in24 and loved for thirty years. Because of  my25 landlord' s negligence  I do not believe that my8 
2 landlord or other landlords of Harlem  rooming3 houses deserve a rent  increase.4 It is my hope that you would be5	just in your deliberations today.6 Thank you.7 (Audience participation. )8 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Chris9 Athineos.10 After Mr. Athineos is Mildred11 Ortega, then Roberta Bernstein, Desmond  Giddings,12 and Stephen Kamzar.13 Go ahead.14 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:	My15 name is Christopher Athineos and I am a  small16 property owner from Brooklyn. And I'm here  to17 urge you today to keep with your mission  and18 purpose, as Members of the RGB, to preserve  and19 maintain rental housing in New  York.20 After last year' s inadequately21 low guidelines, I thought perhaps you  were22 planning to average out the huge PIOC  increase23 over a couple of years. It's obvious from  your24 proposed guidelines that was not the  case.25 It ' s incomprehensible  to me that10 
2 this Board' s actions are not consistent with the3 mission of the RGB nor its research. I don' t  see4 the point of doing all of the research  and5 holding a public hearing if the Board has   already6 made up its mind to pass very low  guidelines.7 The Mayor and the City  Council8 certainly did not use this reasoning when  they9 passed the largest property tax increase  ever,10 18.5 percent. They said that the City was in  a11 dire budget deficit and they would have to  raise12 real estate taxes or cut  services.13 Owners don' t have this choice. I14 cannot cut services and I cannot increase   rents15 to whatever is necessary to pay my bills.  That 's16 your job and it 's not being done.17 This year my insurance is  still18 increasing after last year's increase of over  10319 percent, and I'm getting less coverage  too.20 My buildings are older  buildings21 in landmark areas which are over 150 years old22 and it 's impossible to maintain them to the23 standards which the City  sets.24 With the new sidewalk25 regulations owners are more liable than ever   for2 
2 maintaining	sidewalks even when trees, which  are3 planted by the City, pull the sidewalks up.  I've4 had to hire private tree contractors who must  get5 a permit from the City to trim the tree  roots.6 Then I must go to the Landmarks Commission  for7 approval of the color and material used to  make8 the sidewalk. And then I have to go to the DOT  to9 get a permit to actually do the work.  This10 doesn' t qualify for an MCI and it must be done11 every few years when a tree pulls up  the12 sidewalk.13 Recently I received a  violation14 from the Fire Department for a sprinkler we  have15 in a common area of a seven- family brownstone.	I16 was puzzled because I already did the  sprinkler17 test which I filed with HPD. And I found  out18 after going to the Fire Department that now  the19 Fire Department is enforcing a new law which  they20 didn' t bother to tell anyone about.21 So now I 'm faced with a $100022 fine, $500 in legal fees and another $1200  bill23 from the plumber to do a pressure test in  the24 presence of a Fire Department inspector,  even25 though all of this was already done and  filed2 
2 with HPD. But the two agencies don' t talk to each3 other.4	And to add insult to injury,  the5 Fire Department also requires now the owner  to6 hire someone who has a certif icate of fitness,7 which is again the licensed plumber, who  must8 come to my building every month to check  the9 sprinkler system for, the sprinkler heads  if10 they' re painted , if there is dust on them and we11 have the proper signs, another $150 to  $25012 charge every month.13 These are things that your14 guideline increases do not  cover.15 I would just urge the Board to16 pass reasonable increases of 7 percent for a  one-17 year lease, 12 percent for a two-year lease and   a18 longevity increase  - -19 (Audience participation.)20 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS :21 of $25.00 for tenants in occupancy more  than22 eight years .23 Thank you.24 (Audience participation .)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell .5 
1	1012	(Audience participation. )3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet. Quiet.4 MS. HOLDER:	Chair, I didn't5	hear what his recommendations were. I'm   sorry.6		CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	7, 12 and 7	$25.00.8	MR. LUBELL:	Mr. Athineos, did I9 hear you correctly your buildings are older than10 the Brooklyn Bridge?11 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:	Yes.12 I never thought of that , but the buildings were13 there probably when horse- drawn carriages were14 coming down the street.15 MR. LUBELL:	Are there any16 additional costs that are required by reason  of17 the age of your buildings?18 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:	I19 mean that' s something that I think the PIOC or20 the Rent Guidelines Board doesn't take  into21 effect.22 Older buildings require  more23 maintenance  than buildings  say built in the24 1960s. I mean we are talking about facade  work.25 We  are talking about  - -  I haven' t even touched on9 
2 lead paint because I know from prior  testimony3 that the Board has said that the law hasn' t gone4 into effect so maybe they don't take that  into5 consideration.6 But it's a huge  consideration7 for owners because just because the law is  going8 into effect August 2nd doesn' t mean that I'm not9 already preparing  and doing work to comply with10 the new law.11 So I don't know what kind of12 paint they used in the 1850s, but according  to13 the City law, if it were built before 1960,  we14 are required to abate lead paint. And  we're15 talking about apartments where I have to go  in16 with a scaffold to paint them, apartments  with17 14/16 foot ceilings with a lot of  ornamental18 plaster work.19 I mean I don't even know how20 I don't even - -  I want to go to the  Landmarks21 Commission.  Someone I know went to the Landmarks22 Commission and asked them what are you  doing23 about this lead paint law. And they said  what24 lead paint law. So they don't even know what 's25 going on. I mean I don't know what I'm  supposed2 
2 to do: cover up and destroy all of this  plaster3 work that may have lead paint on it that we  don't4 even know .5 I mean these are costs that  are6 just outrageous.7	MR . LUBELL :	In the areas, Mr .8 At hineos, where your buildings are located , are9 there many other buildings that are more than  a10 hundred years old?11 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:12 Sure . There are buildings that are wood- framed13 buildings that have probably been there  before14 the brownstones and they probably, you  know,15 encounter - -16 MR . LUBELL:	Brick buildings17 that are more than a hundred years  old.18 MR . CHRISTOPHER  ATHINEOS :19 Sure. Absolutely.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any21 additional questions?22 Yes, Mr. Zelnik.23 MR . ZELNIK :	Would you ever see24 yourself supporting a proposal where  the25 guidelines were differentiated,	let 's say between8 
2 smaller buildings  or older buildings versus3 larger buildings? Do you see a situat ion where4 that might make sense to  you?5	MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS:6 Well , for someone who owns a smaller building,  I7 guess it would make a little sense to  me.8 But  I don' t think necessarily	-9 -  it 's hard to differentiate.	I mean an eight -10 family brownstone will certainly benefit . But  if11 there' s - -  there are buildings  that are over a12 hundred years old that have more than, I don' t13 know, twenty apartments, because  I heard you14 throwing out that number of units. So, you  know,15 it just seems inequitable for those, you  know,16 owners of apartments.17 But I don' t know if the Board18 has any proposal that they' re thinking of. But  I19 am certainly open to ideas because I think   over20 the last , you know, many years, over thirty- four21 years, it's obvious that this system hasn' t22 worked, whether it be for owners or for   tenants.23 So I'm certainly open to  any,24 you know,  creative  suggestions .25 MR. ZELNIK:	So am I.6

CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS :	I21 think they started the law on deregulation in  '9322 or '94. I don' t remember.23 MR. PAGAN:	And the last year24 any of them?25 MR. CHRISTOPHER ATHINEOS :10

MILDRED ORTEGA:	As a11 tenant since 1995 in a rent stabilized  single12 room occupancy in the Royal York Hotel on  the13 Upper West Side, I strongly urge you to deny   any14 rent increases to my landlords, Hank Fried,  Urs15 Jakobs, Michael Ahren, Manuel Vargas and   Glenn16 Westerlind  of Royal Park Partners.17 For the past twenty- three years18 they have been getting rich by driving  tenants19 like myself out of our homes in order to  replace20 us with homel ess people for whom the City21 government  shells out $3000 every twenty- eight22 days for a single room or  apartment.23 In November, 2001, the Royal24 Park Partners signed a contract with HASA,  a25 division of New York Human  Resources10 
2 Administration,	to provide  emergency temporary3 housing. Since that time, they have made  $124 million by intentionally engaging in an  illegal5 campaign of harassment to force recent - stabilized6 tenants out of their homes.7	Building management' s crimes8 include:9 False arrest of tenants  and10 threatening  them with deportation;11 Promoting drug dealing,12 prostitution and fighting in the building  to13 create a dangerous atmosphere where tenants  have14 been robbed and threatened with  rape;15 Cutt ing off the gas - residents16 have been unable to cook since November  2001;17 Reducing the services as  a18 whole, including heat , hot wat er and elevator19 service, closing the laundry  room;20 Turning a blind eye to  rodent21 infestation and asbestos contamination  in the22 building.23 I implore you to freeze  these24 criminal  slumlords' rents.25 And for those who are  really8

ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Good20 morning, Chairman Markus and other Members of   the21 Board. For some of you, welcome to your   second22 year.23 I am Roberta Bernstein,24 President of the Small Property Owners of  New25 York. We have over a thousand members and  we13 
1	1092 typically own the small walkup buildings  in older3 neighborhoods. And we perhaps are most  impacted4 by the guidelines you will be passing this  week.5 You are going to be hearing  from6 many owners today about how diff icult it has7 become to run and operate our properties . The8 reason is that we've had huge increases  in9 insurance, gas, water rates, real estate  taxes10 and a lot of other things such as the lead  paint11 legislation, which are just chipping away at  our12 bottomline  leaving very little left over for13 regular good maintenance  and certainly nothing14 left over for capital  improvements.15 Now I don't believe your  formula16 adequately reflects water and gas heating  costs17 because they are a part of the utility  section.18 We have a 5.5 percent increase in our  water19 rates, but that translates to us to a much  higher20 percentage  than the formula yields, nor does it21 take into consideration the impossibly high  cost22 of lead abatement in this crazy law which  really23 doesn' t protect children any more than the prior24 law did.25 What is the owner supposed to  do2 
2 when - - here is a real example  - a building has   a3 bottomline cash flow of $20,000 a year? Wit hin4 the past two years the tax increases have gone   up5 $14,000 a year. This particular building on  the6 Upper East Side near Harlem, near that  border,7 has now sustained vacancies. So the rental   income8 is actually less.9 There' s almost no dollars left10 to operate safe, affordable  housing.11 Some of the Council people  that12 are going to or have been before you today  are13 going to ask for rent rollbacks or rent   freezes.14 But these are the very Council people who  voted15 for these tax increases to start  with.16 It would seem to us  they're17 trying to destroy a mom and pop  industry.18 I met with the Department of19 Finance to complain about the new assessments   and20 the rate hikes and so forth. And the  bottomline21 was,  they  said to me, well , why don' t you sell ,22 the property' s worth a lot more if you sell.23 But that would be missing  the24 point totally. We want to own our properties.   To25 sell is to give up our  dream.2 
2 You don' t ask tenants to move if3 their repairs aren't done or if the rents are  too4 high. The courts and HPD ensure that repairs  are5 done. This Board ensures that rents are  kept6 reasonable. But really no one is out there  to7 protect us .8	It is the tenant 's right to live9 in their homes in the same way that it is  our10 right to live and own our properties  without11 being squeezed out of business. We want to  pay12 our fair share, not more. We want tenants to  pay13 their fair share, not less.14 Seniors are protected by  SCRIE15 by the way.16 (Audience part icipation.)17 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Yes,18 they are.19 We are, therefore  - -20 (Audience participation.)21 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	We are,22 therefore, asking you for an increase on a  one-23 year increase of 7 to 8 percent and on a  two-24 year lease 10 to 12 percent .25 Thank you very much.9

I have  been14 living at  - - in an SRO over ten years . My15 landlord is known at the Batman because he  would16 go around hitting the tenants with a bat  and17 charging us extra money to cash our checks .18 We have been living  underneath19 awful conditions: no heat , no hot water, holes in20 the wall , rats, garbage  never  taken out .21 When I first moved in, my  rent22 was $215 and then I had to pay $400 . And then  in23 2000 with the rent increase, it went up to  $435 .24 After the landlord threw  the25 rest of the tenants into the street , which was12 
1	1132 illegal by lying and saying that Columbia  bought3 the building from him, that hasn' t stopped the4 landlord from demolishing the building without   a5 worker' s permit , which he has doing presently.6	I think he doesn' t deserve the7	rent increase no longer. That' s it.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any11 quest ions?12 Go ahead.13 This gentleman is an SRO  hotel14 tenant .15 MR.

2 the manager and the owner/operator of two  four-3 story walkups in the historical district  of4 Greenpoint.5	Most of the building owners  in6 my area have raised their children in  their7 buildings and will pass their buildings on  to8 their children, as I will.9 I tell you this so that you10 understand that not all landlords are  large11 faceless companies who just take from  our12 communities and sit back and wait for the rent   to13 roll in.14 In fact , we work hard, long15 hours, and we' re always on call. Our income16 varies by a variety of circumstances, most  of17 which we have no control. Unlike most  companies,18 we cannot set our prices to market but  are19 limited to what you, the Rent Guidelines  Board,20 agrees and allows us to  charge.21 However, our suppliers,  the22 plumbers,  the  electricians,  Con Ed , oil/gas23 suppliers have the ability to charge  whatever24 they feel is the going  rate.25 It seems a little unfair for  the6 
2 City to control only one side of the  equation.3 Let me give some examples of4 runaway costs which we are all faced  with.5	In 1997 our insurance costs for6 our building was $4,003. Our  2003 and	' 04 costs7 were $12 ,576 and we lost our lead, mold and now8 have pollution  exclusions.  This represents an9 increase of 293 percent.10 In 1996 our water costs were11 seventy- two eighty; by 2003 it was $11,831 or a12 152 percent.13 In 1997 our real estat e taxes14 were  $10 , 668; today they are over $23 , 092 or an15 increase of 216 percent.16 Our rent increases, if we  take17 them compounded over the years	'96 to 2002,18 assuming each tenant , which they all do, take  a19 two-year renewal, was ninet een  - -  it was a20 compounded rate of 19.24 percent. When  you21 compare this to our increases of 152 to  29322 percent , our predicament  is obvious.23 Please remember that owners  and24 managers of older buildings have tenancy which   is25 very stable with very little turnover and  that6 
2 five to twenty percent of our tenants are  rent3 controlled with rents of less than $250  per4 mont h.5	A VOICE:	No.6	MR. STEPHEN KAMZAR:	Most of us7 have the same tenants for many years and  we've8 developed relationships, and there is also  a9 tendency to round rent down and lower in  many10 circumstances.11 Today almost fifty percent of12 our tenants receive a preferential  rate.13 The landlord/tenant  relationship14 has changed tremendously over the last decade   in15 New York. It has become much less adversarial   and16 much more a working  relationship.17 We understand many of our  tenant18 problems and we always try to work out  an19 acceptable solution with them rather than  running20 to the courts or attorneys.21I'll just end by saying  I22implore youto consider our expenses and  our23predicamentand vote us an increase which  at24least is nolower than our cost  increases.25Thank you.
2CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Thank you .3Any questions?4(Audience part icipat ion. )5CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6James Lewis. Mr. Lewis?7MR. JAMES LEWIS:	I'm James8Lewis andI'ma tenant organizer with Take  Back9Harlem oftheWest Side SRO Law  Project.10And I'm also a rent  stabilized11 tenant  in Harlem.12 And in both my professional	and13 personal endeavors I come across all types  of14 housing:  SROs, hotels,  apartments,  project - based15 Section 8 housing. And what I find is is  that16 landlords for the most part are not  providing17 services to tenants that they deserve in  the18 first place.19 So an increase to me would  be20 ridiculous.21 Right now I have five  buildings22 without electricity. Two of the buildings   are23 going without electricity  for ·a month.24 I also have dealt with a25 landlord who not only didn' t provide services  to11 
2 the building, but brought a goon squad in  there3 and kicked in the doors of the apartments  and4 told them they had to get out. And we had to  have5 him arrested.6 Every day I deal with  tenants7 who are without heat , hot water or electricity,8 gas, have rats, roaches, the building is  falling9 apart . But yet landlords want increases.10 Now I understand that their11 prices of things have gone up. But what I  also12 understand is for the most part landlords do  not13 provide services when they have  increased14 expenses. What they do is they decrease  the15 services.16 And all you have to do is  just17 look at HPD records of violations that go on  in18 the City to determine that.19 And the other thing is  that20 landlords have an out. If landlords aren' t making21 money, they can go and get a hardship  increase22 and be able to get the monies that they need   in23 order to keep going.24 But I work for a non- prof it and25 I already have gotten a layoff service waiting  to2 
11202see ifwe are going to get putin the budget.If3I losemy job and I have to  goto McDonald' s,I4cannotapply to my landlord toget a decreasein5	my rent so I can stay in that  apartment.6	So I think, and especially since7 last year you gave the landlords an enormous8 increase, I think this year you need to  protect9 the tenants, save the tenants and not give  an10 increase. It should be  zero.11	And for a lot of these landlords12 there shouldn' t be an increase. They should be13 giving tenants money back.14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. JAMES LEWIS:	You know, I16 love New York City, was born and raised here.  And17 what 's happening slowly is New York City is18 becoming a place for the  rich.19 And I personally do not want  to20 have to leave New York. But if you  keep21 increasing the rents and I'm not  getting22 increases in my salary, I can't live in New  York23 City.24 And that 's the job we got to do.25 It 's about fairness. You know, somebody just  said12 
1	1212 you have a mandate to take care of the  landlords .3 You have a mandate to be fair. And fair is  no4 increases.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 (Audience participation. )7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any8 questions?9 (No response.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 Allison Crockett , J. Allison12 Crockett.13 MS. JAY CROCKETT:	My name is14 Jay Crockett . I own a 3 0- unit building  on the15 Southside of Williamsburg	in Brooklyn. I'll make16 this very brief .17 Last year I spoke before  the18 Rent Guidelines Board and watched many of  you,19 newly appointed to the task, struggle to  balance20 the needs of tenants with the needs of  owners.21 The rent increases granted  last22 year raised my entire rent roll by $4,132.00  a23 year. That comes out to an average  yearly24 increase of $137.76 per  apartment.25 My fuel bills in 2002 were8 
2	$19 , 698.00. In ' 03 , they jumped to $24,050 .3 That' s an increase of $4,351.00 a year.4 My fuel bills for the first  five5 months of this year already total $16,699.00,  an6 increase of $4,351.80. At these oil prices  my7 annual bill for 2004 would be $40,065.86 , an8 increase of $16,000 over last year. That 's9 $533 .85 per apartment.10 Compare that , please, to the11 rent increase of $137.76.12 And that , Board Members, is only13 fuel.14 The City demands that  owners15 provide to tenants an apartment which is   secure,16 clean and safe from the dangers of asbestos  and17 lead paint , and nice and warm on a wint er' s day.18 That may be very easy for  some19 landlords to do, but not in the Southside  of20 Williamsburg.21 Mr. Zelnik, you mentioned  a22 couple of times with other people who were   giving23 testimony, you brought up the idea of whether   for24 a small building the inequities there , and  there25 are huge inequities, it costs me the same  thing,3 
2 the same price, to heat a 3 0-unit building with3 very low rents in Williamsburg as it does to  a4 heat a 3 0- unit building that gets much, much5 higher rents elsewhere in the  City.6 I think it 's an excellent7 proposal to look into. But please don' t limit it8 to twenty apartments. In my neighborhood, and  my9 building is very typical , pre- war, most of them10 were built 70/80 years ago, six- story walkups,11 they're anywhere from twenty to seventy  units.12 Any questions?13 A VOICE:	Why did you buy?14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Questions?15 Sure. Mr . Zelnik.16 MR. ZELNIK:	I just want to17 clarify something.18 The twenty apartment target  was19 just hypothetical.20 MS. JAY CROCKETT :	Right. And I21 understand  that .22 MR. ZELNIK:	And the idea would23 be to look at different aspects of it , whether24 it 's that number or building type or age or25 whatever . But it was not specif ically meant to2 
2say that was the right  cutoff.3MS. JAY CROCKETT:I understood4that. I just panicked when I  heardthe number5twenty.6CHAIRMAN MARKUS:We' ll move it7up to twenty- one.8(Laughter.)9CHAIRMAN MARKUS:But there' s10 always going to be somebody panicky  because11 there' s always somebody over that limit.12 MS. JAY CROCKETT:	I understand13 that. It certainly  - -  I mean most  of my life I14 was a tenant and it was in rent  stabilized15 buildings.16 It 's not the tenants' fault that17 fuel bills have gone up so drast ically and that18 we have all the other  increases.19 But it 's not my fault either.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Pagan.21 (Audience participation. )22 MR. PAGAN:	Quick questions.23 Where' s the building located?24 MS. JAY CROCKETT:	373 South25 4th Street in Brooklyn, on the Southside.10 
2 MR. PAGAN:	And how long have3 you owned it?4	MS. JAY CROCKETT:	Six years.5	It will be six years in  September.6	A VOICE:	Why did you buy it?7	A VOICE:	What was your8	motivation  - -9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.10 MS. JAY CROCKETT:	I'm not11 answering your questions.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.13 Adriene , Ms. Holder .14 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.15 You said that you had  thirty16 units in your building?17 MS. JAY CROCKETT:	Yes.18 MS. HOLDER:	Are they all rent19 stabilized units?20 MS. JAY CROCKETT:	Three of21 them are rent controlled.22 MS. HOLDER:	And what 's the23 median rent?24 MS. JAY CROCKETT:	The medium 25	rent is $634. 00.10 
1	1262	MS. HOLDER:	And what 's your3	highest rent in the  building?4	MS. JAY CROCKETT:	For a5 renovated , two- bedroom,  $16,020. It is6 deregulated but I have never raised the  rent.7	MS. HOLDER:	$16 , 000?8		MS. JAY CROCKETT:	I'm sorry. 9	$1,620.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.11	MS. HOLDER:	What 's the lowest?12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. JAY CROCKETT:	I can't hear14 you.15 MS. HOLDER:	The lowest unit?16 MS. JAY CROCKETT:	Oh! Of a17 rent controlled , it's $122 for a one bedroom.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And what19 MS. HOLDER:	I'm sorry.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. Go21 ahead.2 2	MS. HOLDER:	And how many rent23 controlled units do you have?24 MS. JAY CROCKETT:	Three are25 rent controlled , one- tenth of the building.23 
2	MS. HOLDER:	Okay.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank4	you. We appreciate it.5	MS. HOLDER:	I'm sorry. One6	other question.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One other8	question.9	MS. HOLDER:	I'm sorry.10 Thanks, Ms. Crockett. I've  never11 seen you before so I'm just trying to get - -  some12 of the other owners we've met in previous  years.13 And then how many vacancies  do14 you have in your building?15 MS. JAY CROCKETT:	Zero.16 MS. HOLDER:	Zero vacancies.17 Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 (Audience participation. )20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Alfred Scott.21 MR. ALFRED SCOTT:	My name is22 Alfred Homer Patrick Scott. I'm named after   a23 king, a poet and a saint. I'm none of  these.24 Good morning,  landlords, good25 morning,  tenants, good morning, panelists.10 
2 I am a rent stabilized tenant  in3 Harl em. The last time that I had the privil ege of4 attending one of these meetings the remark  was5 made by a panelist	- it might have been the6 chairperson - that Mr. Terry Poe of the  Goddard7 Riverside SRO Law Center had mellowed. And   the8 response of Mr. Poe was that a sojourn in  a9 hospital  can do that.10 Though I do not wish the  same11 fate as that endured by Mr. Poe upon  the12 panelists, it is to be sincerely hoped that  they13 who possess the Sword of Damocles have   similarly14 mellowed.15 It is important that it be  borne16 in mind that the result of rent increases,  their17 impact , not only affects simply the pocket books18 of those who are compelled to dig deeper,  but19 impacts the school children and the  grandchildren20 who are dependents and who have to be fed  and21 clothed and all of the other expenses borne  by22 parents and grandparents in the raising  of23 offspring. School books being another  expense.24 Current and impending  increases25 in fuel and electricity costs are  certainly2 
2 factors to contend with. But these are  items3 which radiate in all directions equally  sparing4 none and enveloping all .5	Take a long - term view, take a6 note, I beg of you . The Czars did not know what7 was about to envelope them in 1917. It was   sudden8 and catastrophic.9 We must be more aware than  they10 were. Big brother is watching you now more  than11 ever before .12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 Mr. Petras, Nick Petras,15 followed by Liz Hernandez,  followed by James16 Peyton, followed by Anne  Cunningham.17 A VOICE :	You skipped three18 people.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Petras.20 MR. NICK PETRAS:	How are you21 doing? I'm Nick Petras, Jr. and I represent  my22 family' s interests .23 Among other things, we  have24 several hundred rent stabilized apartments,  about25 ninety percent of which are in Queens. I have   an6 
2 MBA in Finance from NYU down the street. ·3 My dad bought his first building4 in 1959, and I have been in charge of day- to- day5 operations of our real estate business  for  almost6 ten years.7	A VOICE:	Are you overcharging8	people?9	MR. NICK PETRAS:	No.10 I know many owners are going  to11 discuss and have been discussing  surging  costs12 for insurance, real estate taxes, energy  and13 water. All of these costs have great impact on   my14 business. All are increased expenses that   are15 easily, if not willingly, verifiable by  tenant16 advocat es. All should be considered in your17 deliberations.18 I know you have taken a lot  of19 testimony about it , but today I'm going to speak20 about the new lead paint law, a topic of  which21 I've given a lot of thought  to.22 This is a lead paint audit23 conduct ed in 2001, November,  in accordance with24 HUD guidelines for a 42- unit apartment building25 built  in 1927 in Astoria.	It was conducted by a10 
2 reputable lead paint audit and abatement  firm3 that has done work for, among others, The  New4 York Times.5 In accordance with HUD6 guidelines, thirty- one of the forty- two units in7 this building were tested with an XRF guide.  We8 found lead in thirteen of thirty- one units or9 about forty percent of the units. We didn't  find10 a lot of lead , however. Rather we found a wall11 here, a door there , a radiator in one apartment12 or another.13 This is typical , according to my14 lead consultant , who tells us that more than15 eighty- five percent of the walls he tests are16 lead free and more than ninety- five percent of17 the ceilings are.18 We also sampled the building19 built in 1952 and found no lead at  all.20 As you know, the inspect ion21 liability is significantly more stringent  than22 under the old law. My insurance broker is   finding23 it more difficult and expensive to find  liability24 coverage for lead paint. We also got a  nice25 letter from one of our carriers, GNY, about  the2 
2 new lead law. It didn't mention premium  increases3 or decreases however.4 So how am I going to respond  to5 this new lead law and why should you  be6 concerned?7	Well ,  thank goodness, we've8 never had a lead poisoning complaint in any  of9 our buildings. We knock on  wood.10 The law, nevert heless, imposes11 increased costs on me for testing, abatement  and12 administration.13 First , you should know that  in14 every pre- 1960 building with a child under  seven,15 the mere existence of a painted window sill  of16 unknown lead content is a Class C  Hazardous17 Violation. The mere existence of the paint ed18 window sill is a Class C Violat ion.19 I believe this was said  by20 Harold Schultz at the RSA chip lead paint   seminar21 last week. I think this means that I have to  test22 every apartment in a pre- '60 building with a kid23 in it. And that 's going to cost me about $200 a24 unit with my regular  consultant.25 I may have to have to add8 
2 another off ice worker to handle this at least in3 the beginning.4	Once I find lead paint in  such5 an apartment , I think I'm going to have to abate6 it all just to get the apartment exempted  from7 the presumption.	If I just have to replace a  door8 or window will , this is a several hundred dollar9 cost. If the apartment is chock full of lead,  and10 we found those too, it could be tens of  thousands11 of dollars  in temporary  - - added to  temporary12 relocation costs .13 Every vacant apartment under  the14 new law you have to have a dust clearance  test.15 That 's going to cost $150 a unit as well .16 I think we are actually going  to17 go further and make sure that each one of  these18 apartments is lead free completely too.  That19 again will cost anywhere from several hundred  to20 tens of thousands of  dollars.21 Finally,  that  1952 building -22 and I will wrap it up - it was tested  in23 accordance with HUD guidelines. I think we  tested24 forty- six of the ninety units. In order to get25 exempted under HPD' s new proposed  regulations, we5 
2 have to go back and retest every apartment   so3 that every surface in every apartment is  tested.4 And that 's going to be several hundred bucks  a5 unit.6 You folks just need to  know7 about that.8 Thank you.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 Any questions?11 (No response.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 (Audience participation. )14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Liz15 Hernandez.16 Liz Hernandez,  is she here?17 A VOICE:	She's here.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. I19 didn't see you. Come on down. We got  you.20 All right. Hold on a  second.21 Go ahead.22 MS. LIZ HERNANDEZ:	Thank you.23 Good afternoon. My name is  Liz24 Hernandez and I am a tenant organizer with  the25 West Side SRO Law Project , a non- profit10 
2 organization that offers legal advocacy  and3 organizing to SRO tenants on the West Side  of4 Manhattan and in Central  Harlem.5 Every year tenant  advocates6 from all over the City come to you  sharing7 different perspectives of the work that they  do8 and the tenants that they serve. And it is  my9 hope that after you hear my testimony and  my10 clients' test imony that you will vote for a zero11 percent increase .12 This year a lot of my work  has13 involved advocat ing for low- income workers that14 live in an Upper West Side SRO, an SRO that  the15 landlord has used a lot of aggressive tactics  to16 try to drive out tenants from this building  by17 not providing basic services like heat and  hot18 water, by turning off the only elevator in  the19 building for three months arguing that it  needed20 to be completely renovated , but turns it on21 quickly after we started a HP action. It  worked22 all the t ime.23 He has not provided heat and  hot24 water. He takes advantage of tenants that don' t25 speak English, that don' t have knowledge of their2 
1	1362 rights in order to empty the building out  and3 drive them out and harass  them.4 This landlord may not be5 representative of all landlords. He' s probably6 not representative of all SRO landlords. But   if7 you don' t decide  - -  if you decide  to award this8 landlord a rent increase , you'll be rewarding9 this type of landlord.10 Don't send a message that  you11 don' t care about affordable housing for low  to12 moderate  income tenants.13 (Audience part icipation.)14 MS. LIZ HERNANDEZ:	Do the15 right thing this year.16 Tenants depend on this housing17 because it' s affordable and they depend on you  to18 keep it that way. And I hope that you do  the19 right thing this year.20 Thank you.21 (Audience part icipation.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	James Peyton.23 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	Good24 afternoon to the Board and to all that are  in25 here.2 
2 A VOICE:	Louder.3 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	I'm a small4 landlord. And as we all know, taxes  have5 increased. Some of that taxation should be  passed6 on to the tenants.7	And, in fact , in a lot of cases8 with landlords such as myself we have to do   the9 work. All the work that 's done in my building10 basically	I do it. That includes plumbing.	I do11 it. If it weren' t for my abilities in this, I12 would not be able to keep the  building.13 For an example. Let me tell  you14 about going to court. Here is one tenant -  and15 this is for my wife and myself to live in  the16 building	- he has been in the building  for17 eighteen years. To get the apartment for my  wife18 and  I to live in - - he' s paying  $267.63. When I19 went to court to get him out , it cost me $500.  I20 had to pay him $5000.21 For eighteen years this man22 actually, if you figure it out , is paying  $11.5623 for eighteen years. That' s crazy.24 Now, I understand a lot  of25 people here have problems. But the problem is  not8 
2 the landlord' s problem. We cannot afford to  take3 care of people because they cannot pay  their4 rent. It 's impossible.5 (Audience participation.)6 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	The City is7 talking about building a stadium for millions   of8 dollars and they cannot put up buildings  for9 people of low income? It ' s sickening.  It 's10 sickening.11 (Audience participation.)12 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	Listen. We13 cannot do it.14 Excuse me. Excuse me.15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.17 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	I'm speaking18 to the Board.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Talk to us.20 (Audience participation. )21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma' am. Ma' am.22 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	The Board,23 ma' am, will make the decision, not you.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What number25 is she?7 
1	1392	MR. JAMES PEYTON:	Thank you .3	So when you look at this,  I4 cannot go to the store and say, look, I want   this5 bread and the cashier says, well , where' s your6 money.	"Well , I'm sorry, I don' t have enough. " I7 will wind up in jail if I do that .8 So they are going to come  here9 and say, oh, the landlords are this and  the10 landlords are that because they can't pay. That 's11 not the landlord' s fault. For God' s sake, we need12 to start being honest around  here.13 One gentleman was talking  about14 he cannot live in New York. There' s a lot of15 people migrating  to north, south and wherever16 because they cannot pay.17 Should I take care of peopl e18 like this - -19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Talk to us.20 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	- - because21 they cannot pay the rent? That 's - -  I mean  this22 is - - this is - - this is terrible when you   look23 at it .24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Wrap up,4 
2	please.3	MR. JAMES PEYTON:	But this is4	the case. This is the  case.5	A VOICE:	Why is he getting so6	much time?7	MR. JAMES PEYTON:	This is
89101112 to wrap up.
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.MR. JAMES PEYTON:	- -	the case.Now, here' s another case. CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No, you got
13 A VOICE:	Your time is up.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You got to15 wrap up.16 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	At least I17 hope you heard it.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank19 you.20 (Audience participat ion.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' ve got22 Anne Cunningham, we've got Ed Korman  following23 her, Harold Jones, and then Pilar  Downing.24 Do we have Anne Cunningham?25 Let 's go.12 
2	Go ahead. Go ahead.3	MS. ANNE CUNNINGHAM:	Okay.4 Good afternoon.5 I had brought the red  herring6 for everyone to read. And you have copies of  my7 testimony. Someone please give them to the  people8 on the Board.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' ll get it .10 Go ahead.11 Red herring for what?12 MS. ANNE CUNNINGHAM:	Red13 herring.14 Okay.15 My name is Anne Cunningham. I  am16 test ifying on behalf of the Tempo Hotel Tenants.17 The Tempo, formerly The Commander Hotel , is  one18 of the five remaining Class A hotels. Only a   few19 hundred rent - regulated tenants or less reside in20 all five hotels combined.21 Four of the five hotels - the22 Buckingham,  St.  James,  Tempo and Windenmere	-23 cater to the tourist trade , while The Cambridge24 is in the business of assisted living  residents.25 Each year the Rent  Guidelines10 
2 Board places Class A hotels in a  separate3 category and a separate vot e despit e the fact4 that with recent developments this stock  has5 severely depleted.6 Two hundred and seventeen  units7 existed at The Tempo. Sixteen units  were8 demol ished , without a Certif icate of Non-9 Harassment , ninety tenants remain.10 Evictions,  conversions, high-11 end rentals for the last year from $1500 a  month12 to $4500 a month,  followed by corporate and13 transient rentals from four agencies finalized   a14 red herring to convert the building  to15 condominium.16 My very  small two units  - - two17 rooms rather has an insider' s price exceeding18 $523 , 000. Part of this testimony, also as you19 were told earlier, includes a copy of the   red20 herring for the Board Members. And please   read21 the letters from the tenants. The letters  tell22 the true story of what we have  endured.23 To wrap this up, I  strongly24 recommend the establishment  of a Mayor' s25 Committ ee on Fairness in Housing that will2 
2 guarant ee no rent increases imposed on tenants3 who reside in buildings with a history  of4 discrimination, harassment , violations,	false5 self - certificat ions and owing the City money in6 fines and unpaid taxes.7 Why should they get an  increase?8 (Audience participation. )9	MS. ANNE CUNNINGHAM:	Until10 this Committee formulates and is effective,  the11 Rent Guidelines Board should vote zero   increases12 for all tenants citywide. We want the RGB also  to13 keep the proviso intact at seventy- five percent.14 Thank you once again for the15 pl easure of participation  in this process.16 (Audience participation. )17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 Mr. Korman.19 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	Good20 afternoon, Mr. Chairman and Members of the  Board.21 My name is Edward Korman.  I'm22 the Executive Vice President of the  Small23 Property Owners of New  York.24 Firstly, may I ask how the  Board25 Members measure  the Price Index of Operating10 
2 Costs?3 I don' t think that the Board is4 taking into account the small properties  with5 four to about twenty units which make up a  big6 majority of the New York City housing and   their7 locations, such as Bushwick, Ridgewood and  the8 South Bronx, all high- density areas that are9 being watched by insurance companies now and  that10 have more than six to eight people,  sometimes11 more, in a two- bedroom apartment.12 You say real estate taxes  went13 up only 16.5 percent. The actual was  18.514 percent . But did you take into account the15 escalation of the assessments of all  these16 properties?17 You said insurance went up  14.7.18 I have a six- family building	in Bushwick. A19 number of admitted companies  -  Greenwich,   Realm,20 UA, Interstate - all stopped writing in the   area.21 My broker had to insure me with a non- admitt ed22 company, American Safety Indemnity. I don' t  know23 if you ever heard of them, but I wish I  didn't24 because the premium went from $3267 to  $5300. 00.25 Your percent of increase I think is  inaccurate.2 
2 Ut ilities,	.8 percent increase;3 last year I paid Amerada Hess $.55 a therm  for4 gas plus the cost to Keyspan for delivery.   The5 price went to $1.22 per therm, is more  than6 double of what you people are  saying.7	Fuel costs, ut ilities, went down8 minus 2.8. #2 oil, which small properties  use,9 went from $1.30 to a high of $1.95 a gallon.   You10 must also take into account that oil heats   the11 hot wat er as well as heating the house. When  you12 have doubl e or more families in an apartment , I13 think you have to do some other math.14 If an owner has high costs,  the15 only way we can pass them on is through the   RGB.16 Services companies I'm sure received  similar17 amounts. They don' t have to respond to anybody.18 Electricians,	carpenters, plumbers, they don' t19 have any mercy on anybody. They have a New   York20 City license and we need  them.21 Housing Court , have you ever22 been there lately? If a tenant , one tenant out  of23 six or eight doesn' t pay rent , it is   devastating24 to an owner, especially when the judge gives   the25 tenant four to six months to pay up before you8 
2 can evict. And then, yes, the Orders to Show3 Cause. They can go on forever.4	Water Department , the DEP is5 instituting a new program instead of frontage.  It6 is the mult i - family conservation  program which7 will increase water costs in a six- family8 property from about $2100 to over $3000,  billed9 on a per unit basis if your property can  qualify.10 That 's over a forty- five percent	increase.11 If you can't qualify, you will12 be billed on meter. Here  comes the	'70s and	'80s13 again, folks, back to abandonment and  no14 affordabl e housing.15 The new lead law, the City16 Council didn't do their homework, but passed  a17 bill against better judgment and advice of   City18 agencies that know the present law is  quite19 effective.20 Have you any idea what this  will21 cost owners? If they have insurance, 14.7  percent22 is a dream. Another log  for the	'70s and	'80s.23 I know that most of the  Board24 Members are relatively new. And I hope that   you25 all do your homework. Otherwise within a  year5 
2 with all the above- mentioned high costs that I  am3 sure will continue to rise along with  the4 interest rates5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to6	wrap up.7	MR. ED KORMAN:	- - along with8 the interest rates and the laws that are  being9 passed against regulated housing, will there  be10 affordable housing?11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Harold Jones.14 Mr. Jones?15 A VOICE:	Why are you skipping16 members?17 Harold Jones?18 MR . HAROLD JONES:	Yes.19 Good afternoon.20 I want to thank the West Side21 SRO Law Project for inviting me here, who  has22 been responsible for many years cleaning up   the23 messes that your decisions here  make.24 I was going to read from a25 prepared statement but I think, having  listened12 
2 to tenants from both  - -  I mean speakers from  both3 sides, I'll just be brief and to the  point.4 You know, terror comes in many5 different  forms. Terrors come in many different6 forms. And I find it troubling that  this7 government  spends such vast resources tracking8 terrorism all around the world , yet we allow  this9 kind of thing to go on from the landlords   in10 regards to the buildings that they  own.11 (Audience participation. )12 MR. HAROLD JONES:	And for you,13 the Board Members, to allow them to be able  to14 achieve those goals by not quest ioning what  they15 do, not asking them to open their books  or16 anything. And, of course, for the  Bush17 Administrat ion anybody who aids a terrorist  or18 harbors a terrorist is no better than  the19 terrorist.20 (Audience participation .)21 MR. HAROLD JONES:	So I think22 that it should be a benef it to all of us if23 everybody could just be concerned about the   needs24 and welfare qf everybody, as opposed to  pandering25 and cowbuckling to anybody because they are   your2 
2 constituents or what ever you can line your3 pockets with.4 It would be bett er for us all if5 you could just be sincere in what you  do.6 If you are going to make  this7 meeting, make it that as opposed to making   it8 being a show, which it seems that it has  been9 this morning.10 So I would say to you that , on11 behalf of me being a rent - stabilized tenant in an12 SRO unit , and I've been there for thirteen  years,13 the landlord that I have has no intention to   come14 here, couldn' t care less about what goes on here.15 But she's able to benefit  from the decision that16 you make.17 Has no intentions of  doing18 nothing because she has done nothing over  the19 last five or six years that we've dealt with  her.20 And thanks to the Law  Project21 which represented us, we've been successful in so22 many endeavors that we've had in regards to   her.2 3	So be considerat e, you know, of24 us all as opposed to just taking the one side   -25 not all of you, and those of you know who  I'm
