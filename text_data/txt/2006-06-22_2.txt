2 the application.	Every year when they're taking3 the property, the property, I have them fill out4 an application which gives me their job history5 details, their income, et cetera.6 These are very good paying jobs.7 NBA, CBS, Viacom.	The information is in front of8 you.	I copied it for the entire board to see,9 okay.10 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Would you11 propose some sort of needs' test on the tenants?12 MS. KIM MORTIMER:	Pardon?13 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Would you14 propose some sort of needs test for tenants where15 they pay a certain amount of their income for16 rent.	In these cases if they make over a certain17 amount and the rent is below a certain level?18 (Audience participation.)19 MS. KIM MORTIMER:	I'm, sorry, can20 you just - - I have to think about that question21 because it's not - - nine tenants we're talking22 about, I mean my building might be the exception,23 okay - - so.24 (Audience participation.)25 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Let's assume2 
2 it's not.	Let' s assume it's not and you have a3 certain number of tenants that are paying a4 fraction of their income for rent.5 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Excuse me, it is6 private.7 MS. KIM MORTIMER:	It is private,8 that is correct.9	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.10 MS KIM MORTIMER:	Yes.	I mean if11 they can - - if the tenant can afford the increase12 then, yes by all means the landlord should be13 compensated.	If they cannot then, you know, if14 they cannot they have to remain.	And I don' t15 have a problem with that.16 What I have a problem is when they17 make more than the building actually generates in18 income, I have a serious problem with that.19 And then my family has to be forced20 to sell it because we might not have the money.21 They thought I had the money to inject it to the22 property.	Because it's been in my family for23 over 40 years and my grandmother paid or played24 an integral part of making that community on the25 Upper West Side .10 
2 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And the last3 time you had a vacancy was?4 MS. KIMBERLY MORTIMER:	Pardon?5 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	The last time6	you had a vacancy in the building.7 MS. KIM MORTIMER:	Last time - -8 well, some apartments have been	with these9 particular flats that I have tenants who have10 been there for over twenty years and make decent11 incomes .	They have been there for over 20 years.12 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.13 MS . KIM MORTIMER:	Yes, they're14 like 40 years old, 35 years old.15 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	When was your16 last vacancy?17 MS. KIM MORTIMER:	It depends on the18 flats.	It depends on the flat.	Last vacancy19 would have been maybe two and a half years ago,20 three years ago.21 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And the22 vacancy before that because you seem to be23 struggling with the vacancies, it's such a long24 time.25 MS. KIM MORTIMER:	Yeah, because9 
2 nobody leaves.	I mean nobody wants to leave a3 flat that' s paying less than $500 per month for4 rent.5 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	We have one6 question from Ms. Adams.7 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Excuse me.8 Are all of the units rent9 stabilized?10 MS. KIM MORTIMER:	All of units are11 rent stabilized.	That's true.	We're having a12 problem with one that should have been13 destabilized but that' s something completely14 different.	It has not been under DHCR records.15 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And when your - -16 prior to you corning in to your management of the17 building a year and a half ago, who managed the18 building?19 MS. KIM MORTIMER:	My grandmother.20 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And she did it by21 herself?22 MS. KIM MORTIMER:	That is correct.2 3	And my mother - -24 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And during the25 years they applied every increase, applicable24 
2	increase for renewals?3	MS. KIMBERLY MORTIMER:	Yes, that4	is correct.5	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	All right. Thank6	you.7	MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	The next speaker8 is Cassandra Dooley;9 Followed by Charles Ogunrinde;10 And then City Councilman Dominic11 Recchia.12 A VOICE:	Recchia.13 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Recchia.	I'm14 sorry.15 MR. CASSANDRA DOOLEY:	Good16 afternoon.17 My name is Cassandra Dooley and I18 reside at 69 West 71st Street in Manhattan.19 A VOICE:	We can't hear you.20 MS. CASSANDRA DOOLEY:	You can't21 hear me.	Is this better?22 We are gathered here today to23 discuss the issue of rent increases for rent24 stabilized and rent controlled apartments as well25 as SROs.8 
2 What I'm about to tell you is3 extremely pertinent and I'm honored to speak with4 you at this event.5 The building where I live is6 attached, an attached brownstone to three other7 buildings and they are classified as SROs.8 I resided there for 27 years during9 which time I had the same landlord.10 Now that the owner has passed away11 problems with the new management have ensured.12 As it happens, on December 28 of '05 the same13 date as the closing of the sale of these14 buildings, the suspicious behavior by the new15 management began.16 It started with the disappearing of17 the trash for all the buildings.	When I18 discovered this strange occurrence, I19 simultaneously noticed a woman in a basement20 apartment going through all our bags of trash21 with plastic gloves and sorting them.	Later I22 learned she worked for the new landlord.23 Then this past January the true24 harassment began at full speed.	I received a25 phone call from the new management company who2 
2	pointedly asked me, what are you planning on3	doing?	This caught me off guard.	I told them I4 answered by saying about what?	His reply was5 about leaving the building.6 Dumbfounded, I assured him that7 after 27 years of residing there I had no such8 plans.	From then on I was besieged by innerving9 phone calls including one offering me $5,000 to10 move out and saying I would be very sorry if I11 did not take the money.12 This offer was followed by an13 eviction notice stating that I did not live at 6914 West 71st Street but rather I lived at 84th and15 Horatio Street which happens to be my sister and16 her husband' s address for an apartment that they17 have had for 30 years.18 How my landlord discovered that19 address I have no clue.	Perhaps the fine tooth20 combing of the garbage in December helped them.21 Meanwhile, other tenants received22 eviction notices.	Who did they target, the23 elderly and the infirmed.24 Now, in my efforts to procure legal25 consultation, one attorney had confirmed my4 
1	1582 fears.	Upon hearing my landlord' s identity this3 lawyer explained, oh, no, not him.4 My question today is why should5 landlords who exhibit this behavior be rewarded6 with rent increases and furthermore, why should7 tenants like myself be saddled with legal fees to8 protect my housing rights.9 Now that I am forced to retain a10 lawyer, I, too, have an unnecessary financial11	hardship - -12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap13 up.14 MS. CASSANDRA DOOLEY:	taking15 the money away that I would be using for my16 health insurance for my legal fees.17 As you know, the majority of tenants18 in the SROs buildings are in fixed and limited19 incomes.	They are among the least	they are20 the most vulnerable and least able21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to22 wrap up.2 3	MR. CASSANDRA DOOLEY:	I want to24 ask the Board why should we	condone this type of25 behavior with a rent increase?24 
1	1592	(Audience participation.)3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 Charles Ogunrinde.5 Welcome back.6 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	My name is7 Charles Ogunrinde.8 VOICES:	We can't hear you.9 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	Can you hear10 me?	Yeah.	My name is Charles Ogunrinde.11 What I want to do is I'm allowed to12 ask the RGB some questions?13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' re allowed14 to ask them.	I'm not sure we' re going to answer15 them.16 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	Yeah, okay.17 I want know	I going to - - you18 have to	you going have to make a decision of19 whether there's going to be a rent increase or20 decrease.	I want to know what standard of21 reference you're going to base your increase.22 You know, because of there - - okay, there are23 about one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,24 eight, nine, ten.	How you going to base your25 thinking on the same style of reference?ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC. , 212- 840- 1167
2	That' s my question.	I mean3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have two4 more minutes.5 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	Okay.	My6 point is	my point is - - the point I'm trying7 to raise is there' s only one standard of8 reference that you should base your thinking on.9 And that should be based on the health of the10 tenant, the health.	The health of every tenant11 and the health of the City, you know, the health12 - - yeah, the health of tenant so - - because if13 you don't have your health, if you don't have14 your health, nothing matters, you can't do15 anything.	You can't achieve anything.	So your16 health is very important.17 So - - because without your health - -18 yeah, without your health you can't pay the rent,19 you can't pay the rent.	And if there' s some - -20 because you can pay the rent.21 And an rent increase is an abuse to22 the body because if you increase the rent it's23 going to abuse the body and you're going to have24 health problems.	And if you abuse the body you25 can't - - you can't get	I mean you can't get4 
2	good job.	There' s no way to get good job.3	There 's no way you can	a tenant rent increase4 to you can't afford to educate yourself.	You5 need to go to school.6 With the rent increase you can't,7 you know, you can't do anything right.	You can't8 - - you can't have a decent health insurance, you9 know.	And without - - without - - with higher rent10 increase you can't afford to have a decent life.11 So - - so I advise the Board to think12 about help other people.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I have a16 question.17 I have a question.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	A question,19 sir.20 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you for21 your testimony today.	I appreciate you coming22 out.23 To the extent that you feel24 comfortable answering, do you live in an SRO?25 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	Yes.4 
2 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	How long have in3 you lived in the SRO?4 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	It's now5 going to be six months.6 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Six months?7 In your building, are there a lot of8 permanent tenants, SRO tenants?9 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	Yes.10 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Are there any11 units that are being using for transients or12 tourists or students?13 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	Yes.14 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	What percentage15 of the building, do you know?	How many units are16 in the building?17 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	How many18 units?	I didn't count, but few permanent tenants19 in there .20 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Few permanent21 tenants?	Okay .	Do you know how much the22 apartments that are rented to the transients or23 the students, the people, the tourists? Do you24 know how much the units go for?25 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	How much2 
2 money?	Well, yes, like I pay 215 a week.	Two3 fifteen dollars a week.4	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And how much do5	they charge the tourist?6	MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	My room is7	very small, very - -8 A VOICE:	$70 a night.9 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	$70 a night,10 thank you.11 You said your room is small.12 Describe your room for me, please.13 MR . CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	It's a small14 room, but it's dirty.	You know, they don't pick15 up the trash and, you know, they don't pick up16 the trash.	They don't clean, they don't every17 day cleaning.18 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Do you have any19 services that come with that?20 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	And they21 tried FOR me to leave.	They don't want me to be22 there.2 3	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	What do they24 say?25 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE :	They want to24 
2	kill me, you know, if I don't leave.3 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	All right.4 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	I called the5	Police many times.6	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Do you have any7 services for renting there?	Do they provide for8 like any type of linen or any type of services?9 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	Well, they10 did the water the first time I got in.	After11 that I don't see no cleaning.12 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Okay.	Thank13 you.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 Mr. Schleider.16 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chairman.17 You said you moved six months ago?18 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	Yes,19 January.20 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	You moved in21 six months ago so your SRO is accepting permanent22 tenants.23 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	Yes, but he24 tell me legally so he can't put me back.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	They evicted him7 
2	first and then - -3	MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	He tell me4	illegally in March, in February - -5	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And how long6 had you been living there before that?7 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	Hah?8 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	How long had9 you been living there before?10 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	I got there11 in January, right.	And he tell me like in March12 and he - -13 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	So you moved14 in first in January?15 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	Yes.16 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	You hadn't17 lived there before January.18 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	No.19 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	So they did20 accept you in as a permanent tenant in January.21 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE:	Because the22 judge put me back2 3	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	I understand.24 You win.25 MR. CHARLES OGUNRINDE: Yes .24 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank3 you.4 (Applause.)5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	City Council6 Member Dominic Recchia.7 (Applause.)8 COUNCILMEMBER RECCHIA:	Good9 afternoon.10	I'd like to take this opportunity11	to - -12 VOICES:	Louder, please.13 COUNCILMEMBER RECCHIA:	Okay. Here14	we go.15 I'd like to take this opportunity to16 just bring to the attention that it's time that17 we give tenants a break.	And it's time that - -18 (Audience participation.)19 COUNCILMEMBER RECCHIA:	It is time20 that we have to say this year let's not raise the21 rents.22 I represent a very large senior23 population in Brighton Beach, Coney Island,2 4	Bensonhurst.	And let me just tell YOU that I25	understand that landlords own the buildings, they
2	have a right to make profit, no one is saying3	that.	But there comes a point in time when you4	have to say what about the people living there.5 Buildings are being sold today.6 They're making nice profits.	The new landlords7 that are coming in are cutting services.8	Buildings that used to have security9 guards no longer have security guards, they have10 cameras.	Buildings that want of the services11 that they have that they were supposed to have12 and they had for many, many years, 20 or 30 years13 are now being depleted.14 Tenants have a right to have their15 rent not go up, especially the seniors.	I am an16 advocate for the seniors because they cannot17 afford it.	And the middle class are leaving the18 City because they can't afford the rents.19 We are throwing them out.	There's20 no place for them to live.21 Middle class families can hardy live2 2	in Manhattan.	Then they move to Brooklyn and you23 keep on raising the rents.	It has to stop.	We24 have to tell the tenants, enough is enough, we're25 going to help you.23 
2	You know what, don't give them a3	raise	don' t raise their rent this year.	Let' s4 give them a break, a break for the seniors, a5 break for all the tenants and then we can come6 back next year reexamine this.	But it's time to7 give them a break.	Every year we have increases.8 Thank you very much.9 (Audience participation.)10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.11	DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Question.12 One of the things that has been13 raised throughout our deliberation is the number14 of rent stabilized apartments which have15 violations against them, 50, 100, sometimes16 more.	We are, of course, unable to separate the17 good landlords from the those that are not good.18 And we also do not have the power to enforce, as19 some other departments do.20 Where is the City Council on that?21 COUNCILMEMBER RECCHIA:	Well, the22 City Council is very in favor of making the23 fines.	And then we're working on increasing the24 violations and the fines for these violations.25 Because that's the biggest problem here, the
2	landlord says no big deal to get a violation, so3	what.	Okay. The penalties have to increased and4 - - if they know that the penalty is going to be5 increased, you're going to see how quick it's6 going to happen.7 You know, a few years ago the City8	Council passed the New Lead bill.	And because9 of our bill, twenty percent less children today10 have lead poisoning because of what the City11 Council did.12 (Applause.)13 COUNCILMEMBER RECCHIA:	And that' s14 why the landlords were against it.	But, you know15 what, twenty percent less children have lead16 poisoning.	And so we want to work - - we are not17 an enemy in the City Council to the landlords.18 We want to work with them, but19 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	The argument that20 we had, or discussions that we had about21 lead-based paint is how much it cost to put your22 requirement in place, that's fine.	But what we23 have heard time and time again is a problem with24 infestation by insects, hot having heat, not25 having water, that sort of thing.	And those are9 
2	the apartments that are "bad landlords" that have3	numerous violations against them.	We would have4 to increase or decrease their rent just like5 everybody else.6 Can we look for some relief?7	COUNCILMEMBER RECCHIA:	Yes.8 Listen, you have my support, anything I can do,9 my office is here.10 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	But I understand11 your support, which is welcome, but in terms of12 some actual enforcement of those requirements and13 penalties, can we expect any relief any time14 soon?15 COUNCILMEMBER RECCHIA:	The City16 Council has a number of bills that we' re working17 on with the administration on this.18 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Thank you very19 much.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 (Applause.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker23 is Alix Shearer;24 Followed by Max Cohen;25 Followed by Jimmy Silber.
2	Alix Shearer, Alex, are you here?3 (No response.)4 VOICES:	What number are you on?5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on.	Let me6 read the rules here, okay, just so you7 understand.8 People needed to preregister.9 Those that preregistered are called in the order10 of preregistration.11 To the extent12 VOICES:	What number?13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'll tell you the14 number when I'm done.15 To extent that you missed your16 number, then you have to go to the end of the17 line.	However, if your number is 70 and you show18 up early, you still have to go after the people19 that are preregistered for you.20 Anybody who' s in the room who21 preregister needs to check in behind in the back.22 So make sure you check in.23 The number right now for an owner is24 speaker 34.	For a tenant it's speaker 37.25 That' s Mr. Cohen is speaker 37, okay.6 
2	So that' s it.3	Alix Shearer .4 MS. ALIX SHEARER:	Yes.	I own a5 small residential building in Brooklyn with eight6 units.	We have a rent roll - -7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Speak louder.8 MS. ALIX SHEARER:	Can you hear me?9 The building I bought two and a half10 years ago.	And half of the buildings are rent11 stabilized.	And the two lowest rents in the12 building are $550 a month.	And the next level is13 $980 a month.14 So for the $550 a month, a rent15 increase of three percent is $200 per year.	And16 for the $980 per month is $450 per year, and the17 rent increase of three percent.18 From 2004 to 2005 my fuel bill has19 increased by almost fifty percent.	My real20 estate taxes by more than twenty.	And for the21 next year, 2006 it's going to be fourteen percent22 from the assessment sheet.23 I have computer and I heard the24 impact of fuel and real estate taxes increase25 together from 2004 to 2005 is about $200 per4 
2	apartment.3	A VOICE:	Before taxes or after?4 MS. ALIX SHEARER:	Before taxes.5 I have also a computer that the6 impact of the increase of my total expenses on7 each unit from 2004 to 2005 is $2,769 on an8 average basis taking the total expenses divided9 by eight.10 Of this, only 331 can be linked to11 painting, repairs.	I had to renovate two12 apartments and one is a very long process.	It's13 all the permits and so on with the architect so14 it was vacant for quite a while.15 So I just want to give another16 figure.17 The average total cost per apartment18 in 2005 was over $10,000 including mortgage, the19 payment and interest of the mortgage and20 insurance and real estate taxes.21 So it's going - - doesn't make a lot22 of sense.	Fortunately the other free market23 apartments paid for the other rates.	So what I24 want to say is that I realize you there are all25 kinds of different buildings and tenants and4 
 2 owners and different cases, but today the3 incentive to the owner is to sell and cash out.4 I was supposed to get to this market early, but5 my best incentive today is to sell and cash out6 because I do realize if, after while, you know,7 I'm - - if things are going and prices increase as8 they do, I won' t be able to maintain the building9 and I will to sell it to another owner.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 Thank you.12 Max Cohen, Mr. Cohen.13 I'm going to make an announcement.14 It's a quarter to one right now.	We' re going to15 have a slight recess at 1:00 to give the16 stenographer and others a breather.	That recess 17	will be from 1:00 to 1:15, 1:00 to 1:15.18 Hold on a second, Mr. Cohen.19 Max Cohen;20 Followed by Jimmy Silber;21 Followed by Tito Nandi.22 Mr. Cohen.23 MR. MAX COHEN:	I'm a tenant from24 Brooklyn.	And I lived in my apartment for about25 approximately forty years before I left the18 
2 Bronx.	So I'm a total native New Yorker.3 And I'd like to say first that this4 panel is an elite panel, it's a privilege, it's5	an honor to be on your panel.	And you have a6 responsibility to everyone, but you're here to7 protect people, not just to vote on increases,8 but to protect people.	And it is the same9 concept that our forefathers had in mind when10 they created this county, was to protect people11 and property.12 Now we are on a time where things13 are tough.	We have a shortage of housing for14 people who need affordable housing, and we have15 an energy crisis.16 In about a few days, Hillary Clinton17 will be at an expo and I believe about June 26th18 she will be the key speaker about energy, because19 energy is just as important as our apartment20 crisis is.21 What are we going to do when the22 energy keeps rising?	We have a pretty good idea23 that natural resources are diminishing not only24 diminishing, but other countries are causing the25 rise of energy.	When it goes to $100 a barrel6 
2 you can imagine what the rent increases are going3 to proposed in this town.4 We don' t have a mecca here in New5 York City for renewable energy, we have it6 started in other countries.	We have various7 programs, even offshore created for energy by8 wind tunnels started in Belgium.	We don't have9 this kind of concept here.	We don't necessarily10 have to have one form of energy, we can have many11 forms of energy.12 But there seems to be an13 indifference.	However, the Mayor and Pataki has14 made statements on this.	You already know some15 things about what he' s proposing to do.16 Nevertheless, the position of your panel cannot17 resolve all the problems for everybody.	And it18 may be out of your hands.19 And what I propose is that this20 panel recommends to the Mayor and the City, just21 as well as other states across this country, take22 a more serious stance about energy.	And maybe23 even starting a center, an actual center just24 like a financial center in the City, a mecca for25 energy.2 
2	We have a shoreline which can be3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap4 up.5 MR. MAX COHEN:	which can be6 utilized by other states as well.	It's not just7 one group of buildings I'm taking about.8 I thank you very much.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you. Thank10 you.11 (Applause.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Silber.13 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Good afternoon.14 I'm Jimmy Silber.	I'm the Vice15 Present of SPONY, the Small Property Owners of16 New York.17 I represent owners that are the18 backbone of providing housing in this City.19 They're owners who, by and large live in their20 own buildings.	They get along very well with21 their tenants and they provide safe and22 violation- free and adequate housing for their23 tenants.24 There is great harmony between the25 tenants and the owners of small buildings.	And4 
2 these are the owners that we need to encourage to3 stay in the business of providing housing4 because when they disappear, the buildings are5 lost from the rental system.6 And when we look at the rates that7 this Board has set since you were created back in8 2002 with Mayor Bloomberg, you look at some9 glaring changes in the way this has Board10 operated as compared to boards before you.11 And there' s also been a correlation12 between the Price Business Index and the rate for13 one year increase that this Board has set.14 It may vary by two points, three15 points, but it has - - it has always been a16 correlation and there' s always been an effort by17 this Board to compensate owners for their cost as18 measured by the staff of the Rent Guidelines19 Board.20 And just for example, I pulled some21 numbers.	In the last four years, just looking at22 what the government takes from owners in the form23 of taxes, real estate taxes and water and sewer24 taxes, just those two components of the Price25 Index, the average of the four years was 9.72 
2 percent for real estate taxes over four years and3 5.1 percent for water and sewer taxes over four4 years.5 And what has the Board given to6 owners over those four years, an average of 3.27 percent.	Now, how can that be?	How can we8 expect people to operate their buildings when the9 government is itself talking more than the agency10 created by the Government to compensate us has11 given us less.	It can't work.12 Look at the Price Index in the four13 years since this Board has been in existence.14 The Price Index has averaged seven percent.15 What has the Rent Guidelines Board average rate16 been, 3.2 percent.	What is the core rate been,17 six percent.	Taking out the volatility of fuel,18 six percent, but has this Board given as an19 average rate for four years, 3.2 percent.20 There' s no logic to what this Board is doing.21 There' s a rational relationship between the22 numbers that the staff comes out with and what23 this Board is issuing as a one year lease.24 And this year it is significantly25 for all of the commensurate rent adjustments, the2 
2 four different categories of commensurate rent3 adjustment, the lowest is 5.0 percent and the4	high is 8.0 percent.	You can't go lower than5	staff is telling the commensurate rent - -6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You have to wrap7	up.8	MR. JIMMY SILBER:	I just want you9 to remember when you don't adequately reimburse10 small owners just for the taxes and the water and11 sewer, then you are sending a message to them12 that there's no hope and that you should try to13 sell.	If the market's good, sell and get of the14 business.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	And maybe17 you've lost rental housing.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, Mr.19 Cohen .2 0	Any questions?	We have some21 questions .22 Mr. Schleider.2 3	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for24 your testimony.	As always, it's inciteful and25 cogent.24 
2	Is there something3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Not cogent.4 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER :	Yes, it's5 cogent. It's cogent.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.7	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Is there8 something in the PIOC or items on the PIOC that9 you mentioned in your testimony, are there items10 that should be included that impact your11 operation' s ability that aren' t included?12 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	Well, you know,13 the PIOC is used as an indicator and it leaves14 out a tremendous amount of expenses that owners15 experience.	There are replacement cost for16 something like a sidewalk .	If your sidewalk17 cracks and you've got to replace it because your18 insurance company won 't give you a policy for the19 following year.	That' s not included in the Price20 Index .	That' s not a major capital improvement .21 There are items like loss of rent22 when the tenants moves out of an apartment and23 you've got to spend two months getting ready to24 paint it and to rehabilitate it.	Loss of rent is25 not included in the Price Index.8 
2 There are many costs for an owner3 that are not picked up on the present, but the4 thing is you use the Price Index, it's not5 perfect, but we use it.	And we've used it since6 1980.	And, you know, there' s always been a7 correlation even though it's not perfect and it8 leaves out and it understates, everybody agrees9 is understates what it really cost to run a10 building.	And that' s even more reason why there11 has to be a close correlation between the Price12 Index and what the rates are. And this board has13 varied from that policy.14 You're setting a whole new set of15 standards when you vary so greatly from what the16 staff of this Board produces as evidence of when17 are costs go up.18 (Audience participation .)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 Mr. Nandi, Tito Nandi;21 Follow by Vivian Rifflemacher.22 And then we're going to go to a23 break.24 Mr. Nandi.25 MR . TITO NANDI:	Hi .	Good2 
2 afternoon.	My name is Tito Nandi.	I live at 2443 West 99th street and that's an SRO building.	And4 I'm living over there from 1987.5 And my landlord - -6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Can you talk into7	the mike.8	MR. TITO NANDI:	And my landlord9 does not deserve rent increase because of the10 poor and unhealthy condition of our building.11 My bathroom is dark and so dark,12 kitchen also dark.	And there is "no smoking"13 sign in the bathroom and the kitchen and the14 hallway and people are smoking.	And at least15 once in a month our elevator broken and broken16 down for more than one or two days.17 And I already talk many times with18 our landlord and he always say, okay, okay, I19 will take care of it, take care, so this now I20 don't talk with him.21 And other landlord - - landlord doing22 this renting also illegally.	Rooms are so23 small, hundred square feet, 120 square feet.	Now24 he rented those rooms for four people, four25 people, you don't believe and they are living9 
2 like - - I mean - - yes.	So - - and already he3 accept cash because they don' t - - most people4 they don't have bank account so you cannot prove5 those so - - but I know and if you go there anyone6 you can see how do they live.	There so bad7 condition you just don't believe it.	It looks8 like some third-world country.	And he has the9 toilet unlocked.10 Before 2000 there was another11 landlord that was not so bad but now he' s so bad12 so I don't know what to say.13 That' s all.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I have a16 question.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.19 Adriene.20 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	How much do you21 pay for your room?22 MR. TITO NANDI:	Okay.	I am paying23 now almost $300 per month because I living there24 from '87.	But who they are coming now, landlord25 taking from each of them, 100, 120, 115 per8 
2 month.	So one room 100 square feet, 120 square3 feet so	and we have those two buildings about4 220 rooms.	Every floor sixteen room for 16 room.5 We have three bathroom and one kitchen.	And6 inside kitchen I know there is a room when I came7 there in '87, refrigerator, but not in six years8 no refrigerator and that' s so bad.9	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	So let me make10 sure I understand this.11 You said that you pay $300 per12 month - -13 MR. TITO NANDI:	Almost, yes.14 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	But you said for15 the people who are coming in now they're charging16 you said 150 per month or per week?17 MR. TITO NANDI:	No.	Per week each18 people, but there is no fee because few of them19 they charge 120, few of them he charge - - I mean20 that' s his way.	I don't know which way is that21 because every year they go back and forth and he22 change his own price and all cash.23 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And of the 22024 rooms you said there are several buildings,25 there' s about 220 units or rooms, 220 rooms.10 
2	MR . TITO NANDI:	220 rooms .3	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Do you know how4 many of those rooms are going to students and5 tourists?6	MR. TITO NANDI:	That I don 't know.7DIRECTORHOLDER:Arethere a lot8of permanent residentslike you?9	MR. TITO NANDI:	Yes.	And also10 there are children also.	And before that they11 told us for our building children cannot stay .12 All those small rooms they're children .	Their13 age from one year to age nine, ten years to14 eleven years, all kinds of children over there15 and with bad condition.16 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	So you said that17 each floor has about 60 units?18 MR. TITO NANDI:	No.	16, one/six.19 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Oh, 16, 1620 units, three bathrooms, one kitchen.21 MR. TITO NANDI:	Right.22 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And in the23 kitchen you don't have a refrigerator anymore.2 4	MR. TITO NANDI:	No .25	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Do you get any
2	other services?3	MR. TITO NANDI:	Yeah, there are4 cleaners but there's they don't clean very well5 because one guy is not possible so many - - so I6 tell them so what I can, I cannot work whole day7 and get money so.8	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Okay, thank you.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 (Applause.)11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Vivian12 Rifflemacher and then we're going to go to a13 break.14 It will be approximately 15 minutes15 from when Vivian finishes.16 Go ahead.17 MS. VIVIAN RIFFLEMACHER:	Hi.	Good18 morning, good afternoon.19 I live at the Dexter Houses that's20 an SRO on West 86th Street .21 Okay.	I've live there for about ten22 years.	It's a single room occupancy building and23 it's been there since 1943.24 I move there ten years after I had25 to leave a share, a sublease share.	It ended12 
2	abruptly.	An elder wanted to move back into this3	condo I think.	And we had to4 A VOICE:	Speak loud.5 MS. VIVIAN RIFFLEMACHER:	We have6 to find another place to live quickly.	And so7 it's the only place I could afford to live8 independently.	And I had a couple of cats.	And9 it was the only place I could afford to live on10 my own with the cats and, you know, just be here11 to continue my life.12 I have a pretty nice job.	I work at13 - - I do administrative work at a hospital.14 Basically everything was okay for a while.	In15 May 2004, a new owner took over the building and16 began running it illegally as a hotel and a youth17 hostel.	And began, they came in basically with18 an agenda to empty the building.19 They started evicting people,20 harassing people.	There were a lot of frivolous21 suits being brought to Housing Court.	People22 were being falsely accused of not paying their23 rent, falsely accused of subleasing their rooms24 when they're not.	People being beaten up.25 Front door being left open at all hours.	Someone4 
2 just got their - - their door kicked in.	There' s3 terrible harassment.	Someone just - - he was4 beaten up.	His neck is broken.	He was facing5 surgery and possible paralysis.6 As I said, we're not protected, and7 we' re probably not protected by the 70s that we8 had five percent of the rezone.	We' re hovering9 at a level right now with tenants.	We may have10 we're down to about I think 68 percent of11 genuine tenants.12 No one in the building has been13 registered with DHCR since 2003.	The landlord14 has not registered anyone with DHCR since - - for15 the past what, three years.16 If you want - - we know what the17 proviso, that we can overturn the proviso so that18 we wouldn' t - - we would get a rent increase in19 spite of all these things.	Can you - - we want20 the - - can a proviso be strengthened?	Can it be21 brought up to 90 tenancy?	We want landlords to22 be made to register tenants with DHCR, it23 requires to did this, all of them.	People that24 live in the building.25 Our landlord' s a millionaire.	He2 
2 owns lots of properties around here.	He's not3 suffering.	In a terrible way we're in the same4 situation as the small property owners and we're5 just the flip side of the same situation .6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you . Thank7 you.8 (Audience participation.)9	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I have a10 question .11 (Applause.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma' am, question,13 question.14 MS. VIVIAN RIFFLEMACHER :	Yes.15 Sorry.16 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	That' s okay.17 Thank you for your testimony.18 If you don't mind, can you tell us19 how much you pay for your room.20 MS. VIVIAN RIFFLEMACHER:	Yes.	I 21	pay $442.75.22	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Monthly?2 3	MS. VIVIAN RIFFLEMACHER:	Yes, that24 monthly.25 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And you said24 
2 you've been a tenant there for ten years.3 MS. VIVIAN RIFFLEMACHER:	Yeah.4 The room' s approximately ten by5 thirteen.6 A VOICE:	And she doesn' t have a7 bathroom.8	MS. VIVIAN RIFFLEMACHER:	That's9 right, I share a bathroom.	And there' s no10 kitchen facility.11 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chairman.12 MS. VIVIAN RIFFLEMACHER:	I share13 the bath with three other people.	Unfortunately14 my - - one of my neighbors recently died.	She was15 very old and another person vacated so rooms are16 now being warehoused.	And we don't know what' s17 going to happen to them but I assume they' ll be18 rented.19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.21 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I'm sorry.22 Thank you.23 How many units in your building?24	MS. VIVIAN RIFFLEMACHER:	There' s25	about 260, that' s including - - there's like a - -
2 there' s an apartment on the ground floor that's3 counted as a unit so it's 260 units.4	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And you said 685 percent of those have permanent tenants.6 MS. VIVIAN RIFFLEMACHER:	Yeah,7 yeah.	The landlord has planted some people in8 the building.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma'am.11 MS. VIVIAN RIFFLEMACHER:	There are12 tenants throughout the buildings that are not13 real tenants that are planted by the landlords.14 They work for the management.	Their purpose is15 sort of to participate in harassment.	It's16 complicated.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You are covered18 by the proviso.	You are covered by the proviso19 because it's more than 25 percent of a hotel20 makes you covered.	I mean they use the transient21 hotels, it's not the other way around.22 MS. VIVIAN RIFFLEMACHER:	We've23 heard that the provision is being - - they're24 trying to have it taken away.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What you've5 
2 heard in the past, the proviso has covered you at3 these percentages.4 MS. VIVIAN RIFFLEMACHER:	Yes.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay . I6 understand.7 Any other questions?8	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Yes, I do have9	some more questions.10 Okay.	So with those units or those11 rooms that are being rented out to students or to12 tourists, what do those rooms go for?13 MS. VIVIAN RIFFLEMACHER:	Let's see,14 the youth hostel rooms it's about $30 a night per15 bed per person .	So you have like eight beds in16 one room, you know, do the math .17 The hotel rooms go up to about like18 120 a night, it varies, $80 to 120 a night.	Some19 of the rooms are very small so that range.20 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And what services21 do you get?22 MS. VIVIAN RIFFLEMACHER :	Well, we23 were supposed to have, this is interesting, we24 were supposed to have switch board service and25 cleaning service .	At one time we had linen10 
2 service that was way - - that's long gone .	And3 the rooms cleaned, being cleaned, I mean most of4 the tenants don't care about anymore about having5 the rooms cleaned for the linen service.	I6 certainly don't .	But the common areas used to7 regularly cleaned.	It's not cleaned anymore .8	We used to have - - the telephones  9 the switchboards	the telephone lines were cut10 by the new landlord so no one could call .	There11 were elderly people, they can't afford phones,12 they don't have phones and the switchboard was13 their only way to communicate with the outside14 world.15 Some lady that her lines were cut16 and the switchboard, you know, couldn' t give a17 damn .	They - - some of these people couldn 't even18 call out for an emergency.	If they fell down in19 their room they couldn't even call 911.	I mean20 the woman who died in my room next to me, I don't21 know what happened to her .	She was found on the22 floor.		She could have - - I don't know.	She was 2 3	down on the floor.	I don't know what happened to 2 4	her .	If she had a phone she could have called25	somebody .
2	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	So you're saying3 - - I just want to make sure I'm clear.	You said4 that people don't care about having the linen or5 the cleaning services but you're saying you also6 don't have linen or cleaning service, right?7	MS. VIVIAN RIFFLEMACHER:	No, no.8 We do care about the common areas being kept9 clean, yeah.	And we care - - you know, all our10 people were hurt by the switchboard.	I mean it11 doesn't matter to me.	I have a telephone and so12 I'm all right.	I know a lot of people who are13 hurt very badly by the switchboard being cut off14 and I'd like that to be restored.15 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you so16 much for your testimony.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 (Applause.)19 MS. VIVIAN RIFFLEMACHER:	You're20 welcome.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It's now 1:10.22 We' ll be back at 1:20.23 Let me read the people who will be24 testifying, the first three:25 Elizabeth Ronis;
2 Walter Gambin;3 Tina Berte.4 Those are the first three people at 5	1:25 .6 Thank you.7 (At 1:25 p.m. the hearing was8 temporarily recessed.)9 (At 1:35 p.m. the hearing was10 resumed.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right. We' re12 ready to get started now .13 Elizabeth Ronis, first;14 Followed by Walter Gambin;15 Followed by Tina Berte;16 Are you ready, Elizabeth?17 MS. ELIZABETH RONIS:	Yes.18 Does this work?	Yes.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead .20 MS. ELIZABETH RONIS:	I'm the owner21 of a small building - -22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Shhh, quiet.23 MS. ELIZABETH RONIS:	I'm the owner24 of a small building.	And I live in my building.25 The building is very beautiful and I take great6 
2 pride in maintaining it.3 I want to let you know that costs4 have risen astronomically in the past two years.5 In 2004 taxes and water came to 33,000;6 In 2005 the combined number was7	41,000;8 For 2006 assessed taxes are  45,000.9 It's a 36 percent increase in two years;10 Utilities, which were 6,900 in  200411 were 8,000 in 2005 and were 5156 for the  six12 months of 2006.	That' s a 51 percent increase if13 you analyze it all;14 Insurance costs, which were 6,361 in15	2003 became 7,300 in 2004.	7,500 in 2005 and are16 now 7,524 for ten months.	So circa 8,700 for the17 year.18 This does not include another $90019 for a separate flood insurance.	That' s a 3620 percent increase.21 In addition, sprinkler inspection,22 which was required annually is $150 and is now23 required monthly.	Twelve times $150, another24	$1,800 .25	Repair costs have risen;
2 Hardware costs have increased and3 building maintenance costs have increased.	In4 the meantime, rents have increased 3.5 percent5 and 2.75 percent.6 I have tenants who have been there7 for thirty years.	Several buildings on my block8 have returned to single occupancy, there used to9 five .	In the last two years this has increased10 to ten.11 No one wants to run a rent12 stabilized building, it's not only unprofitable13 but the amount of forms, regulations and14 requirements is constantly increasing and is15 unmanageable.16 I have had to borrow to pay my taxes17 and my insurance this year and I've had to take18 money out of personal savings.	I cannot sustain19 this.	If my building cannot be self-supported,20 I will have to sell.	And if I sell my building21 to the only people who want it, single owner22 occupancy, they will convert it into single23 occupancy and six more tenants will lose their24 apartment.25 So rather than maintaining2 
2 affordable housing, it is being decreased in this3 way.4 I am on a landmark block .	I had5 I want to change my windows.	I'm required to6 replace windows not to what they were when I7 brought the building, but to 1935 .	Then the8 front windows were rounded .	There are ten such9 windows .	Each window costs $4,000.	This is ten10 times 4,000, $40,000, plus the amount for the11 other tenant' s windows which are about three to12 $400 a piece.13 I haven' t got the money to do this14 so the windows remain as they are .	As I said,15 this is not maintaining affordable housing.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where' s your17 building?18 MS. ELIZABETH RONIS:	88th Street19 off of Central Park West .	I'm getting $800, $90020 month.	You can't get apartments like that in21 Brooklyn.	Not do denigrate Brooklyn, but it's22 just a matter of - -23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 (Audience participation .)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Walter Gambin .2 
2 MR. WALTER GAMBIN:	Walter Gambin.3 I've lived in a Class A Section 2484 SRO residence, the Dexter House at West 86th5 Street Manhattan since 1978.	My landlord is6 renting to transients, mostly tourists, firstly7 in violation of both the SRO Law Code and the8 zoning codes.	And secondly, making more money9 from such rents than from legal tenants.10 He's also warehousing rooms.	All of11 this means to me that he does not deserve, he12 does not need an increase.	It's my rent.13 Now, speaking about a large City14 landlord with large buildings, I don' t really15 think I should be referring to many of the16 smaller building owners.	I don't think that17 should - - maybe, but just in general.18 We used to have a phone system in19 the house so we could call other rooms.	We could20 also call to the outside for a charge.	The21 landlord has taken this away, except for the22 hotel guests.23 The bathrooms are not cleaned nearly24 as often as they were before the current25 management came.	The management staff gives us2 
1	2012 unfriendly, unwelcoming attitudes.	As I see it,3 they want us to leave so they can change the4 character of the building to make big profits.5 Now, about my own personal6 situation.	The Social Security Administration7 has determined that I am disabled because of a8 serious heart condition so I receive SSI and food9 stamps benefits currently. A rent increase would10 not be easy for me.11 Now, I'd like to say a few things of12 my own views about the tenant/landlord situation13 in my own, sometimes simple language.14 I ask what's a matter with these15 landlords?	With all the money they own, they16 still trouble and harass many of their fellow17 citizens who are tenants and have much less so18 that these landlords can gain still more dollars19 for themselves.20 Now I say, it is sickness. It is21 anti- social behavior.	It goes against living in22 harmony with their brothers and sisters.	I say23 it is addiction and there should be24 rehabilitation programs set up for landlords.25 (Audience participation.)2 
2 MR. WALTER GAMBIN:	And really,3 not every last one, yes, there are some good4 landlords, even among the wealthy, but I think5 for the majority these are the landlords set up6 rehabilitation programs for landlords would7 appear to me to be unwilling or unable to realize8 fully the hurt they do to people.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10	(Audience participation.)11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Tina Berte;12 Richard Jimenez, Jimenez;13 Maria Arlia.14 That' s the order.15 Tina Berte, are you here?16 MS. TINA BERTE:	Good afternoon.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The mike.	The18 mike .	The microphone .19 MS. TINA BERTE:	I'm an owner of a20 small building.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to talk22 louder .23 MS. TINA BERTE:	I'm an owner of a24 small building.	I'm trying to maintain it, but25 it is very hard with the way taxes have gone up .12 
1	2032 Taxes have gone up in the last five years by3 forty percent.4	Fuel has gone crazy.	I mean I had5 one month this winter I paid over two thousand6 dollars for five units.	And it probably - - it7 doesn' t even, in the winter months, cover the8 cost.	And we get actually nothing in tax - - in9 subsidizing our rent increases whereas,10 everything as has gone up so terribly that real11 landlords can't really do it.12CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where' s your13building?14MS. ELIZABETH BERTE:	35 Charles15in the WestVillage.16CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	35 Charles?17MS. ELIZABETH BERTE:	Yes.18CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Any19questions?20Yes, question.21DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Yes, I have a22question.23How many units do you have?24MS. ELIZABETH BERTE:	Five units.25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma' am, use the
2 microphone .3 Five units was the answer.4	MS. ELIZABETH BERTE:	Five units.5 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And they're6 still rent stabilized?7 MS. ELIZABETH BERTE:	Yes.	One is8 rent control.9	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	So four rent10 stabilized rent units and one rent control  unit?11 MS. ELIZABETH BERTE:	Yes .12 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And what' s your13 monthly rent roll?14 MS. ELIZABETH BERTE:	3,000 - - 15	monthly, $3,000.16 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And much are your17 expenses?18 MS. ELIZABETH BERTE:	My expenses19 in a month, well, as I said, my taxes are $13,00020 for a year .	My insurance is over - - my insurance21 this year was 3,268 plus another insurance which22 is about 400.	It's about 3,700 in insurance23 only, a year.24 Water bills have increased .	My25 water bills are about five - - $1,549 .	And these16 
1	2052 tenants are living there, I'd said 35 years.3 They won't move.	Why should they. I try to keep4 a good building for them, clean and everything.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do you live in the6 building too?7 MS. ELIZABETH BERTE:	No, but my8 cousin does.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.10 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.12 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	So13 realistically you're making about $10,000 a year14 on this?15 MS. ELIZABETH BERTE:	To be honest16 with you, last year I made $2,000 on the17 building.18 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Two thousand19 on the building.20 MS. ELIZABETH BERTE:	My expenses21 were 38,000.	Excuse me, my expenses were 36,00022 and the income was 38.23 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And if one24 tenant missed a payment that would have hurt you25 significantly.12 
2	MS . ELIZABETH BERTE :	Excuse me?3	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER :	I said if one4 tenant would have missed a payment, that would5 have hurt you financially.6	MS . ELIZABETH BERTE:	Sure , of7	course .8	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER :	And you9	maintain the building well?10	MS . ELIZABETH BERTE:	Yes, I do.11	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .12 MS . ELIZABETH BERTE :	I don 't13 think my tenants would stay for 35 years if they14 weren' t treated well .15 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Even at $600 a16 month.17 MS . ELIZABETH BERTE :	Hah?18 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER :	Even at $600 a19 month in the West Village.20 MS .

ELIZABETH BERTE:	Yes, it is.10 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And how much is11 your building worth?12 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER: What difference13 does that make?14 MS. ELIZABETH BERTE:	I don't know,15 I didn't put it up for sale.16 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Okay.	Thank17 you.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 Richard Jimenez, Jimenez, are you20 here?21 Thank you.22 Followed by Marla Arlia;23 Followed by Vicki Labowski.24 MR. RICHARD JIMENEZ:	Good morning,25 ladies and gentlemen.10 
2 I live at 216 West lO Oth Street.	My3 room is All.	And they only tell me have I has to4 from room because I own it a lot of money and I5 have no money.	And I mentioned - - he and he want6 to throw me out.	He scratch my bones with this7 security, this is a criminal stuff.	The police8	have the record and the doctor too.9	An they making construction, you10	know, they don't have a no professional11	employees.	They don't have a no super.	And they12 making - - in my room they making three rooms, a13 new bedrooms.	They making too make bedrooms they14 might be 300 rooms.	And they try to15 construction without permits or license.	And16 they don't have any insurance.	They don't pay17 Social Security to employees, you understand.18 And they take all the services from19 the ninth floors.	They have already, now they20 have the same service that they used - - that they21 don't do nothing.	And Icome here to tell you22 to help you.23 Thank you.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 (Audience participation.)12 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sorry.	It's3 Maria Arlia not Marla, right?4 Maria Arlia;5	Followed by Vicki Labowski.	Hold on6	one second.7 And Cynthia Nebel, I think it is.8 Go ahead.	In the mic.9 MS. MARIA ARLIA:	I am a part owner10	of apartments11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The mike12 MS. MARIA ARLIA:	I'm a part owner13 of a property located at 68 West 69th Street.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You've got to15 project.16 A VOICE:	Can't hear you.17 MS. MARIA ARLIA:	The property is18 located on 69th Street, West 69th Street.	And it19 has thirteen units.	The other owners are my20 mother and my sister.21 And the reason that I'm telling you22 that is because it's a family business.23 My father owned the building prior24 to his death.	And a lot people thought that we25 had inherited a windfall when he passed away.12 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to talk3 louder.4 MS. MARIA ARLIA:	Anyway, my5 sister and I work at this part time and none of6 actually live in the building because we can't7 afford to because the rent - - we need the rent to8 pay the bills.9 Just as an example, electric and gas10	in 2004 was $11,909.	In 2005 it was $14,212.11 That' s a 19 percent increase.12 Similarly, for real estate taxes, in13	2004 they were 49,000.	In 2005 it was 53,000,14 that' s also a'9 percent increase.	We have to15 maintain the building and we lost a lot of income16 due to making regular repairs such as for the17 plumbing.18 In 2004 plumbing had a good year.19 We paid 2,700 to repair plumbing.	2005 we had a20 bad year, $11,600 to repair plumbing.	That' s21 over an 380 percent increase.22 At the same time we needed to23 renovate an apartment because the previous24 occupant had been living there for over 35 years.25 And it was a single room, this building actually14 
2 is mixed use.	It has class A apartments and3 class B rooms.	So we needed to convert it to a4 class A apartment.	And that renovation cost over5 $70,000.	And it takes over three years to6 recover any of that cost.	And at the same time7 we are not even breaking even.8 And then additionally, the New York9 State Fire Department recently require that10 everybody install the new sprinklers and do float11 tests monthly which is in addition to the regular12 annual sprinkler test.	And for this I have to13 pay 1350 just to install the additional14 sprinklers, as well as adding to my monthly15 maintenance costs.16 In addition to that, we have tenants17 who just refuse to pay his rent simply on the18 principle that we have enough money so why do we19 need to care about his rent.20 So we ended up spending over $120021 in legal fees just to get him to pay his rent22 and we didn't even recover the rent that he had23 not already paid.24 So I don't know how people can25 possibly expect landlords to maintain the2 
2 building properly, let alone provide any3 services.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 Any questions?6 Thank you.7 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Just how many8	units?9	MS. MARIA ARLIA:	There are thirteen10 units.11 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	And they're all12 stabilized?13 MS. MARIA ARLIA:	Not all of them.14 Three.	Three are not.15 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Thank you.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You said West17 69th?	Between what and what?18 MS. MARIA ARLIA:	Yes.19 I'm sorry?20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Between what two21 avenues?22 MS. MARIA ARLIA:	It's between23 Columbus and Central Park West.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank25 you.10 
2	Vicki Labowski;3 Cynthia Nebel;4 Followed by Chris Carroll.5 MS. VICKI LABOWSKI:	Hi.6 It seems to me like the small7 building owner is victimized as much as we are8 so I just want to say that.9 I sympathize with the small building10 owner and I sympathize with us.11 My name is - - my name is Vaishali12 Vickie Labosky.	I am proud to be a tenant of the13 The Dexter House, an SRO located at 345 West 86th14 Street between West End Avenue and Riverside15 Drive.16 Last week The Dexter House was17 covered on Channel 11, Channel 4 and Channel 2 TV18 News.19 I have lived in New York City for 2520 years.	I have lived in the Dexter Houses for 1521 years since 1991.22 I came here as a young dancer and23 now I am a Yoga and Chi Gung teacher.24 The present management of the Dexter25 House took over in May of 2004 and immediately5 
2 began turning the building into an illegal youth3 hostel, jamming rooms with two to six bunk beds4 and renting them at for $30 per bed, per night,5 breaking the Multiple Dwelling Law by6 overcrowding a room legally designated for two7 people, maximum.8 Last year I know there was a group9 of about eight Egyptian me staying in a youth10 hostel room in the 14A wing on mattresses the11 management merely threw down on the floor.12 That's eight times $30, eight people13 times $30 a night for this.	$240 per night and I14 think they stayed for five or six nights.	And in15 fact, we, The Dexter House Tenants Association,16 found out that only one of them had to present a17 passport at the front desk.18 And all of these people - - and19 that' s a Homeland Security threat.	All of these20 people are allowed to roam the building in all21 hours of the day and night partying and making a22 mess.23 In fact, the front door of the24 building is never locked anymore.	There are 26125 units in the Dexter House.2 
2 In May 2004, the new management took3 over under the direction of Jay Wartski, a very4 notorious and life long slumlord.5 So in May of 2004 there were 316 hotel rooms and now only two years later the Jay7 Wartski and Robert Goicochea Management now have8 control of about 83 of the 261 units.	That's 529 more units gone from regular tenants in two years10 through their illegal activities.11 The hotel rooms now rent for between12 $85 and $110 a night.	And are rented for from13 one day to many days.14 This City of New York's Corporation15 Counsel is in the process of suing the Dexter16 House Management and owners, but they keep boldly17 and blatantly just keep going on evicting18 frivolously the two cases, trumped-up charges19 against tenants, a lot of tenants.	And it's all20 harassment.21 And what makes it right?	What makes22 it okay?	Okay.	Last Thursday night there was a23 task force meeting, a town hall meeting of the24 task force on illegal hotels and illegal use in25 residential buildings.
2 Every time I go to a meeting like3 this I run into people who are yoga students of4 mine or other people I know who tell me this is5 now happening in their buildings.6 At that meeting a lady came up to me7 who lives in the building on West 70th Street8 that houses Cafe Mozart and that was a regular9 apartment building, and she said her landlord is10 renting apartments for 300 per night as hotel11 rooms.12 But this is about the Dexter House .13 So no, SRO landlords do not need any rent14 increase.	Zero rent increase.15 According to the SRO Law Project - -16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I need you to17 wrap up.18 MS. VICKI LABOWSKI:	All right.	I19 will.20 According to the SRO Law Project21 there are absolutely no SROs that are renting to22 regular tenants anymore.	And we know that all of23 them are renting to tourists.	You don't see any24 SRO landlords here to testify, it would be too25 incriminating and too ludicrous.2 
1	2172 I'm almost done.3 The demographic of people living in4 SRO housing has changed.	We are regular working5 people and we all educated.	We need affordable6 housing.	We are crucial to the livelihood of New7 York City and we know it.	We won't be squeezed8 out.	We won' t be forced out and won't be9 harassed out by trumped-up, made-up reasons for10 eviction case by the Dexter House Management.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 MS. VICKI LABOWSKI:	And I want to13 say one more thing.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.15 You're cheating	you're stealing16 from the other people, aren't you?17 MS. VICKI LABOWSKI:	No, I'm not,18 I'm helping them all.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No, no, you're20 not.21 MS. VICKI LABOWSKI:	I would like to22 say one more thing.2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You're done,24 you're done. You're done.25 MS. VICKI LABOWSKI:	You - -
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You're not being3 fair to the other people.	Goodbye.	Thank you.4 Thank you.	We appreciate your sentiment.5 There other people here. You cannot6 dominate here.7 The next person.8 Cynthia Nebel.9	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I have a10 question.	I have a question.11 Thank you for your testimony.12 Tell me how an increase would impact13 upon the folks in your building.14 MS. VICKI LABOWSKI:	If - - if you15 give a rent increase, you are unwittingly16 participating in the unlawful effort of the17 Dexter House Management to force us out of our18 long time homes.19 When we calculate how much money20 they' re making on the 83 youth hostel hotel21 rooms, they' re making more than three million a22 year.	So they don't need it, they don't care.23 And we are having a hard time getting by.24 And we're regular working class25 people, including school teachers, including10 
1	2192 lawyers including - - we're not lower income,3 we're middle.	We're paying 50 to 60 percent of4 our income in rent and we' re living in small5 rooms.	And we're happy because we have a place6 to live and we're not complaining, but we are7 complaining about this problem.8 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	How much do you9 pay?10 MS. VICKI LABOWSKI:	I pay 1200 a11 month.12 DIRECTOR HOLDER: And that' s for a13 room?14 The Dexter House - - I was the15 President of the Dexter House Tenants Association16 in 2004 and '5.	So in November of 2004 they17 started an eviction case against me, as well as18 many, many other people.	So I'm not allowed to19 talk anymore about my situation in the Dexter20 House because my attorneys told me not to.21 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	How much do some22 of your neighbors pay who are currently tenants23 there?24 MS. VICKI LABOWSKI:	Between25 what I know of and we know a lot because we have2 
2	a lot of statistics, between about 450 and 700.3 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	A month?4 MS. VICKI LABOWSKI:	A month.5 These are small rooms.	Most of them are under6 120 square feet. Most of them share a bathrooms7 with three to four other tenants.	Some have8 sinks in them, some don' t.	None of them have9 kitchens.10 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	What other11 services do you get at Dexter House?12 MS. VICKI LABOWSKI:	Well, they13 used to clean the bathrooms in the areas where14 people shared a bathroom, but they clean them15 sometimes now and sometimes they don't.16 We used to have house phones but we17 don't have them anymore because the management18 cut them off.	We applied for the DHCR to get19 them back but nothing' s been done yet two years20 later.21 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you.22 MS. VICKI LABOWSKI:	Thank you.2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question. We have24 more questions.25 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	You mentioned24 
1	2212 that you were paying $1200 a month.	Is this for3 a room or more than a room?4	MS. VICKI LABOWSKI:	It's for my5 room in the Dexter House.6 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	And the unit that78	MS. VICKI LABOWSKI:	I'm not allowed9	to talk.10	DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Okay .11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 MS. VICKI LABOWSKI:	Thank you.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Cynthia Nebel,15 is that right?16 Hold on one second.17 Go ahead.	You can come to the mike.18 Cris Carroll is next after Cynthia.19 And then Jose Jorge is after Chris20 Carroll.21 Go ahead.22 MS. CYNTHIA NEBEL:	Good23 afternoon.24 I'm speaking on behalf of my mom25 who' s the owner of a six-unit building.12 
2 In late 1998 the price of crude oil3 was $10 a barrel.	Last month the price of crude4 oil hit an all time high of $74.38 a barrel.5 Yesterday, the price of crude oil6 closed at $70.33 a barrel.	That is a 700 percent7 increase, 700 percent.	To put this kind of8 increase in perspective, imagine if a tenant's9 rent increased by the same percentage as crude10 oil.11 For example, if a tenant who was12 paying 500 a month in 1998, had his rent13 increased by the same percentage as the rise in14 the price of crude oil, that tenant would be15 paying $3,500 today.	That shows you just how16 dramatic the percentage increase in crude oil17 really is.18 The rise in the price of crude oil19 has been nothing short of horrific.	Economists20 tell us that if the price of a commodity rises,21 consumers will reduce consumption.	We have seen22 that happen.23 People stop driving to work and take24 public transaction.	Homeowners lower their25 thermostats and wear heavy sweaters.	However, an2 
2 owner of a multi- family dwelling can't reduce3 consumption by lowering the thermostat to 624 degrees.	From October 1st through May 31st5 building owners are required by law to maintain a6 minimum temperature of 68 degrees in every room7 and every apartment between the hours of 6 and 108 p .m . when the outside temperature falls below 55.9 Neither do building owners get any10 respite during the summer months for they have to11 burn fuel to maintain the legally required12 minimum hot water temperature of 120 degrees .13 On one hand we can't reduce14 consumption, yet on the other hand the small15 increases that the Board has allowed in the past16 few years prohibited building owners from17 recovering part of their increased costs.18 How can one compare the 700 percent19 rise in the price of crude oil with the increases20 that the Board has allowed for the past eight21 years.	There is no comparison.22 A perfect economic storm is brewing.23 The spectacular rise in fuel oil prices along24 with the rise in property taxes and assessments,25 the increase in the water bill and rising2 
1	2242 insurance rates, are forces that are converging3 to create the perfect economic storm.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap5	up6 MS. CYNTHIA NEBEL:	To create the7 perfect economic storm that threatens to wipe out8 small owners.9 Thank you.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11	(Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Chris Carrol.13 Chris Carroll, are you coming?	Is that you?14 Are you Mr. Carroll.15 Hold on one second, let me just - -16 Jose Jorge;17 Followed by Harry Atkinson.18 Mr. Carroll, go ahead.19 MR. CHRIS CARROLL:	I spoke here20 last year.	I live at Dexter House which is being21 illegally converted to a tourist hotel and youth22 hostel by Jay Wartski, the notorious SRO23 slumlord.24 Illegal tourists rentals in my25 building earn Wartski more than one million12 
2 dollars a year in illegal profits.3 Since last year conditions in my4	building have dramatically deteriorated.	Last5 November 4, 2005, at approximately 12:15 p.m. , my6 life was threatened by building manager Robert7 Goicochea, as I attempted to observe an8 inspection by DOB inspector Peebles, of an9 illegal hotel room in my section of my floor,10 section "6A".11 Building Manager Goicochea said to12 me, go ahead, stick your head in the room, I'll13 slam the door on your head.	He meant to crush my14 skull between the door and the door jam.15 A couple of months later this same16 Goicochea assaulted my friend Bobby, a tenant on17 the 16th floor, seriously injuring his neck and18 spinal cord.	My friend is suing Goicochea for19 personal injury and human rights abuse.20 The climate of fear created by21 Wartski and Goicochea in my building is so22 intense that an increasing number of tenants are23 leaving or seriously considering leaving.24 The brutal harassment tactics which25 Wartski has been practicing and perfecting for5 
2 more than thirty years in dozens of buildings are3 working very well and are being continued to this4 very hour.5 This City Corporation Counsel' s case6 against Dexter Management has been dragging for7 more than a year, but still not one single direct8 action to stop Wartski has been taken by the9 City.10 And what is happening at Dexter11 House is taking place in most, if not all, the12 SRO buildings throughout the entire City.13 I've been told that the Chairperson14 of this Board has declared his intention to give15 SRO landlords a rent increase this year.	I have16 a message for him, how dare you.17 This Board years ago should have18 imposed a rent freeze for all SRO tenants, a19 permanent rent freeze, until after the SRO20 building in this City is brought into complete21 compliance with the law.22 Instead you have granted raises to23 these law-breaking landlords, who, as I have24 said, are the vast majority of SRO owners.25 I challenge this Board to find one2 
2 SRO in this City which is run completely3 according to law.4 SRO tenants are among the poorest5 residents in our City.	Many are on Welfare or6 disability.	Many are retired and living on7 Social Security alone.	But SRO owners throughout8 the City have contempt for these tenants and for9 all of there tenants, for one simple reason:10 Their rent is comparatively low.11 SRO owners can make a decent profit12 for managing their buildings according to law,13 but their greed is stupefyingly without bounds14 and they have been driving helpless people out of15 their homes for decades.16 These people cannot afford lawyers17 and are mostly ignorant of their rights. They are18 the most defenseless, exploited people in the19 City and yet, you continue to grant rent20 increases to their exploiters, the criminal21 landlords.22 I am outraged.	Last year I said a23 rent increase would be a travesty of justice. Now24 I say simply, "It is obscene. "25 I do not ask you, I demand a rent2 
2 freeze for all SRO tenants.	You are accountable3 for your actions and we SRO tenants will hold you4	accountable.	If you grant a rent increase this5 year, you should be overthrown.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thanks .7 (Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jose Jorge.9 Thank you.10 A VOICE :	Excuse me .11 What number are you up to for12 tenants?13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Fifty.14 MR. JOSE JORGE:	Good afternoon.15 My name Jose Jorge.16 A VOICE :	We can't hear you .17 MR . JOSE JORGE:	My name is Jose18 Jorge.	I am an SRO tenant. I live in the Midway19 Hotel on 216 West 100 Street.	At 216 West lOOth.20 I came here today to testify against21 any rent increase.	The reason is that my hotel22 is - - is being converted into apartment and23 luxury hotel and studio .	And my landlord only24 rent out to tourists .25 And the point is that all the10 
2 services that I have, I have a telephone station,3 linen, cleaning, all this gone.	I have filed4	several complaint to different City agencies.	It5 doesn't work.	The City agency don't care.	You6 apply for this.	The only way you count the7 wealthy landlord is follow the rent not only8 because we have a law here, the City is no don't9	do nothing.	And we got to take the City, I live10 in this City for almost fifty year and they do11 whatever they want.12 Who is the responsible for that?	In13 1969 was created the Rent Guidelines Board.	From14 there I have been harassed for landlord because I15 used to live in the West Side - - Upper West Side16 SRO.17 The SRO hotel, because I live there18 for a long time, it started 14th Street to 110 in19 the Upper West Side.	From 1969 a lot of this20 unscrupulous people started the real estate21 business and they start to buy all these SRO and22 make it to apartment condo.	They have are very23 rich.	The City have doesn't found out the use24 that the landlord incomplete.	Okay.	The City25 was the crowded with the low income people like10 
2 myself.	And I used to work there for one dollar3 an hour.	And then this guy came with nowhere4 even they don't want to pay, they come back from5 other country, come back and get rid of people.6 I don' t - - I want you don't give rent increase7 like you have done before because the people if8 you do a rent increase for SRO, you going to9 penalize elderly people.10 And my hotel only seven percent of11 300 unit is still alive.	Every people, if you12 increase it, you will put them to death, because13 the only income we got is from Social Security.14 Social Security don't give us nothing.	They15 don't care.	And we still have these they reduced16 to condo.17 The Upper West is the condo and18 everything is condos.	You know the price they go19 for, two, three million dollars.	And we are20 still here with Social Security.	Then the21 landlord harass us because he want to get money22 we don't have a mortgage or money to buy the23 building because - - because the rent landlord is24 going try for HPD.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap2 
2	up, Mr. Jorge.3	MR. JOSE JORGE:	Well, I want4 people they try do and don't do any increases for5 the people and help these people.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 (Applause.)8 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I have a question.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.	Sir,10 question.11 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	How many units12 in your building?13 MR. JOSE JORGE:	300.14 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	300 rooms? How15 many of those rooms are occupied by permanent16 tenants?17 MR. JOSE JORGE:	Well, they were18 all permanent tenants before.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And what' s it20 now?	What do you think it is now?21 Go to the microphone.22 MR. JOSE JORGE:	Well, they are23 converting illegally into apartment, studio and24 the HPD has been there and confirmed the25 violation.10 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It 's the regular3 apartments, not a hotel or is this been converted4 to permanent apartments, is that what you're5 saying?6 MR . JOSE JORGE:	Yes .7 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	So you have no8 idea of how many people still are there as9 occupants of SRO or class - -10 MR . JOSE JORGE :	Well, you talking11 about the permanent tenants?12 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Yes .13 MR. JOSE JORGE:	Not even ten14 percent.	Elderly people receiving Social15 Security .	I think only three or four percent.16 Now this landlord, that guy has this17 building is gone from here.	You know how I'm a18 day time so I hope that you won't give any rent19 increase to the elderly people, because the20 elderly people, the only thing they waiting for21 the next, if you increase the rent like you22 understand, you going to help the rent .2 3	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	How much do you24 pay for your room?25 MR . JOSE JORGE :	I used to pay $15024 
2 for my room.3 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	A month or a4 week?5	MR. JOSE JORGE:	Monthly.	Because6 I been 35 year.	I still there because am I7 disabled, otherwise I won' t talk.	But my Social8 Security brings home because I have an accident,9 I hurt my leg in the sidewalk 35 year ago.	And10 can - - only ten percent people living there.11	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Okay. So how12 much do the rooms go for the tourists or for the13 students?14 MR . JOSE JORGE:	Oh, boy.	It's too15 big. It's too big.16 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	You don't have17 an idea?18 MR. JOSE JORGE:	Yeah.	You see19 it's all these newspapers.	You see all20 newspaper, you see you take the New York Times21 and you will see the price, unbelievable.22 And we don't have - - the only way we23 can fight the landlords, we hire lawyer.	No24 more. You go to the lawyer and say give me $5,00025 if you want somebody.	You believe that. And12 
2	they - -3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, lawyers4 are too expensive.5 What, Adriene?6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7	Appreciate it.8 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you, sir.9 (Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Harry Atkinson11 is next.12 Hold on a second.13 Followed by Daniel Andrejcuk;14 Followed by Robert Sherwood .15 Go ahead, Mr. Atkinson.16 MR. HARRY ATKINSON:	Mr. Chairman,17 ladies and gentlemen of the Board, I'm wearing a18 turnicate which represents SRO tenants.19 Medically the turnicate is employed20 to squeeze and stop and contain the loss of21 lifeblood.	Analogously it represents the squeeze22 that is being put on our living costs.23 New York City has an ever augmenting24 housing crisis, the erosion and the reduction of25 affordable units for low income tenant.
2 Perhaps amendments been to the law3 and/or housing codes could be made requiring4 owners of SRO and rent controlled or stabilized5 buildings to maintain a fair percentage of their6 units as affordable and registered yearly.7 As an SRO tenant on limited income,8 I live in a nine by eleven room with no kitchen,9 no air- conditioning, no room service and a shared10 toilet and shower.11 The address is Riverside Towers now12 called Hotel, at 80 Riverside Drive where 12013 rooms are DHCR-registered and rent regulated.14 In my 26 years of living there I15 observed the tenants moved out.	Rooms were16 warehoused and then rented to tourists so that17 today only sixteen or seventeen rooms out of 12018 rooms are occupied by long term tenants such as19 myself.20 We cannot afford to pay roughly 150021 - - 1500 a month for the regular studio, but we do22 pay 350 to 400 for the limited accommodation of23 one room.24 Surely this is no financial handicap25 to the landlord who charges $100 or more per2 
2 night to tourists.3 In our building, affordable rooms4 are no longer available to long term tenants even5 though they are HCH registered.6 An interest is coming under the7 subterfuge of MCis, but they're going make the8 repair and we have to contest it.	Most of us9 afford - - cannot afford the dignity of going to10 retirement homes for 4000 a month.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you wrap12 up, please.13 MR. HARRY ATKINSON:	Please help14 the less fortunate of us by having housing15 control and reform.16 I appreciate your time.	Thank you17 so much.18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 Daniel Andrejcuk;21 Robert Sherwood;22 Followed by Susan Slocum.23 Mr. Andrejcuk.24 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	Good25 evening, Rent Guidelines Board.
2 I have to address little bit like we3 say this problem, you have to be intelligent, you4 don't have to be smart, just enough to think.5 Many things we heard about rent increase, about6 cost of living increase.	We see everyday when we7 go to the store, everything costs more money.8 To run buildings cost more money9 every day.	If you go to store, hardware or10 plumbing supply to replace parts, it used to be11 $3 now you have to pay $6.12 It should be rent increase,13 reasonable rent increase.	I give you example.14 Last year which our neighborhood from Westchester15 County, their increase for one year was 4.75.16 We get only 2.75.	And we here in New York have17 higher cost of living then Westchester.18 For one year - - for two years was19 increased six and a half, which we didn't get.20 The oil price, I'll give you an example, in 200421 used to be per one gallon, 96 cents.	Last year22 in 2005 we pay $1.70.	And this year we' re paying23 at this moment, as of yesterday $2.33 cents a24 gallon.25 We don't know how much higher it2 
2	will go.	The insurance came up, everything came3	up.	We need a good increase.	My proposal is4 that we get increase for this year for one year5 at least six and a half percent.	For two years,6 nine and a half percent.	And regardless of that7 I believe there should be supplement for all rent8 which is below $700, for one year increase, it9 should be $25 extra.	And for two years $40.10 I don' t want to waste more of your11 time because there are more speakers.12 That' s what I want to say.	We need13 desperately rent increase.	You will solve that14 level and will stay.	People will lose lower15 income rentals because they can't afford, they16 sell.	You see what' s going on in the shop.	They17 coming very expensive and they' re asking 3,000,18 4,000 which is scary to me to be a landlord.19 $3 ,000 for rent but that' s what' s coming in the20 market.21 And I'm asking you in the name of22 tenants and in the name of landlords, it should23 good increase to keep lower income otherwise they24 will be on the street.	The people have enough25 money to hire good lawyers and they leave this
2 tenant, they will be homeless.	Help us together,3 tenants and landlords .	Give us good rent4 increase this year, at least six and a half and5 nine and a half.6 Thank you .7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 (Audience participation.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sir, sir, we10 have a question.11 Go ahead.12 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Where are your13 buildings?14 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK :	Excuse me?15 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Where are your16 buildings?17 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	Where the18 building?	In Manhattan.19 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	How many units?2 0	MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	Thirty21 units.22 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And where in23 Manhattan is it?2 4	MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	Washington25	Heights.
2		I have tenant that pay that $180, 3	370, 400, 500, 600, that' s the rental.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	More5 questions.6 Go ahead .7 Mr. Schleider has a question.8 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Okay. Thank9 you for testifying.10 Your thirty units, a lot of them11 with very low rents.	You posted a six and a half12 and a nine and a half percent range of increases13 for one or and two year lease.14 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	At least.15 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	At least.16 Would that level of increase make17 you whole, in other words, would that cover your18 expenses?19 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	Not really.20 I still have to put money into the building.	I21 looking in the future, but how long I keep this22 building, I don't know.23 (Audience participation.)24 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And what do25 you think will happen if you sell the building,
2 what would happen to the tenants if you sell that3 building?4	MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	If I will5 sell this building that I have the owners that6 would be close to buy and to sell this building.7 I think they should, that most will selling real8 estate right away.9	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.10 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Have long have11 you owned the building?12 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	Excuse me?13 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	How long have14 you owned the building?15 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	I brought16 last year on December.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 Robert Sherwood is next;20 Mr. Sherwood will be followed by21 Susan Slocum;22 Followed by Sandra Lansky.2 3	MR. ROBERT SHERWOOD:	Okay. If this24 was (inaudible) and create this meeting it would25 not be necessary.
2 Again, for the umpteenth time they3 work with small time operation should not be same4 meeting.5 Second, the Tenants and Neighbors6 Association Organization has pledged to vote that7 landlord are profiteering over SROs and rent8 stabilized and rent controlled buildings.	I hope9 they have done so already.	If not, I hope they10 do so.11 My building at 240 West 72nd Street,12 a Temple, there has been illegal conversions for13 terrorist use.	We have a very heavy tourist14 training in our building.15 These illegal conversions to16 terrorist hotel use needs an investigation of the17 issuance of building permits.	I mean there must18 be some hanky-panky getting these permits to do19 these conversions that are illegal.	That needs20 to be looked in to .21 May I bring to mind that SROs are22 not full, complete homes and it's not what you23 people must have.	Those that don't have private24 baths or kitchens are classified as SROs.	These25 are not complete homes.	I'm sure you're not
2 familiar with this provision because you have3 complete homes yourself.4 Now finally to paraphrase Ronald5 Reagan, I say protect and defend our whole upper6 walls.7 And as far as the SROs are concerned8 as I said previously, because they're not9 complete homes, no zero increase, I say roll10 back, a radical, substantial roll back for SRO11 people because we don' t live in full, complete12 homes.13 One thing to do something about14 these illegal conversions.	Look into building15 permit issues.	There is corruption here.	It16 stinks.	You can smell a cow.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 MR. ROBERT SHERWOOD:	Thank you.19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Susan Slocum;21 Followed by Sandra Lansky;22 Followed by Margie Foster.23 Susan Slocum.24 MS. SUSAN SLOCUM:	Hi.25 I'm Susan Slocum and I am a rent
2 stabilized tenant and a senior citizen.3 I think we should get a decrease and4 not an increase.5 Over the years - -6 (Audience participation.)7 MS. SUSAN SLOCUM:	Landlords are8 making much, much more money.	My landlord never9 testifies because he owns many buildings and he' s10 not losing any money.	He's making a fortune. All11 you bring here are the small landlords who say12 they're losing.	They brought their building last13 year.	They buy distressed buildings, they aren't14 losing.15 Big landlords, you don't see them16 here and they' re making a fortune.17 (Audience participation.)18 MS. SUSAN SLOCUM:	Tenants are19 barely surviving.	I work for the City Wide Task20 Force of the Housing Court in the Harlem21 Community Justice Center and every time I go to22 court we see poor people being forced out of23 their homes because of rent increases, phoney24 MCis for shoddy work.	And all kinds of other25 tricks to get poor tenants out, seniors and
1	2452 everybody.3 Please freeze the rents this year,4 you can't raise it anymore.5 Thank you.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 (Applause.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sandra Lansky;9 Followed by Margie Foster;10	Followed by Lannie Hill.11	Go ahead.12 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	I have a13 family-oriented building in the14 VOICES :	Louder.15 MS . SANDRA LANSKY:	Well, I don' t16 know how.17 (Fixing microphone.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Speak in to19 mike .2 0	MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	I own a21 family- oriented building in a good section22 VOICE:	We still can't hear you.23 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	Well	I own24 a family-oriented building in the Bronx, in a25 good section, family section of the Bronx .21 
2 I was widowed ten years ago and took3 over management.	I care enough about my tenants4 that I keep my office in the building.5 My super - - it's a union building,6 but I employ four people who are pressed by7 unions.8 I started out paying $409 a month to9 the union for my super. I now pay 794.	His10 salary has gone up accordingly.11 When I took over the building I paid12 45 cents a gallon for number six oil.	I now pay13 between $1.61 to - - to $1.80 for number six.14 My Con Edison bills for the common15 areas of the building have gone up from three16 hundred some odd dollars a month to $600 a month,17 that' s just for lighting the halls.18 I want to further state that I can19 only rent an apartment for what the market will20 bear.	So that if I have studios which turn over21 very frequently, I can legally ask $1,500.22 Forget about it, I can't ask $1,500, the market,23 in a good section of the Bronx, won't bear it.24 Therefore, there are people living25 in what would legally be $1500 a month which I2 
1	2472 don't think is fair for my neighborhood3 necessarily, but even if I thought it were fair,4 the market takes its toll, tells you what you can5 charge.6 And I have people that are paying7 $560 a month for a studio in a good section.8 Therefore, I think that the raise of 275 that we9 got last year was a pain for me.10 What happens if I sell the building11 is a new landlord, I believe, does not have to12 live up to what I was doing.	However, he will13 have to live up to what the market would bear.14 And I think that' s the way it should go.15 I think - - O know we need more, and16 I don't own a ten buildings, it's a family-owned17 building.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How many units19doyouhave?20MS. SANDRA LANSKY:54 apartments.21DIRECTOR ADAMS:Stabilized?22MS. SANDRA LANSKY:Beg your pardon?23DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Are they stabilized24apartments?25MS. SANDRA LANKSY:	They're
2 stabilized.3 Makes no difference in actuality4 whether they're stabilized or not.	The forces of5 the mark are what determine what I can charge.6 If people stop renting for $3 , 000 a month, people7 won' t charge $3,000 a month.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on, we have9 a question.10 Go ahead, Leslie.11 DIRECTOR WRIGHT:	Your testimony has12 brought up a question that I, as a new member,13 and perhaps some of the older members or excuse14 me, more seasoned members have also - -15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	More seasoned.16 DIRECTOR WRIGHT:	More seasoned,17 thank you.18 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	I'm not19 seasoned either.	This is the first time I've20 come here.21 DIRECTOR WRIGHT:	So maybe you can22 help me understand this better.23 You've just highlighted the fact24 that the market will only bear rents of this,25 whereas, legally you can charge this.2 
2	MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	Yes.3	DIRECTOR WRIGHT:	So why then do you4	want the increase?5	MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	Oh, I want the6 increase because, in fact, somebody who is paying7 560 could, to my knowledge, because my office is8	on the premises of the building, could easily pay9 650, not 800, not 1500, but drives a brand  new10 car, dresses very well and wears jewelry, fine11	things.12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How long have14 you owned the building?15 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	My family, as16 I said, I took it over ten years ago when I was17 widowed.	The building has been in the family18 since 1955, I believe, best guess.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.20 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	You mentioned21 earlier in your testimony that you were paying22 $400 to the union for a super and that was now up23	to $794?24 DIRECTOR WRIGHT:	Yes.25 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	What period of24 
2	time is that?3	DIRECTOR WRIGHT:	That covers the4 period that I - - that I've been managing the5 building which is about eight years.6 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Thank you.7 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And what is8 your rent roll, monthly rent roll for the9 building?10 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	Under 30,000.11 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And what are12 your expenses?13 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	Hah, my oil14 bill alone last year was $75,000. My real estate15 taxes were $66,000.16 (Audience participation.)17 MS. SANDRA LANSKY: I beg your18 pardon?19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.20 A VOICE:	That's per year.21 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	No, per year,22 per year.	My electric is now averaging 600 a23 month so that' s 6,00024 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	7200, 7200.25 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	Okay.	What8 
2	else can I - -3	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Water and4 sewer.5 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	Water and sewage6 is $26,000 a year, up from 19.	Insurance is up7 to 23, if I'm not mistaken. I could be  - -8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	2300?9 DIRECTOR WRIGHT:	Beg your pardon?10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	2300.11 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	No, 23,000.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	$23,000.13 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	That' s right.14 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Do you have a15 management contract with someone?16 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	I beg your17 pardon?18 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Do you pay a19 management?20 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	No, I'm21 hands-on.	I'm in the office every day.	And if22 anybody could help me cut my costs, see me later.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank2 4	you.25	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	We're not
2done yet.3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Oh, we're not4done yet.5DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:A question was6 asked how much she makes a month and I imagine7 that was in relation to the monies that she's8 receiving as a profit on this building, but we9 haven' t done the expense profile yet.10 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	I'm giving you11 the expense profile.12 What do you want.13 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Yes.14 How about professional fees,15 administration fees.16 DIRECTOR WRIGHT:	Oh, attorneys'17 fees average 6,000 a year.18 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And you're19 we didn't get quite the payroll that you had, you20 gave us the union amount. What - -21 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	The payroll, I22 can't - - I couldn' t get my accountant on the23 phone.24 (Audience participation.)25 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Roughly.6 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet. Go ahead,3 ma' am.4	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	It's nominal at5 this point.6 (Audience participation.)7 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	I beg your8 pardon.	I beg your pardon.9	A VOICE:	You're lying.10 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	I'm speaking.11 My payroll varies.	The net on my12 super' s salary is 423.	He lives apartment-free.13 His gas and electric run 160 a month.	I pay his14 phone bill, $50 a month.	I pay for his gasoline15 so he can run chores for me and he gets at least16 $300 a week extra.17 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	A week?18 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	A week extra19 for doing plumbing chores, some painting chores.20 He grosses out over $70,000 a year.21 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Right, right.22 So 70,000 on top of that.23 Any other expenses that you can24 think of?25 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	Help me.	I'm a10 
2	little nervous.3	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	How about4	repairs?	We haven't spoken about repairs.5	MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	Well, he takes6 care of a good amount of the repairs.7 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Well, he does8 the labor on that, you have expenses on supplies.9	MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	Oh, parts,10 parts for the boiler.11 I'm fixing a roof presently which is12 going to cost about 8,000.	The lead abatement, I13 had a tenant whose child was sucking on toys from14 India and China.	She called the Department of15 Health.	They tested 87 areas in her apartment.16 They said that two out of 87 contained point one17 percent of lead.	That was their reading.	I18 sent it to a HUD-approved lab.	It was under19 their reading.	I sent it blind.20 She since cost me ten thousand21 dollar in harassment fees.	And - - and I don't22 like to sue, it's not my style.2 3	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	So we' re well24 over - - so far - -25 (Audience participation.)24 
2	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	So far we' re3	well over 300, 000 in expenses.4	MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	I beg your5 pardon?6 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER: I said so far7 we're - -8	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	No, we're not9 actually.	I have about 2 - - I have over 273,00010 or so.11	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And then12 you're adding to the expenses on the new owner.13 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	No, that' s adding14 them.15 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	No, it's not.16 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Well, that' s what17 I just added.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What are we19 proving here?20 MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	Well - -21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	To debate one22 building?23 What is - - if you're willing to say,24 if you're not, what is your approximate bottom25 line, Ms. Lansky, can you answer that?
1	2562	MS. SANDRA LANSKY:	You mean what I3 bring home from the building?	I am taxed from4 the building on $80,000 a year.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Of income.6 Thank you.7 (Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Margie Foster,9	are you here?	Is she here? Is she here? No.10	(No response. )11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Lannie Hill, are12 you here?13 MR. LANNIE HILL:	Yes.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Lannie15 Hill;16 Followed by Joyce Goodman, are you17 here?18 MS. JOYCE GOODMAN:	Yes.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Followed by Yajun20 Mark, are you here.21 A VOICE:	Okay.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay great.23 So, are you Lannie Hill?24 MR. LANNIE HILL:	I am.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Great. Thank12 
2 you.3 Go ahead.4	MR. LANNIE HILL:	My name is Lannie5 Hill.	I live at 246 West 21st Street in the6 Borough of Manhattan.	Our building is an SRO and7 is protected under the Rent Control Law.	Our8 landlord is Larry Tauber of Chelsea Partners,9 LLC.10 The tenants of my building have sent11 me to tell you that since I stood before you last12 year the conditions in our building have grown13 worse.14 Our landlord has continued his15 pattern of harassment, following an obvious16 course of action intended to force the tenants in17 our building to give up our rights granted by the18 Rent Control Law.19 Our landlord has reduced the20 services originally provided by the building' s21 previous landlord.	Now, a new superintendent22 lives here.23 No one cleans our toilet rooms . No24 one cleans our shower rooms.	We have had to call25 for a mold inspection by HPD just last week.
2 We've been in court against the3 landlord suing for repairs for over a year and a4 half.	Many of the repairs he has made have5 fallen apart.	Many of the violations are worse6 than they were.7 The worst problems include:8 An unsecured front door;9 Intercoms that haven't worked in10 years;11 Toilet rooms and showers locked and12 chained by the landlord for years at a time;13 And a roof that hasn't stopped14 leaking for the last four years.15 We are not comfortable nor are we16 secure in our own homes.	We fear intruders and17 the next rainstorm.18 The landlord has effectively ruined19 several ''warehoused" rooms which are deemed no20 access by HPD.	He has flooded one room,21 continued a long- term leak in another and22 collapsed part of a ceiling in yet another.23 The cellar is an open violation with24 HPD.	He has refused to repair it and leaves it25 essentially open to the elements.2 
2 The court case, which we have3 pursued against the landlord, has caused great4 stress on the tenants of our building.	Most of5 the people are elderly.	Some are disabled. It is6 very difficult for them to go to court.7 The landlord has cost us, including8 days in court and days waiting for repairs, 259 days per tenant.10 Now the landlord has filed11 "alteration plans" with the DOB for our building.12 He owns a building next door and has filed13 "alteration plans" for that building.	He gutted14 it out. He filed illegal plans and harassed15 tenants down to one last neighbor.	We believe16 that he will attack us if he can only get the17 permit.18 We have faced verbal harassment from19 our landlord over and over again.	The speech he20 gave us when he took over the building states his21 point of view: "I am a little king. I will decide22 what's best for this building.	It is my pleasure23 that you use the toilet. It is my pleasure that24 you use the shower.	It is my pleasure that you25 sleep here. It is my pleasure that you stay here.2 
2 Now you live under my law. I am the landlord. "3 We plead with the Rent Guidelines4 Board not to reward this man by allowing him to5 take more of our desperately needed income.6 Please do not reward a man who would willfully7 subvert the Rent Control Laws for his continuing8 campaign of horrors against the elderly, the poor9	and the infirmed, your neighbors, who live at 24610 West 21st Street.11 (Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How many units13 are there and how many are SROs right now?14 MR. LANNIE HILL:	There are 2815 units and there are eleven people that remain in16 the building.	The whole building is an SRO.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. And the18 rest of the building he' s made it that?19MR. LANNIE HILL:	Yes.20(Audience participation .)21CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22Joyce Goodman.23Joyce Goodman will be followed by24Yajun Mark;25Followed by Jack Freund .
2 MS. JOYCE GOODMAN:	I work for3 Assemblymember Daniel O'Donnell.	I'm Joyce4 Goodman and I'm his community liaison.5 This is his prepared testimony.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where does the7 assemblyman represent?8 MS. JOYCE GOODMAN:	He represents9 the residents of Manhattan Valley, Morningside10 Heights, the Upper West Side of Manhattan and11 Southern Harlem.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.13 MS. JOYCE GOODMAN:	" ...The proposed14 rent increases of between 3.0 and 6 percent - -15 3.0 and 6.5 percent for one year lease renewals16 and from 5.0 to 8.5 percent for two year lease17 renewals if passed, will have a dramatically18 negative effect on the lives of tenants who live19 in my Assembly District and for tenants across20 the City of New York.21 These increases will adversely22 effect the very people our system was originally23 designed to protect.	We cannot continue to24 overlook the housing needs of our working25 families, or our most vulnerable residents: Our2 
2 seniors, immigrants, the disabled and homeless3 populations.4 First and foremost, I ask that the5 Board to consider vital statistics that are6 probably not unique to my community district, but7 which are extremely telling in terms of why there8 are so many of us here today who refer to the9 affordable housing situation in New York City as10 a "crisis. "11 Over the course of the last seven12 months, my Community Office has assisted13 approximately twenty five households who fell14 into rent arrears and sought legal and financial15 assistance to prevent them from losing their rent16 regulated apartments.17 Each one of these constituents18 required on average, four - - an average of four19 follow-up meetings or more comprehensive legal20 services or an advocate in Housing Court to try21 to prevent their eviction.22 It is important to note that the23 majority of these cases involve tenants who pay24 between $650 and $950 per month for rent.25 The difficulties my constituents2 
2 face paying these rents goes a long way in3 dispelling the idea that they should simply4 relocate to other neighborhoods to find housing5 elsewhere.6 Affordability is an issue across7 this City.	Furthermore, a majority of these8 tenants have lived in their apartments for more9 than a decade and they occupy apartments that are10 at capacity.11 For example, most of these single12 renter currently live in one-bedroom apartments13 and the majority of those who occupy an apartment14 larger than a one-bedroom, more often than not,15 have boarders or third parties who are paying a16 percentage of the rental expenses.17 Additionally, many of those who have18 sought assistance from my office are those who19 are approaching 65, but do not qualify for SCRIE.20 Some are those who are permanently disabled, but21 do not qualify for the newly-instituted exemption22 for the disabled.	A great many are low income23 working families whose salaries over the years24 have not increased anywhere near the rent25 increases that have been instituted by this body.2 
2	It is hard to avoid the obvious3	conclusion that a great many of my constituents4	who live on fixed incomes will find themselves in5	an impossible living situation if faced with a6	rent increase over the next one or two years.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Can you wrap up,8	please.9	MS. JOYCE GOODMAN:	" ...It is an10 acknowledged fact that my office11 I'll wrap up by saying all I do, my12 whole life' s work is keeping people in their13 apartments because their incomes are desperately14 close to what their rents are.15 (Audience participation .)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 Ya Jun Mark;18 Followed by Jack Freund;19 Followed by Zhao Jiang Li, I think.2 0	Go ahead .21 MS . YA JUN MARK:	Good afternoon.22 I am from the Chinatown Tenant Union23 and I am here to voice my strong opposition to24 the proposed exorbitant and unjustified rent25 increases .21 
2 In my daily work and visitations3 with low income units across Chinatown and Lower4 Manhattan, we often found families barely able to5 afford the already high levels of the rent for6 apartments that are also severely run-down and7 neglected.8 In many of the apartments, I found9 cracked ceilings and walls, chipping paint, leaky10 plumbing, faulty and dangerous electrical wiring,11 and in general, widespread neglect of maintenance12 and landlord duties.13 Worse yet, in the wintertime, found14 tenants go without proper the heating and hot15 water on some of the coldest days of the year.16 For these conditions, many families are paying17 over fifty percent of their take-home pay to the18 landlords that they never see and to landlords19 that don't seem to care.20 As a resident of the Lower21 Manhattan, I have seen and experienced first hand22 these same neglectful conditions.23 Deplorable conditions are also24 widespread in the Bronx and other areas25 throughout New York.	From what I have witnessed2 
2 and experienced, many landlords of this City have3 failed their tenants, and the government of the4 people has failed to better regulate and ensure5 the safety and well- being of its most vulnerable6 citizens - low-income families, immigrants, and7 the elderly.8 Before you consider raising rents so9 that neglectful landlords can squeeze more money10 from honest and decent New Yorkers, you must11 consider the crucial need to improve living12 conditions first.	That is why we are all here13 before you today to say no to the proposed rent14 increases.15 We hope and believe that this Board16 will ultimately do what is the best for this City17 and for its people.18 Thank you.19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 Jack Freund.22 MR. JACK FREUND:	Thank you, Mr.23 Chairman.24 Can you hear me good?25 I want to first thank the Members of2 
2 the Board.	You have taken an extraordinary3 amount of time and put in an extraordinary amount4 of effort this year, in particular in my memory,5 into listening to owners, as well as tenants,6 taking tours and I want to thank you for your7 time and effort that you put into this.8 It's said that you have a difficult9 job, but I think - - it's that you do have a10 difficult job, but I think it's said for the11 wrong reasons.	It's often put into the context12 that the RGB has to balance the equities or that13 you have to be concerned with maintaining14 affordable housing.15 I think if the RGB views that as its16 goal, you don't have a difficult job, you have an17 impossible job.18 I want to cite two examples.19 This morning' s New York Times had an20 article about the disappearance of middle income21 neighborhoods in New York City.	But the point22 of that article I think is it's just not New York23 City, it's all urban centers.	This is a national24 phenomena of shrinking middle class in all urban25 centers .2 
2 Yesterday there was another article3 in the Wall Street Journal which talked about the4 housing burden of all Americans which has risen5 and been above thirty percent for some time.	It6 has just risen above thirty percent in New York.7 So, again, this is a national problem.8	And there is nothing that we could9 do about these broad-scaled	economic effects.10 What we can do is provide the rent increases that11 are necessary to keep property owners in12 business.	That is the function and the purpose13 of the Rent Guidelines Board and it's one that14 has not been accomplished certainly in the past15 four years where no one disputes that costs have16 increased significantly, and that the Rent17 Guideline increases have been significantly below18 even the historical levels of rent increase,19 which in turn, have not been adequate in terms of20 compensating owners.21 This year the minimum commensurate22 rent increases that your numbers indicate would23 be five percent, nine and a half percent for one24 and two year leases.	If you look at your recent25 historical precedent, you're not going to come9 
2 close to that.3 So what I'm going to ask you to do4 is just as what happened three years ago or four5 years ago now when the Rent Guidelines Board6 threw out its traditional approach and had7 increases of four and a half and seven and a8 half, which were totally inadequately for Price9 Index increase of 16.9 percent, I am now going to10 ask you to again break that trend that has been11 established.12 We have new members on the Board13 who can take a new view of this situation and14 realize that the role of the RGB is keep owners15 in business and don't give them - -16 (Audience participation.)17 MR. JACK FREUND:	Any increase that18 you do, even the five and nine and half,19 according to another report in the Wall Street20 Journal last week, private sector rents in the21 City are going up eight to ten percent a year.22 Certainly, any rent increase that you do will be23 below that.	And that is, at most, a function of24 your Board, to protect tenants, not from25 necessary rent increases, but from market rent2 
2 increases rather.3 You can do that and you can provide4 owners with the reasonable rent increases they5 need to keep providing housing.6 I thank you again for all the7 attention you've paid to these issues this year.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question, Mr.11 Freund.	Mr. Lubell has a question.12 DIRECTOR LUBELL:	Mr. Freund,13 we've read recently, and there's growing concern14 obviously about the quote, loss of 200, 000 units15 over a relatively brief span of time to16 affordability or to being affordable apartments.17 Can you comment upon that.18 MR. JACK FREUND:	Sure.19 How many hours you got?20 I'll try to be brief.21 It's an interesting subject though.22 Most of those units, 200,000 units obviously are23 not lost to the housing stock, they are - - they24 didn't disappear, dissolve into thin air, they25 shifted tenure.	Some of those housing units9 
2 became coops and condos.	Some of them which were3 Mitchell-Lama units are now rent stabilized4 units.5 The housing market in New York is6 very dynamic.	It shifts constantly, as it7 should.	As the housing market is slowly shifting8 to a home ownership emphasis from a rental9 emphasis.10 If fact, if you look at the HVS11 data, and the most recently released data, we12 suddenly have more rent stabilized units than13 we've ever had.	The total number of units has14 increased.	And oddly enough the number of units15 renting below $500, the lowest rent level, has16 remained constant from 2002 to 2005.17 So clearly I mean - - again, going18 back to my initial comments, there is nothing you19 can do, we can do, anybody can do, about broad20 economic factors that effect New York City and21 the country as a whole.	What you can do is try22 to maintain the existing affordable housing that23 we have and doing so by providing the rent24 increases necessary to pay for - - nobody contests25 the enormous increases we've had in fuel, real2 
2 estate taxes, insurance .3 And equally I think nobody disputes4 that the rent increases over the last few years5 have just not been in the ballpark necessary to6 meet those costs.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS: Yes, Mr . Schleider,8 question .9 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thank you,10 Mr . Freund.11	You represent property owners.	And12 your constituency is large and I imagine it 1  s13 shrunk over the past year or so as small owners14 exit out of the rental market .15 But maybe you can comment on16 something.	Over the next five years the low17 projection for population growth in New York City18 is about 200, 000 people .	I 1 ve seen it as high as 19	400,000 people.20 We 1  re also seeing that the21 demographic shifting towards a more affluent New22 York City.	We 1  re going to be losing a lot of the23 households that are say $35,000 a year annual24 income and less and we gathered more households25 say in the $75,000 area and higher income20 
2	brackets.3 Given the state of the housing4 market right now, the rent stabilized housing5 stock, what with the public agencies have stated6 going to introduce as new housing, affordable7 housing, how do you see the impact of this two to8 400,000 increase in population in the City over9 the next five years impacting the rent stabilized10	stock?11	MR. JACK FREUND:	Well, I12 another big question that I'll try to be brief13 on.14 It's going to increase rent15 pressures on the stock.	Again, it's one of these16 forces of nature that are kind of immutable.17 You' re halfway to demand you're going to have18 increased pressure on rents.19 Hopefully we	the City' s policies20 in opening up new land for development.	We have21 seen rate increase since supply and if we allow22 new development to occur, and the City has kind23 of mixed record on this, shutting down24 development in some areas and opening up25 opportunities for development in others, but if
2	one were to truly open the floodgates I mean the3	solution I think everybody would acknowledge with4 our problems is more housing.	There is a lot of5 vacant land in the City to accommodate more than6 200,000 more people.	But we need to - - we need7 to allow the private sector to produce the8	housing that' s necessary . And that' s a simple9	answer.10	DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	And to11	maintain the affordability of the housing that' s12 already in place by having adequate rent13 increases to preserve and protect that housing.14 MR. JACK FREUND:	Couldn' t have15 said it better.16 DIRECTOR SCHLEIDER:	Thanks.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well said.18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Next is Zhao20 Jiang Li, are you here?	Yes.21 Followed by Dorothy Simon;22 Followed by Georgina Christ or23 Christ.24 MS. ZHAO JIANG LI:	Good afternoon,25 Lady and gentleman.	I am Zhao Jiang Li.	I'm12 
2 from Chinatown Tenant Union.3 When I go outreach, I saw people are4 living in bad condition place.	They must pay5 higher rent for their apartment and take care6 their living.7 It needs a lot of money for that,8 But they got a little paid from work.9 I urge don't raise the rent so well10 people can live in a healthy place.11 When I talk with tenants who live in12 Chinatown they always say we are living in a13 noisy and bad condition and higher rent place. In14 this situation, landlord just want get money.15 They don't care if the people living that16 condition.17 So in Chinatown, gentrification is18 very popular. Landlord want to get more money.19 They replace the tenant.20 So, I urge Counselor don't raise the21 rent.	Two years raise zero percent.	Protect the22 tenants, protect the Chinatown.23 (Audience participation.)24 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	I have a25 question.
2	MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	We have a3	question .4	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Which building do5	you live in Chinatown?6	MS. ZHAO JIANG LI:	I live housing7	Gaffon Housing	(phonetic.)8 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	How long have9 you lived there?10	MS. ZHAO JIANG LI:	Three years.11	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And how much do12 you pay in rent?13 MS. ZHAO JIANG LI:	In my14 experience I pay 600.15 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	That' s for a16 studio or a one-bedroom?17 MR. ZHAO JIANG LI:	Two-bedroom.18 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Two-bedroom?19 And many units in your building?20 MR.	ZHAO JIANG LI:	There are 34,21 maybe 28 units .22 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	28?2 3	DIRECTOR ADAMS:	What' s the24 address?25 MR .	ZHAO JIANG LI:	Address?24 
2DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Address.	What' s3the address?4MR.	ZHAO JIANG LI:	Yes, Chinatown5and - -6DIRECTOR ADAM:	Street number.7MR. ZHAO JIANG LI:	Yes.	2928	Delancy Street.9	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	So how old is10 the building, do you know?	How old is the11 building.12 A VOICE:	So Mr. Li actually lives13 in public housing and he's representing the14 Tenant Union because there are many tenants up15 here today who are facing gentrification and who16 pay high rent - - who pay high rents even though17 their landlords aren't providing any services at18 all.19 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you.20 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	So you live in rent21 stabilized housing?22 A VOICE:	No, he lives in public23 housing.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 (Audience participation.)10 
2 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	The next speaker is3 Dorothy Simon;4 Followed by Georgina Chirst and5 Daniel Kornblum;6 MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	My name is7 Dorothy Simon.8 I'm speaking for the Committee to9 protect rent control tenants.10 But what we' re trying to do also is11 to protect tenants that are not rent controlled12 but rent stabilized because in the corners that13 are rent controlled are very fast disappearing.14 There are only 40,000 left in the City and15 originally there were more than a million.16 We've heard small the small17 landlords come here.	And first, there should be18 one hearing.	I'm surprised that the tenant19 organizations aren't here to back up the tenants20 and that they don't bring out a large number of21 tenants that are effected.22 And we know there are probably23 (Audience participation.)24 MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	They're25 demoralized by what has happened to them over the2 
2	last 34 years.3	At any rate, let me read.	I'm4 distributing a copy of this to all of you people.5 This is to the Rent Guidelines Board6 from the Committee to Protect Rent Controlled7 Tenants.8 Thomas Siracuse has been a tenant9 for many years and he cannot be here.	And I as10 the Cochair actually Dorothy M. Simon.11 ' ...We urge you to vote against the12 proposed 50 percent increase for vacated rent13 apartments or the HUD Fair Market Rent Special14 Guideline.15 Because of the continuing sharp16 increases for rent controlled units, many rent17 controlled tenants are paying over $1,000 a18 month.	This proposed special guideline makes it19 much easier for landlords to reach the 2,00020 vacancy decontrol threshold thus taking these21 units off rent regulation and further reducing22 the stock of affordable housing.23 According to the New York Times Real24 Estate Section of April 10, '03, DHCR reported25 that more than 13,000 apartments were removed
2	from the rent regulated rolls in 2004 compared 3	with 6400 in 2002.4 According to the New York State5 Housing and Vacancy Survey, over 16,000 rent6 controlled apartment have been deregulated from7 2003 to 2005 or for a loss of 27 percent of the8 total rent controlled apartments.9 This hemorrhage in the loss of10 affordable housing seriously effects the City' s11 ability to attract new workers such as teachers12 and other City workers.	It is estimated that13 there are about 50,000 rent controlled apartments14 left in the City and most of these apartments are15 owned by large real estate operators or my16 landlord, Sal Goldman, originally Goldman and17 DeLorenzo, specialize in rent control apartments,18 never cooped the buildings and looked forward as19 we - - he was right that he figured the value was20 going to go up.	He brought the buildings at very21 low prices and has made big. "22 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Ms. Simon, you23 have to wrap up.24 MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	Well, I'm25 handing this out for you to read.4 
2	MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Okay.	Thank you .3	MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	But I won't take4 the time, but the fact is that the rent control5 apartments should not - - these are middle income6 apartments.	In my building, as we die or as we7 leave, the landlord doesn't even bother, is what8 you declare but he just goes ahead and remodels9 the building with - - nothing is done in our10 apartments, but the apartments as they become11 vacant.12 Now, you have marble floors in the13 bathroom and in the kitchen and he gets over14 $3500 a month rent for the smaller apartments and15 goes all the way up.16 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Okay . Thank you,17 Ms. Simon.18 We had a question.	Ms. Holder has a19 question.20 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you for21 coming to testify.22 We missed Tom Siracuse this year.	I23 hope he's doing well and we hope to see him next24 week.25 MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	What' s that?
1	2822 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Tom Siracuse.3 We' re used to seeing Tom at these hearings also.4 I miss him this year and this year and I hope5 he' s doing well.6 MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	He wasn't been7 well, but we still have a case pending in the8 courts.	We have not given up on the courts.	And9 our lawyer has appealed the case and we intend to10 go ahead with it.11	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Well, my best to12 Tom.	Please convey that to him.13 How long have you been in your rent14 controlled apartment, ma'am?15 MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	What' s that?16 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	How long have you17 been in your rent controlled apartment?18 MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	Since - - well,19 1970 is when rent control came in, since then.20 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	But - -21 MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	But I was there22 before.2 3	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	So how long have24 you been total in that apartment?25 MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	I've been I24 
1	2832	there guess some time a few years before 1970.3	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And how many4	units in your building?5	MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	75.6 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	75 units?7 MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	We have about8 20 rent controlled apartments still left in the9 building.	We do have a porter.	From the moment10 I moved into the apartment with my husband, we11 have been fighting the landlord.	It's not a12 place that I would recommend it.13 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	And - - okay.14 Thank you.15 MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	Nothing was16 done in our apartment.	I moved in	when I17 first moved, the stove that was there is still18 there. And when I contacted - - I thought that19 there was gas in the apartment, I contacted Con20 Edison and they said oh, they said oh, they said21 don't worry, those old stoves will outlast the22 new ones.	And it's true, it's okay.	My landlord23 has no expenses.	I have everything that was in24 the apartment when I moved in.25 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Where is your6 
2	building?3 MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	25 West 68th4 Street.	It's right near Lincoln Center and - -5 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Okay and - -6 MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	The rent's7 very high in the area.	And we're trying to8 maintain affordable housing.	There was a council9 to retain livable - - a livable West Side.10 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	So you said11 there's 75 units of which 20 of the units are12 still rent controlled.13 MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	Yes.14 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Are all the rest15 of them rent stabilized or have any of them gone16 out of the rent regulated17 MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	They were left18 unstabilized.	But within recent years there all19 been decontrolled.20DIRECTOR HOLDER:I can't hear you.21MS. DOROTHY SIMON:Within recent22	years they all have been decontrolled .23DIRECTOR HOLDER:So how much are24those rents?25MS. DOROTHY SIMON:Well, the
1	2852 penthouse apartment that was originally	the3 original owner sold the building and have4 included in the lease, the sale, the fact, that5 his son was disabled should be allowed to live in6 the apartment as long as he lived.	But they went7 to court on it and lost.	But eventually the son8 had to leave because he couldn' t afford the rent.9 And he just recently died at Metropolitan10 Hospital.11	DIRECTOR HOLDER:	So how much is12 the rent?13 MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	It's about - -14 probably up around $10,000.	I mean I don't know15 what it is.	I don' t have that contact with the16 new tenants.	Mostly they're not in the17 apartment .18 This woman, I don't know if she19 works in the UN or whatever, she's not American20 and she just, it's a pad for her to come to.	And21 most of - - there are many people in the building22 that have children and they would like a larger23 apartment, but as they become vacant they're24 decontrolled and they cannot live there.25 DIRECTOR HOLDER:	Thank you so
2	much for your testimony.3	MS. DOROTHY SIMON:	It's a real4	problem.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 (Audience participation.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Georgina Christ,8 is that you?9 Thank you.10 Hold on one second.11 Following Georgina will be Daniel12 Kornblum;13 Following Daniel will be Yarrow14 Willman- Cole.15 Go ahead, Georgina.16 MS. GEORGINA CHRIST:	I have lived17 on the Lower East Side for 36 years.	I am a18 member of Cooper Square Committee and a19 volunteer.20 As a volunteer a collected 80021 letters signed.	And I'd like to present them to22 you today from the Lower East Side Tenants.23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Leon.25 MS. GEORGINA CHRIST:	I was also6 
2	printing - -3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on a4 second.5 Ma' am, will you give him the6 letters.7 MS. GEORGINA CHRIST:	Sure.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Are those from10 rent stabilized tenants?11 MS. GEORGINA CHRIST:	For the most12 part, yes, they are.	Some were from people who13 used to live in the City who were visiting their14 families and could no longer appear here.	And15 there were some from - - a few Brooklyn, a few16 from above 14th Street.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Brooklyn is18 still in the City.19 MS. GEORGINA CHRIST:	Yes, but20 from the Lower East Side this is concentrated21 mostly on the Lower East Side, I mean from 14th22 Street to Houston, from Third Avenue to D.23 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Roughly what24 percentage of these would you say are rent25 stabilized?
2	MS. GEORGINA CHRIST:	I would say3	95.4 DIRECTOR ADAMS:	Thank you.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .6 Go ahead, continue.7 MS. GEORGINA CHRIST:	While I was8 collecting the signatures I also was privy to9 thousand of street testimonies over the last two10 months.	I can, without a doubt, testify that11 the tenants on the Lower East Side cannot afford12 a rent increase.13 For the first time, forty percent of14 letter's signatures were done by men which is15 unusual.	Usually it's the women who sign up for16 it, but this time forty percent of the men were17 signing, and some of them are pushing baby18 carriages.19 Eighty percent of the signatures20 were from people 45 and up dealing with stagnate21 wages and cost of living increases.	Most felt22 that they were unable to even afford to retire.2 3	A number of the	young adults who24 were living in deregulated apartments were also25 very, very upset and angry because they're forced24 
2 to live two, three, four deep and with their3 parents because they cannot find affordable4 housing.5 Along with my trip through	from6 14th Street to Houston and from Third to D, I7 counted forty construction sites of new luxury8 and condos for a thousand people.	I only counted9 three construction sites for affordable housing10 which would house 25 each in two of the buildings11 and approximately 35 in another building.12 Then there' s your 80/20 which is13 only good for approximately ten years.14 The people on the Lower East Side,15 their fear is palpable when it comes to affording16 an rent increase, they absolutely cannot afford17 it.	And we vote for a zero rent increase.18 (Audience participatio n.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 Daniel Kornblum;21 Followed by Yarrow Willman-Cole;22 Followed by John Ackerman.23 MR.

Talk9	into the mike.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Try speaking11 into the mike. The mike is the right size.12 MR. DANIEL KORNBLUM:	All right13 again, like I said, my wife and I we are the14 small landlords, we are not the Donald Trumps.15 We are not big conglomerate that I heard people16 talking about.	You're talking about the small17 landlords, that I'm going to list some of the18 problems that we have as the small landlords.19 First of all, I heard some speakers20 talking about rent control and everything else.21 Okay.22 World War II finished 61 years ago23 and you cannot bring - - you know, things do not24 stay the same unfortunately or fortunately.25 For example, like I have bills over10 
2 here from a year ago.	The fuel bills alone from3 a year to this time, went up by 34 percent.	The4 insurance went up by about seventeen percent and5 administrative costs went up by about ten.6 Parts and supplies went up at least7 30 percent.	I just got a call from my plumber8 yesterday.	He' s telling me that half -inch copper9 tubing went up by 32 percent, and don' t get10 scared when you see your bills.11 The City of New York said about a12 year ago that they're going to raise only the13 water bills percent in the next five years.14 Well, guess what, they going to raise it by ten15 percent for the next five or six years.	And16 most of the tenants don't really call the office17 to say that their water is leaking, the faucet is18 leaking.19 And another thing is that tenants20 have one of their assistance they have is the21 HEAP program, Heat Energy Assistance Program.22 They give the assistance, not the landlords.23 And basically the biggest problem is not the24 social problem and all that,not enough housing25 and all that.	We have a problem were we have to2 
2 pay our basic bills .	You have control on income .3 I wish you would have control of our expenses.4 (Audience participation.)5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where 's your6 building?7	MR .

YARROW WILLIAM- COLE:	Good19 afternoon, Members of the Board.20 My name is Yarrow William-cole.	And21 I am a tenant advocate by from the West Side SRO22 Law Project.23 So thank you for your sensitive24 attention span to listen to everyone' s testimony25 today .10 
2 I'm here as an advocate, like I3 said, for a single room occupancy tenants that4 face more and more pressures everyday to leave5 their rooms - - to leave their rooms from6 landlords.7 One of these pressures comes from8 the practice of renting to tourists illegally.9 And to clarify, this morning10 Mr. Ogunrinde, Charles Ogunrinde who came up to11	speak, he said	you said that his building was12 rent - - it's sort - - you guys - - it seem liked13 you guys were under the impression that his14 building was rented to tourist - - to rent - - I'm15 sorry, to residents permanently, but that' s not16 the case actually .17 He's only been living there six18 months he said.	Well, what he did, what happens19 is that when he said his landlord actually wants20 to kill him, he wasn' t kidding, because21 management is extremely hostile towards him22 because he sought counsel and advice in order to23 be able to live in the hotel as a permanent24 tenant, which is his right.25 Instead of charging 60, $70 a night12 
2	he wanted to pay on a weekly or monthly basis as3 a permanent tenant.	So that' s what he' s fighting4 for right now.	And it's still in limbo, we don't5 know what's going to happen.6 He did have to go to court and the7 judge to did order him back into his room because8	he was evicted illegally.	So to clarify that.9	So what' s happening in many SRO10	buildings is there they're called single rooms so11	the landlord sees an opportunity to make huge12 sums of money renting to tourists.	It's13 important to understand that landlords under no14 realistic estimate, rent illegally to tourists to15 keep up with rising expenses. And in no way could16 raising SRO tenants rent, even 100 percent,17 compensate greedy landlords enough from them to18 stop renting to tourists.19 So therefore, in essence, SRO20 landlords do not need nor care about a rent21 increase.	An increase only places an unfair22 burden on the SRO tenants who mostly live below23 the poverty line, around 48 percent.24 So why does the Board care about the25 problem of illegal hotels in deciding on a rent12 
2 increase?	Well, giving a blanket increase to3 SRO landlords with the - - when we have a list of4 over a 100 locations that made hotel working5 group comprised of community organizations of6 politicians just between 24th Street and lOOth7 Street, on the west side .	And also we a have8 list of only sixteen possible SRO hotels that9	rent to permanent tenants .	Ten of those are10 rented to tourists so there's a problem affecting11 not only the minority of SRO tenants, but the12 majority.13 In addition - - that is why it's14 greatly important that any provisos must be15 raised to not reward any landlords that are16 warehousing apartments or are renting to tourists17 instead of 75 percent, we should consider very18 seriously 85 percent .19 Thank you very much .20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	85 you said?21 Thank you .22 (Audience participation .)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	John Ackerman;24 Followed by Lawrence Gregory;25 Followed by Steven Chabra .10

JOHN ACKERMAN:	Good afternoon.10 My name is John Ackerman.	I am a11 small property owner on the Upper West Side.	I12 have a small, five- story brownstone which I've13 owned for fifteen years.14 My property's classified as an SRO15 hotel.	I don't rent to tourists so I don't know16 what she's talking about.	I have 16 units, 12 of17 which are SRO rooms .18 The last few years the Board has19 given zero percent increases and zero percent20 allowances to run my - - for vacancy to run my21 property.22 I owe two years in back real estate2 3	taxes.	I owe $200,000 in credit card debt .	And24 I'm paying 18 percent interest to the City and on25 the credit cards to subsidize this property.24 
2 My real estate taxes, fuel,3 electric, insurance and repair costs have4	skyrocketed.	I cannot get a mortgage on the5 property, additional mortgage from the banks6 because my rents are so low and my costs are so7 high.8 Ihave a tenant who recently died.9 He lived in two SRO units for the past thirty10 years and paid only $198 per month rent for both11 rooms.	The current market rent for these rooms12 is $1500.	Under the current guidelines Iam not13 allowed to increase this $198-a-month rent.14 By the way, the man died with over15 $500, 000 in his bank accounts because his rent16 was subsidized by the prior owner and myself for17 the past thirty years .18 He' s not the only tenant.	Ihave19 eight more like this that are paying even lower20 rents, ridiculously low rents.	The low rents21 that I mentioned to you before, also includes22 electricity.23 Several of these tenants, I found24 out, own beach houses, have a country home.	They25 drive brand new cars so I don't believe they do
