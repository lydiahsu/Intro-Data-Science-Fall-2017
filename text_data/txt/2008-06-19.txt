This  will 21 take -- it is a three or four- page document and  I22 will read it into record.23 " NEW YORK CITY RENT GUIDELINES 24	BOARD 2008 --25	( Audience participation.)

2 previously subject to the City Rent  and 3 Rehabilitation Law which are the subject of  a4 tenant application for adjustment. The  Rent 5 Guidelines Board hereby adopts the following 6 Special Guidelines:7 For dwelling units subject to  the 8 Rent and Rehabilitation Law on September 30 , 2008 ,9 which become vacant after September 30 , 2008 , the 10 special guideline shall be:	Blank.11 Heading: DECONTROLLED UNITS.12 The permissible increase for 13 decontrolled units as referenced in Order 3 a which 14 become decontrolled after September 30 , 2008 , shall 15 be:	Blank.16 Heading:	CREDITS.17 Rentals charged and paid in  excess 18 of the levels of rent increase established by  this 19 Order shall be fully credited against the  next 20 month' s rent.21 Heading: STATEMENT OF BASIS AND	22 PURPOSE.23 The Rent Guidelines Board is 24 authorized to promulgate rent guidelines  governing 25 apartments subject to the Rent Stabilization Law  of 2 
2 1969 , as amended, and the Emergency Tenant 3 Protection Act of 1974 , as amended.4 The purpose of these guidelines  is 5 to implement the public policy set forth in  the 6 Findings and Declaration of Emergency of the  Rent 7 Stabilization Law of 1969 (§ 26 - 501 of the N. Y. C.8 Administrative Code) and in the  Legislative 9 Findings contained in the Emergency  Tenant 10	Protection Act of 1974 ( L. 1974 c. 576 , § 4 [§ 2 J).11 ( Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The Rent 13 Guidelines Board is also authorized to  promulgate 14 rent guidelines for loft units subject to  Section 15 286 subdivision 7 of the Multiple Dwelling Law.  The 16 purpose of the loft guidelines is to implement  the 17 public policy set forth in the  Legislative 18 declaration -- in the Legislative Findings  of 19 Article 7 - C of the Multiple Dwelling Law --20 ( Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	-- ( Section 22	280 ).23 Dated: June 19 , 2008 .24 I will entertain motions.25 ( Audience participation.)23

2 adjustment tied to the length of a tenant' s  tenure.3 This document is quite complex and one that takes  a4 long time for this Board to  digest.5 This proposal for a  supplemental 6 rent increase of anywheres from $ 35 to $ 90 is a7 major policy departure in terms of the  methodology 8 the Board has used for 39  years.9 To consider it in haste  this 10 evening without a careful analysis of how it  would 11 effect affordability, especially as it would  effect 12 low- income tenants, would be a travesty.13 ( Audience participation.)14 MS. HOLDER:	This propose --15 this proposal has not been discussed at any of   the 16 public meetings of the Board that have taken  place 17 since the beginning of the 20087 cycle nor is  there 18 any mention of a supplemental rent increase in  the 19 proposed order adopted on May 5 th.
1	15 2 rent increase surfaced only last Wednesday  night,3 June 11 th at the first public hearing in Brooklyn.4 And it was clearly a proposal by the  Rent 5 Stabilization Association.6 To consider this tonight based  on 7 a 22 - page staff memo that was circulated to board 8 members only this morning is a procedural  outrage.9 Furthermore --10 ( Audience participation.)11 MS. HOLDER:	Furthermore, on 12 substantiative grounds, the staff memo makes  it 13 clear that their preliminary analysis on the  impact 14 on affordability is not reliable.	We have high 15 regard for the professionalism and capability  of 16 our staff and we thank the staff for their  honesty 17 and integrity as expressed in this 22 - page memo.18 Given the sensitivity of the 19 affordability issue for lower income tenants  and 20 the arguable, questionable aspect of the  analysis,21 it is hard to believe that we, as the RGB,   would 22 conduct our public mission on such short  turnaround 23 time without adequate review of  analytical 24 methodology issues or adequate time to review  and 25 respond to the analysis. 	 ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167
1	16 2 ( Audience participation.)3 MS. HOLDER:	In the analysis --4 in the analysis of rent burden data,  median,5 across- the- board- rent income ratios tend to be 6 inertial over time while poor and near- poor tenants 7 are struggling with rapidly escalating  rent 8 burdens.9 If we care to consider the  impacts 10 on lower income tenants, this is not the way   to 11 forecast it.	We must --12 ( Audience participation.)13 MS. HOLDER:	We must insist that 14 the proposal for any kind of supplemental  rent 15 adjustment be withdrawn in its entirety or the  vote 16 be postponed --17 ( Audience participation.)18 MS. HOLDER:	-- to give the 19 Board time --20 ( Audience participation.)21 MS. HOLDER:	We must insist that 22 the proposal for any kind of supplemental  rent 23 adjustment be withdrawn in its entirety or the  vote 24 be postponed to give the Board time to consider  the 25 true impact of such an extreme change in the  method  	 ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167
1	17 2 of adjusting rents.3 A public hearing should be 4 scheduled on this issue and experts invited  to 5 comment on it as well as those agencies  charged 6 with enforcing the guidelines.7 ( Audience participation.)8 MS. HOLDER:	This would mean 9 that the vote would have to be put off most   likely 10 until after July 1 st.	While not ideal, the radical 11 nature of this supplemental rent hike  proposal 12 makes such a postponement necessary.13 The suburban rent boards have 14 frequently missed the July 1 st deadline without 15 harm to owners or tenants.	In fact, the law 16 provides for such an eventuality.17 The law says:	The standards for 18 rent adjustments established annually shall  be 19 effective for leases commencing on October 1 st each 20 year and during the next succeeding twelve  months 21 whether or not the Board has filed its findings  and22 statement of the maximum rate or rates of  rent 23 adjustment by July 1 st of each year.24 If such lease is entered  into 25 before such filing by the Board, it may provide  for  	 ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167
1	18 2 the rent to be adjusted by the rates then in   effect 3 subject to change by the applicable rates of  rent 4 adjustment when filed; such change to be  effective 5 as of the date of the commencement of the   lease.6 Said lease must provide that if 7 the new rates of rent adjustments differ for  leases 8 on different terms, the tenant has the option  of 9 changing the original lease term to any other  term 10 for which a rate of rent adjustment is set by   the 11 Board with the rental to be adjusted  accordingly.12 And that is taken from  the 13 Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974 Section 4 B.14 To proceed with this dangerous,15 poorly- understood proposal at the meeting tonight 16 is unacceptable both on procedural and  substantive 17 grounds.18 ( Audience participation.)19 MS. HOLDER:	My motion 20 therefore, is to postpone this meeting,  this 21 meeting, the final vote --22 ( Audience participation.)23 MS. HOLDER:	-- or in 24 alternative for this type of proposal, for  a25 supplemental rent adjustment to be withdrawn in  its  	 ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167
1	19 2 entirety.	And, again, I would like to stress to  my 3 colleagues --4 ( Audience participation.)5 MS. HOLDER:	I would like to 6 stress to my colleagues that the assumptions  that 7 the Board -- that our -- that the Board -- that   the 8 staff have made in making this memo,  the 9 assumptions that were made included looking at  the 10 income for all New Yorkers, not just New Yorkers  in 11 rent regulated housing.	New Yorkers meaning 12 everyone in New York City.13 And it is assumes anywhere from  a14 ten percent to a fifteen percent in income  that 15 includes individuals from Wall Street, which  we 16 know during the years in question between 2005  and 17 2008 have experienced upwards of a forty  percent 18 increase in their income.19 This is no way impossible for  us 20 to do.	We can take out that population from  the 21 data.	We can withdraw --22 ( Audience participation.)23 MS. HOLDER:	Our staff, when 24 given enough time, can give us data that is   much 25 more reliable and that actually will take a   fair  	 ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167
1	20 2 look at the rent burdens on rent  stabilized 3 tenants.4 So, again, my motion is for  a5 postponement of this final vote of the  Rent 6 Guidelines Board, or in the alternative, for  the 7 proposal for any supplemental rent adjustment to  be 8 withdrawn in its entirety for this  year.9 ( Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there a --11 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I second the 12 motion.13 ( Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	There was a15 second on the motion.	Mr. Languedoc seconded the 16 motion.17 Any debate on the motion?18 MS. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Mr.20 Schleider.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I don' t believe 22 there' s anything procedurally incorrect about the 23 motion, first.24 Second, this is just another  --25 ( Audience participation.)2 
2 MS. SCHLEIDER:	The staff report 3 is just another in a series of reports,  nothing 4 more nothing less.	There' s nothing further for 5 this Board to discuss in terms of the merits  of 6 this motion.	I don' t see it passing at all.7 ( Audience participation.)8 MS. HOLDER:	But in all fairness,9 in all fairness --10 ( Audience participation.)11 MS. HOLDER:	-- this report --12 this report is longer than most of the  reports 13 issued by our staff.	And when our staff issues 14 reports, they are -- they sit  before us.	We read 15 the reports ahead of time.	We go over the data 16 with our staff who then answers questions that  we 17 have may have.18 And also, after the -- only  after 19 all the reports are issued do we then have  public 20 hearings where we actually invite experts as  well 21 as the public to make comment on the  information 22 that' s been released.23 That has not happened with  this 24 22 - page document full of all kinds of charges and 25 assumptions, assumptions that if given more time  we 2 
2 could actually understand what this  says.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m sorry you need 4 more time to understand this.5 MS. HOLDER:	This was issued at 6 9 : 20 a. m. this morning. This is unacceptable.	I7 won' t even -- without even getting to the 8 substance --9 MS. SCHLEIDER:	The memo is --10 ( Audience participation.)11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- succinctly 12 presented, well formatted, and clear.13 MS. HOLDER:	Without even 14 getting to the substance, which I disagree  with,15 procedurally this is unacceptable.	And we 16 should --17 ( Audience participation.)18 MS. HOLDER:	-- postpone so that 19 there can be considered deliberation on  this 20 report.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any additional 22 debate on the motion?	The motion is to, as  I23 understand it, either to postpone the vote or I' m24 not sure what the second part is because, you   know,25 there is no formal motion before the Board  --2 
2 MS. HOLDER:	So my motion,3 Chair, is to postpone this vote so that we can   have 4 time for considered deliberation and analysis  of 5 this 22 - page report.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	And 7 that' s a second, I assume, Mr. Languedoc.8 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Yes.	Second.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Mr.10 Languedoc seconded that.11 So the motion before the house  is 12 to postpone the meeting.13 Hearing no additional debate --14 ( Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	-- I' m going 16 to call the roll.17 Ms. Adams, on the motion  to 18 postpone the meeting.19 MS. ADAMS:	Mr. Chairman --20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Adams.21 MS. ADAMS:	-- I vote no  because 22 the memo does not raise any issues that I' m  aware 23 of --24 ( Audience participation.)25 MS.

2 wait for Andrew to hand it out to  everybody.3 In advance of offering a  motion 4 with respect to this year' s apartment guideline, I5 would like to make a brief  statement.6 At last year' s final vote, I made 7 a statement outlining the inequities in the  rent 8 stabilization system that limit the members of  this 9 Board from enacting guideline adjustments that 10 target those participants in the rent  stabilization 11 system, both owner and tenant, most  disadvantaged 12 by high costs - the lower income tenant and  the 13 owner of a distressed residential  building.14 A copy of last year' s statement is 15 attached.16 A year later this Board is  still 17 facing the same systemic inequities with  an 18 ever- increasing desire to promulgate more targeted 19 guidelines.20 As indicated by many speakers  at 21 our public hearings, and board members,  this 22 so- called " one- size- fits- all" approach has become 23 antiquated.	It is clear that an across- the- board 24 increase for one- and two- year lease renewals does 25 not target the areas of the stabilized stock  that 2 
2 need larger increases.	At the same time, tenants 3 residing in these buildings are generally the  least 4 able to afford the required  increases.5 Other than agreeing to offer  this 6 -- offer criticism to this " one- size- fits- all"7 approach, there is not much consensus as what  the 8 size variations should be.	Tenant advocates argue 9 that the appropriate size - if one were to draw   an 10 analogy to shoe sizes - should fit a  ballerina' s11 feet while owner advocate -- advocates  believe 12 every response to the Board -- every response  the 13 Board makes should " fit" the feet of a member  of 14 the NBA championship team the Boston  Celtics.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yeah, Boston.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Meanwhile,17 those who advocate for neither side - the  public 18 members of the Rent Guidelines Board - strive  to 19 create a shoe that fits both the ballerina and  the 20 Celtic player. This is just not possible unless  the 21 current version of the Rent -- under the  current 22 version of the Rent Stabilization Law.23 As I indicated last year,  I24 continue to believe that the Rent  Guidelines 25 Board' s role in the stabilization system would be 2 
2 considerably more rational if the  system 3 accommodated an income- based approach. Such an 4 approach is currently not permitted under  the 5 existing law.6 Last year I suggested creating  a7 system modeled on what I believe to be a   highly 8 successful and rational public policy underpinnings 9 of the Senior Citizens Rent Increase Exemption  and 10 the Disability Rent Increase Exemption programs.11 This income- based approach would allow the Board to 12 increase rents to owners while  maintaining 13 affordability for tenants that need it the  most.14 All too often this Board  is 15 pressured to make up for the failures in the  safety 16 net system. The inadequacies and limitations  of 17 such programs as Section 8 , Jiggets and SSI  should 18 not be placed at the feet of this Board nor   should 19 individual owners subsidize tenants' inability to 20 pay rent.21 Government and society must step 22 in to help those -- these less fortunate  tenants.23 It is undoubtedly the case that this Board  has 24 under- compensated owners for expenses incurred in 25 2003 and beyond.2 
2 That year' s Price Index of 3 Operating Costs was 16 . 9 percent. This rise in 4 costs was driven by double- digit increases in 5 taxes, energy costs and insurance, including a  66 6 percent increase in fuel oil  costs.7 Under the commensurate rent 8 adjustment formulas provided by the Board staff  in 9 2003 , which use the PIOC to maintain owners' net 10 operating income, NOI, the lowest  calculated 11 increase for a one- year lease was 10 . 4 percent and 12 for a two- year lease was 12 . 6 percent.	Yet -- in 13 2003 .	Yet, this Board voted for increases  of 14 four- and- a- half for a two- year lease and 7 . 5 for a15 -- four- and- a- half for a one- year lease and 7 . 5 for 16 a two- year.17 Given the circumstances 18 surrounding that particular year when this City  was 19 still reeling from the effects of 9 / 11 , this Board 20 determined that owners were more capable of  bearing 21 these costs than passing them onto tenants.  I22 believe that the actions of this Board in 2003   were 23 justified.	But I also believe that it is now  time 24 to provide compensation to owners consistent  with 25 the dictates of balance.2 
2 Similarly, in 2006 and 2007 , the 3 final guidelines determined by this Board  were 4 below, or in one instance, equal to the  lowest 5 versions of the commensurate rent increases.	Over 6 the past several years rents between long- term 7 tenants versus new or recent tenants have  become 8 increasingly skewed.	Tenants in occupancy for six 9 or more years --10 ( Audience participation.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I believe the 12 actions of this -- over the past several years  the 13 rents between long- term tenants versus new or 14 recent tenants have become increasingly skewed.15 Tenants in occupancy for six years or more  with 16 rents less than $ 1 , 000 pay an estimated median 17 contract rent of $ 745 in 2008 .18 ( Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The median 20 contract rent of all other rent stabilized  tenants 21 is $ 1 , 164 , a difference of over $ 400 . Meanwhile,22 the median operating and maintenance cost  for 23 stabilized units in 2006 was $ 605 per unit. A24 drastic rise in the cost of oil as well  as 25 significant increases in utility costs such  as 2 
2 water and sewer costs since 2006 have  likely 3 resulted in significantly higher per unit  operating 4 and maintenance costs.5 The across- the- board increases 6 have had a substantial impact on raising rents  on 7 the high end, perhaps higher than the rise  in 8 operating expenses, but have had limited impact  at 9 meeting the increase in operating expenses in  units 10 with lower rents.11 A three percent increase on a $ 600 12 rent is $ 18 per month while the same  percentage 13 increase on a $ 1200 rent is $ 36 , double the amount.14 Yet both units face the same increases in  operating 15 and maintenance costs.16 As time goes by, the rents  charged 17 on these higher units have begun to cover  increases 18 in expenses for the lower paying tenant.  Tenants 19 who recently moved into rent stabilized  apartments 20 are now signing leases that often reflect  the 21 market or are certainly closer to market rents  than 22 those paid by long- term tenants.23 Owners have adequate access to 24 increases that allow vacant apartments significant 25 increases in rent. These are the units that  are 2 
2 least likely to need an increase in rents yet it   is 3 these units that benefit most from  the 4 one- size- fits- all approach.5 I believe, and our staff  research 6 has indicated, that tenants that have been in  place 7 for a considerable amount of time are able  to 8 afford a higher percentage of increase and  still 9 maintain affordability. With significant increases 10 in energy costs and water and sewer charges, it  is 11 becoming increasingly harder for owners of 12 distressed and near distressed properties to  cover 13 their operating expenses.14 I therefore, offer the following 15 apartment guidelines for lease renewals.16 ( Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	I move 18 to adopt the language of Apartment and Loft  Order 19 # 40 , as read into the record at this meeting, and I20 further move to adopt the Explanatory Statement  of 21 Findings for Order # 40 substantially in the form 22 submitted by staff to the Board as of June  19 ,23 2008 , and to be modified by the RGB staff  after 24 this meeting to reflect the adopted  rental 25 adjustments and to include the staff' s memo 2 
2 regarding analysis of rent guideline  adjustment 3 dated June 19 , 2008 .4 And finally, I move to adopt  the 5 following rental adjustment for rent  stabilized 6 apartments and lofts.7 Heading: ADJUSTMENT FOR RENEWAL	8 LEASES ( APARTMENTS.)9 Where heat is provided or  required 10 to be provided to a dwelling unit by an owner   from 11 a central or individual system at no charge to   the 12 tenant, the adjustments are as  follows:13 For a one- year renewal lease 14 commencing on or after October 1 , 2008 and on  or 15 before September 30 , 2009 : 4 . 5 percent.16 For a two- year renewal lease 17 commencing on or after October 1 , 2008 and on  or 18 before September 30 , 2009 :	8 . 5 percent, provided,19 however, that where the most recent vacancy  lease 20 was executed six years or prior to the date of   the 21 original lease under this Order, the  following 22 shall instead apply:23 For a one- year lease renewal 24 commencing on or after October 1 , 2008 and on  or 25 before September 30 , 2009 :	4 . 5 percent or $ 45 ,2 
2 whichever is greater.3 For a two- year renewal lease 4 commencing on or after October 1 , 2008 and on  or 5 before September 30 , 2009 :	8 . 5 percent or $ 85 ,6 whichever is greater.7 Where heat is neither provided nor	8 required to be provided to a dwelling unit by   an	9 owner from a central or individual system,  the	10 adjustments are as follows:11 For a one- year renewal lease 12 commencing on or after October 1 , 2008 and on  or 13 before September 30 , 2009 :	4 . 0 percent.14 For a two- year renewal lease 15 commencing on or after October 1 , 2008 and on  or 16 before September 30 , 2009 :	8 . 0 percent , providing,17 however, that where the most recent vacancy  lease 18 was executed six years or more prior to the date   of 19 the renewal lease under this Order, the  following 20 shall instead apply:21 For a one- year renewal lease 22 commencing on or after October 1 , 2008 and on  or 23 before September 30 , 2009 :	4 . 0 percent or $ 40 ,24 whichever is greater.25 For a two- year renewal lease 2 
2 commencing on or after October 1 , 2008 and on  or 3 before September 30 , 2009 :	8 . 0 percent .	No,4 excuse me.	Yes, 8 . 0 percent or $ 80 , whichever is 5 greater.6 Adjustments for renewal leases 7 shall also apply to dwelling units in a  structure 8 subject to the Partial Tax Exemption Program  under 9 Section 421 a of the Real Property Tax Law, or in  a10 structure subject to Section 423 of the  Real 11 Property Tax Law as a Redevelopment  Project.12 A sublet allowance of ten  percent.13 Loft Guidelines.14 For one- year increase periods 15 commencing on or after October 1 , 2008 and on  or 16 before September 30 , 2009 :	3 . 5 percent,17 three- and- a- half percent.18 For a two- year increase period 19 commencing on or after October 1 , 2008 and on  or 20 before September 30 , 2009 :	6 . 5 percent.21 Special Guideline.22 ( 1 ) 50 % above the maximum base 23 rent, or 24 ( 2 ) The Fair Market Rent for 25 existing housing as established by the  United 2 
2 States Department of Housing and Urban  Development 3 ( HUD) for the New York City Primary Metropolitan 4 Statistical Area pursuant to Section 8 ( c)( 1 ) of the 5 United States Housing Act of 1937 ( 42 U. S. C.6 section 1437 f[ c] [ 1 ]) and 24 Code of Federal Rules 7 Part 888 , with such Fair Market Rents to be 8 adjusted based upon whether the tenant pays his  or 9 her own gas and/ or electric charges as part of  his 10 or her rent as such gas and/ or electric charges  are 11 accounted for by the New York City  Housing 12 Authority.13 Such HUD- determined Fair Market 14 Rents will be published in the Federal Register  to 15 take effect on October 1 , 2008 .16 The following examples --17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Get close to the 18 mike.	Stay close to the mike.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The following 20 outlines examples of how the guideline  adjustments 21 would be calculated using different lengths  of 22 tenancies.23 To the Board members, I will  not 24 read those.	You can read the examples here,  but 25 they' re designed to explain and they will be 2 
 2 contained in the Explanatory Statement which  will 3 explain exactly how what we' ve done, if we do  it,4 will happen.5 Do I have a  second?6 MR.

LANGUEDOC:	Mr. Chairman, I13 would like to state --14 ( Audience participation.) 1516171819 MS. HOLDER:	I would just like 20 to say -- I would just like to say that this   entire 21 process is not one that has taken  into 22 consideration the burdens to low- income tenants.23 The proposal -- the proposed 24 increases are outrageous and they' re going to 25 result in increased displacements of  tenants 19 
2 throughout New York City.3 We see in our offices everyday,  at 4 the Legal Aid Society, that tenants are  already 5 being displaced from these high increases.	And6 more and more tenants, low- income New Yorkers,7 middle- income New Yorkers are at the tipping point,8 the very tipping point that is going to change  the 9 way that our City is  here.10 We are losing diversity of  income,11 diversity of ethnicity and race because of  the 12 rents.	This process is broken.	This process needs 13 to be reformed.	But until that time I would beg  my 14 colleagues not to vote for these types  of 15 increases.	They do take into consideration the 16 rent burdens of tenants in New  York City.	They are 17 much, much too high.18I hope that my colleagues  will 19vote against this proposal.20( Audience participation.)21CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any additional 22debate?23Mr. Schleider.24MS. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.25Thank you, Adriene for picking up 
2 on some points that I wanted to  make.3 First of all, accountability, as 4 Nick Webb writes, is a mysterious virtue that  all 5 politicians claim to possess until the time  comes 6 to demonstrate it.7 For the past six preliminary  and 8 final vote meetings, I' ve called on the local 9 politicians to formulate a workable public  policy 10 to preserve the housing stock that' s the backbone 11 of this City. Most claim to have tried, but only   a12 few seem motivated.13 A workable public policy that 14 addresses the realities for income enhancements  to 15 support housing affordability and housing 16 sustainability is desperately needed. Yet  our 17 politicians' inaction belies their claim.	And we 18 have a pressing issue here.19 The advocates for the tenants  and 20 the advocates for the owners labor under a  mandate 21 that unfortunately continues a high level  of 22 polarization.	Without flexibility to address who 23 can afford what rents on an individual basis  and 24 what level of income is truly necessary just  to 25 keep ahead of costs for a particular building,  the 2 
2 existing system of determining rent  guideline 3 increases provides only a reaction. Not a  solution,4 limited or otherwise, but a  reaction.5 ( Audience participation.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Call the 7 question.8 Does everybody understand what the 9 motion is?

SCHLEIDER:	Into the mike.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	-- of the Rent 16 Stabilization Law of 1969 (§ 26 - 501 of the N. Y. C.17 Administrative Code) and in the  Legislative 18 Findings contained in the Emergency  Tenant 19	Protection Act of 1974 ( L. 1974 c. 576 , § 4 [§ 2 ]).20 Dated: June 19 , 2008 .21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I notice that 24 there' s no proviso language in this order.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What?20 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I notice there' s3 no proviso language in this order as had been   in 4 prior orders.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.	I' m6 going to make a motion.	I' d like to move a motion.7 I move to adopt the language  of 8 Hotel # 38 , as read into the record at this meeting,9 and I further move to adopt the  Explanatory 10 Statements of Findings for Order # 38 substantially 11 in the form submitted by the staff to the Board   as12 of June 19 , 2008 and to be modified by  the 13 Guidelines' Board staff after this meeting  to 14 reflect the adopted rental adjustments.15 And finally, I move to adopt  the 16 following rental adjustments for rent  stabilized 17 hotels:18 The allowable level of rent 19 adjustments over the lawful rent actually  charged20 and paid on September 30 , 2008 shall be:21 1 ) residential Class A ( apartment)22 hotels:	Four- and- a- half percent.23 2 ) lodging houses: Four- and- a- half 24 percent.25 3 ) rooming houses:	( Class B2 
2 buildings containing less than 30  units:3 Four- and- a- half percent.4 4 ) Class B hotels:	Four- and- a- half 5 percent.6 5 ) Single Room Occupancy ( Multiple 7 Dwelling Law Section 248 SRO' s):	Four- and- a- half 8 percent.9 In addition, I would like  to 10 suggest a proviso similar to what we' ve done in  the 11 past:12 Except that the allowable level of 13 rent adjustments over the lawful rent  actually 14 charged and paid on September 30 , 2008 shall be 15 zero percent if permanent rent stabilized or  rent 16 controlled tenants paying no more than the  legal 17 regulated rent at the time that any rent  increase 18 in this Order would otherwise be  authorized,19 constitute fewer than 85 percent of all units in   a20 building that are used or occupied, or  intended,21 arranged or designed to be used or occupied  in 22 whole or in part as a home, residence or   sleeping 23 place of one or more human  beings.24 In addition, you have before  you,25 which I won' t read into the record, but I  consider 2 
2 it part of the record, the Board' s intent in  terms 3 of the administration of the proviso which  is 4 similar to the intent that we have previously  read 5 into the record.6 Just to make it clear,  this 7 particular motion does increase the amounts,  from 8 the last time we adopted a proviso, from 80 to   85 9 percent.10 Is there a second on that  motion?11 MR. KIMMEL:	Second.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Second.13 Any debate?14 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Mr. Chairman, I15 have a question about the  proviso.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.17 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Are you saying 18 85 percent of the units of a building or 85   percent 19 of the tenants residing in a  building?20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I think if 21 you look at the -- I' ll read the example.22 Mr. Languedoc, would you like me 23 to read it?	Mr. Languedoc, would you like me  to 24 read it?25 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Yes, please.2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes you said?3 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Yes, please.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.5 The Board' s intention for the 6 meaning of this proviso is that all dwelling  units 7 in the hotel, whether occupied, vacant, rented  to 8 tourists, transients, contract clients, students or 9 other non- permanent tenants, or to permanent rent 10 stabilized tenants, be counted in the  denominator 11 of the calculation.12 The only type of units in  the 13 hotel that may be excluded from the denominator  are 14 units that are used as stores or for  similar 15 business purposes such as doctor' s offices.16 The numerator of the calculation 17 is the number of units occupied by permanent  rent 18 stabilized or rent controlled tenants.19 Here are two examples:	One hotel 20 has 100 units and two stores. Thirty- two units are 21 rented to permanent rent stabilized tenants.	Ten 22 are vacant and 58 are rented to transients  and 23 tourists. The calculation is as  follows:24 The denominator is 100 and  the 25 numerator is 32 .	This calculation results in an 2 
2 occupancy percentage of less than 85 percent  under 3 the formula ( 32 percent) and an increase cannot be 4 taken for the permanent stabilized tenants.5 Example Two: A hotel has  150 6 units, two of which are used by a dentist and   a7 doctor for their businesses.	Eight are rented to 8 tourists.	Five are vacant and 135 are occupied  by 9 permanent rent stabilized tenants.10 The denominator would be 148  and 11 the numerator would be 135 .12 This calculation results in an 13 occupancy percentage greater than 85 percent  under 14 the formula ( 91 percent) and an increase can  be 15 taken for the permanent stabilized tenants.16 Does that answer your question,17 Mr. Languedoc?18 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Yes.	Thank you.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes?20 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Yes.	Thank you.21 I' d like to --22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any additional 23 discussion?24 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I' d like to move 25 for a friendly amendment to the  motion.2 

23	something?4
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you saying MR. LANGUEDOC:	I' d like to move 
5 for a friendly amendment to the motion to lower   the 6 increases from 4 . 5 percent to three percent.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	To what, three 8 percent?9 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Three point zero 10 percent.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I think under 12 the Robert' s Rules of Order I can choose not  to 13 accept that so I choose not to accept  it.14 Any additional motions?15 ( No response.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Call the 17 question.18 Ms. Adams.19 MS.
