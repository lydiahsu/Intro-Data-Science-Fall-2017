P R O C E E D I N G    SCHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Good evening,My name is Jonathan Kimmel,  Chair 
 7 of the Rent Guidelines Board.	I’ d like to welcome 8 you to this public meeting.9 This is the final meeting  in 10 a series of public meetings and hearings  to 11 determine renewal lease adjustments for  rent 12 stabilized housing units in New York City  with 13 leases commencing or being renewed on or  after 14 October 1 , 2010 , and on or before September 30 th, 15	2011 .16 Before we go into the business,  I17 would just like to take a moment to  publicly 18 acknowledge the staff of the Rent Guidelines  Board;19 Andrew, Brian, Danielle, Leon and Charmaine,  who 20 have worked --21 ( Applause.)22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	-- who have 23 worked tirelessly to provide the members of  this 24 board with their extensive research and  analyses.25 Their work has proven to be  an 16 
2 invaluable resource to this board in  our 3 determination of the guidelines.	As Chair, and I4 will take the liberty of speaking for the  entire 5 board, thank you for your  efforts.6 Now I will have to read  the 7 language of the 2010 Apartment and Loft Order # 42 .8 Order Number 42 - Apartments  and 9 Lofts, rent levels for leases commencing October 1 ,10 2010 through September 30 , 2011 .11 NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN PURSUANT TO 12 THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN THE NEW YORK CITY  RENT 13 GUIDELINES BOARD BY THE RENT STABILIZATION LAW  OF 14 1969 , as amended, and the Emergency Tenant 15 Protection Act of 1974 , as amended, as extended by 16 Chapter 82 of the Laws -- no, I missed that.

2 any, due under such clause except those  charges 3 which accrued within one year of the  commencement 4 of the renewal lease.5 Moreover, where a lease contained 6 an escalator clause that the owner may  validly 7 renew under the Code, unless the owner elects  or 8 has elected in writing to delete such  clause,9 effective no later than October 1 , 2010 from the 10 existing lease and all subsequent leases for  such 11 dwelling unit, the increased rental, if any,  due 12 under such escalator clause shall be offset  against 13 the amount of increase authorized under this  order.14 SPECIAL ADJUSTMENTS UNDER PRIOR	15 ORDERS.16 All rent adjustments lawfully 17 implemented and maintained under previous  apartment 18 orders and included in the base rent in effect  on 19 September 30 , 2010 shall continue to be included in 20 the base rent for the purpose of  computing 21 subsequent rents adjusted pursuant to this  Order.22 SPECIAL GUIDELINE.23 Under Section 26 - 513 ( b)( 1 ) of 24 the New York City Administrative Code, and  Section 25 9 ( e) of the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 2

 2 STATEMENT OF BASIS AND PURPOSE.3 The Rent Guidelines Board is 4 authorized to promulgate rent guidelines  governing 5 apartment units subject to the Rent  Stabilization 6 Law of 1969 , as amended, and the Emergency Tenant 7 Protection Act of 1974 , as amended.	The purpose of 8 these guidelines is to implement the public  policy 9 set forth in Findings and Declaration of  Emergency 10 of the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 (§ 26 - 501 of 11 the N. Y. C. Administrative Code) and in the 12 Legislative Findings contained in the  Emergency 13 Tenant Protection Act of 1974 ( c. 576 , of the laws 14	of 1974 § 4 [§ 2 ].)15 The Rent Guidelines Board is  also 16 authorized to promulgate rent guidelines for  loft 17 units subject to Section 286 subdivision 7 of  the 18 Multiple Dwellings Law.	The purpose of the loft 19 guidelines is to implement the public policy  set 20 forth in the Legislative Findings of Article  C21 ( sic) of the Multiple Dwelling Law ( Section 280 ).22 With that read into the record,  do 23 I hear a resolution proposed?24 Mr. Languedoc.25 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you, Mr.15 

2	Chair.3
I make the following motion:	I
4 move that this board adopt adjustment for  renewal 5 leases for apartments for one- year renewal lease,6 zero percent;7 For two- year renewal lease, zero 8 percent;9 Vacancy allowance for apartments,10 there shall be no vacancy  allowance;11 Sublease allowance, zero percent;12 Adjustment for loft units for 13 one- year increase, zero percent;14 For two- year increase, zero 15 percent;16 Zero vacancy increase, zero 17 vacancy allowance for lofts;18 The special guideline for units 19 that become decontrolled shall be 150 percent  of 20 the rent controlled rent; and 21 The permissible increase for 22 decontrolled units under Order A, 3 a, shall be 50 23 percent.24 And in support of that motion,  I25 would just like to note that the Price Index  of 4 
2 Operating Costs or PIOC, completed by the staff  of 3 the board, was only 3 . 4 percent. That is the lowest 4 since 2002 . It’ s been very low inflation.	There’ s5 been a loss of over 10 , 000 rent stabilized units in 6 2009 , creating a scarcity problem.	And in the 7 meantime, the income of rent stabilized  households 8 has declined. Unemployment is at near record  levels 9 and affordable housing has become  increasingly 10 scarce.11 VOICES:	We can’ t hear you.12 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Can you hear me 13 now?14 VOICES:	Yes.15 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I’ m sorry.	I do 16 that every year.	At what point did you not  hear 17 me?18 VOICES:	All of it.19 MR. LANGUEDOC:	All of it.	I’ ll 20 start again.21 ( Audience participation.)22 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay.	In support 23 of my motion for a rent freeze, the board’ s  Price 24 Index of Operating Costs is 3 . 4 percent.	That’ s25 the lowest since 2002 .	The City has lost over 2 
2 10 , 000 rent stabilized units, a net loss of over 3 10 , 000 rent stabilized units in 2009 . There’ s been 4 very low inflation. In the meantime, the  median 5 household income for rent stabilized tenants  has 6 declined. The unemployment rate is at record  highs,7 hovering around ten percent.	And the supply of 8 affordable housing that’ s affordable to low income 9 households has become increasingly scarce.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is there a11 second?12 ( Applause.)13 MS. HOLDER:	I second that 14 motion.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.16 MS. HOLDER:	I too have a17 statement. It’ s been a particularly difficult year,18 not only for this board, but more importantly  for 19 all New Yorkers. And we see that in the  testimony 20 that’ s come before us.21 But to add to that, what  we 22 actually do see, is we see that over time that   the 23 landlords who’ ve been awarded increases by this 24 board year after year.	If we actually look at  it,25 what we see is that the landlords -- and it’ s  clear 2 
2 evidence that the owners' average net  operating 3 incomes have been kept whole over the long term  of 4 rent stabilization, a period when tenant  rent 5 burdens have risen dramatically. And we’ ve seen 6 that over and over again.7 In the analysis of rent  burden 8 data, median across the board rent income  ratios 9 tend to be inert over time, while poor and  near 10 poor tenants are struggling with rapidly  escalating 11 rent burdens. And we must care to consider  the 12 impacts on lower income tenants. If not this  year,13 I don’ t know when.14 This has been a  particularly 15 difficult year and in light of the last two  years,16 much more higher increases than what was  really 17 warranted. We would like to see that there be  a18 rent freeze. We think it’ s what’ s fair.	We think 19 it’ s what needs to happen in this economy.	We need 20 to take into consideration what is going on  with 21 the renters and the tenant  community.22 And according to the law, we  must 23 consider first, the economic condition of  the 24 residential real estate industry and the  affected 25 area, including such factors as the prevailing  and 2 
2 projected real estate taxes and sewer water  rates,3 gross operating maintenance costs, including 4 insurance rates, governmental fees, cost of  fuel 5 and labor costs, and cost and availability  of 6 financing, including effective rates of interest,7 and the overall supply of housing  accommodations 8 and overall vacancy rates, as well as relevant  data 9 from the current and projected cost of  living 10 indices for the affected area and such other  data 11 as may be made available to  us.12 We have an excellent staff  that 13 has prepared wonderful reports for us.	And they 14 include, " The Changes to the Rent Stabilized 15 Housing Stock in New York City in  2009 ."	" The 2010 16 Housing Supply Report."	The 2010 Price Index of 17 Operating Costs."	" The 2010 Income Affordability 18 Study."	" The 2010 Income and Expense Study" and 19 " The 2010 Mortgage Survey Report."20 And all that I mean to say by  just 21 reciting what it is that this board knows too  well 22 about what is the law and the reports that we   have 23 that have been provided to us by our most  excellent 24 staff, is just to say that there is a totality   of 25 things that we need to  look at.	We need to look at 2 
2 a bunch of things. But what we’ re seeing 3 consistently year after year after year, and what’ s4 been compounded year after year after year,  are 5 unwarranted increases to tenants' rents.	And the 6 rent burdens continue to escalate.7 And the time is now. This is  the 8 year that we should have a rent freeze.  Westchester 9 has done it.10 ( Audience Participation.)11 MS. HOLDER:	The Westchester 12 County Rent Guidelines Board understood that  those 13 apartments covered by the ETPA, the majority  of 14 them in southern Westchester and neighborhoods  such 15 as Mount Vernon, New Rochelle and Yonkers,  that 16 those tenants needed to have a rent freeze  this 17 year.18 And Nassau County Rent Guidelines 19 Board did it.	They did a rent freeze for the  first 20 year and one- half of one percent for two- year lease 21 renewals.	And those are both processes that  where 22 you actually had landlords that opened up  their 23 books and with all the evidence before them,  that 24 is what those two rent guidelines  board did.	And 25 we think it is the right thing  to do.	And given 2 
2 the fact that in New York City, we  have 3 disproportionate amounts of low income  people 4 living in this housing stock, this is the time  this 5 year in New York City for a rent  freeze.6 ( Audience participation.)7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 I’ d like to call the vote on Mr.9 Languedoc’ s proposal.10 Ms. Adams.11 MS.

9 Chairman.	Thank you, board members and welcome  to 10 the public assembly gathered here.11 In this year’ s scheduled meetings 12 and reports, deliberations and airing of points  of 13 views emphasized that the continued economic 14 insecurity affecting most everyone in this  great 15 hall and throughout New York City, both tenants  and 16 landlords, has brought stress, worries,  troubles 17 and uncertainty.	Though the individual 18 circumstances are varied in both type and  depth,19 nonetheless, living life in New York City  has 20 become more of a challenge. And providing  safe,21 affordable housing has become more of a  challenge,22 a great deal more challenging.23 In fact, our staff reporting cites 24 a government- sponsored survey that shows that 25 despite on- going efforts by a number of government 9 
2 agencies and nonprofit groups, housing 3 affordability remains an issue in a city  ranked 4 11 th overall among 71 big cities nationwide during 5	2008 .6 The 2009 ACCRA data shows 7 Manhattan has the highest cost of living index  in 8 that nation, with Brooklyn the third highest  and 9 Queens the fifth highest. Nationally, Manhattan  is 10 the most expensive.	Brooklyn and Queens third and 11 fifth most expensive in the  nation.12 You can’ t get away from the fact 13 that it’ s expensive to live in this city and it’ s14 expensive to provide housing in the City. But  we 15 know that the cost of living has risen - and   risen 16 sharply - with hidden price increases, usually  a17 smaller packaging or less product in the same  size 18 package for the price you’ re used to paying.	This 19 means hidden price increases, up to 30 percent  in 20 some cases.	Smaller portions, less product in  the 21 box or can than you used to get, all hidden   price 22 increases and many of these within the past  year 23 alone.24 Looking at the cost of food  and 25 household items over the past ten years, the  rate 6 
2 of price increase - just what you pay at the   cash 3 register - has dramatically increased.	And when 4 you also consider the smaller amounts that you  get 5 for high price, your dollar  has shrunk.	The dollar 6 doesn’ t go as far as it used to go. Food  and 7 household items cost way more than they  did.8 However, your apartment didn’ t get 9 smaller.	And the rent increases passed by   this 10 board has always been far, far lower than  the 11 increase you pay for food and household  items.12 ( Audience participation.)13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Far, far lower.14 In fact, the rate of rent increase has never  kept 15 up with the rent of real price  increases.16 And I pointed out before that  the 17 staff reports show meager property incomes  for 18 Bronx apartment buildings contrasted with the 19 higher incomes for the luxury buildings in the  core 20 Manhattan neighborhoods.21 We’ ve seen the incomes for 22 properties in the Bronx move down year after  year 23 despite some upward property income movement  in 24 other boroughs.	Clearly, there is no consistent 25 movement in property income Citywide, let  alone 2 
2 year to year.	In fact, the Citywide average  rate 3 of property operating income growth is 38  percent 4 lower than last year.	Average cost growth is 23 5 percent higher than last year. Costs rose  23 6 percent faster than the prior years rate of  cost 7 growth.8 In fact, the staff reports  show 9 the only consistency is that stabilized  rent 10 increases have roughly mirrored inflation and 11 owners' cost have increased far,  far faster.	The 12 staff reports also don’ t account for hidden costs.13 We’ ve seen the evidence of this 14 as one in nine properties are distressed,  an 15 increase over last year.	And distressed because 16 rents don’ t cover expenses.	That’ s expenses before 17 debt service.	More than eleven percent of  the 18 rental buildings rent collections do not  cover 19 operating expenses:	Fuel, water and sewer,20 electricity gas, real estate taxes,  repairs,21 insurance, all before the bank gets  paid.22 And hardship rent increases cannot 23 be processed by the State.	Year after year DHCR 24 has testified that the hardship increase  process 25 doesn’ t work. There is no DHCR relief for these 2 
2 properties.	Adequate increases from this board are 3 needed to prevent further deterioration of  the 4 housing stock.5 And for those properties able  to 6 meet operating costs, how have  they fared?	Well,7 the landlords collect the rent.	The landlords are 8 telling us that they don’ t own their buildings.9 They’ re not full owners any longer. Landlords have 10 a partner that’ s unforgiving and demands payment 11 first. The partner gets its money before  the 12 landlord. That partner is the City.	The City takes 13 almost 25 cents of each dollar collected of  income 14 for these buildings.15 ( Audience participation.)16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And that 17 percentage is rising and it’ s rising fast.	Real 18 estate taxes, water and sewer charges,19 administrative fees, all rising and rising  fast.20 And the number of distressed properties is  expected 21 to rise because of this.22 As a board, we can’ t address the 23 particular issues and problems of individual  owners 24 and tenants, nor can we address of the issues  of 25 types of buildings or groupings of tenants  as 2 
2 separate and apart from the total universe  of 3 landlords and tenants. We’ ve struggled with this,4 but we’ re locked into our mandate to consider 5 guidelines appropriate for the vast majority of  the 6 housing stock.7 Unfortunately, the statute 8 presently does not allow us flexibility to  isolate 9 those least able or most in need, both tenants  and 10 landlords.	And that was reinforced by a judge  who 11 negated our attempt to think outside the box  with 12 the minimum dollar rent increases.13 Well, the Appellate Division 14 affirming vacating the minimum dollar  rent 15 increases under Rent Guidelines Board Orders  Nos.16 40 and 41 , says that our politicians in the  City 17 Council have the ability and power to  establish 18 classifications of housing accommodations, and, if 19 deemed necessary, to thereby allow for 20 differentiations of rental treatment.21 The City Council has had  the 22 ability and power to allow us flexibility  in 23 setting rent guidelines. But they’ ve chosen not to.24 The Appellate Division said that they have  the 25 ability and the power. The politicians, the  very 2 
2 same critics of this board, who have had  the 3 ability and power to allow us the flexibility  to 4 address issues and problems of landlords  and 5 tenants with a more appropriate method,  have 6 refused us the flexibility.7 Yet these politicians want this 8 board to do more of the Council’ s work.9 ( Audience participation.)10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	These politicians 11 who get paid with taxpayer money want this board  to 12 do their work.	They expect us to maintain a  social 13 safety net by expanding an entitlement  program 14 funded by landlords through inadequate rent 15 increases.	This board and these deliberations  are 16 not a forum for social justice issues nor should  it 17 be a forum for redistributive  agenda.18 Again, the City has a  demanding 19 partner through its politicians, wants to take  over 20 these buildings with hidden and outright  taxes,21 fees, and not allowing this board the  flexibility 22 to address particular issues and problems  with 23 adequate guideline adjustments.24 I say again, we need to move as  a25 board toward a more realistic attitude  that 2 
2 supposes not all landlords are able to make  it 3 without assistance in meeting rising costs,  crimped 4 cash flows and draining on their savings, and  that 5 most tenants can and should bear their share of  the 6 rising real estate taxes, water and sewer  charges,7 unfunded mandates and prospect of rising  operating 8 costs.9 ( Audience participation.)10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Without proper and 11 fair rent increases --12 ( Audience participation.)13 MR. SCHLEIDER: -- the landlords 14 are again --15 ( Audience participation.)16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- the landlords 17 are again shouldering the expense of what is  a18 public subsidy.19 ( Audience participation.)20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The staff report 21 focusing on the rent increase formulae noted  that 22 the rise in core expenses was three- and- a- half 23 percent.24 ( Audience participation.)25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And that next 2 
2 year’ s core expense will be 6 . 7 percent.3 ( Audience participation.)4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	These suggest 5 modest one and two- year increases will be necessary 6 to protect the viability of our regulated  housing 7 stock.8 ( Audience participation.)9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Testimony from 10 owners and managers of apartment buildings  confirm 11 the rapid rise in operating costs and  were 12 surprised at the low percentage increases in  our 13 report.14 ( Audience participation.)15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	However, reality 16 says the costs have risen have far more  with 17 testimony suggesting minimum one- year renewal lease 18 increases up to ten percent are  necessary.19 ( Audience participation.)20 MR.

HOLDER:	Just a couple of 19 points.20 Mr. Schleider outlined the process 21 as it stands now, the information that’ s come 22 before us and detailed the economic reality.  He 23 also, rightfully so, stated the realities of  things 24 that are going on in different counties. It is  true 25 what he says about property taxes here in New  York 3 

2	City.3
But the same way that  property 
4 taxes are an issue in New York City, the same   way 5 that the loss of subsidies or the inability to  get 6 subsidies for low income tenants who live  in 7 housing in New York City is scarce and  difficult.8 These are all issues that everyone tells us and  we 9 know, are issues that the City takes up or that   the 10 State takes up.11 And I would just suggest, the  same 12 way that tenants are told every year that we  should 13 go speak to legislators or we should continue  to 14 work with groups such as the Legal Aid Society  and 15 other community- based organizations to get things 16 for tenants and to realize some type of fairness  in 17 the process, I would also suggest that there  are 18 things that happen with owners' expenses that  need 19 to be taken up by  government.20 And what I think is most  important 21 for us to realize is that we are a part of   this 22 process. We are a part of the process  that 23 continues to burden tenants. And so again,  not 24 taking ourselves out of it and not saying that  we 25 should not be held to the same standard, but  just 4 
2 like the politicians that come before us that  we 3 would like to hold accountable, and just  like 4 Albany and what goes on there that we’ d like to  see 5 real reform and change, I say to this board that   we 6 need to be very conscientious and very  considerate 7 and thoughtful about what it is that we’ re doing 8 this year.9 The proposal made by my  colleague,10 Mr. Schleider is too high.11 I vote no.12 ( Audience participation.)13 MS.

LEVINE:	Mr. Chair, I would 
2 like to make a  proposal.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Levine.4 MS. LEVINE:	In anticipation of 5 making this proposal, I have a statement that I’ d6 like to make.7 A VOICE:	( Inaudible.)8 MS. LEVINE:	I do, all of you.9 If one only read the first  few 10 pages of Gone With The Wind, one would be left   with 11 the belief that the South had trammeled  the 12 Northern invaders and prevailed conclusively in  The 13 War of Northern Aggression.14 For a naive witness to  these 15 proceedings, one would have an equally  strong 16 misunderstanding of where the power lies in  the 17 regulation and treatment of the housing  community 18 and how the inequities in our system  are 19 promulgated.20 After serving four years on  this 21 Board, I have a colossal sense of  accumulated 22 frustration from hearing testimony from  both 23 landlord and tenant groups. Tenants tell us  of 24 losing health benefits, freezing of their  Social 25 Security payment amounts, losing jobs or  enduring 2 
2 wage freezes, and violations in their  buildings,3 and reflectively state that this economic  climate,4 whatever the “ this” is, is the worst they have  ever 5 seen and therefore there must be a rent  freeze.6 Landlords tell us their woeful 7 tales of aging buildings with higher  maintenance 8 costs, increases in taxes and water and  sewer 9 rents, and demonstrate how this board has failed  to 10 compensate them for their expenses over the  long 11 term.12 Most notably, however, public 13 officials, elected by all of you, who actually  have 14 the power to change the laws, come before us  each 15 year and cynically shift the burden of  tenant 16 affordability issues onto this body rather  than 17 showing any leadership and any  purposeful 18 meaningful reform.19 ( Applause.)20 MS. LEVINE:	Each group, it seems,21 testifies so as to create the impression that  the 22 power to alleviate each of the burdens that  you 23 suffer from lies in the hands of the members  of 24 this elite little group.	Not one of these groups 25 mentions any culpability they may have, or  even 2 
2 offers to participate in a constructive  dialogue.3 As we began our deliberations  this 4 week, the Appellate Division of the New  York 5 Supreme Court handed down its judgment  upholding 6 the lower court’ s invalidation of the minimum rent 7 increases that we voted on and passed in 2008 and  8	2009 .9 ( Audience participation.)10 MS. LEVINE:	This Board proposed 11 the imposition of these increases as the result  of 12 mighty struggles to attempt to distinguish  among 13 the vast array of economic and housing  problems 14 presented to us in an effort to overcome  the 15 weaknesses of the “ one size fits all” response.16 Clearly, the judicial branch felt 17 differently.	Their interpretation of the  statute 18 is that we have only narrow authority to issue  a19 percentage guideline for the maximum increase  in 20 stabilized rents, that is, pick a number and  then 21 go home.22 This year, the rent stabilization 23 program lost the largest amount of units since  the 24 Rent Guidelines Board first started  formally 25 compiling this information into a report in 2003 .9 
2 These losses are caused by a variety of  factors,3 including high rent/ vacancy decontrol, cooperative 4 and condominium conversion, expiration of 421 - a and 5 J- 51 benefits, substantial rehabilitation and other 6 causes.7 While we lament these losses, and 8 recognize the contribution of these losses to  the 9 ongoing housing emergency in New York  City,10 stopping this loss is far outside the purview  of 11 the nine members of this board.	Instead, the power 12 to change the laws precipitating those losses  lies 13 solely in the hands of the New York  State 14 Legislature.	And as long as rents remain   low,15 landlords will continue to be incentivized  to 16 convert their buildings to co- ops or condos.17 That’ s called a free market.18 ( Audience participation.)19 MS. LEVINE:	The impact of the 20 ongoing recession has hurt all of us and  all 21 constituencies.	One of the biggest consequences of 22 the Wall Street meltdown is a contraction of  the 23 tax base in New York City.	Nonetheless, money must 24 be found somewhere to pay the bills. Turning to  the 25 landlord community to plug the gap is the  political 2 
2 equivalent of saying “ the butler did it."3 Accordingly, the New York City Council voted  in 4 10 . 1 percent increases in real estate taxes, the 5 second consecutive year of double digit  increases 6 and an increase of 12 . 9 percent for water and sewer 7 costs.8 And upon the heels of  such 9 increases, the Speaker and numerous members of  the 10 New York City Council came before this board  and 11 testified in favor of a rent freeze. The  statute 12 under which we operate expressly states the  taxes 13 and sewer and water rates are factors to  be 14 considered in determining the guidelines.15 From members of the body  imposing 16 these increases of landlords to then come here  and 17 tell us to ignore the statute and ignore the  impact 18 of the very increases that they imposed is not  only 19 disingenuous, it’ s an abdication of the 20 responsibilities they sought when running  for 21 office to serve the people of New York  City.22 ( Applause.)23 MS. LEVINE:	No one can be 24 squeezed in both cost and income and continue  to 25 provide the same services and  product.2 
2 But on the other side we  have 3 heard testimony of increasing levels of 4 homelessness in New York City.	Those leaving 5 homeless shelters rarely find housing in  stabilized 6 units.	With no income to measure to quality  for 7 stabilized housing, people with incomes far  in 8 excess of meeting the benefits of  stabilization 9 remain in their units creating an  artificial 10 shortage.11 Tenants have been crying, “ open 12 your books” to landlord for years.	Perhaps it is 13 time for the Legislature to ask the same  question 14 of tenants, and those paying, perhaps, less than  20 15 or 25 percent of their income to lose the  benefit 16 of stabilized housing, not the unit from  the 17 system, but the individual tenant claim to  a18 subsidized rent.19 I do not believe that  seeking 20 solutions to the housing process should be  an 21 adversarial process, landlords vs. Tenants, elected 22 officials against the public, appointed board 23 members vs. The City Council.	In fact, the members 24 of this board work with each other in a   cooperative 25 spirit striving to find a solution within  the 2 
2 narrow framework of the law. It is imperative  that 3 we look beyond this annual chimera of thinking  that 4 we can achieve a solution to the problems  of 5 landlords and tenants by arriving at the  right 6 number for rent increases. Both sides  have 7 maintained that any number that is not the  number 8 they choose will only exacerbate  the problem.	I9 agree.	But that is all we’ re empowered to do.	My 10 colleague, Betty Adams, said one number’ s too low,11 one number’ s too high.12 ( Audience participation.)13 MS. LEVINE:	This isn’ t the three 14 little bears and we’ re not Goldilocks.	I don’ t15 know that we’ re going to find a number that’ s just 16 right.17 ( Audience participation.)18 MS. LEVINE:	While we are 19 confident that the number we will arrive at is  the 20 best given the limited arena in which we operate,  I21 turn to those with the power to address the  wide 22 set of concerns to begin immediate action and  not 23 rest on blaming the Rent Guidelines Board  for 24 failing to fix that which it cannot  do.25 ( Audience participation.)2 
2 MS. LEVINE: It is up to you,  the 3 State and City legislators that come before us  and 4 I implore you to create mechanisms  for:5 ( 1 ), expanding the access to 6 existing programs for tenants in need of  relief;7 ( 2 ) analyzing the longevity 8 problem which distorts rents by considering  an 9 income test for tenants under regulated  leases;10 ( Applause.)11 MS. LEVINE:	( 3 ), providing 12 meaningful incentives to owners to maintain  the 13 existing affordable housing stock;14 ( 4 ), creating new programs for 15 inducing owners to build new affordable  housing 16 units;17 ( 5 ), providing tax relief for you.18 Providing tax relief for landlord expenses such  as 19 compliance with lead paint laws, sidewalk  violation 20 impositions, new fuel changes that will benefit  our 21 community but nevertheless increase landlord costs.22 And I say, not capitalize over some arbitrary  use 23 for life figure, but expensed in the year in   which 24 those costs are incurred.25	( 6 ) --
 2 ( Audience participation.)3 MS. LEVINE:	I have called on the 4 legislature to do those items.5 ( 6 ), spreading the burden of 6 paying for affordable housing among taxpayers  so 7 that landlords do not bear a  disproportionate 8 burden by expanding housing credit programs for  the 9 most needy; and.10 ( 7 ), continuing the imposition of 11 serious sanctions and enforcing them  against 12 landlords with longstanding violations on  their 13 buildings.14 ( Audience participation.)15 MS. LEVINE:	Finally, in response 16 to accusations that this body is “ a sham," “ a17 circus sideshow," “ lacks objectivity” or that we 18 are in the pocket of the Mayor, as I sit here now,  19	--20 ( Audience participation.)21 MS. LEVINE:	-- I affirm to you 22 that I don’ t know what the final guideline is  going 23 to be. We have discussed it among ourselves  in 24 groups of two, three, and four  all week.	But we 25 have no agreement as of  this moment.	I have not 20 
2 spoken with anyone about this other than the  eight 3 people to my right and left.	At the end of the 4 night, we will, for many of us, begrudgingly  agree 5 to some numbers.	None of us will feel  satisfied.6 None of us will feel that we have served  the 7 public.	None of us will feel that we  have 8 adequately addressed any other problems faced  by 9 anyone sitting in this audience tonight  --10 ( Audience participation.)11 MS. LEVINE:	-- or eagerly 12 watching NY 1 to --13 ( Audience participation.)14 MS. LEVINE: None of us will  feel 15 that we have adequately addressed any of  the 16 problems faced by anyone sitting in this  audience 17 tonight or eagerly watching NY 1 to see what is 18 happening to their rent or net operating income  in 19 the coming year. But that is all we’ re empowered to 20 do.	If you don’ t believe me, I refer you not   only 21 to the governing statute but to the Decision  and 22 Order of the Supreme Court, Appellate  Division,23 First Department, dated June 22 , 2010 in the matter 24 of Casado v. Markus.25 ( Audience participation.)2 
2 MS. LEVINE:	Each year that I  have 3 been on this board, I have offered to work  on 4 meaningful legislative reform with tenant  groups,5 landlord groups, or to work with members of  the 6 City Council or State Legislature.7 To date, no one has ever taken  me 8 up on my offer.9 ( Audience participation.)10 MS. LEVINE:	Nevertheless, I urge 11 each person sitting in this room to speak to   the 12 people on the other side of the  room.13 ( Audience participation.)14 MS. LEVINE:	Look for the problems 15 that you can unite over to address.	Look for the 16 solutions that are mutually acceptable.	And then 17 turn to the people with the actual power to  address 18 them, your elected representatives, and  demand 19 substantive changes to the obsolete law under  which 20 we labor.21 ( Audience participation.)22 MS. LEVINE:	Only you have the 23 power to change the system. I hope that you  will 24 use your voices and be heard by the people who   can 25 do more than just listen.2 
2 And with that I propose  increases 3 in the following amounts:4 1 . 75 % for a one- year lease and 5 3 . 75 % for a two- year lease.6 ( Audience participation.)7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is there a8 second?9 MS. ADAMS:	I second, Mr. Chair.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Adams 11 seconds the motion.12 MS. HOLDER:	Did she -- she 13 just did for the apartment increases.	I’ m sorry.14 MS. LEVINE:	I’ m off.

ADAMS:	Mr. Chairman, I would 21 like to commend my colleague, Ms. Levine for  the 22 statement that she made.	Because I think it 23 summarizes the frustrations that many of  the 24 members of this board have felt, particularly  the 25 public members.2 
2 And so I would just like  to 3 commend her on that.	And I vote yes.4 ( Audience participation.)5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Adams votes 6 yes.7 Ms. Cruz.8 MR.

Nevertheless, I’ m going to 6 vote for the motion because I believe that the  only 7 way that the board can come to some kind  of 8 consensus and have the lowest possible  rent 9 increase is by supporting this  motion.10 And so I vote yes.11 ( Applause.)12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Languedoc 13 votes yes.14 Ms. Levine.15 MS.

It 6 is true, and I would like everyone to know,  that 7 this board actually does talk to  each other.	We 8 don’ t agree on many, many issues.9 This has been one of the  most 10 frustrating years.	The last two years with the 11 supplemental increases were definitely very,  very 12 frustrating for so many of us on the board. I   know 13 that my colleagues thought that they  were 14 fashioning something creative.	Ron and I15 definitely thought that it was something that  was 16 illegal, which I documented in a memo to the   board 17 two years ago.18 ( Applause.)19 MS. HOLDER:	But definitely, but 20 definitely something that we did not think  was 21 warranted, regardless of the legality, was  not 22 warranted in terms of the philosophy behind  it.23 I do want folks to know, and  I24 want our constituency to know, that despite  the 25 fact that it looks as if this has not passed, I   am 2 
2 voting yes. And I want folks to understand why.  We 3 have debated -- and I want it on the record --   that 4 we had talked about this as a board. It is   very 5 important to me that folks understand that Ron  and 6 I have been working very hard.	We understand 7 what’ s on the table. We understand what’ s at stake.8 This is a very difficult year for everyone not  just 9 with the economy, but also dealing with  the 10 realities of what’ s happening politically and with 11 Albany.12 I vote yes to this motion,  Chair.13 My colleague, Ms. Levine, I14 appreciate the discourse that we’ ve been able to 15 have this year, as a discourse we’ ve also been  able 16 to have with other public members.	Thank you for 17 your statement.	I don’ t agree with everything in 18 your statement Risa, but you know that that  would 19 not necessarily be the case.	But I do appreciate 20 your motion today. And I want folks to know  that 21 we’ re working very hard to try to figure something 22 out.

I know  this 9 is going to have an impact on the tenants and  I’ m10 so sorry, but I’ m very concerned with what’ s going 11 to happen with your rents this year. I think  this 12 is the best that we can be able to do this   year.13 I vote yes.14 ( Applause.)15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Holder 16 votes yes.17 Mr. Wenk.18 MR. WENK:	Yes.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Wenk votes 20 yes.21 Before I cast my vote, I  would 22 like to make a brief  statement.23 Each year this board is  required 24 to set renewal lease adjustments for hundreds  of 25 thousands of rent stabilized apartments  throughout 2 
2 New York City. As Chair and a public member,  I3 recognize the importance of considering all  the 4 housing data presented to this board by the  Rent 5 Guidelines Board staff, housing experts and 6 government agencies.7 Serious consideration is also 8 given to public testimony of tenants, owners  and 9 public officials, which I believe helps the  board 10 realize the issues faced by those affected by  the 11 decisions of this board.	Each group brings valued 12 concerns and arguments before us. Therefore, I  find 13 it necessary to balance the needs of both  tenants 14 and owners when setting renewal lease  adjustments.15 In analyzing data presented to 16 this board, it is clear to me that costs related   to 17 running multi- family buildings have risen in the 18 past year.	In particular, owners have witnessed 19 double digit increases in real estate taxes  and 20 water and sewer rates. I also acknowledge  that 21 significant factors such as high unemployment  rates 22 and stagnant wages have impacted tenants’  abilities 23 to pay their rents. The current recession  has 24 impacted both owners and tenants alike.25 It is clear that a2 
 2 one- size- fits- all approach to setting rental 3 adjustments does not meet the various and  diverse 4 needs of all affected, but it is the  constraint 5 under which this board must operate.6 After considering the commensurate 7 rent adjustments calculated by the RGB staff,  and 8 balancing these calculations with relevant data 9 regarding housing affordability, I vote  yes.10 Motion passes, 7 - 2 .11 We’ ll take a five- minute recess.12 ( Recess taken, 7 : 10 p. m. - 7 : 21 13	p. m.)14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ladies and 15 gentlemen, I’ d like to call this meeting back to 16 order.17 Please bear with me as I read  the 18 language of the 2010 Hotel Order 40 .19 Order Number 40 - Hotels,  Rooming 20 Houses, Single Room Occupancy Buildings and  Lodging 21 Houses.

2 later.	This anniversary date will also serve  as 3 the effective date for all subsequent  Rent 4 Guidelines Board Hotel Orders unless the  Board 5 shall specifically provide otherwise in the  Order.6 Where a lease or rental  agreement 7 is in effect, this Order shall govern the  rent 8 increase applicable on or after October 1 , 2010 9 upon expiration of such lease or rental  agreement,10 but in no event prior to one year from  the 11 commencement date of the expiring lease unless  the 12 parties have contracted to be bound by  the 13 effective date of this Order.14 RENT GUIDELINES FOR HOTELS,	15 ROOMING HOUSES, SINGLE ROOM OCCUPANCY BUILDINGS  AND	16 LODGING HOTELS.17 Pursuant to its mandate to 18 promulgate rent adjustments for hotel units  subject 19 to the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 , as  amended,20 (§ 26 - 501 ( e) ( sic) of the N.

 2 hotel units subject to the Rent Stabilization  Law 3 of 1969 , as amended, and the Emergency Tenant 4 Protection Act of 1974 , as amended. The purpose of 5 these guidelines is to implement the public  policy 6 set forth in Findings and Declaration of  Emergency 7 of the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 (§ 26 - 501 of 8 the N. Y. C. Administrative Code) and in the 9 Legislative Finding contained in the  Emergency 10 Tenant Protection Act of 1974 ( c. 576 L. 1974 ,§ 4 11	[§ 2 ].)12 Having read that, is there  a13 motion?14 Ms. Adams.15 MS.

Ms. Adams.Ms. Adams:	Yes.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Adams votes CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz.MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Chairman, I just 
8 wanted to make a few remarks for the  record.9 This is the second year that  zero 10 guidelines have been enacted for  hotels.11 ( Applause.)12 MS. CRUZ:	This is in light of  the 13 fact that the staff has reported to us that  the 14 Price Index ratio has gone up by 3 . 9 percent.15 Taxes for these types of properties have gone up  by 16 13 . 5 percent. This is in contrast to the real 17 estate taxes that are charged as to  apartments,18 which went up 10 . 1 percent.19 My belief is that to enact a  zero 20 percent guideline increase for a property,  is 21 sending the message that these types of  properties 22 are not to be developed, are to be gradually  phased 23 out so that the interests of the tenants  that 24 occupy these units are, in fact, counteracted  by 25 enacting a zero guidelines.8 
2 And I very vehemently oppose  the 3 enactment of this proposal and for that reason  I4 vote no.5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz votes 6 no.7 Ms. Holder.8 MS. HOLDER:	This is one area 9 where I do feel that the tenants  are heard.	We 10 also know that the landlords are nowhere to  be 11 found.12 I applaud the advocates, the  work 13 that you all do, to try to maintain this  housing 14 for the lowest income tenants that we have in  the 15 City.	This is the housing of last resort.  I16 applaud you, because you all have done a great  job.17 I applaud the tenants who continue to live in   that 18 housing and trying to make their communities  better 19 who have already made a great investment in  their 20 communities throughout New York.21 I vote yes for this motion and I’ m22 so glad that you were  heard.23 ( Applause.)24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Holder 25 votes yes.2

SCHLEIDER:	I too would like 16 to echo the sentiments of the hard work that  the 17 advocates do for this form of housing. But I am   a18 little dismayed that reference made to owners  of 19 this type of property not showing up may  be 20 interpreted as giving those owners less of  an 21 opportunity to have their realities in terms  of 22 operating expenses heard or considered.23 I know the Chair has made  mention 24 that just because these owners don’ t show up en 25 masse as tenants do, that they are, in fact,  being 16 
2 treated with fairly. So I’ d like to believe that 3 they are being treated with  fairly.4 However, out of the past 15  years,5 9 years have had a zero  percent increase.	So I6 concur with my colleague that it’ s sending a7 message that the board or the process doesn’ t8 provide enough assistance to these owners to  entice 9 them to keep these units in  place.10 And for that matter, I have  to 11 vote against this. I have to vote  no.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider 13 votes no.14 Mr. Wenk.15 MR.

I would 10 actually like to ask that this board resume what  I11 think was done maybe two or three years ago,  where 12 we actually have an interim meeting, perhaps  in 13 September or October of this year, to perhaps  think 14 about other types of data that we would like  to 15 bring before, perhaps think about other types  of 16 witnesses that we’ d like to have before it.	Just 17 an organizing and planning meeting with the  staff 18 and the board for the public to come to, but   I19 would like to suggest that, I would hope that  my 20 colleagues would support such a meeting in  the 21 fall.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Holder, I23 think that is an excellent idea and we will  discuss 24 it and look forward to that.
