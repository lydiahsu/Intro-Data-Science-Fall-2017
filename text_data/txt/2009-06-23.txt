SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.16 ( Audience participation.)17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you, Mr.18 Chairman, thank you, Board Members.	Thank you 19 Board Members for your participation in the  process 20 this year.	I appreciate the range of  discussion 21 and debate be brought to the many pressing issues 22	--23 ( Audience participation.)24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- this year and 25 welcome to the public assembly gathered here  this 23 

2	evening.34
( Audience participation.)MR. SCHLEIDER:	I said in May,
5 this year' s scheduled meetings and reports and 6 deliberations in airing the points of  view,7 highlight the fact of life that stress,  worries,8 troubles and uncertainty brought about by  the 9 current economic insecurity affect most everyone  in 10 this great hall and throughout New York City -   both 11 tenants and landlords.12 Though the individual 13 circumstances are varied in both type and  depth,14 nonetheless, living life in New York City  has 15 become more of a challenge  --16 ( Audience participation.)17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- and providing 18 safe, affordable housing has becomes more of  a19 challenge and a great deal more  challenging.20 We' ve all seen the staff reports21 that illustrate years of falling property  incomes 22 followed by years of rising property  incomes.23 We' ve seen the staff reports 24 showing the meager property incomes for  Brooklyn 25 apartment buildings contrasted with the higher 5 
2 incomes for the luxury buildings in the  core 3 Manhattan neighborhoods.4 ( Audience participation.)5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	We' ve seen the 6 incomes for properties in the Bronx move down  year 7 after year despite upper property income  movement 8 in outer boroughs. Clearly there is no  consistent 9 movement in property income Citywide let alone  year 10 to year.11 ( Audience participation.)12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	In fact, the 13 staff reports show the only consistencies  that 14 stabilized rent increases have roughly mirrored 15 inflation and owner' s costs have increased by twice 16 the rate.17 ( Audience participation.)18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	We' ve seen the 19 staff reports showing that landlords have  steadily 20 improved their property over the  past decade.	And 21 all of that with property income  remaining 22 virtually flat over the long term meaning that  the 23 repairs, renovations and improvements are made  with 24 more expensive dollars as inflation eats into  the 25 purchasing power over time with property  owners.2 
2 The vast majority of landlords 3 demonstrating pride in their --4 ( Audience participation.)5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- property, make 6 the commitments in providing safe, clean  housing 7 for their tenants. And we' ve seen evidence of this.8 Yet, still one in ten properties are  economically 9 distressed, distressed because the rents don' t10 cover expenses.11 ( Audience participation.)12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And as for 13 tenants, landlords are -- landlords are  sympathetic 14 to the realities of the hard- pressed and 15 out- of- work tenants face. Landlords are sensitive 16 to the real- world hardships of tenants at risk.17 Landlords are concerned that 18 tenants with strong payment history are  falling 19 behind in these times.20 ( Audience participation.)21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' m not speaking 22 again of the ten or fifteen percent of tenants   that 23 cannot meet their rent in any economic climate.  No 24 one denies that those tenants are potentially  at 25 risk. I' m speaking of those tenants really 2 
2 vulnerable due to losing their job. All members  of 3 this board have been moved by the  testimony 4 concerning tenants' inability to make the  rents 5 while unemployment drains their savings, strains 6 family relations and makes heavy demands  on 7 friendships.8 No one on this board is  so 9 coldhearted as to dismiss the facts as  irrelevant.10 And yes, the City needs its firefighters,  police,11 teachers, sanitation workers.	And according to The 12 New York Times today, the median pay since 2002  has 13 risen from 23 to 36 percent with pension  benefits 14 also rising.15 However, no one has come forth  in 16 testimony to convince us that those not at  risk,17 that those with jobs couldn' t afford their rents.18 In fact, the overwhelming majority of tenants  can 19 and do pay their rents.	No one likes to pay  rent 20 but that doesn' t mean they can' t.21 ( Audience participation.)22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	For the past 23 seven years as a member of the board I' ve 24 recognized that that housing affordability is  a25 chronic issue for New Yorkers.	And I' ve called for 2 
2 government to rise to the challenge of  making 3 housing affordable by expanding the safety nets  and 4 legislating new safety nets.5 We heard testimony stating that 6 less that half of those eligible for SCRIE and  DRIE 7 apply.	This needs to be corrected by advocates  and 8 support groups directly concerned with those 9 residents of our City.	Clearly, these programs 10 need to be fully embraced and other  programs 11 initiated to extend social safety nets and doing  it 12 as only government can when motivated by  the 13 political will.14 However, the political will may  be 15 only lip service.	When pressed, if she would 16 support a renter tax rebate, something like  the 17 $ 400 homeowners get, something that might help 18 tenants in a meaningful way, the Council  Member 19 from the Second District said, only if a  rent 20 freeze is passed. That' s not government wanting to 21 do something meaningful with tenants. That' s lip 22 service.23 When asked why a $ 60 billion City 24 budget is passed and not a single elected  official 25 raised the question or had even the thought  of 2 
2 taking one- tenth of one percent of the budget or 3 $ 60 million of that tax pool of money as a  safety 4 net for at- risk tenants this year, the Manhattan 5 Borough President, although disingenuous, asked 6 about it after the fact rather than to embrace  the 7 idea for next time - elected official lip  service 8 to tenants.9 And your elected officials are 10 responsible for raising the real estate  taxes,11 water and sewer rates, municipal fees and  charges 12 that are taking about 30 cents of every rent  dollar 13 collected from property owners - costs that  rise 14 each year and cause rents to  increase.15 ( Audience participation.)16 MR. SCHLEIDER: The elected 17 officials call for a rent freeze. What  about 18 freezing tax and water rates?19 The Tenant Members do not deny  the 20 cost of operating a rental building have  been 21 rising. However, the Tenant Members still hold  onto 22 the thought that owners as a group as making  out 23 well and that no increases are necessary  or 24 warranted.	Yet tenants as a group  --25 ( Audience participation.)2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- are the only 3 party in this deliberation that need not pay  their 4 fair share.5 I say there' s a long ways between 6 those two thoughts and as a board we need go to   a7 more realistic latitude that supposes not  all 8 landlords are able to make it without  assistance.9 ( Audience participation.)10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And that most 11 tenants can and should bear their share of  rising 12 real estate taxes, water and sewer  charges,13 unfunded mandates and prospect of rising  interest 14 rates.15 ( Audience participation.)16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Without proper 17 and fair rent increases, the landlords are  again,18 shouldering an expense of what is a public  subsidy.19 ( Audience participation.)20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The vast 21 majority of landlords, this large number  of 22 landlords own small buildings, there are  the 23 representatives of some right here. About  forty 24 percent of the regulated rental housing stock is  in 25 buildings of less than eleven  units.2 
2 I' ve said this before and I' ll say 3 it again:	The vast majority of landlords have  been 4 suffering operational cost increases for  years 5 without a real commensurate increase in  rents.6 ( Audience participation.)7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	These are the 8 gatekeepers of the existing affordable  housing 9 stock. These gatekeepers are the private  citizens 10 that the City has inequitably forced to shoulder  a11 public cost with higher real estate taxes,  another 12 upcoming increase in water and sewer charges,  and 13 dozens of administrative fees.14 Tenants must share in these  cost 15 increases.	A rent stabilized apartment, again  is 16 not a birth right.	And the obligations of being  a17 good tenant include paying the rent that  fairly 18 reflects the cost of running safe, habitable  and 19 affordable housing.20 The staff report focusing on  the 21 rent increase formula noted that the rise in  core 22 expenses were 6 . 5 percent and that next year' s cost 23 increase would be 9 . 1 percent. These suggest that 24 very high one- and two- year guideline increases are 25 necessary to protect the viability of our  regulated 2 
2 housing stock, guideline increases higher than  last 3 year.	And the preliminary range passed in  early 4 May falls way short of these  targets.5 So, again, Mr. Chair, I  propose 6 that the guideline be based not solely on the   high 7 projected cost increases noted in our reports,  but 8 also in the realities of another real estate  tax 9 increase, another water and sewer rate hike  this 10 summer, electricity rate hikes, and that  oil 11 pricing has doubled since its low in  February.12 ( Audience participation.)13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	However, in 14 keeping with the economic realities and  concerns 15 for those newly at- risk tenants and those likely to 16 join their ranks before this year is out, we say   no 17 to the highest number in the staff' s report of  the 18 increase in range.19 I propose an increase of  five 20 percent for a one- year renewal and eight percent 21 for a two- year renewal lease; and 22 In keeping with last year' s23 guideline, a minimum rent increase equal to  the 24 greater of the percentage increases or $ 45 for a25 one- year renewal lease and $ 85 for a two- year 2 
2 renewal lease while a tenant has been in  continuous 3 occupancy for six years or  longer;4 A vacancy allowance determined by 5 the formula set forth in the Rent Regulation  Reform 6 Act of 1997 and in Chapter 82 of the Laws of  2003 ;7 Ten percent subletting allowance;8 and 9 Special guidelines for apartments10 entering rent stabilization after September 30 ,11 2009 from rent controlled.	Such newly stabilized 12 rents will be the greater of 150 percent above  the 13 Maximum Base Rent or the Fair Market Rent  for 14 existing housing as set by HUD as recorded in   the 15 Federal Register as of October 1 , 2009 .16 For loft properties, for loft 17 apartments, the same as the  apartments.18 And this Board must allow 19 landlords to protect New York' s housing and to 20 equitably share the burden.21 Thank you, Mr. Chair.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there a23 second?24 ( Audience participation.)25 MS.

LANGUEDOC:	The data that was 10 -- the data that was presented to the Board  this 11 year in terms of owner price increases,  reflected 12 only a small increase --13 ( Audience participation.)14 MR.

2 MR. LANGUEDOC:	The recession has 3 affected rent stabilized tenants 4 disproportionately.	Owners were given a very  large 5 rent increase last year and they still -- they' re 6 still gaining the benefit of that, of that  rent 7 increase through September 30 th of this year.

2 of rent stabilized property owners' change in  cost.3 This was especially true last year when the  Price 4 Index of Operating Costs - a severely  flawed 5 measure of owner' s actual expenses - was unusually 6 higher.7 Year after year the rhetoric and 8 debate turn landlords against tenants and  most 9 recently has encouraged landlords to deny  the 10 benefits of tenure and longevity among  their 11 tenants in their buildings; the same tenants  who 12 have faithfully paid their rent, maintained  the 13 units, stabilized the communities where  their 14 property sits.15 ( Audience participation.)16 MS. HOLDER:	And every year we as 17 a Board ignore the real- life consequences of 18 tenants' rent burdens and significant changes  to 19 renters' standards of living.20 ( Audience participation.)21 MS. HOLDER:	However, however, it 22 is our obligation to consider other  factors,23 including, crucially, the issue of owners'  income 24 and perhaps most importantly, we have a  vital 25 responsibility to consider the economic  situation 2 
2 of rent stabilized tenants, their incomes,  the 3 prevalence of unemployment, poverty and 4 homelessness among renter households and  the 5 cumulative impact of guidelines of rent  increases 6 on the very well being of  tenants.7 If in no other year, this year  is 8 the year for a rent  freeze.9 ( Audience participation.)10 MS. HOLDER:	Because -- because 11 so much of the RGB' s attention has been 12 historically and unjustifiably absorbed with  the 13 issues of owner costs, far too little  consideration 14 is typically given to the economic and  social 15 strengths of New York City renters. Indeed,  there 16 can be no other explanation for the unwarranted  and 17 excessive rent increases authorized by the RGB  in 18 recent years.19 Any balanced --20 ( Audience participation.)21 MS.

( Audience participation.)MS. HOLDER:	As weighed against 
5 the -- as weighed against the  demonstrable 6 financial good health of property owners,  would 7 result in no increases or only marginal  increases.8 Part of the cause of  this 9 imbalance, in perspective, is the excessive  weight 10 afforded owners' costs versus owner incomes  and 11 circumstances of tenants in the absence of  a12 single, easily digestible statistic or piece  of 13 data that describes, and in however flawed  a14 manner, the economic situation of  tenants.15 ( Audience participation.)16 MS. HOLDER:	The RGB staff -- the 17 RGB staff generates no index of tenant incomes  or 18 poverty or household displacement and  instead 19 presents an income and affordability study  that 20 catalogues a wealth of data on the economic  health 21 of tenants in the New York City  economy.22 Nevertheless, despite the absence 23 of that single statistic, it is  absolutely 24 indisputable that the overwhelming body of  evidence 25 and data from last year, as well as this year,   show 5 
2 that New York City renters are  struggling.3 The New York City economy is in  a4 deep recession. Renters' hardships have increased,5 that poverty and homelessness are  significantly 6 increasing, that the housing crisis continues  to 7 plague many low and moderate income renters,  and 8 that these are trends that have been holding  and 9 will continue to hold for several  years.10 ( Audience participation.)11 MS. HOLDER:	In rent stabilized 12 buildings from 2006 to 2007 , while operating costs 13 increased by 4 . 1 percent, rental and total income 14 increased by 6 . 5 percent.15 In 2008 , the Price Index of 16 Operating Cost, which measures the cost of  goods 17 and services used to operate and maintain New  York 18 City apartments, rose by only four  percent.19 Meanwhile, rent revenues grew faster than  average 20 operating costs.21 While operating costs increased 22 only 5 . 2 percent, rental income increased by 6 . 523 percent and net operating income grew by 9 . 324 percent. Net operating income grew by 9 . 83 percent.25 Moreover, the number of distressed 2 
2 properties fell for the third straight  year.3 Again, the number of distressed properties fell  for 4 the third straight year.5 The Price Index of Operating Cost,6 the Price -- the PIOC, measures the price change  in 7 a market basket of goods and services used in   the 8 operation and maintenance of rent  stabilized 9 apartment buildings in New York  City.10 The PIOC measures changes in  the 11 cost of purchasing a specific set of goods  and 12 services which must remain constant both in  terms 13 of quantity and quality from one year to the  next.14 This year the PIOC for  rent 15 stabilized apartment buildings increased by  four 16 percent, nearly four percentage points less  than 17 the PIOC percentage change from the year  before 18 which is 7 . 8 percent in 2008 .19 The PIOC was driven upward by  real 20 estate taxes and utility costs. More  moderate 21 increases were seen in administrative costs  and 22 labor, contractor services, parts and supplies  and 23 replacement costs. These increases were offset  by 24 declines in the cost of fuel oil of 10 . 1 percent 25 and insurance of 2 . 9 percent.2 
2 Section 26 . 510 of the Rent 3 Stabilization Law requires the Board to  consider 4 prevailing and projected operating and maintenance 5 costs. Projections for components of the PIOC  are 6 performed to provide -- are provided --  are 7 performed to provide the Rent Guidelines Board  with 8 an estimate of how much costs are expected to   rise 9 in the year following the current Price  Index.10 The PIOC projection is used  in 11 this year -- in this year, operating costs for  rent 12 stabilized apartment buildings increased by  413 percent versus last year' s PIOC increase of 7 . 3 .14 ( Audience participation.)15 MS. HOLDER:	What is significant 16 is a change in the overall PIOC. For this year   it 17 is 4 percent, down considerably from 7 . 8 percent.18 Moreover, the PIOC is projected to increase by  only 19 2 . 2 percent in 2010 .20 Through our history, the Rent 21 Guidelines Board --22 ( Audience participation.)23 MS. HOLDER:	Through our history,24 the Rent Guidelines Board has used a formula  known 25 as the Commensurate Rent Adjustment to  help 2 
2 determine annual rent guidelines for  rent 3 stabilized apartments. In essence, the  Commensurate 4 combines various data concerning operating  costs,5 revenue and inflation into a single  measure 6 indicating how much rents would have to change  for 7 net operating income in stabilized buildings  to 8 remain constant.9 There are five different types of 10 Commensurate Adjustment formulas. What the RGB' s11 own data tells us is that for one- year leases  the 12 net revenue with vacancy commensurate has  been 13 closest to the actual guideline for six of the  nine 14 years that the Rent Guidelines Board has been  doing 15 this, and is closest by far for the  cumulative.16 For two- year leases the 17 traditional Commensurate has generally been 18 closest, but net revenue with vacancy  commensurate 19 has been second closest. So what does the  net 20 revenue with vacancy commensurate show for  this 21 year? It actually shows for one- year leases, a 1 . 722 percent and for two- year leases, a 2 . 5 percent.23 We have always known these 24 increases to be too high. This is why this  year 25 it' s justified that they be much lower.2

But 18 really, nobody operates a business on a one- year 19 snapshot. They look at it on a  trend.20 And if you look at the past  --21 from 2001 -' 02 through the 2006 -' 07 numbers that we 22 had in the report, you' ll see that the average 23 costs increased seven percent a year.	And NOI 24 growth is, this revenue that you' re talking about 25 for the owners increased two percent a  year.2 
2 ( Audience participation.)3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So at that type 4 of transition in place, you can see how much of   a5 dire strait owners are going to be in very  quickly,6 if not already.7 ( Audience participation.)8 MR.

Of folks that are still  employed,16 they are now furloughed or experiencing loss  of 17 hours and salary.18 If for no other year, we must  make 19 sure that tenants are not  shouldering 20 disproportionately and in a very punitive way,  what 21 is happening with our economy.22 Yes, zero percent.23 ( Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any 25 additional debate?2

2 York City. These units are located in thousands  of 3 buildings throughout the five boroughs and vary  in 4 size, age and operating profiles.5 Not only is the population  of 6 buildings in the City diverse, so are the  residents 7 that reside in them and the people who own them.   In 8 particular, tenant incomes vary widely not  only 9 from neighborhood to neighborhood but often  within 10 the same building.11 Owners vary from the person  who 12 owns one six- unit building which he calls home, to 13 the large real estate company whose  portfolio 14 contains thousands of rent stabilized  apartments.15 All of these very diverse 16 components make the Board' s job, at best, a17 difficult one. The Board in particular --  the 18 Board, in particular the Public Members, try  to 19 balance the escalating costs of running  these 20 buildings with the tenants' ability to pay  their 21 rents.22 I do believe that rent 23 stabilization serves to provide affordable housing 24 to thousands of tenants. Whether it was the  intent 25 of the original law or not, it is hard to   ignore 2 
2 the fact that rent stabilization is an  integral 3 part of the affordable housing support system  in 4 New York City. Half of the rent stabilized  units 5 have rents of $ 925 or less. In fact, it is  likely 6 that the rent stabilization system has become  the 7 biggest affordable housing tool in the  City.8 Similarly, rent stabilization does 9 provide enough revenue for many owners to  meet 10 rising operating expenses while still providing  a11 reasonable, sometimes healthy, return on 12 investment.13 In short, rent stabilization 14 serves these groups quite, these two groups  quite 15 well.16 However, there are two other 17 groups that have been impacted greatly by  rising 18 costs in all aspects of living and doing  business 19 in New York City - the lower- income tenant and  the 20 owner of a distressed residential  building.21 According to the 2008 Housing  and 22 Vacancy Survey, 27 . 1 percent of all rent stabilized 23 renters pay more than half of their income  in 24 contract rent. Clearly, these renters are 25 struggling with paying their rent. Meanwhile,  ten 2 
2 percent of rent stabilized buildings are  distressed 3 in that their costs exceed their income. Many  more 4 buildings straddle this line of economic  strife 5 with income that barely outpaces costs.6 In addition, the most recent  tax 7 delinquency data for multi- family buildings shows 8 both an increase in the number of properties  and 9 the amount of money in arrears from the  previous 10 year.11 In analyzing data presented to 12 this Board, it is clear to me that the  long- term 13 rent stabilized tenants pay significantly lower 14 rents than those tenants who have recently  moved 15 into their stabilized apartments.16 Not including tenants that are  a17 part of the SCRIE program, the Senior Citizens  Rent 18 Increase Exemption Program, in 2008 the  citywide 19 median rent stabilized rent was $ 930 . Meanwhile 20 tenants in place for six years or more and  paying 21 less than $ 1000 in rent had a median rent of $ 713 .22 Because of this disparity in  rent,23 an across- the- board increase for a one- year and 24 two- year lease renewal does not target the areas of 25 the stabilized stock that need larger  rent 2 

2	increases.3
It is for this very reason  that 
4 the Board adopted a minimum dollar adjustment  for 5 long- term tenants last year.6 It is my belief that we need  to 7 continue this minimum increase for another year  in 8 order to ensure that two- year leaseholders not 9 signing a renewal lease under the current order  pay 10 their fair share of rising operating costs. I  do 11 not view this policy as a punishment to long- term 12 tenants but rather as a form of equity in that   all 13 tenants are paying an equal share of  rising 14 operating costs.15 I believe that the Rent  Guidelines 16 Board' s role in the stabilization system would be 17 considerably more rational if the  system 18 accommodated an income- based approach. Such an 19 approach is currently not permitted under  the 20 existing law.21 For the past two years I have  been 22 advocating for a system modeled on what I   believe 23 to be a highly successful and rational  public 24 policy underpinning, the Senior Citizens Rent 25 Increase Exemption program, and the Disability  Rent 4 
2 Increase Exemption program. This income- based 3 approach would allow the Board to increase rents  to 4 owners while maintaining the affordability for 5 tenants that need it the most. This will  target 6 assistance where it is needed - to both the   poorest 7 tenants and owners in New York  City.8 As the individuals charged with 9 the responsibility to make decisions and  take 10 actions that will permit approximately one  million 11 rent stabilized units in New York City to  be 12 maintained in a financially viable manner,  this 13 Board must allow owners the ability to maintain  the 14 quality of the housing, multi- family housing stock.15 I am cognizant that the  rent 16 adjustments set by the RGB, Rent Guidelines  Board,17 do have a significant impact on affordability so  we 18 must explore ways to maintain reasonable rents  for 19 lower- income tenants and at the same time switch 20 the undo burden of subsidizing rents from  the 21 individual owner to the public purse.22 Whatever the relief, I call  on 23 public officials to make significant changes  so 24 that we can enact guidelines that truly impact  the 25 rent stabilization system in a way that allows  it 2

I have a second.17 Any discussion? Go ahead. Ms.18 Holder.19 MS. HOLDER:	The Chair' s motion 20 is much too high and  --21 ( Audience participation.) 2223 type of	24 unwarranted.25 To proceed with this type  of 23 
7 ( Audience participation.)8 MS. HOLDER:	The Board -- the 9 Board received information with an analysis, by  the 10 Community Service Society, of the U. S. Census 11 Bureau' s 2008 New York City Housing and Vacancy 12 Survey.	And I just would like for everyone to  know 13 what it is that was shared and have this in   the 14 record.25	In 2007 the median income for   rent 
2 stabilized tenants was $ 39 , 000 . That means that for 3 half of the tenants affected by the RGB' s  action,4 an affordable rent is 30 percent of the  income 5 which is no more than $ 975 . The tenants living in 6 the City' s under $ 1 , 000 rent stabilized apartments 7 are primarily people who cannot afford more.  Their 8 median income is $ 30 , 000 and half of them have 9 incomes below twice the poverty line, 26  percent 10 poor and 24 percent near  poor.11 Half of these tenants live  in 12 lower rent areas of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens  and 13 Staten island. Just ten percent live in  Manhattan,14 fourteen percent in Upper Manhattan, ten percent  in 15 the gentrifying area of Brooklyn and  Queens 16 adjacent to Manhattan, and sixteen percent  in 17 higher rent, outer- range neighborhood.18 Almost three- quarters of those 19 tenants are people of color, 27 percent Black,  28 20 percent Latino, 7 percent Asian, 41 percent are  in 21 households headed by an immigrant or a person  born 22 in Puerto Rico.23 And all I have to say again  is 24 that they' re too high.	Any type of supplemental or 25 equalization allowance ever for the RGB to pass  and 2 
2 especially in this year, I think is illegal  but 3 definitely regressive. I cannot -- I cannot  stand 4 to have to sit here and watch this happen yet   again 5 in a second year.6 I' m going to vote no.	I think 7 it' s ill- advised for my colleagues to vote in favor 8 of this motion.9 ( Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any 11 additional debate?12 MS.

( Audience participation.)CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any additional MR. LANGUEDOC:	Yes.CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead, Mr.MR. LANGUEDOC:	I could just --
13 I' d just like to say that I personally turned  over 14 to the Board the report of this Dr. Waters from   the 15 Community Service Society which outlines the 16 difficulties tenants with rents under a  thousand 17 dollars are having to pay a minimum rent  increase.18 And it is part of the  record.19 And there were a number  of 20 individual tenants who, maybe 20 , 30 , 40 who gave 21 testimony as to the -- the personal testimony as   to 22 the difficulty they experienced from having to  pay 23 the minimum rent increase especially under  this 24 economy.25 So I think that there is  a13 
2 substantial amount of evidence in the record that  a3 minimum rent increase is harmful and should not  be 4 adopted.5 MS. HOLDER:	And --6 ( Audience participation.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any 8 additional debate?9 MS. HOLDER:	And also I would 10 just like to add that these statistics are  taken 11 from the U. S. Census Bureau' s 2008 New York City 12 Housing and Vacancy Survey which, of course,  we 13 recognize and that is part of our  deliberative 14 process.	It' s a part of what is part of  our 15 record.16 MS. CRUZ:	That is correct, Ms.17 Holder. But those statistics do not indicate  how 18 long the individuals have been in occupancy.  They 19 do not connect the length of occupancy  within 20 income.21 And the Minimum Rent Adjustment  is 22 to alleviate the inequity that is encountered  by 23 property owners that rent very, very below  market 24 apartments by individuals that have been  in 25 occupancy for more than six years. And  the 2 
2 statistics do not provide that  data.3 ( Audience participation.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any additional 5 discussion?6 ( No response.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' re going to 8 call the question.9 Ms. Adams.10 MS. ADAMS:	Mr. Chairman, I' m11 feeling very troubled at this point.	I think it' s12 important to have an economically integrated  system 13 -- City in all boroughs even during  these 14 economically trying or depressed times for much  of 15 the public.16 Some of the middle class for  whom 17 stabilized housing is intended to benefit  --18 policemen, firemen, teachers, nurses, the examples 19 have been used over and over during  this 20 deliberation -- they have often received raises  in 21 their pay. But those increases are in no way  equal 22 to the increased cost of education,  transportation,23 food, aging children, healthcare, et cetera,  that 24 have also been born during these  economically 25 troublesome times.2 
2 ( Applause.)3 MS. ADAMS:	We are responsible 4 for meeting the public' s need as a Public  Member 5 particularly, for stabilized housing and  for 6 ensuring that the stabilized housing stock is  well 7 maintained.8 I applaud our elected officials 9 such as my Council Person, Gale Brewer,  for 10 seriously engaging --11 ( Applause.)12 MS. ADAMS:	-- in this effort 13 since as we all know the RGB alone cannot meet   our 14 need for moderate- cost housing.15 I also have serious concerns  about 16 elected officials who call for rent freezes  only 17 and do not fully engage in carrying out  their 18 oversight responsibilities for, or policies  and 19 government, departments, and agencies who  have 20 important responsibilities in meeting our  current 21 needs and working with others in developing  and 22 implementing the policies, procedures and 23 practices, which are needed in order to ensure  that 24 there is the availability of decent and  affordable 25 housing for all people.2 
2 Needless to say or perhaps it  is 3 important to say this need will only be met   when 4 there is fruitfully interaction -- when there  is 5 fruitful interaction between government and 6productive action as well with the real  estate 7industry.8At this point I  pass.9CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Adams 10passes.11Mr. Cruz.12MS.

KIMMEL:	Second.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Seconded, Mr.23 Kimmel.24 Any debate?25 MS. CRUZ:	I have a question.2 

23	question? Yes.4
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have aMS. CRUZ:	I' d like to understand 
5 why Ms. Levine is proposing a guideline that  is 6 below the guideline that was proposed in  our 7 preliminary --8 ( Audience participation.)9 MS. CRUZ:	-- guidelines.10 And secondly, I' d like to 11 understand if the proviso will continue, the  85 12 percent.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The proviso 14 would be irrelevant at zero. So the proviso  would 15 not be adopted if this motion is  adopted.16 MS. LEVINE:	' Cause the owners 17 of hotels and SROs failed to demonstrate any  reason 18why that we should be giving them an increase  this 19year.20CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That' s a good 21answer.22Any additional discussion?23Adriene.24MS. HOLDER:	Yes.25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder.
2 MS. HOLDER:	As we' re well aware,3 the majority of SRO tenants have fixed incomes  and 4 many struggle to be able to pay both their rent   and 5 afford the basic necessaries.6 Conversely, hotel and lodging 7 house owners saw their industry grow and still  do 8 not depend on the comparatively low population  of 9 permanent SRO tenants to reap significant  profit.10 In addition, I just want to  say 11 that we also know and we saw testimony this  year 12 also that the advocates and organizations  who 13 actually can protect these tenants are very  limited 14 these days in their capacity and their resources  to 15 protect these tenants from the  scrupulous 16 landlords.17 But most importantly, the SRO 18 tenants of New York City are a negative  growth 19 population. And except for supported SROs  managed 20 by not- for- profit organization, there' s no new SRO 21 housing coming onto the market.	And while the 22 number of current SRO tenants shrink each year  and 23 as their numbers dwindle, the population  becomes 24 more and more vulnerable to the landlord' s attempt 25 to convert this low- income housing into more 2 
2 marketable real estate.3 I support this motion.4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.	Mr.6 Schleider.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	If I understand 8 Ms. Holder' s position, it' s because, in part, she' s9 looking to this Board to support  community 10 organizers and those community advocates who  look 11 out for these SRO tenants because they don' t  have 12 the resources themselves so she' s calling on this 13 Board to do their jobs? I mean, am I   missing 14 something?15 MS. HOLDER:	No, I' m not. I' m16 not. They' re particularly vulnerable and we know 17 that the Board --18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, we recognize 19 they' re vulnerable.	But what you said is  that 20 because they have limited resources, that  this 21 Board should now adopt this type of zero  rent 22 increase. I mean did I mishear  you?23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That' s one of 24 the rationale.25 MS. HOLDER:	No, that' s just one 2 
2 point I was making. But we know  --3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But it' s still the 4 point. You' re looking to this board to supplement 5 the activism or the advocacy; is that  correct?6 MS. HOLDER:	No, I' m not looking 7 for that at all.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, then I9 wish you' d take that --10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me phrase 11 it in a different way:	The advocacy is being cut 12 back so this class of tenant needs even  more 13 protection; --14 MS. HOLDER:	They' re just more 15 vulnerable is all I' m saying.16CHAIRMAN MARKUS:-- is that 17right?18MS. HOLDER:	That' s--19CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Okay. Correct.20MS.
