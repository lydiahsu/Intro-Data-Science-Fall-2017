2 COUNCILMEMBER  ROBERT JACKSON:3 I appreciate that.4	MS. LUSSKIN:	in Albany.5 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:6 I appreciat e that.7 But  sometimes also  I know that ,8 you know, as a commission or as  - -  someone was  in9 front of us yesterday at a hearing, a  housing10 hearing, and he was representing the  housing11 developers. And we had some homeowners that  were12 testifying about this situat ion.13 Even though he was not14 represent ing Staten Island - the individual was15 representing  the housing developers for the  Bronx16 and Queens - I asked him to please  communicate17 with his colleague for the Housing  Development18 Association to try to sit down with  these19 homeowners and work out this situat ion where20 everyone can come away, you know, happy and  not21 have a homeowner complain about the fact  that22 they can't live in their home, a brand new  home,23 as a result of a developer not doing the  right24 thing.25 That ' s not the type of image5 
2 that we can have.3 And I say to you as a body,  even4 if you don' t have that within your jurisdict ion,5 you can still comment on that.6 So at least that ' s what you7 should do.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Zelnik.9 COUNCILMEMBER  ROBERT JACKSON:10 Yes, sir.11 MR. ZELNIK:	I don't think you12 were here earlier when one tenant testified  that13 their building from the period of 1987 and  almost14 to the present has over 400 violat ions and they15 circulated the violations from the  Building16 Department.17 And some of those  violations18 were really very, very serious  violations.19 And my sense is, while we  may20 have limited jurisdict ion in terms of what the21 State law says, I have a feeling that the  City22 Council can probably do something in terms  of23 addressing violations  dealing specifically with24 DOB and making sure that they act and do  what25 they are licensed to do and chartered to do,  if10 
2 you will , in terms of violat ions and work orders3 in curing these things.4 So I'm just wondering why  City5 Council isn't becoming a little bit  more6 creat ive , a little bit proactive	in terms of7 doing things about violat ions on buildings8 because we clearly at this point can't  do9 anything about it.10 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:11 Yes.12 I hear what you're saying.  I13 think that  - - I know as a member of the  City14 Council we, especially  in northern Manhattan,15 Miguel Mart inez and myself are the advocates,  we16 deal with HPD concerning these buildings with   a17 lot of violat ions in order to address that and ,18 where appropriate, to fine the  people19 appropriately.20 But the bottomline is you  have21 to constantly force their hand legally in  order22 to do that.23 And you know one thing? I  think24 that advocates and The Legal Aid Society,  who25 represents many of the tenants, and other  legal2 
1	4532 non-prof it groups that represent tenants, ought3 to pursue actions against landlords that  are4 failing to maintain buildings according to  the5	codes and rules and regulations.6 But clearly I think that we  need7 to do more, but I think that all bodies, us  as8 the Council and you as the Guidelines Board ,9 could , even if you can't insert that into your10 decision, commenting on it is very  important.11	MR. ZELNIK:	I would appreciate12 it .13 COUNCILMEMBER  ROBERT JACKSON:14 But  I hear you and we will  - - you know, I will  be15 communicat ing that to my colleagues, especially16 on the Black, Latino and Asian  Caucus.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. Ms.18 Adams.19 (Audience participation.)20 MS. ADAMS:	From the21 conversation that you and Mr. Zelnik had, one  of22 the things that 's clear and what you're hearing23 is that  - -  I mean  everybody now acknowledges that24 there is a housing crisis.25 And when the question comes  up12 
2 as to, well , what do we do about  it , there  are3 many part s in all of that , we do because of the4 legislation that we operat e under, HPD is - -   you5 know, and you go on down the road and people   from6 the Council and the Mayor and the Governor  and7 everybody else is really sorry that this is  the8 case .9 And I think that it has  reached10 a point now where people have to take  action11 instead of just saying that this is a  problem,12 that we have to do something about  it.13 And it 's not just14 (Audience part icipation. )15 MS. ADAMS:	but some of us16 have not used whatever we have to the extent  that17 we could.18 (Audience participation.)19 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:20 I totally agree with you.21 (Audience participation.)22 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:23 I agree with you that some of us have not  used24 all of our avenues to the extent that we   can.25 And  I clearly - -  I think even2 
2 the Mayor agrees that there' s a housing crisis.3 That ' s why he announced - - what is it , about a4 year/year- and - a-half ago - - that he was going to5 move with this multi - billion affordable housing6 building thing.7 But I agree with you8 wholeheartedly, and I think that action is  very9 important at all venues. And this is part of  it10 here tonight , today. City Council we hear it  all11 the time. And even us, as members of the  City12 Council , some of us have to step up even more13 without a doubt.14 And I say to you that action  is15 very important.16 One little example, and then  I'm17 going to sit down and let my colleagues  take18 over, with educat ion. You know, educat ion is a19 key to success. We all agree with that. And  part20 of that , I was involved with the lawsuit CFE,21 Campaign for Fiscal Equity, versus the State  of22 New York. We just got a court judgment , order,  of23 $14.8 billion for the children of New York  City.24 But with respect to  education,25 it starts with us every single day. And , for2 
2 example, part of pursuing that lawsuit , I walked3 150 miles in order to pursue that act ion.4 And these are the type  of5 actions that we have to take and stand up,  even6 though you may not have the jurisdiction, you  may7 say that the landlord is not going to fix up  the8 code violations, then we' re are going to suggest9 to Albany to change the  law.10 Now you may not change  it11 yourself , but  I believe  it 's in your jurisdiction12 that  you could  recommend , I believe	- and I may13 be mistaken - you may be able to recommend   that14 certain things happen.15 And what we are doing by  doing16 that is sending a message to those peopl e that17 have the authority that this is how you   feel18 about it. So feeling and expressing  those19 feelings are very important in the  process.20 (Audience participation.)21 MS. ADAMS:	I'm one of the first22 to say, yes, that is important , but we've got to23 get some	(unintelligible)24 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:25 I agree.2 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.3 Mr. Pagan, go ahead.4 MR. PAGAN:	Councilmember5	Jackson, nice seeing you  again.6	I'm going to ask you  in7 reference to preservation  issues because  I think8 when we sit here most of the landlords that  we9 hear are very small landlords who  have10 difficult ies, and they happen to be in many,  many11 cases serving communities where we live the   most.12 For instance, they may be in Bushwick, or  they13 may be in areas of Bed - Stuy, or Crown Heights or14 maybe Harlem and the  Bronx.15 And this morning they  were16 talking about the issue of cashflow,  especially17 in the winter when they have to deliver  oil.18 And I made some suggestion where19 they could develop  funds.20 But I think one of the  things21 that we could look up to the Council and  maybe22 with the Administration where they could set   up23 short - term loans, especially  in the wint ertime ,24 or some mechanism where our people don' t  suffer,25 the peopl e I represent , because there was no oil7 
2 delivery and there was no oil , the heat was not3 there, the hot wat er.4	And maybe the issue is that  some5 of the bills come at the wrong time and  lay6 there.7 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:8 Okay.9	MR. PAGAN:	And oil happens to10	be one of them, maybe  taxes.11	But the issue is is there a12 possibility  of  the Council  looking  into that ,13 working with the small owners to develop  programs14 that could help them out so we don' t have to15 listen and waiting for ten, five percent , fifteen16 percent  increase in areas where chances are  if17 you give them a five percent , three percent18 increase, they won' t be able to collect it19 because the people can't  pay.20 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:21 Yes. I would say the answer is yes and I  would22 love to explore  that with you. And  I think  - - you23 remember I mentioned earlier that you can  make24 recommendations.	I would love that the Rent25 Guidelines Board to send us some of  those12 
2 recommendat ions to the City Council so that we3 can consider that. That 's very important in the4 process, working together.5	Because clearly if you are a6 small owner  and you cannot ,  because  of your7 cashflow, cannot afford to purchase oil , well8 that 's a problem for the owner and problem for9 the residents, the tenants  also.10 And if we can help bot h the11 owners to survive in that process and help   the12 tenants, in order to make sure that they  have13 heat and hot water, I think that 's a14 collaborat ive approach which needs to happen.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,16 Councilman.17 COUNCILMEMBER  ROBERT JACKSON:18 Thank you very much, Mr.  Chair.19 (Audience participat ion.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Before we21 cont inue with the other Council Members,  it ' s22 five to six. Anybody who is here who wants  to23 test ify has to go upstairs and put their name on24 the list .25 Okay.6 
2	Councilmember Martinez.3 (Audience participation.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One thing5 about the Councilmembers. They know how to  fix6 the mike.7 (Laughter.)8 COUNCILMEMBER  MIGUEL MARTINEZ:9 Mr. Chair and Board Members :10 I want to give you the11	opportunity	thank you for allowing me the12 opportunity to testify before  you.13 It was a great discussion  that14 was taking place here with Councilmember  Jackson15 and earl ier speakers.16 I stand here before you to  ask17 you to consider a zero increase in the renewal  of18 leases.19 (Audience participation.)20 COUNCILMEMBER  MIGUEL MARTINEZ:21 And I tell you this, New York City is, in fact ,22 facing a severe, not just a housing crisis,  a23 severe affordable housing  crisis.24 I represent the district that25 only has a two percent ownership rate which  is12 
1	4612 the Washington Heights, Inwood and Marble  Hill3 community, the 10th Councilmanic District. And   I4 will tell you that many of the apartments in  my5 district that are rental are closely, if  not6 dangerously  close, to being decontrolled.7	The effect and the laws that  we8 got from Albany have not benef itted the City of9 New York. And , in fact , this vot e that you  are10 going to take, it is extremely crucial. And to   be11 a partner with the New York City Council that ,  by12 the way, has done so much for the  preservation13 and development  of affordable housing in the  City14 of New York, the vote that you are going to  take15 today is extremely  important.16 Because the City Council  just17 finished delivering a home rule message  to Albany18 telling Albany that New York City should  have19 control of the rent laws in the City of New   York.20 (Audience participation.)21 COUNCILMEMBER  MIGUEL MARTINEZ:22 If you do the opposit e - -23 (Audience part icipation.)24 COUNCILMEMBER  MIGUEL MARTINEZ:25 And if you do the opposite, if you turn   around8 
2 and send a message that , no, that New York City3 does not need to have control , that everything  is4 under control in New York City, by  increasing5 the percentage under renewals, you're sending  a6 bad message.7 Because New York City right  now,8 even though the Mayor has put money forward  for9 the development of affordable housing, this  City10 Council has taken a progressive step , which we11 call the inclusionary  zoning, to guarantee12 permanent  affordable housing  in communities such13 as the Hudson Yards, such  as14 Greenpoint/Williamsburg,	such as other15 communities that are coming before the New  York16 City Council for rezoning issues. The number   one17 priority for the City Council is are you going   to18 develop permanent affordable housing. That 's the19 first quest ion.20 And  if not , we,21 (Audience part icipation. )22 COUNCILMEMBER  MIGUEL MARTINEZ:23 - -  the Council , have  taken the responsibility24 (Audience participation .)25 COUNCILMEMBER  MIGUEL MARTINEZ:2 
2- - hastaken the step and responsibility  to3ensurethat we guarantee affordable  housing.4The same is true that this  City5 Council year after year work with landlords  and6 put money in the City budget to ensure  that7 landlords, for issues such as Mr . Pagan8 ment ioned , that need help and guidance from HPD9 to better manage their building, this  City10 Council puts money in the budget for  those11 particular purposes.12 The same is true - - the same  is13 very true for many families, many families  with14 the impact of the State laws: one,  the15 preferent ial rents are out the window; two, what16 the State has done to us not knowing the  true17 needs of the City of New York is not reflected   in18 those laws.19 And we need to ensure that  we20 have a partner in you, in this Board , in sending21 a message to Albany that we need to control  the22 rent ,23 (Audience part icipation.)24 COUNCILMEMBER  MIGUEL MARTINEZ:25 - - and that we do not need - -5 
2	(Audience participat ion.)3 COUNCILMEMBER  MIGUEL MARTINEZ:4 And  I know - -  I know I'm being a little5 passionate about this.6 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	That ' s okay.7 COUNCILMEMBER  MIGUEL MARTINEZ:8 But this Council has been very progressive,  have9 been proact ive in guaranteeing and ensuring10 affordable housing.11 The same is true that we need  a12 partner in the Executive Branch. Those of  you13 that are here that represent the Mayor,  Michael14 Bloomberg, we need you to go back to him and  tell15 him that he needs to be on this side and help   you16 make the decision to vote zero percentage on  the17 renewal.18 Thank you.19 (Audience part icipation. )20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Zelnik.21 MR. ZELNIK:	You indicated that2 2	you represented Marble  Hill.23 I do.24 MR. ZELNIK:	How far do you go25 up?23 
2 (Audience part icipat ion. )3 COUNCILMEMBER  MIGUEL MARTINEZ:4 I go up to 228th Street.5	Basically, most of the  ownership6 in my district is represented in the Marble  Hill7 area, the 228th Street by John F. Kennedy  High8 School.9 As Councilmember Jackson10 ment ioned earlier, we both represent northern11 Manhattan. But most of the home ownership   falls12 within his district  .13 MR. ZELNIK:	I have a specific14 question but I don' t know if this falls within15 your district or not. But it 's about 228th Street16 and Broadway, or maybe 23 0th Street and Broadway,17 the Kingsbridge  Riverdell Development Corporation18 proposed affordable housing along that strip   on19 some land.20 And I know at least one or  two21 City Council people in that area, Oliver  Capell22 being one of them, voted against it . They did not23 want affordable housing there. They just  wanted24 commercial development.25 I don' t know whether this was in6 
2 your district as well.3 But are you familiar with  that4	project?5	COUNCILMEMBER  MIGUEL MARTINEZ:6 I'm not . And I'm of the understanding	that there7 is still discussion about that  development.8	It 's not in my district. You are9 absolutely  right.  It ' s Councilmember Oliver10 Capell ' s district.11 MR. ZELNIK:	Right. It's just a12 little north of you.13 COUNCILMEMBER  MIGUEL MARTINEZ:14 Correct.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 Thank you. We appreciate  it.17 COUNCILMEMBER  MIGUEL MARTINEZ:18 Thank you.19 (Audience part icipation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, go21 ahead.22 COUNCILM EMBER MALINDA KATZ:	So23 I don't ruin your image, I'll fix the  microphone.24 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Right , right .25 You guys know how to do  it.9 
2COUNCILMEMBER MALINDA KATZ:	I3wantto thank you all for serving here at  the4RentGuidelines Board.5My name is Malinda Katz. And  I6 think what ' s probably  the more  important factor7 is that I represent Queens, Forest Hills,  New8 York. But I also am Chair of the Land  Use9 Committee. I also have been an elected off icial10 on and off for twelve years now. I was in  the11 Assembly before.12 And I have been at many,  many13 Rent Guidelines Board' s hearings. And I sort of14 feel like deja vu every t ime I'm here.15 But what ' s truly flooring me in16 this hearing is that this isn't about what  the17 Council has done. This is about the  authority18 that you all have in your  hands.19 (Audience participat ion .)20 COUNCILMEMBER MALINDA KATZ:	I21 guess - - I mean I can go through what the    Council22 has done. I can go through wanting  more23 inspectors for the Buildings Department. And  I24 can go through spending the money but not  having25 it done.6 
2 I can go through all the t imes3 that we've had HPD on the stand and go  through4 the affordable housing arguments that we've  had.5 But this is truly one case  where6 all of you, all nine of you who have  been7 appoint ed by the Mayor of the City of New York,8 have the future of these tenants and the   tenants9 of the City of New York in your  hands.10 I mean it 's one thing for the11 City Council to do everything we possibly can   to12 negot iate time and time ago every single time  we13 have an application in front of  us.14 We have to negot iate. We have a15 partner. That' s what happens.16 But what happens now to  the17 tenants of this City and the message that ,  like18 my colleague, Councilman Martinez,  said,  the19 message that we send up to Albany is truly   only20 in your hands.21 And so we should be here  to22 discuss what effect your decisions will have on23 the City of New York and on the  tenants.24 (Audience participation. )25 COUNCILMEMBER  MALINDA KATZ:2 
1	4692 But I would like to state for the record that   I3 am the lead negotiator for the City Council  when4 it comes to affordable housing. It is my job   to5 go in there and negot iate with the Mayor of the6 City of New York or Dan Doctoroff every   single7 time a rezoning comes  up.8 I will tell you that in  Hudson9 Yards we started at sixteen percent that  the10 Mayor gave us. Because of the Council 's11	negotiations, we went up to twenty- eight percent12 affordable housing in that  area.13 (Audience participation.)14 COUNCILMEMBER MALINDA KATZ:	We15 started out in Williamsburg/Greenpoint	with16 nineteen percent affordable housing. We ended   up17 at thirty- three percent.18 By the way, one- third of that is19 going to people with twenty- five percent AMI  or20 lower, or thirty percent AMI or lower. I  mean21 this  is important  stuff .22 And we are working hard to  send23 a message to everyone who will listen  that24 affordable housing is in a crisis in this   City.25 And we are doing everything  we12 
2 possibly can in the Council to ensure that  people3 have a place to live. Even if we' re going to4 start to build the affordable housing that  we've5 negot iated with the Administrat ion on, even we6 were to lay a shovel in the ground  tomorrow,7 people will not have a place to live for  years.8 (Audience participation.)9	COUNCILMEMBER MALINDA KATZ:	So10 let me just end with this.11 This is a partnership. We  all12 care about the City. The question is how to  get13 to where we need to get  to.14 I want to end with just  one15 thing, and excuse me taking a prerogative  here.16 We are also doing everything we can in  the17 Council and with the Administration  to make  sure18that theeconomic development of this  City19thrives.We are truly trying every way that  we20possiblyknow how.21But the one category of folks  in22	this City that will not really benef it from an23economic  surge arethose people on fixed incomes.24And in my districtthat is truly the majority  of25folks who are rentstabilized tenants. They  are
2 seniors on fixed incomes. Social Security went  up3 $48 this year.4 And if the rent goes up  two5	percent , four percent , seven percent , it's just6	illogical that they are going be able to  afford7	it .8 So I will say that we are  doing9 everyt hing we can to make sure that the economics10 continues and to make sure that the City   thrives.11 But , pl ease, the one category of folks that can't12 afford any increase are those folks on  fixed13 income . And for most of the folks in this  room14 and in the City who are rent stabilized , we  need15 to give a zero percent  increase this year.16 Thank you.17 (Audience part icipation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 Ms. Lusskin.20 MS. LUSSKIN:	I have one21 quest ion about your own district , your area,22 because one of the things we always try  to23 understand	is where we are having an impact  on24 what are the changes in the housing  availability.25 In your district what has  been8 
2	the impact of vacancy decontrol? I know  luxury3 decontrol - -4 COUNCILMEMBER MALINDA  KATZ:5	We've priced a lot of folks out in my district.   I6 mean I am mostly a senior district. So folks   die7 or move out to senior homes or nursing homes,   I8 mean clearly vacancy decontrol takes hold. And   it9 is pricing folks out.10 And to tell you the truth,  I11 mean I was up in Albany. I was an Assembly  member12 in 1997 when we did the new regulations and I  was13 not for the $200, 000 above or $2000 a month,  you14 know, gett ing you off rent stabilizat ion and rent15 control.16 But the fact of the matter is  in17 my district  it 's affected because  that 's where18 folks were coming.19 And I need those apartments  for20folksthattruly can't afford to live  anywhere21else.2 2MS. LUSSKIN:	Thank you.23COUNCILMEMBER  MALINDA KATZ:2 4So - -25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And we have
2	another question.3	COUNCILMEMBER MALINDA KATZ:	I4 live in Forest Hills and everyone' s parent at  one5 point lived in my  area.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.7 COUNCILMEMBER  MALINDA KATZ:8	Yes, sir.9	MR. PAGAN:	Councilmember, I10 just want  to express  - -  I work in Williamsburg11 and we were very involved in the rezoning  and12 advocacy there.13 And I do want to express  our14 thanks for the work you did on our behalf .  It's15 not only the thirty- three percent achievement16 because when people look, oh, we got  thirty- three17 percent on affordability, but there were   issues18 like neighborhood  restorat ion,19 COUNCILMEMBER  MALINDA KATZ:20 Yes.21 MR. PAGAN:	- - which nobody22 talks about , or even advocacy dollars that  were23 set aside for the rezoning, which is going to  be24 important displacement. Because that 's a big25 decision that most of the communities are   having10 
2	is the issue of displacement.3	And today when we talk  about4 what everybody has done , it 's not because   people5 want to know what they are doing is , because6 we 're sitting here listening to myriads of7 problems that are interfering with the  things8 that we are trying to get accomplished  here.9 And it 's like one side saying10 one thing, the other saying another, it 's like11 being a social worker and say, well , you have  to12 go here , you have to go there to get those13 issues.14 And when I have the  opportunity,15 I bring those issues up to the people who  come16 here and speak so they' ll understand what  other17 people are saying and maybe there' s something18 that can be done.19 Thank you.20 COUNCILMEMBER MALINDA  KATZ:21 Thank you.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 3	Good job. We appreciate  it.24 We' re going to take a recess now.25 (At 6:08 o'clock p.m. there was24

CHRISTINA FUENTES:	Ladies19 and gentlemen of the Board:20 My name is Christ ina Fuentes.21 I'm here and I'm outraged to say that as  a22 homeless person I have not once heard about  the23 unspoken homeless that are affected by this  rent24 increase. I'm talking about the children of  our25 City.14 
2	(Audience participation. )3	MS. CHRISTINA FUENTES:	These4 children are being  - -  they are taken out of  their5 homes because their parents can no longer  afford6 to pay the rent in their  houses.7 This is not something that8 happens overnight. This is something that   happens9 over years and decades.10 These children are now  being11 forced to miss school. They are forced to  miss12 time out from their education because  their13 parents now have to go through the process  of14 EAU, Family Housing shelters, where they have  to,15 therefore , search on their own for affordable16 housing that is not being made available to  them17 in this fair City of New York.18 This is supposed to be the  land19 of opportunity, but there is no opportunity  for20 these families to find shelter.21 I myself , eight months  pregnant ,22 have been denied housing and shelter for the   last23 year- and - a- half since I became homeless.24 This is an outrage that  these25 children have nowhere to go. They have no one   to4 
2 speak for them, no voice. And you're going  to3 raise their parents' rent when they are  the4 working people that are making  $7.00/$8. 00 an5 hour, just a little bit above the minimum  wage6 and can no longer afford the rent on what  was7 considered affordable housing maybe five or  ten8 years ago.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 (Audience participation. )11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	People may12 have come back in.13 Andy Humm?14 MR.

We' ll16 take you.17 Carla Washington?18 (No response. )19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Stephanie20 Bailey?21 (No response. )22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mr. Godensky.2 3	Followed by Lisa Rubin, then  Mr.24 Humm, and then Mr.  Peckham.25 Those of you who remember,  the24 
2 person who said he was an actor, remember  that3 man who said he was an actor, he was, in fact ,  an4 actor. He was impersonat ing Mr. Peckham.5 So we are going to give Mr.6 Peckham a chance.7 Mr. Godensky.8 MR. CHARLES GODENSKY:	My name  9 is Charles Godensky. I am a small property  owner10 from Queens.11 About twenty- two percent of my12 tenants are rent controlled and the  remaining13 tenants are rent stabilized. I recently had  one14 of my rent controll ed tenants call me up upon15 receiving his fuel increase that comes  out16 annually. And he was very concerned about why  his17 fuel increase increased by sixty percent .18 His five- room apartment fuel19 increase went from $49.35 to  $80.25.20 So I suggested that he call  the21 DHCR and I got him some phone numbers for  the22 fuel department and the MBR Department . And I23 said call me back and tell me what they tell  you.24 I just get orders and I have to serve you the 25	papers.9 
2 So he calls me back about  five3 to six days later and he says to me he did call ,4 he spoke to somebody there , and they basically5 said that they worked all year long to come  out6 with these numbers and that ' s what they felt   was7 justifiable based on the increase in fuel  costs8 for running the building for the year. This  is9 No. 2 oil .10 He was also concerned that  he11 also had a 7.5 percent rent increase. So I  said,12 look, you have to speak to the MBR Unit  about13 that .14 He spoke to Mr. Horowitz of  the15 MBR Unit and he basically told him the  same16 thing. He says, look, we have our numbers that  we17 work with. This is all we do. We' re specialists18 in this. And this is what we decided is a  fair19 number for the landlords to continue  running20 their buildings.21 Now, many of the City  Council22 peopl e are coming up here today and they are23 proposing	zero percent increases, where the  DHCR24 is proposing and giving the rent  controlled25 tenants a 7.5 percent increase and on top of  that2 
2	a large fuel surcharge .3	How are we supposed to run  our4	buildings on anything less than that?5	These are professionals.	These6 are people that work all year round figuring  out7 the numbers, telling the landlords what they   can8 get , telling  the tenants what  they have  to pay .9	Like  I said , twenty- two percent10 of my tenants are SCRIE tenants. This  one11 gentleman was not a senior citizen . He was a12 working gentleman.13 But many of my tenants  are14 senior citizens. They are eligible for  SCRIE.15 SCRIE is now $22 , 000 a year eligibility. And more16 and more tenants each year are going to move  to17 SCRIE .18 I do not have any violations  on19 my buildings.	I work hard to give my tenants  a20 nice home. If my rent controlled tenants  are21 asked to pay 7 .5 percent for one year and a fuel22 adjustment , I ask that my rent stabilized tenants23 pay the same thing . Anyt hing less than this will24 just have the remaining stock of  housing25 deteriorate .10 
2 City Councilman Katz wants  the3 ent ire burden to be put on the landlord. And I4 don't think that 's fair.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How many6	units do you have?7	MR . CHARLES GODENSKY :	I have8forty units.9CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	In Queens,10one building?11MR. CHARLES GODENSKY:	It ' s one12building, yes.13CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any other14quest ions?15(No response .)16CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you done?17MR. CHARLES GODENSKY:	Yes,18sir.19CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20(Audience part icipation. )21CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms . Rubin,22you're next .23MS. LISA RUBIN:	Hi! Good24evening.25I represent Councilmember  Alan
1	4832 J . Gerson, Councilmember of the 1st District in3 Manhattan, which includes Battery Park  City,4 Chatham Square5	A VOICE:	Move the mike.6	MS . LISA RUBIN:	I 1   m sorry. Can7	you hear me now?8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	A little  9 closer to the mike. Or you can take it out  to10 speak .11 MS. LISA RUBIN:	Okay.12 I 1  m sorry. Can you hear me now?13 VOICES:	Yes.14 MS. LISA RUBIN:	Thank you . I 1  m15 sorry about  that .16 Good evening!17 I represent Council member Alan18 J . Gerson of the 1st Council District of  Lower19 Manhattan.20 And the Councilmember urges  that21 the New York City Rent Guidelines Board , in the22 interest of preserving the City 1   s dwindl ing stock23 of affordable housing, protect the senior 24	citizens, disabled persons and other  rent25	stabilized persons, many of whom live on  fixed
2incomesor low wages, as it determines the  rent3renewallease guidelines.4It is understood that the  Board5 is contemplating an increases that could be  as6 high at 7 percent for a two-year lease and  as7 high as 4.5 percent for a one-year  lease.8	Moreover, a surcharge on tenants9 who have resided in a given rent stabilized  unit10 for eight to ten years is also  under11 contemplation by the Board.12 Both proposals,  if approved ,13 would constitute an unjust taxation on  tenants14 based on their age as well as their low   incomes.15 That is because senior citizens might be  more16 likely to have resided in a given unit for  a17 longer amount of time and persons with  lower18 incomes might be more likely to sign only a  one-19 year lease.20 In sum, these proposals would21 amount to a longevity tax as well as a  backdoor22 resurrection of the discarded poor  tax.23 While the Councilmember is  aware24 that landlords' expenses for items such as   the25 property tax, insurance and fuel have   increased9 
2 over the years, he also understands that the  bulk3 of these increases were incurred in or  before4 2003 and were reflected in previous  Rent5 Guidelines Board  increases.6	Thus, the bases for these7 additional  large increases have no apparent8 justif icat ion.9	Moreover, the policy10 implications of these increases would  contravene11 what we thought is the City' s well - settled goals12 of promoting and not destroying access  to13 affordable housing.14 Thus, the Council member urges15 that the Rent Guidelines Board revisit  these16 proposals and devise fair and just  guidelines17 that comport with the City' s publ ic policy as18 stated.19 Thank you.20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Humm.22 MR . ANDY HUMM:	Thank you.23 My name is Andy Humm. I'm  the24 Vice President of the London Terrace  Tenants25 Association	in Chelsea.10 
2 I was going to submit  written3 testimony but after listening to what 's been4 going on here tonight I've changed what I'm   going5 to say, just as I hope you will change your  minds6 after listening to test imony as well.7	I was going to test ify for a8 rent freeze. I am now against a freeze.  We9 clearly need a rollback of at least five  percent.10 (Audience participation. )11 MR . ANDY HUMM:	Just - - all12 right , friends.13 (Audience participation. )14 MR. ANDY HUMM:	I'm just15 talking about reversing the obscene profits  that16 the Board has allowed to pile up under  the17 Bloomberg Administration.18 (Audience participation. )19 MR. ANDY HUMM:	I mean the20 reason we have the law that sets you up,  that21 puts you in this place, is because we  need22 af fordable housing. Everybody up there23 acknowledges that there is a housing crisis.   Does24 everybody not acknowledge that there is a  housing25 crisis? Thank you. There is a housing  crisis.8 
2 If you don't start thinking of3 housing  as  - - you know, housing  is a necessity.4 It is not a luxury. It 's not stocks and bonds.5 It 's not something we trade. It ' s something  that6 we all - - it ' s something that we all need.7	Now, Mr. Markus, earlier  you8 insinuated that somebody was asking you to  sort9 of contravene the State law by, you know,  by10 doing something. Some might say that you all  have11 ignored the law when you awarded increases  to12 landlords when their costs went  down.13 I expect  that , because of14 polit ics, that you will vote for slightly  lower15 increases this year because it 's an election16 year.17 The point of all that is  that18 you are not machines. You are people. You are   our19 brothers and sisters, all of us together.  You' re20 people. You can make  judgments.21 You know, if all this could  be22 done by a formula, we wouldn' t need you at   all .23 We would just plug the numbers into a  computer,24 that would be  it , we wouldn' t have to have  all25 these hearings, all this wasted human energy,   and8 
2	that would be the  increase.3	But that ' s not what it is. You  -45	(Audience participat ion. )6	MR. ANDY HUMM:	- - are going to7 make a judgment.8 (Audience participation.)9	MR. ANDY HUMM:	As it has been,10 if you don' t reverse the upward spiral of rents,11 it will be you who drive more and more of  the12 middl e class out of New York.13 I want that to weigh on  your14 conscience. You know, you have a governmental15 responsibility, sure. But you have consciences16 and your actions have  consequences.17 With any luck, and I'm  sure18 you' ll be glad about this, this w i l l  be your last19 meeting. We hope to replace Mayor  Billionaire20 with someone who understands the needs of  the21 people of the middle  class.22 But , but - -23 (Audience part icipation. )24 MR. ANDY HUMM:	But I don' t25 mean to insult you. You're a friend of his.  But10 
1	4892 you can start the process of easing the pain   of3 this City now. You can start the process  of4 easing the pain right now. It's in your power  by5 voting for a rollback  now.6 Thank you.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 (Audience part icipation.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Humm, you10	succeeded in changing the  cheer.11	(Laughter.)12 MR. ANDY HUMM:	Thank you.13 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	And that ' s a14 big compliment.15 (Audience part icipation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Daniel17 Peckham. Mr. Peckham, this is the first  time18 somebody has been a victim of identify fraud   at19 the Rent Guidelines Board. I want you to  know.20 Yes. He showed his ID card. I'm glad to have   you21 here. We' re glad that you persevered.22 MR. DANIEL PECKHAM:	Thank you.23 Victim  - -  I just got this24 yesterday.25 Please take notice that  pursuant12 
1	4902 to Rent Stabilizat ion Code Section, blah, blah,3 blah, the owner and landlord does not intend   to4 renew your lease for the above - referenced5 premises which expires in September because  the6 owner seeks in good faith to recover  possession7 of said premises for the purpose of  demolishing8 the building.9	Here is an ad. This is from10 Belkan, Burden, Wenik and  Goldman.11 Here' s an ad on their website.12 It says: Let 's get ready to rumble. DHCR grants13 demolit ion application without holding a hearing.14 And this is the way they say  is,15 and their final line is, the  demolition16 application is a more attractive option  for17 owners seeking to recover possession of  rent18 regulated buildings.19 (Audience participation.)20 MR. DANIEL PECKHAM:	Here is a21 picture of our hallway on the 4th of July   just22 before the 4th of July weekend. These are  holes23 through the wall. They took possession. We  had24 four buildings.25 The landlord bought  thirteen10 
1	4912	buildings for $13 million.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where' s your4	building?5	MR. DANIEL PECKHAM:	All rent  6 stabilized. 21st Street between Seventh  and7 Eight h.8 He got rid of the SRO  people9 for, like I think he got everybody out of  the10 building  for like $200,000.11 Demolishes the building,  builds12 it up , a $10 mill ion building, costs l ike two,13 three , four million. He makes $6 million.14 He' s doing - - so then he moves - 1516 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Condos?17 MR . DANIEL PECKHAM:	No.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You say19 MR. DANIEL PECKHAM:	Their20 market  value ,  $2400 to  $4000 one-bedroom.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Rental .22 MR . DANIEL PECKHAM:	Yes .23 Then when they're building that24 building, they break through the walls. This  is25 the hallway picture. There' s a guy' s bedroom16 
2 there. They broke through his wall. He runs  out3 and says, hey, you broke into my bedroom.  The4 guys say, oh, you know, well , we' re supposed to5 go through the third brick. They make three  more6 holes like one foot by two  feet.7	I come home. I called the8 police, 911, DHCR, DOB and the  HPD.9 The pol ice show up and they10 can't do anything. They say it 's the Department11 of Buildings.12 The whole thing turns out  that13 he never got in any trouble at all for  doing14 this.  It laid there  - - he didn' t even apologize.15 The debris laid there the whole weekend and   never16 cleaned it up, and in total made thirteen  holes17 accidentally.18 So scared  - -  there were three19 women, two men, single everybody, one woman  with20 a child , they all got scared and took his first21 buyout offer. I'm the only one  left.22 I went  to the DHCR , told Carbone23 about this whole thing and about  this.24 He' s like: yeah, yeah, but25 what 's happening now?8 
1	4932 Every lawyer that I spoke  to3 said don' t even go to the DHCR , it's owned by the4 landlords. It 's a waste of t ime. Everyone knows5 it . It 's common knowledge.6 So, here' s me.7 And  then - - and this buyout8 offer they offer, they said that the  average9 rent , or the mean rent in New York City in10 Bulletin 2002 - 1 buyout is $33 1 per room. So11 that 's like $1000.12 So if your rent is over  $1000,13 in this buyout  offer he can pick  - -  there' s three14 options. He can pick the one he wants. If  he15 wants to give you a stipend , if your rent is  over16 $1000, which in my case it is, he doesn' t have  to17 give you anything. All he has to do is pay   for18 your moving. That 's it. Legal. It 's the law.19 That' s all I have to say.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 MR. DANIEL PECKHAM:	Thank you.22 (Audience participat ion.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me read24 the names of the next several  speakers.25 Monroe Litman are you here?8 
2 MR . MONROE LITMAN:	Here.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.4	Chris Brandon?5 (No response.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Brandon?7 (No response.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Chris9	Brandon?10	(No response.)11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	John Skehan.12 MR . JOHN SKEHAN:	Here .13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.14 Gail Feit?15 (No response.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It's a great17 name. Gail Feit?18 (No response. )19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sheiline 20	McGraw?21	MS. SHEILINE McGRAW:	Yes.2 2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' re here .23 Okay .24 We are going to go with  Monroe25 Litman.23 
2 MR. MONROE LITMAN:	Hello,3 everyone.4 I wonder if you realize that5 Abraham Lincoln spoke from this  platform.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We look at7	his picture.8	MR. MONROE LITMAN:	Well , there9	you go. I never looked at that  picture.10 I went to Cooper Union. Do  you11 know that Cooper Union is a scholarship  school12 and that all the students go here for  free?13 I just reconsidered it with  a14 person in the library and the telephone  operator15 that my  - - you know, that  things haven' t changed.16 I was here maybe	'68.17 But the point I want to make  is,18 I issued this little statement. I 'll give you a19 copy if this will help.20 Last year I was here, I think  it21 was last year, and I talked about Scrooge  because22 you people are somewhat in the capacity in  my23 estimation, humble estimation, that you are  sort24 of - - you know, you' re people who, since you were25 appointed  by  Senor Bloomberg ,  Mr. Bloomberg,10 
2 millionaire , billionaire  Bloomberg ,  that you sort3 of have a certain kind of liking to the  man.4 I originally didn' t hate him,5 but he is working on me.6 I think a man with billions  of7 dollars  - - can anybody here tell me any of   his8 charitable works? I never heard anybody  address9 that. I know his daughter Emma just got  married.10 I wish her well.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	He gives over12 $150 million a year to  charity.13 MR. MONROE LITMAN:	Very good.14 I have to check on that.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	To Johns16 Hopkins.17 MR . MONROE LITMAN:	I think18 there are a lot of peopl e in New York City who19 should be applying to lessen their pain  in20 l iving.21 Now the thing is that - -  I22 mentioned	also about Queens College I have  here.23 I went there	' 48 to	' 52. And  at that time there24 was no tuit ion. I can't see a person trying to25 take full credits, whatever number it is  now,12 
2 fourteen or whatever credits per semester,  and3 being able to work a job and so on and have  a4 family maybe and so forth.5 Then I remember there were  a6 whole lot of posters that said "Open your books. "7 I see one here.8	But that too should be done.  I9 don' t know with the computer age that that can't10 be done.11	So I say this to you. I support12 WBAI somewhat . They're going through a lot of13 troubles in their attempt at democracy.  Roger14 Kilgore ment ioned this meet ing at the Brooklyn15one and theone in the future when you have  to16render yourdecision.17But I am very impressed  that18some of thepeopl e here brought up either a rent19freeze or arent reduct ion, all those kinds of20 things. These are not  impossibl e. We need  - - as21 somebody last said , why don' t you stand up  - - we22 have to have big action. But you too have a   job23 to do in that regard of not just being a  proper24 citizen, or not even a proper, an  improper25 cit izen, but a very proper citizen.20 
2	Thank you.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 Good to see you again.5 (Audience participation.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	John Skehan.7 MR. JOHN SKEHAN:	Wow, this8 just amazes me. I've been homeless for one   year9 and I've lived here all my life, all  forty- three10 years. I was born in Lenox Hill Hospital   and11 raised in the Bronx.12 All right? I've become one  of13 35 , 000 homeless people in New York City.14 Why am I standing in front  of15 you?16 With all these problems and  all17 these headaches, what can you do? Why am  I18 talking to you? I don' t know.19 The gentlemen, Mr. Humm, came  up20 and said something to the effect that , you  know,21 this organization approved rents increase  and22 fuel increase, but he didn' t ment ion whether or23 not he was making or losing  money.24 You know, if I was losing  money,25 I'd come to you: listen, I'm losing money,  help8 
2me.3But he couldn' tsay that because4that would be alie.5CHAIRMAN MARKUS:It wasn' t Mr.6Humm.7MR. JOHN SKEHAN:Oh!8CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Mr. Humm9was - -10MR. JOHN SKEHAN:Mr. Katz11then.12But the thing isthat he13 couldn' t say I'm losing money, help me make  money14 because that 's not what 's happening.15 What 's happening is New York is16 not foreigners, not people  from France,  England,17 Ireland , Germany come to New York and don' t have18 a place to live. They have places. How I don' t19 know. I lived here forty- three years and I  can't20 get a place.21 You' re not the problem. I agree22 with that. I think that' s a hundred percent23 correct.24 Why am I talking to you?  I25 figured it out. You can become part of a  solution13 
2 for me. You really could. You could help me  -3 okay? - start all over again, because I  lost4 everything. I have nothing: my family,  my5 friends.6 That 's not important. What 's7 important is that I get back as a  productive8 member of society. How do I do  that?9 I went to different10 organizat ions.  I 'm applying  for different monies,11 different grants, to try to afford a place  to12 live. I was supposed to be out of the place  I'm13 in in six to nine months. I 'm there thirteen14 months already and there' s no light at the end of15 the tunnel yet.16 Will you be part of my  solution?17 Will you help me so that when I get out of  there18 now, and all the things I'm looking for, all  the19 money  I 'm trying to get , all the things I'm20 trying to get  to pay  a reasonable  rent , that if21 you give a rent increase now, it changes all   over22 again for me and I might be homeless  again.23 That 's reality.24 Can you be part of the  solution,25 the one spoke in the wheel that starts doing  the2 
1	5012 right thing so that the other spokes can   follow3 behind you: the Mayor, the Governor, and all   the4 other things that we need?5	You know, that 's what I'm here6 for the past  few - - not miracles,  just do  the7 right  thing and help me , please.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience part icipation. )10	CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Gail Feit ,11	are you here?12 (No response. )13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No.14 Sheiline McGraw?  I know you're15 here.16 Aft er that , Marietta Hawkes?17 (No response.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Marietta19 Hawkes?20 (No response.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Estella22 Harris?23 MS. ESTELLA HARRIS:	I'm here.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Good.25 Maria Pena?12 
2 Okay. Those will be the next3 three.4 Sheiline, Estella and Maria.5	Go ahead , Sheiline.6 MS. SHEILINE McGRAW:	Good7 evening, Members of the Board, and my  courageous8 fighters.9 A VOICE:	Louder.10 MS. SHEILINE McGRAW:	Louder.11 Okay.12 My name is Sheiline  McGraw.13 For eleven years I have lived  at14 the Dexter House, an SRO on 86th Street between15 West End and Riverside Drive. The low rent  has16 enabled me to pursue my dream as a  dancer.17 Because of this low rent , I have been more able18 to focus my energies on my dance career  rather19 than having to work extra hours as a waitress   in20 order to pay higher rent.21 I've been truly blessed.  SROs22 are part of what make New York City so  great.23 A rent increase would deter  many24 potential artists from moving in. Such an  act ion25 would be callous and a great shame .6 
2 We also have in our  building3 many primarily working people,  school teachers,4 peopl e in the restaurant industry, health care5 practitioners,  yoga teacher, writers, dog walkers6 and so on.7 By pushing these people out ,8 where would they go? These are peopl e who9 contribute to our society  tremendously.10 And in terms of the  school11 teachers, these people are responsible  for12 educating your children, our children. Pushing13 them out of rent control , rent stabilization,14 they will have to probably move elsewhere and  no15 longer be able to teach students in New  York16 City, that already we know is in a very  bad17 situation.18 I would like to end by19 mentioning three points very urgent in  my20 opinion.21 First of all , the landlords of22 our building, Jay Wartski and Sam Gowalsky,  are23 trying to drive out the tenants of our  building24 in order to rent to tourists. Sixty rooms don' t25 have regular tenants now and fifteen rooms  are2 
1	5042 empty on the brink of turning into hotel  rooms,3 becoming a youth hostel .4	Secondly, the management  has5 reduced many important services. For example,  the6 maid service. They are now focusing on the  hotel7 rooms and ignoring peopl e living in the tenant8 rooms, for example, my section. So my section  is9 uncl ear, unkept. It 's disgusting. I think it 's10 disgraceful.11	And , thirdly, the management	is12 in the process of evicting several tenants  and13 has already succeeded in evicting some  tenants14 unlawfully. We need to change  this.15 Thank you for listening to  me.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 (Audience participation. )18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Estella19 Harris.20 Followed by Maria Pena , followed 2122 MS . ESTELLA HARRIS:	Good23 evening, everyone.24 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	One second ,25 Estella .22 
2	Eliya Feldman, are you  here?3	MS. ELIYA FELDMAN:	Yes.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.5 Go  ahead , Estella.6 MS. ESTELLA HARRIS:	Good7	evening, everyone , and Rent Control Board.8	I moved here to New York  City9 from Buffalo, , New York, in January and I moved10 here to go to graduate school to study for  a11 Masters of Arts in  teaching.12 And since being here,  moving13 here, the living circumstances when I moved  here14 that I thought would be established fell  apart15 and I found myself homeless in this City at  the16 age of fifty- seven.17 However, I did not consider  that18 a bad thing as I moved here to work  with19 children, at - risk students. And so I'm meeting a20 lot of their parents and I'm hearing stories.  And21 some of these stories are very  disturbing.22 Being that I'm fifty- seven and I23 will soon be of retirement age , I've met a lot  of24 people living in a shelter on Lexington  Avenue25 who have retired and cannot afford an  apartment9 
1	5062	in New York City . And I can understand why.3	The rent is outrageously high4 and it is more than the average working  family5 can bear. And it is a shame and it is pathet ic6 because this is one of the richest cities in  the7 world.8 (Audience participation. )9	MS. ESTELLA HARRIS:	And every10 culture, every ethnicity in the world  is11 represented - -12 (Audience participat ion.)13 MS. ESTELLA HARRIS:	- - here in14 this City.15 But you look at - - and I  love16 New York State. I love New York City. We have  one17 of the most wonderful places on earth,  in18 America, to live in, and we are turning it into   a19 pit because there are money- hungry people who20 only care about the dollar.21 (Audience part icipation. )22 MS. ESTELLA HARRIS:	And you23 have within your power a means of helping  to24 civilize that , to stand in the gap and make a25 difference. And you owe it to the hard - working10 
2 peopl e and the children of this City to do it .3 Someone said earlier today  there4 are 3 8,000 homel ess people in New York City. I'm5 sure that has grown because I've added to  that6 guideline.7 New York City represents  a8 cosmic sampling of the planet earth.  Every9 country in the world is represented. There  are10 those who have, who are seeking to turn  this11 City, along with all of the various  boroughs,12 into the City of Kings and a place for  their13 subjects.14 They wish to regulate the15 working class people and the homeless  working16 class and others whose lives are destabilized  by17 the high cost of rent.18 They want New York to become  the19 Silicon Valley of the East . They want to preserve20 the right of the have' s to forever stand on the21 backs of the have not 's.22 (Audience part icipation .)23 MS. ESTELLA HARRIS:	And that' s24 wrong.25 This country was founded on  the2 
1	5082 principle that every man and woman and child  are3 ent itled to a decent , affordable place to live4 that is not a king' s ransom .5	What do you do about the  housing6 crisis? This is not a problem. It is a  situation7 and you all know that there is a solution.  The8 solut ion is to not continue those who have money9 to continue to build houses, property  like10 Tribeca III , Millennium Towers with the average11 one-bedroom of $750,000. What the hell do  they12 have? Diamonds and gold inlaid  floors?13 In Flushing and Queens there  are14 buildings	they're doing a eighteen- story15 building , re- doing it and the prices are expected16 to be around $250,000 for a 500 square foot  one-17 bedroom. And that is ridiculous when peopl e can't18 even afford a home to buy.19 It 's not right . And each of you20 sitting there who are not homeless, not  worried21 about being homeless, not worried about  your22 family or your children being homeless,  because23 you can no doubt afford to subsidize, should  be24 ashamed of yourself to even let them put  the25 words in your mouth6 
2	(Audience participation. )3	MS. ESTELLA HARRIS:	- - that4	they deserve a rent  increase.5 (Audience participation.)6 MS. ESTELLA HARRIS:	This is7	wrong. This is disturbing .8 (Audience participation.)9 MS. ESTELLA HARRIS:	And for10 those of us who have faith in the  Creator,11 believe me he will not like it and you all  will12 pay for it in the end , even if it means the13 peopl e in this City rise up and do things that14 ordinarily people don' t even do under pressure.15 (Audience participation .)16 MS. ESTELLA HARRIS:	But these17 are the circumstances that make that kind  of18 fantasy.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 (Audience participation. )21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Maria Pena,22followedbyEliya Feldman, SussanClark . Are you23here?24Go ahead , Maria.25MS. MARIA PENA:(Through an
1	5102 interpreter) Her name is Maria Pena. She  comes3 from RENA which is the Neighborhood  Association4 in Washington Heights.5 She has been living in New  York6 for twenty- two years. She has been working as a7 home attendant.8	Most of the people in our  9 neighborhood  are paying  at  least  fifty percent of10 their income in rents. On top of that they  have11 to pay taxes, food , medication, all that kind of12 expenses .13 We don't need one more rent14 increase because that would force us to leave  New15 York City.16 She wants zero percent  rent17 increase because she considers you guys are  only18 support ing - - by increasing the rent  are19 supporting the landlords. We have to work  very,20 very hard in this country to pay our  expenses.21 One more increase means we are going to  be22 displaced  from this City.23 She's also a member of 1199. We 24	have to work very, very hard to pay our rent   and25	it ' s not  fair one more increase.
2 (Audience participat ion.)3 MS. MARIA PENA:	(Through an4 interpret er)	We expect you to find a solution  to5 this problem because on top of paying high  rent ,6 the landlords are harassing us enough. On top   of7 that they want us to pay a fee to have an   air8 conditioner in our apartment , to have a washing9 machine. For everything they want us to pay   more10 money on top of that. Another increase is   too11 much.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 (Audience participat ion.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sussan Clark.15 MS.

15132CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Hold3on.4You' ll go right after Ethel5Chriss.6Go ahead,Eliya .7MS. ELIYAFELDMAN:	H . Il .8	My name is Eliya Feldman.  I'm9 representing Senator Thomas K. Duane who can't  be10 here today. He' s on his way back from Albany.  So,11 unfortunately,	he apologizes for not being  in12 attendance today.13 And I will read his  testimony.14 I am State Senator Thomas K.15 Duane, representing  the 29th Senatorial District16 in Manhattan.17 I represent  a very mixed - income18 district and many of my constituents are   renters19 who allocate too high a percentage of  their20 incomes to pay their rent.21 Right now, New York City  is22 suffering an affordable housing crisis that  it23 has not seen since the Great Depression. When   the24 availability of affordable housing in this   City25 decreases as incomes for many hard -working New9 
2 Yorkers remain static , it makes no sense to shift3 financial burdens on to tenants who are  fortunate4 to have found homes.5 Tenants have invested their6 lives in our City and improved our  neighborhoods.7 Any rent increase now would be completely   unfair8 and unnecessary.9 In fact ,  the Rent Guidelines10 Board should actually be proact ive and impose  an11 immediate freeze on rents for all  apartments,12 lofts and SROs. I strongly urge you to do  so.13 (Audience part icipation. )14 MS. ELIYA FELDMAN:	The last15 few years, since the RGB began vot ing for16 extremely steep rent increases, have  been17 especially devastating  for tenants. Tenants are18 struggling to pay rent whil e landlords keep19 demanding  increases that they cannot justify.20 We all know that rent - regulated21 housing is the most important source of  housing22 for low and middle- income New Yorkers. The23 largest number of low- income New Yorkers, about24 forty- two percent , live in rent - regulated25 housing.2 
2 The 2001 Census found that  half3 of rent stabilized apartments were occupied  by4 peopl e with a median household	income of $32,000.5 In the United States, New York City ranks 11th  in6 housing costs and 37th in median income.  This7 leaves a quarter of rent stabilized  tenants8 paying more than half their incomes to rent.   Do9 the math. Tenants cannot afford any  rent10 increase.11 It is clear that incomes have12 not risen along with RGB increases. The  primary13 landlord argument that increasing rents  are14 necessary to meet increases in operat ing costs  is15 simply not true.16 In fact , while some operating17 costs have risen slightly in the last  year,18 landlords' prof its far exceed them. Look around.19 There are very, very  few tenant - occupied20 buildings  for sale. That' s because landlords are21 making a more than fair profit on  their22 properties.23 Remember  also that many  long -24 term tenants have paid enough in rent over  the25 years that they could have bought the  buildings2 
2 they live in many t imes over.3 Operating costs for 2004  and4 2005 have been moderate and landlords  have5 already been compensated as the RGB voted  to6 raise rents for each of the last two  years.7	Also, interest rates reported  in8 the RGB 2005 Mortgage Survey are the lowest  ever9 recorded.10 Another rent increase could  not11 only hurt those who live in rent  stabilized12 apartments, but also SRO residents, many of  whom13 are formerly homeless and at great risk  of14 becoming homeless again.15 I strongly urge the RGB to  once16 again vote to freeze rents for SROs as it  did17 last year.18 I commend the Board for  its19 act ion last year and I hope that the Board20 continues to recognize that SRO residents are  the21 New Yorkers who are most in need of  affordable22 housing.23 Raising rents for New  York24 City' s long- term residents is a backdoor effort25 to force them out of the neighborhoods  and8 
2 communit ies they have built. Because New York3 City is in the middle of a horrible  affordable4 housing crisis, it is essential that the  Board5 impose an	mmediate rent freeze for  all6 apartments, lofts and SROs so that tenants  will7 not be priced out of their homes and  our8 neighborhoods.9 Thank you.10 (Audience participation .)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sussan Clark,12 then Mariet ta Hawkes.13 Go ahead, Sussan.14 MS. SUSSAN CLARK:	Good15 evening, everybody.16 My name is Sussan Clark. And  you17 may wonder why am I here. My face is  very18 familiar because  - -19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You changed20 outf its, but we recognize you21 MS. SUSSAN CLARK:	I know .22 I'm very recognizable because  I23 come to all , most of all of your hearings.24 And the reason why I insist  on25 being here is I need to get my voice heard.   I2 
2wantto be here because I'm speaking in behalf  of3manypeople who cannot even be here  today.4And I'm a member	first of5all ,I'm introducing myself as a member of  RENA6	and I am an 1199 member also,  union.7	And as I spoke before, told  you8 before, I suffered a stroke a year ago.  I'm9 unable to work due to the stroke. I have a  weak10 right side of my body. And I became  disabled11 because of that stroke.12 So as of now, I don' t have an13 income. My rent is $640 a month. And that  may14 sound little to you all , but to me it 's a lot of15 money because I don' t have any income.16 Anybody with income it 's okay. I17 mean it 's easy for anybody who has a high income.18 But I don' t have any income.19 And there is a lot of  people20 that I see. I walk around on a daily basis in  my21 neighborhood and see people in my situation   and22 even worse.23 There' s a lot of senior citizens24 that I'm speaking in behalf of them also,  who25 live in my building, who are just  living8 
2 basically on just a little small Social  Security3 check.4 And I don' t think it 's fair for5 the landlords to get an increase on what  they6 already got. They are  - - to me they are gett ing  a7 lot . They are gett ing enough rate now as it is.8	Because where are we going to9 go, peopl e who cannot afford to pay any more? I'm10 making a big effort , as it is right now. It was11 heard enough  for me when I was working  and  it 's12 even worse now.13 And if my rent gets a bit14 higher, that means you are telling me that  I'm15 going to go to live in the street because I'm  not16 going to be able to afford an apartment. I  don't17 think that ' s fair . It 's not fair to me. It ' s not18 fair to nobody who is in my  situation.19 And  I 'm here speaking in behalf20 of everybody who is in the same situation  that21 I'm in. There' s seniors, there' s disabled ,22 there' s a lot of people in my situation in the23 City.24 So I 'm asking you to please  find25 it in your heart to - -  look at our situat ion  and9

Okay.23 Marietta Hawkes.24 MS. MARIETTA HAWKES:	Good25 evening, Board Members and  tenants.13 
2 I urge you all to vote for  a3 zero increase.4	(Audience participation. )5	MS. MARIETTA HAWKES:	My name6 is Marietta Hawkes. I'm a senior disabled  cit izen7 not eligibl e for SCRIE. I missed it by $1000.8	My rent is close to $1000  a9 month. I live in Stuyvesant Town. The owner  is10 Metropolitan Life. They are installing  new11 elevators. We have diminished service.  The12 upgrade has been out seven t imes this month.13 I have a tenant neighbor on  the14 floor with two children. One is six months,  the15 other is two months. She had to walk down  twelve16 flights. She couldn' t take her carriage that day.17 I went to a concert at  Lincoln18 Center at a reduced rate. I came home  twelve19 o'clock at night. The security guard had to  take20 me to another building over the roof so I  could21 get into my apartment.22 And I think that' s diminished23 service.24 I'm living in my apartment  for25 twenty- eight years. I used to think $500 was9 
1	5222 plenty to pay in the rent. I have an  old3 refrigerator. Can't get a new  refrigerator4 because  it ' s a hundred dollars more  in the rent.5	I have no air conditioning. I6	just bought another fan. I have five  fans.7	I go out just to get in - -  go8 into comfortable places like here for  air9 condit ioning.10 Since vacancy  decontrol ,  I see11 people moving out twice a month, two people   every12 month. You always see these storage vans   carrying13 furniture. This is all due to vacancy  decontrol.14 I'm speaking for most of  the15 tenants at 405. A lot of them are on  SCRIE.16 They're over eighty years old. They can't  come17 here.18 I go to all the tenants19 meetings . I see all the elderly and I'm  wondering20 how many even make it to the  meetings.21 Due to the elevators, they have22 construction in the halls. I would go out with   a23 mop and clean my own hall. And what happens,   I24 got glass. I had to go to Beth Israel , get five25 stitches . I had $70 as co-payment.8 
1	5232	I'm cleaning my own halls.3	And I'm also speaking for Jack4 Gitler in Queens and his wife, Rhoda.  They're5 Holocaust victims. Rhoda doesn' t sleep at night6 because she is worried about how she is going   to7 pay the rent .8 Her rent is9 (Audience participation.)10 MS. MARIETTA HAWKES:	Sorry.11	Her rent is $850 a month.12 They' re on a fixed income. Now they told me they13 have to pay $30 a month for the electricity  for14 the air condit ioners. This is in addition to the15 rent , the stabilizat ion rent.16 I go to a lot of tenants17 meet ings and I hear  - - the wealthy pay no  tax.18 They've got the loopholes. They have the   lawyers.19 The poor don't pay tax. No20 reflection that they are poor.21 But it 's the middle income22 people that are paying most of the  taxes.23 (Audience participation.)24 MS. MARIETTA HAWKES:	I was25 under the impression that the SROs had a  zero12 
2 increase. Well , I'm asking for a zero increase3 for the rent stabilized.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5	(Audience part icipation .)6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'm going to7 call all the names of the people who have  signed8 up and I'd like you to tell me whet her you're9 here or not .

BABAK SADEGHI:	I reside at18 the Dexter House . And my name is Babak Sadeghi.19 I would like to mention that  I'm20 a struggling artist here in New York and I   reside21 in a building which also has a lot of  artists22 living there. There' s a lot of dancers,23 musicians,  poets,  filmmakers, playwrights, you24 know, basic actors.25 And I would basically like  to18 
2 request a freeze on the rent increase simply   by3 the fact that a lot of struggling art ists  cannot4 afford to live in this City  sometimes.5	And affordable housing is all6 they have to allow them to continue as  artists.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' re8 specifically addressing the hotel  side.9 MR. BABAK SADEGHI:	Actually10 the hotel is just a microcosm of this great  City11 which is basically renowned for its  contribut ion12 to the arts in many, many  respects.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You want your14 remarks to reflect  in addit ion to the  - -15 MR. BABAK SADEGHI:	In addit ion16 to, you know - - I would like to say that  it's17 because of affordable housing  I've managed18 actually to retain a stake in the City and   to19 continue my life as an art ist.20 And continued rent increases  is21 just going to make that more and more  difficult22 for many artists to survive. And that would be   a23tremendous loss here  tothe City. If we lost  our24artists, we' re going tolose a great , great25treasure that this Cityhas contributed to not
2 only the State , but this nation and possibly even3 the world.4 And as we all know, that  there5 are a lot of great art ists in history that have6 suffered poverty and they have not made  much7 success monetarily but have made a  contribut ion8 in their artwork, which is treasured as  national9 treasures by every country in the  world.10 So I would like you just to  keep11 in mind that along with the affordable  housing12 comes artists. And without our artists, this   City13 would probably be a terrible, terrible place   to14 live in.15 (Audience participat ion. )16 MR. BABAK SADEGHI:	And it17 would be a tremendous  loss.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Jones,21 James Jones .22 MR.

Captain,  fireman20 in dignif ied white hat , luminary white hat ,  had21 priorly instructed Jones, if the  plumbing22 explodes again, call the plumber, do not call   the23 fire department.24 Where was the  entrepreneur25 organizat ional staff during this entire ninety-6 
2	six hour period?3	At approximat ely 4:30 a.m. on4 September 24th this deluge ended. On September5 24th at approximately  9:15, supervising  inspector6 HPD accompanied by inspector subordinat e  knocked7 on the door. Jones welcomed them in. Jones   locked8 the entrance door.9 Supervising  inspector HPD10 immediately, simultaneously while  entering11 inquired was the plumbing work  done.12 Jones answered yeah, but we  have13 been outfoxed by the entrepreneur.  The14 entrepreneur  organization  staff racially15 ambushed,  attacked ,  assault ed, whipped O'Grady16 Plumbing mechanics  in the courtyard , calling them17 "whit e boy. "18 Martin J. O'Grady and his  group19 of mechanics piled back into a cream- colored  van20 parked at the curb; without closing the doors   on21 the vehicle pulled away from the curb at  ninety22 miles per hour.23 Supervising  Inspector HPD and24 inspector subordinate stopped in the foyer25 adjacent to the large walk- in linen closet. Linen4 
2 closet has an independent computerized  electrical3 mount .4 Be reminded that the sheet  rock5 contractor had commanded that plumbers  complete6 first. Grande Plumbers, Inc. were working in  the7 apartment.8	O'Grady Plumbers, Inc. asserted9 to Jones that their corporation had been  awarded10 the contract.11 Supervising  Inspector HPD made12 code entries in his log for the next three  hours.13 Jones brought him a chair.

JAMES JONES:	As I said ,16 Judge Frank, she retired after the events  of17 9/11. I don' t think she was 65.18 But I don' t know. But she19 retired. She told me to come to this  meeting.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.21 Thank you.  I appreciate  it . See22 you next year.23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	David Newton.25 Mr. Newton.8 
2 MR. DAVID NEWTON:	Good3 evening, Mr. Chairman and the Members that sit  on4 this Board.5 VOICES:	Louder.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Speak louder.7 MR. DAVID NEWTON:	Good8 evening, the Members, Mr. Chairman, members  of9 the audience.10 I was talking to a New York  City11 policeman before I came here today, which   they12 don' t have a contract  for the last two- and - a-13 half years. This officer told me that he works  -14 - and he is serving the City of New York, doesn' t15 have a contract for the last two- and - a-half16 years.17 I'm with the Center for Urban18 Community Service. Last Thursday, we hosted  New19 York City and New York State, which covers  all20 boroughs, a housing convention at the  CUNY21 Graduate Center with affordable housing. And  this22 is what we special ize in.2 3	When somebody in New York  City24 can' t do a good job of taking care of the25 citizens, that 's when someone else should step in24 
2 and do it for him.3 The Center for Urban Community4 Service is a non- profit organization, just  like5 most of the organizations who provide   affordable6 housing for the citizens of New  York.7 You might have an artist  like8 this man living in my building. We have  a9 building  that  - -  next  door to The Times Square10 Prince George, Harlem, also Lafayette, uptown11 126th across St. Mary' s in the basement , Dorothy12 Day, which is a non- prof it , they have families in13 it.14 I grew up in North Carolina.  I15 used to hear the  - -  summertime  I just  loved when16 it rained because the rain came on a rooftop   and17 I would use the bathroom  outdoors.18 Here you got the people coming19 from all over the world. This is the  mosaic.20 I live on East 28th between21 Fifth and Madison.	I listen to people' s22 complaints all day. I was just in Albany   Tuesday23 with Urban Justice Center.24 So for the life of me I  can't25 understand  a bunch of educated people	- Mr.2 
1	5372 David , like my name, Ms. Betty, Mr. Zelnik, and3 you,  sir, Mr. McLaughlin  - - when  I look around4 and I walk around in my neighborhood,  34th5 between  33rd Street , and  I see homeless  people6 rolled up in a cardboard box, I ask the  citizens7 of New York City where do all the homeless  people8 sleep in your neighborhood.9	For the life of me, when  they10 sleep on the step of the church on Fifth  Avenue11 at 29th Street where Liza Minelli was married , I12 don't understand. Every night they sleep in  my13 neighborhood,  cardboard box, push shopping  cart.14 This is between 34th, 42nd and 23rd and  going15 down.16 And they sleep on the side  where17 you sell all the nice things  there.18 But the other boroughs,	I don't19 know where they sleep.20 Now, for the life of me why21 can't we make housing affordable? We got  thirty22 some thousand people in the shelters.  Patrick23 Marquee, I know him very well. I've been   serving24 on his committees, Urban Justice, Coal ition  for25 the Homeless, advocate, trying to make  things10 
2 right.3 Damn, when I run into - -  my4 family has been into development	in North5 Carolina, plumbing,  for thirty years. His cousin6 played on the NFL. His father only had a  sixth-7 grade educat ion.8 So I think there's something9 mighty wrong with this  program.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you11 wrap up, please.12 MR. DAVID NEWTON:	There is13 something that 's mighty, mighty wrong.14 Played with the Philadelphia15 Eagles. His father had only a sixth- grade16 education. My grandfather built a whole  town17 almost , where  I was born  in, with a fourth- grade18 educat ion.19 And I come to a City like  this20 and people come farther than I do, and I got  to21 sit here and listen.22 I was a community organizer  last23 year on Wall Street at a non- profit and it still ,24 they are one of the biggest in the City. And I 'm25 an advocate and I have a monthly meet ing every2 
1	5392 month. And my job essentially is of the cit izens3 of New York.4 And  I get  - - whether you know it5 or not , because you don't talk to them on the6 train and you probably are not going to go  and7 set up an advocacy meeting and tell somebody  when8 they' re about to lose their house , when they' re9 about to lose their benef it what they are going10 to do.11	And it 's people over fifty. I12 had a heart attack at forty-eight working at  the13 Brooklyn VA. I 'm a disabl ed Vietnam vet eran.14 So when you go up on the other15 citizens'  rent , you're going up on mine.  I 'm on a16 fixed income. But I don' t mind giving back to the17 citizens of New York what someone gave to  me18 free.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So you' re20 against any rent increases?21 MR. DAVID NEWTON:	Yes, I 'm22 against any rent increases.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We appreciate24 it. We have to move on.25 Thank you .12 
1	5402	(Audience participation.)3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Harrison.4	MR. CONSTANTINE HARRISON:5 Ladies and gentlemen  - -6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Step to the7	mike , please. Just take the mike.8	MR. CONSTANTINE HARRISON:	Can9	you hear me?10	A VOICE:	No.11	MR. CONSTANTINE HARRISON:	Can12 you hear me?13 VOICES:	Yes.14 MR. CONSTANTINE HARRISON:	I15 have something I have to  read.16 Plato said , you know,17 approximately 2500 years ago, that truth was  a18 fair and desirable thing. However, it was a  hard19 thing to persuade men by.20 The portrait of that man  who21 spoke here, Lincoln stated that , I use the  word22 " cosmic " not the word  "God " because God has too23 many anthropomorphic	images to it. I use the  word24 ''cosmic." That cosmic must have loved the common25 people for it to make so many of  them.12 
2	Now,3 (Audience participation. )4 MR. CONSTANTINE HARRISON:5 the interesting thing is, you know, sit  here6 being a student of philosophy for all  these7 years, over forty years, worked for myself , had8 eleven people working for me, I can see how  many9 of these people' s hearts are waxed shut. They10 don' t want to hear anything about the hardship11 and the difficulty.12 However, I ask one  simple13 question and I'm going to read something here,   is14 this.15 Who bought this planet from  the16 solar system? What did they pay for this  planet?17 Why should I or anyone for that matter pay  people18 who go around , what you would say, monopolizing,19 controlling,  corrupting the system, acquiring20 land and building and forcing people to pay  rent21 so that these parasites can live high and  mighty22 off of others? Okay?23 (Audience participation.)24 MR.  CONSTANTINE HARRISON :	This25 is what the question we believe to ask.  This5 
2 planet came about through the solar  system,3 through the electromagnet ic field.4 I know you don't want to hear5 this but I'm going to explain this to  you.6	A, we are an organism.  Walt7 Whit man talks about a blade of glass. You and  I8 know as a homo sapiens sapien does not have   any9	more right than a blade  of grass.	The only10 difference is we homo sapiens sapien are  the11 measures of all things. Now we like to  strut12 around like peacocks: oh, I'm this and I'm   that.13 Yet we can multiply one  acre14 fifty times more vertically since no scarcity  of15 land. Okay?16 These same people if they  could17 control the magnetic  field , they' ll charge  you18 for the  sunlight , these  land parasites.19 (Audience participation. )20 MR.  CONSTANTINE HARRISON:21 Okay?22 They are not landlords.  They're23 parasit es. Okay?24 You guys have a copy of  this.25 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	We see it .10 
2 MR.  CONSTANTINE HARRISON:3 Okay. You guys have a copy of  this.4 And I'm going to read  this.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No, you're6 running out of t ime.7 Go right to the bottom.8	MR. CONSTANTINE HARRISON:	Let9	me just read it.10 Socrates stated twenty- five11 hundred years ago that where land owners  rule,12 you don' t have a democracy - I delete that out  of13 there  - you have a t imocracy. Timocracy  says  to14 me landowners rule and then it leads to  an15 oligarchy that eventually leads to tyranny.  And16 this is what we have today, the corrupt  court17 system.18 Bruno up there in Albany  should19 be taken out , tared , whipped, dumped in a   boat20 and thrown out into the ocean. The same  with21 Pitaki.22 (Audience participat ion. )23 MR. CONSTANTINE HARRISON:	They24 ruin our lives. They' re responsible  - -25 (Audience participat ion.)10 
2 MR. CONSTANTINE HARRISON:3 for the criminality, they' re responsibl e for4 poverty.5 If we get the proper housing ,6 you' ll have a better economy. You' ll have a7 better  economy because  they  - - the arts would8 survive, the banks would survive. The other  thing9 is small business in the community will  employ10 more people and you'd have a better society.  You11 would have less crime.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,13 Mr. Harrison.14 (Audience part icipation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Harrison,16 you forgot to add your demand for zero  percent17 increase; right? You forgot to say  that.18 MR. CONSTANTINE HARRISON:19 Well , yes.2 0	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 MR. CONSTANTINE HARRISON:	Zero22 rent increase and a rollback, and a rollback  and23 a rollback.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 (Audience part icipation. )21 
15452CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Diane Weston,3pl ease.4Diane Weston? You' re here,5right?6You loved the last speaker?7MS. DIANE WESTON:	Yes.8CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.9	You' re going to give us a show10	too?11	MS. DIANE WESTON:	No show.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No show?13 MS. DIANE WESTON:	No . I didn't14 come here for a show.15 I'm here again to speak  to16 everyone as a tenant living in New York City,   in17 Yorkville no less. Been there for many  years .18 I'm not here speaking  about19 myself even though I have a slumlord who has   done20 nothing but raise rents, improper repairs,   MCis21 skyrocket ed , attached to our new rent ,  6.522 increase for two years, which is ridiculous.23 People are being phased out  of24 their apartments.25 I had no heat for four years.  I12 
2 petit ion in Earl Harlem and Harlem every year.  I3 have a lot of people up in East Harlem and   Harlem4 who I love. They' re my brot hers and my sisters.5 And  I 'm going  there afterwards.6 I have experienced nothing but disast er up there.7 A lot of help is needed  there.8	Affordable housing is needed9 there. Whatever is happening to proj ects and10 Sect ion 87 We need Section 8 restored in New York11 City and outside.12 (Audience participation. )13 MS. DIANE WESTON:	And14 immediat ely too.15 You have the power. I'm  one16 tough Jewish woman who loves to get on  the17 streets and talk and find out what 's going on.18 As Marvin Gaye would say, what 's19 going on. And whatever records he ever made   have20 come to pass because we are living it  today.21 I propose  zero increases,22 rollbacks because people who are living in   rent23 stabil ized apartments are suffering. People who24 live in projects are not getting what they  need25 nor do they get services.9 
1	5472 You walk into a proj ect and what3 do you get? You get a vinyl floor and a  stucco4 ceiling. How about that? And urine on  the5 elevator.6	I 1   ve been to many.  I've  slept in7 many  a project  overnight  in someone 1    s apartment.8 It 1    s disgust ing. Things need  to be changed.9 The City is nothing but10 slumlords. We need to crack down on  landlords11 like mine who do not provide proper services.  I12 lived without heat for four years. Repairs  are13 not done properly but improperly and I 1  m start ing14 a case very soon.15 I 1  m here to make  a statement.16 Just because I live in Yorkville does not  mean17 that I have a good  landlord.18 What are you going to do  about19 speaking to Mayor Bloomberg and cracking down   on20 slumlords who do not provide service and open  up21 their books to see how they are profit ing, living22 in Westchester  in beautiful homes, while other23people out hereare struggling to decide, well ,24what am I goingto eat today.25(Audience participat ion.)
2 MS. DIANE WESTON:	How much am3 I going to pay for my medicine? How do I pay  my4 Con Ed bill?5 I have to balance.6 Well , rich people  don' t have to7 balance. They can always support corporations,8 and corporations get tax  breaks.9 But the poor and what ever is10 left of the middle class - because we  really11 don' t have a middle class. I think it 's  been12 phased out. Well , they were the people who  made13 America what they are. My grandparents came   over14 from Russia. My father's parents came over  from15 Austria.16 If it weren' t for them, I17 wouldn' t have been born. And they came to  America18 so my family could prosper.19 And unfortunately you have  bad20 luck along the way. Okay? So I had some bad   luck21 along the way.22 I'm a survivor, I'm a  fighter23 and I'm still here.24 What are we going to do to  make25 changes? Everyone deserves to live in New York.   I2 
1	5492 love New York. It 's a beaut iful City. You have a3 lot of cultural events and you  have4 mult icultural ism. And without multiculturalism,5 we don' t have anything.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you7	wrap up, please.8 MS. DIANE WESTON:	Zero9 increases.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11	MS. DIANE WESTON:	I 'll be here12 again	I'll be here again next year. And that 's13 what I'm proposing.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 MS . DIANE WESTON:	Thank you16 very much.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We appreciat e18 it.19 (Audience participation. )20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Judy Frank.21 She did say she's here, right?22 MS . JUDY FRANK:	Right .23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 MS. JUDY FRANK:	I have also25 l ived in New York City apartments my ent ire life.12 
  2 I have lived in Downtown Manhattan for the  last3 thirty- six years.4 I want to remind you though  that5 only two- and - a- quarter hours north of Manhattan6 there are higher property taxes, higher  fuel7 costs and higher water bills, yet the rents  are8 much lower than New York  City.9 So why do New York City10 landlords complain?11 Those upstate can't believe  the12 rents that we pay here. It must be greed .13 I was also given this sign  when14 I came here quite accidentally	"disabled tenants15 can't afford  a rent hike. "  I agree. Landlords16 should give available apartments at lower  floors17 for the same price. I presently live in a  walkup18 and I walk up six flights. It was  grandfathered19 in when a few seven- story buildings that still20 exist in Manhattan.21 I cannot afford to move.  The22 rents in my building are too high and I  would23 never be able to afford a lower  floor.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where do you 25	1ive?2 
1	5512 MS. JUDY FRANK:	Downtown, SoHo3 area.4 At any rate, I could say that  as5 a New York City school aide , DC 37 union member,6 I can test ify that New York City workers are not7 paid well . And I wonder where we will get the8 service workers we need if we have the  increases9 keep going up sky high.10 We need affordabl e housing for11 all people . Please freeze the rents if you cannot12 roll them back .13 And I wonder if the absence  of14 landlords here tonight makes me feel they don' t15 really need the increases.16 Thank you.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you.18 Harry Peliett? Harry  Peliett?19 MR . HARRY PELIETT:	Hello!20 First , I ' d like to thank that21 gentleman over there because,  in contrast to what22 the Chairman said about not being able to  turn23 the speakers towards the audience to make  it24 possibl e for the audience to hear what is being25 said at this microphone , he allowed that2 
2 particular speaker to be turned partially   around3 and so, therefore, we had the benef it of bett er4 listening quality or hearing quality second  half.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We thank him6	too.7	MR. HARRY PELIETT:	Okay. Good.8 But you said it couldn' t be9 done.10 I just wanted to make a  point.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well , he12 works for me and - -13 MR. HARRY PELIETT:	It was my14 initiative that got it going.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We' re going16 to do it next time too.17 MR. HARRY PELIETT:	Very good.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	New rules.19 MR. HARRY PELIETT:	Next time,20 reminds, a little note, about all around  the21 mulberry bush. Every year the same things   get22 said. And I have a question. Is there  a23 cumulative index or glossary of ideas that   are24 presented by peopl e who speak at the microphone25 before you gentlemen,  ladies and gentlemen,  and8 
1	5532 put in some kind of a document that says  these3 are issues that have been raised at  these4 meetings and we welcome input to dealing  with5 these issues? That was a  question.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have an7 explanatory statement which we do issue which  has8 a summary of all of the test imony.9	MR. HARRY PELIETT:	No, no, no.10	A summary is hard to digest .11	But an alphabetical , if you12 would  like, glossary of what  - -13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We don't have 14	a	- -15 MR. HARRY PELIETT:	It would be16 a good idea if a cumulative index were made  of17 ideas presented here in this hall at  these18 meetings in order to, shall we say, apprise   other19 people of what we are doing here, other than   just20 shouting zero, zero, or, well ,  t imes up. You  know21 what I mean?22 Now, I have a little thing  down23 here about a dist inction needing to be made24 between small owners, big owners and  giant25 owners, because it seems to me that the  big15 
2 owners and certainly the giant owners are   hiding3 behind the small owners. And that should not  be4 done.5	It can be done, is being done,6 but that is not the way it really ought to  work7 without fingers being point ed in the  direction8 of , shall we say, corruption, et cetera, et9 cetera.10 Now, the charge of  corruption11 can be easily assuaged by opening the books   of12 those who claim corrupt ion or claim there is no13 corruption, whatever,  either way.14 But there was a gentlemen,  has15 forty apartments, he spoke before, and he had   a16 probl em with what ever, whatever and	okay. This17 should be taken into  consideration.18 So I propose  zero increase, but19 with an avenue of possible redress for   small20 owners who can document by opening their   books21 what  the problem  is. That ' s just a suggestion.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 3	MR. HARRY PELIETT:	Now, I'd24 like to finish by saying that the  housing25 business is not like a car rental or   computer24 
2 rental business or vacation room and  board3 business .4	It is dealing with the guts  of5 life and it 's not dealing with it very adequately6 because why is it pushing luxury when so  many7 people can't afford  luxury.8 Thank you.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 (Audience participation .)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Kenny12 Schaeffer .13 MR. KENNY SCHAEFFER :	At the14 Legal Aid Society' s Harlem Community Law Off ice15 we see many very low- income people who come  in16 paying a very high percentage of their income   as17 rent , yet living with deplorable and hazardous18 conditions .19 And I've made packets of  seven20 of my clients explaining their rent  situations21 and attached photographs of some of  the22 deplorable  conditions that they have.23 I apologize that the  photographs24 didn' t come out a little better. I was at a25 meeting and I had someone doing it and this  is10 
2 what we have.3 But if you look at them,  you'll4 be able to see.5 The first tenant , Blanca R.  is6 paying a rent of $795.54 a month and you' ll  see7 photographs of a collapsed ceiling and rodents   in8 her room, in her home.9	The next one, B, is Maria D.10 She' s paying a rent of $816.70. She also came  to11 us with a collapsed ceiling that she was  living12 with. Her landlord tried to opt out of a  so-13 called preferent ial rent and get her to pay14 $1060.23 , which she would not have been able  to15 afford.16 We were able to defeat that.  But17 even so her rent stayed at  $816.18 The next one, Purina P. , her19 rent was $980.56. She also came to us with  a20 collapsed ceiling. You' ll see the photograph.	She21 has a Section 8 voucher so her rent  is22 affordable. The landlord tried to opt out of   that23 Sect ion 8 and we are litigating in court . They're24 trying to raise the rent that she would have  to25 pay to the full $980 knowing that she wouldn' t  be10 
2 able to pay and that they would be able to  evict3 her but all they had to do was keep the Section   84 and they would get the rent. It comes  directly5 from the government. They would rather not get  it6 so they could evict and raise the rent at  least7 twenty percent to $1,176.72.8 Angeline M. also had a  collapsed9 ceiling and rats in her kitchen. The  last10 photograph under C. actually goes for D with11 Angeline.12 Edilberto V. , paying  a rent of13 $928, similarly had ceiling leaks,  defective14 floors.15 Francine G. paying what  you16 might say only $676 a month, also had  defective17 walls, ceilings and floors, and paying a  huge18 percentage  of her  income  for rent .19 Monique J .	is paying a rent of20 $750. 00 a month. Also ha? ceiling leaks, gaping21 hol es in her bathroom wall . The landlord made22 repairs and tried to raise her rent to $917  a23 month. We were able to get it reduced to  $750.24 These are typical  stories.25 I want to say that I come  to2 
2 these hearings year after year and I see  the3 Board grappling with what its mission is,   to4 preserve affordabl e housing. But how? By  raising5 the rents year after year or by resisting rent6 increases to preserve  affordable housing?7 There are two words I want  to8 focus on: abandonment and welfare. Year  after9 year the landlords comment saying that if   they10 don' t get huge rent increases, you are going  to11 see landlords abandoning their property.12 I can tell you since the  rent13 laws were weakened  in 1997, there hasn' t been a14 landlord abandon a rent regulated building  in  the15 five boroughs as far as I know who is in  his16 right mind.17 It simply isn't going to  happen.18 They say year after year it' s going to happen.19 And  the last comment , quickly,20 on welfare. I've heard this body say over   and21 over again you're not a welfare agency. But   I22 implore you before you vot e on Tuesday, read23 Section D, 26501 of  the Administrative	Code - the24 findings and declaration of emergency of the   Rent25 Stabilization Law that creates this  body.2 
2 It says that action is needed  to3 prevent  speculative, unwarrant ed and abnormal4 increases in rent. Action continues to  be5 imperat ive in order to prevent the exactions of6 unjust , unreasonabl e and oppressive rents and to7 forestall prof iteering, speculation and other8 disruptive practices  tending to produce  threats9 to the public healt h, safety and general  welfare.10 Your job is to protect the11 general welfare.12 And  the only - - under the lack13 of home rule in New York, the only New York   City14 agency that has any say over  preserving15 affordable rents is the New York City  Rent16 Guidelines Board.17 If you cont inue to raise rents18 year after year, even if it 's a few percent ,  it 's19 pricing people out , it 's destroying affordable20 housing.21 I see the clock says zero  zero22 and I'll end on that note. I think that' s what23 you should go with for the coming year.24 Thank you.25 (Audience participation.)2 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3	Peter Stone?4	Mr. Stone?5	After Mr. Stone is Mr.  Volinski.6	And then we don' t have anybody else.7	Is there anybody else in the8	audience who wants to  speak?9	Come down here. We' re going to10 take everybody who wants to speak after Mr .11 Volinski.12 Mr. Stone, Mr. Volinski , the13 rest of the people, and then we are going to  call14 it a night.15 Go ahead, Mr. Stone.16 MR. PETER STONE :	Your Panel17 seems to hide behind the duties with which  you've18 been charged , and also the limitations that  seem19 to be placed upon you by  law.20 How can you fairly, let 's say,21 negotiate between tenants and owners in  fiscal22 matters and needs when one side, the tenants,   is23 denied solid knowledge of the facts upon  which24 the landlords' stake their  claims?25 Considering what we heard  here10 
2 today with regard to poverty,  homelessness,3 evictions, poorly maintained  dwellings, your4 actions reveal that you must make your  decisions5 in a moral and ethical vacuum.6 (Audience part icipat ion. )7	MR. PETER STONE:	In the words8	of a very famous attorney, have you no  shame.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 (Audience participation.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Volinski.12 MR. JOSHUA VOLINSKI:	Volinski.13 Yes, apparently my name  is14 Volinski. And I'm a staff member of Radio   Station15 WBAI.16 And a few days ago before  our17 24-member board a young man appeared and  the18 chairperson of the Board , Roger Kilgore, whom  you19 know, looked him squarely in the eye and said ,20 "what do you want? "21 And he started yawing,  annoying.22 And she said: "No. What do you  want?23 And I 'll tell you what I want.24 I want zero increases this year and I want  the25 consideration of a rollback in rents .10 
2	And the reason I want  those3 things is because, see this sign, it says " don't4 price us out of New York. " Now, I don't know if5 you ride the subways. If you look at New  Yorkers6 who ride the subways, every year they  look7 shabbier and shabbier.8 A few years ago Life  magazine9 did a comparison between Soviet workers  and10 American workers.  If you look at American  workers11 going back and forth from their job  nowadays,12 they look shabbier, their shoes look more worn.   I13 never see a necktie. I see lots of T- shirts,14 women too.15 If we took a survey here in  the16 room and asked the people here how many of  you17 really maintain an automobile, we would  be18 shocked to find that most people here don' t even19 rent an automobile.20 How many people here can  really21 send their kids to anywhere but CUNY? I went  to22 CUNY like Monroe said. It cost me $70 a  year.2 3	Last term that same education24 cost undergraduates at CUNY $5000 , not including25 textbooks. And I'm telling you here and now  that24 
2 I paid $70 for one ent ire year at City College3 which is less than a textbook.4 How many of us can choose  the5 doctors we really need , the special ists we really6 need? We can't.7	You know, this baloney in8 Congress, if they changed Medicare  and9 everything, we' ll be able to choose the doctor  we10 need. We can't choose the doctor we want  right11 now because they are much, much too  expensive.12 And then there are a few  other13 questions I want to  know.14 They handed you Dexter House  and15 handed you some photographs  on Jay Wartski .16 Twenty years ago Jay Wartski trapped  Mimi17 Rosenberg, who was liquidating SROs on 23rd18 Street , in an elevator with two other women.  And19 this man was on Riker' s Island for thirty days20 for violating the codes of the City of New   York.21 And yet he remains in  business.22 And my landlord, his agent  who23 handl es regulat ed tenants, was caught laundering24 drug money in Columbia and this man is  a25 billionaire  and he' s still in business.8 
2 I'm talking about Abraham3 Lincrease	(phonetic) of Wyngraph	(phonetic)4 Management.5 So don' t these people accumulate6 criminal records or anything? I know I  do.7	If I did anything like that ,  I8	couldn' t  - would never be  rehired.9	Now you're human beings. You' re10 human beings like the people here in the  City.11 They are made of flesh and  blood.12 And I'm going to ask you  one13 favor. Stop playing clubhouse games, become  human14 beings, stand up tall and straight and make   the15 same kind of decisions that Abraham Lincoln  made,16 that Socrates made, that every decent human  being17 that we love, like Paul Robson and Dr. King  made.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 MR. JOSHUA VOLINSKI:	Make the20 right decision.21 (Audience part icipation.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.23 The people	- - you got to give us24 your name .25 Fix the mike. There' s just three10 
2 people left who want to speak;  right?3 Actually you spoke.4 Everybody stand behind you.  That5 gentleman.6 MS. JUANITA PERKINS:	Hello!7 My name is Juanita Perkins and  I8 am honored to represent over 3 0,000 of the most9 dedicated workers in the healt h care field  today10 and that is our home care  workers.11 The majority of our members  are12 single, head of household with small  children.13 The average income is between $7.00 to $9.00  an14 hour.15 The average rent in New York16 City is out of reach for most of our  members.17 Without housing subsidies most of our  members18 would be homel ess.19 Like our aides who give quality20 care to the sick and elderly, they  deserve21 quality housing. We know that we are in   difficult22 times, but don' t take it out on the working  class23 who are the backbone of New York  City.24 I find it ironic today that  one25 of the dailies has a news title that  says2 
2 " Yankees new $800 million dream, house that the3 boss built. "  It 's ironic that the City can  use4 the taxpayers' money to help subsidize  a5 millionaire, but yet most people are going to   be6 worried next year whether they have a roof   over7 their heads.8 We say no to any rent  increase.9 (Audience participation. )10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 Sir, introduce yourself , please.12 MR. MARK LUBART:	My name is13 Mark Lubart.14 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Lubart , L-U-15 B -A - R - T?16 MR. MARK LUBART:	Yes.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 MR. MARK LUBART:	I've lived in19 New York City all my life with a few  years20 exception. I grew up in Crown Heights and now   I21 live a few blocks away from  here.22 This is the first time I've  ever23 come to one of these meetings.24 My rent is about to increase  in25 the next mont h from last year' s guidelines. So10 
2 right now before the increase I'm paying $700   for3 a studio apartment. It 's an okay apartment. I4 don' t hate my landlord. He' s a good landlord.5	My apartment is 200 square  feet.6 Now, for those of you who don' t know, that 's a7 little smaller than the length of that table  I8 think in length. It 's 12 x 20. I pay $700 for9 this space. That ' s where  I live. That 's where10 I've lived for the past thirty  years.11 There is a building across  the12 street from here where the apartments start  at13 $2.5 million I believe.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	$3 .2.15 MR. MARK LUBART:	$3 .2 million,16 and they go to $14 million or something  like17 that.18 I don' t understand who can19 afford these kinds of rents. I don' t know  where20 you people live. I don' t know how much rent  or21 how much you pay for  housing.22 But I think that $700 is  more23 than adequate, more than what I should be  paying24 for 200 square feet . There are two- bedroom25 apartments in my building which are  nice6 
2 apartments that go for $4500 or $5000 a  month.3 That 's insane. I think that 's insane.4	And I don' t hate my landlord.5 The building	is an okay building.6 I don' t know how much my7 landlord makes. He has cellphone equipment on   the8 roof now which I think is probably affecting  my9 health in the long run and he' s getting  rents10 from the cellphone towers on the  roof.11 I don' t know how much he is12 getting from that. But it seems to me that  the13 rents are high.14 I pass by some rental  agencies15 and I look to see if I can move somewhere   else16 and the rents - - a  one- bedroom apartment	- - the17 rents for one - bedroom apartments are $5000/$6000.18 I don' t understand this.19 Now, maybe you think that 's okay20 and maybe  you think  it ' s okay to increase these21 rents.22 And it' s not that I feel that23 the landlords should not be entitled to   earn24 money. They certainly should be.  They're25 providing housing, they' re supporting the5 
  2 housing. I don' t feel that they should be  broke3 because they are providing  housing.4 But at some point this should  -5 - you reach a limit. I'm paying $500 a mont h  for6 medical insurance , which provides me with  a7 gynecological doctor as part of that $500. I   get8 the right to go to a  gynecologist.9 I don' t understand  that .10 But everybody seems to  think11 that 's okay, that 's reasonable.12 I just feel that rents are13 getting outrageous. Condos are outrageous.  Co-14 ops are outrageous.  I see real  estate  rental  - -15 real estat e agencies and ask what 's a one-bedroom16 apartment . And they tell me, well , around 17	$800 , 000.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	To buy?19 MR. MARK LUBART:	Why?20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	To buy.21 MR. MARK LUBART:	To buy. To22 buy. That 's a co-op. That' s not even to buy.23 That ' s just  for a share.  $800,000 for a one-24 bedroom apartment. I don' t know who earns  this25 kind of money.  I don' t understand  it .18
