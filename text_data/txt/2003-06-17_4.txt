2 insurance increases inside your basket of  over3 twenty- five percent just recently. But in4 addition to that , there' s things that are outside5 the basket that aren't reflect ed.6 My insurance has had to go  from7 prime companies to second tier companies.  Just8 last week one of my old prime companies sent me  a9 letter that there is a case going through  the10 County Supreme Court where the claimed amount  is11 $21 million. I have a limit of insurance of  $112 million basic , $2 million aggregat e. They are13 letting me know who my lawyers are and they  have14 a paragraph here I would like to read to  you.15 " The amount  claimed  exceeds your16 Limit of Insurance. Since we cannot indemnify   you17 for the amount of any judgment or  settlement18 exceeding your Limit of Insurance, you  must19 immediat ely notify your Umbrella and Excess20 Liability insurers . . ." about your pot ential21 liability. You may expedit e your other coverage -22 - or no, "You may jeopardize your other  coverage23 if you delay notifying them of this matt er.24 Addit ionally, given that your liability may25 exceed GNY' s policy limit , you may retain your2 
2 own attorney, at your own cost , to protect your3 interests and to coordinate with the law  firm4 that ... " will be assigned to you.5 Let me tell you I'm facing  $216 million. It would bankrupt me many times  over.7	In addition to that , I just want8 you to know, I am contesting that. I have my  own9 attorney. But no matter what happens, I may  have10 to pay out money because included in my claim  for11 this tenant is punitive damage insurance. You  may12 not know it , but punitive damage insurance is not13 covered, no matter what your insurance  company14 covers.15 If I were to get $1 million,16 which I have in insurance, against me,  the17 insurance company wouldn' t pay it. I would pay18 it. I would lose my house, I'd lose my car,  I'd19 lose my bank account.20 Where is that in your basket  of21 insurance? I'd like you to tell me how I am  going22 to cover these things.23 Thank you very much.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 (Audience participation.)8 
2CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3Len Sturm. Are you here?4MR. LEYLAND G. STURM:	Here .5Yes, sir.6CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.7MR. LEYLAND G. STURM:	My name8 is Len Sturm. I live in a Glenwood building  which9 is owned by Leonard Litwin. I live at 1520  York10 Avenue. That 's 80th Street.11 And I'm here to ask  several12 questions. If you answer them when I finish,  that13 would be fine.14 A clarification of where we  get15 an 8.5 increase. This is the biggest increase  in16 fifteen years. Since the year 1983 , you have17 given the landlords a raise every single  year.18 Not once have they ever got a zero. Is that  true?19 (Audience participation.)20 MR. LEYLAND G. STURM:	Now,21 what I gather is you have three things  going22 the landlords are complaining about : taxes, fuel23 and insurance. Okay.24 I 'll pay anything you want to25 pay. I don' t care if you go up to 25 percent a8 
2 year. I don' t care. The point is we have to get3 something in return from these  landlords.4 (Audience participation.)5	MR. LEYLAND G. STURM:	I live -6 - Mr.  Litwin,  as you know, he' s involved , his7 name, along with Ruden, Sabor, Green, Mr.  Cohen,8 they' re all involved with the assessors. There' s9 a crime that 's been committ ed for the last twenty10 years. Where did all of that money go?  Millions11 and millions of dollars.12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. LEYLAND G. STURM:	Out and14 out crooks.15 I live in this building.	I have16 windows that are thirty- two years old. You can't17 even close them. It 's supposed to be a high- class18 building.19 Nobody  - -  everybody complains.20 We wrot e the landlord: please, we will pay  for21 the windows, give us a charge, give us  new22 windows.23 What happens? All the cold  air24 comes in. That 's the reason your fuel is going25 up. That 's partly anyway.6 
1	4552	(Audience participation.)3	MR. LEYLAND G. STURM:	There' s4 no doubt about it.5 For God' s sakes.6	Now, let 's get the security.7 Here I am in a high- class building. The men go  on8 vacation. I see a man standing there, I  said:9 "Where  did you come from? "10 " I don't know. They hauled me  in11 from nowhere.  I just  stand here. "12 I said:  " Who do you know?13 " I know nobody. "14 Leonard Litwin, he' s terrific.15 I'll tell you. He can make a quarter out of  a16 nickel , I'll tell  you.17 (Audience participation.)18 MR. LEYLAND G. STURM:	But all19 of these things have to be  addressed.20 And this 8.5 percent  is21 completely out of line . Let them put some money22 up. Let them match some of the  money.23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. LEYLAND G. STURM:	I don't25 want to take up too much of your time. I think   I7 
1	4562	made my point clear, especially the assessors.   I3 would like to know if they' re going to trial4 pretty soon. Are they? I want to get down  there.5 (Audience participation .)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay . Thank7 you.8 Any questions?9 (No response.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .11	Dennis Gittens . Mr . Gittens .12 MR . DENNIS GITTENS:	My name is13 Dennis Gittens. I come here constantly  every14 year. My wife and I , we worked hard and thirteen15 years ago we bought a small apartment building   in16 Crown Heights, fourteen families .17 Three- quarter of the tenants18 that I have they pay something as a little  over19 $500 for two and three- bedroom apartments.20 I hear the Council people who21 testif ies, says don't give the landlord any2 2	increase, but they sneak in by night and gave  us2 3	the biggest increase that we ever get in  taxes.24 (Audience part icipation .)25 MR. DENNIS GITTENS:	My24 
1	4572 insurance went up by forty  percent.3 My water goes up every  year.4 My assessment goes up  every5	year.6 Everything goes up for me.  And7 you notice, the tenants that are paying the  less8 money in the building, they are the ones  that9 give you the most trouble and cause you  more10 expenses.11	(Audience participation.)12 MR. DENNIS GITTENS:	Iam13 senior citizen too . I am sixty- seven years of14 age, my wife and I .15 I am not saying that  senior16 people or older people shouldn't get a break.  But17 it shouldn't be on my back. It should be on  the18 City and the State and the Federal  government19 back.20 (Audience participation.)21 MR. DENNIS GITTENS:	Some of22 these people are in the stock market . Some of23 them did very well .24 I'm in this business and it is  a25 business like any other business, and I  should12 
2 after I put my hard - earned money and all that I3 do, I 'm proud to tell you I 'm a good  landlord,4 I'm in the building every day, and I should get  a5	profit  from  this building because	- -6	(Audience participation.)7	MR. DENNIS GITTENS:	- - I'm8 working very hard.9 And the way it 's going I am not10 getting a prof it and I think it is right , it is11 fair for me to get a profit.12 And I think that when they  talk13 about small landlords making money, I don't  know14 where these people come from. We are not  making15 money. Every day it is getting worse for  us.16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 Questions?19 (No response.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,21 Mr. Gittens.22 Linda Zoblotsky, is she here?23 MS. LINDA ZOBLOTSKY:	Yes, I24 am.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay, Linda.8 
1	4592	Come on down!3	MS. LINDA ZOBLOTSKY:	Hello,4 ladies and gentlemen of the Rent  Guidelines5 Board.6 I know it 's been a long day and7 I'm another tenant here to say no rent  increases8 this year.9 (Audience participation.)10 MS. LINDA ZOBLOTSKY: I live  in11 the Upper West Side. And I've been paying  my12 rent , fifty percent of my income, on time for the13 last ten years.14 When I first moved in, my15 landlord put in new porcelain paint in my tub.  It16 lasted one bath. But my landlord was still  able17 to raise the rent $100 from the previous  tenant.18 Even though rents are rising,  we19 have mice and roaches. We have more mice  and20 roaches every time an apartment in upgraded  with21 cheap kitchen apartments, a coat of paint and  a22 patch of putty to hide the water damage,  which23 comes again and again. Yet the landlord  can24 charge more rent.25 I see new fancy residential4 
2 buildings popping up . But I 'm not bringing home3 the salary to be able to rent one of  those4 apartments and I don't live in anything  like5 those apartments.6 I currently pay $740 a month  for7 an eight -by- ten studio in a very old building. We8 have problems getting our packages because  the9 landlord locks them up and isn't in the  building10 every day. We don' t have a doorman.11 I 'm telling you, I don' t live in12 a brand new high- rise. I live in an old tenement13 building with holes in wooden floors  and14 inconsistent hot water and my landlord  owns15 several residential buildings like mine  along16 with commercial property.17 We rent - regulated tenants are18 artists, teachers, retired people,  waitresses,19 writers,  people  taking  care of retired - -20 (Audience participation. )21 MS.  LINDA ZOBLOTSKY:  - - parents,22 just trying to live from day- to- day.23 And yet we provide services  that24 make New .York City a desirable place to live and25 visit.2 
1	4612	(Audience participation .)3	MS . LINDA ZOBLOTSKY :	If we4 can' t afford tourist housing stock, where do you5 suggest we go? What is the cost of building  new6 affordable homes as opposed to  preserving7 affordable housing? It 's frightening to face rent8 increases for whatever reason when your income9 just isn't keeping up .10 You can't find a studio below11 $1000 a month unless the building has  serious12 roaches and leaks, and my building is one  of13 those buildings. But this is the best I  can14 afford.15 Please listen to our  concerns16 and prayers about no rent increases . A rent17 increase means for us making choices  between18 rent , food and medicine. We' re decent , hard-19 working people. We' re people looking for work.20 (Audience participation.)21 MS . LINDA ZOBLOTSKY :	We' re22 people trying to make ends meet. And it 's getting23 harder .24 So please support no rent25 increases in this rotten economy .4 
2	Thank you.3 (Audience participat ion.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Elizabeth5 Greene. Elizabeth Greene.6 I want you to all know you're  on7 Russian TV now.8 (Audience participat ion.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You are. This10 is our Russian reporter. Wave to the crowd.  There11 she is.12 Go ahead.13 MS. ELIZABETH GREENE:	Good14 evening.15 I'm a lifetime resident of16 Greenwich Village. I was born in a house which  my17 family owned and ten apartments. It 's gone now. I18 live in an apartment.19 I just want to bring to the20 attent ion of the Board that the Village is now21 seeing vacant stores and they are up and down  our22 streets and avenues this  year.23 I know a lot of people who  do24 manage buildings. Most of - - many, many of    the25 Village apartment houses were owned  by10 
2 individuals, but they lost them and they  are,3 indeed , now owned by multiple apartment house4 owners.5 I've done some renting work  in6 my life for small firms because that was what  was7 available to me.8 But I do want to bring to  the9 attention of the Board that these stores who  are10 being charged an occupancy tax and who  are11 leaving the Village, they supported the  rent12 controlled and rent stabilized tenants  upstairs.13 Their rents paid by far, and do still pay,  the14 stores and restaurants that are there, pay  the15 majority of the taxes and the maintenance  fees16 which are charged there.17 And I can walk you  into18 buildings where people are paying two,  three,19 four hundred dollars a month  rent.20 The tragedy here is that  unless21 these very low rents are balanced out , the22 building will not be supportable and will go   in23 rem. And if those stores cannot be rented , it24 will take the tenants down with  it.25 And I bring this to  your2 
2 attention because I think that it is  the3 imbalance that is doing the harm, the very  low4 rents in a building and two or three very  high5 rents. There is some way that it should  be6 balanced if we are to save these  buildings.7 Thank you.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)

2 New York, rent stabilized apartments should  be3 frozen for the year 2003.4 A PARTICIPANT:	A little louder.5 MR . W. H. AYRES:	The middle6 class are the ones who are paying the  greatest7 amount and the greatest share of taxes  and8 represent huge purchasing  power.9 We must remember that  stabilized10 rents have gone up year after year after  year11 regardless of any real increases or  decreases12 that the landlord experienced over  time.13 It is obvious that the Rent14 Guidelines Board has been  automatically15 increasing the rent rates on a pro forma basis  as16 per the demands of landlords. For one year  at17 least this must stop.18 As a retired senior citizen  who19 is living on a small limited income, I am  finding20 it more and more diff icult to maintain my21 standard of living due to the increases in  the22 cost of food, medical cost s, transit fees and23 taxes.24 My income, along with a great25 number of middle class citizens, puts me in  the6 
2 twilight zone, in an area where I could  not3 qualify for SCRIE and where I cannot continue  to4 maintain a comfortable and realistic  lifestyle5 based on my limited and frozen  income.6	Thank you.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 (Audience participation.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mariana10	Mohylyn. Yes? Is she here?11	A PARTICIPANT:	Yes, she's here.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.13 MS. MARIANA MOHYLYN:	Good14 evening, ladies and gentlemen.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Pull the mike16 down.17 MS. MARIANA MOHYLYN:	Down? All18 right.19 What is the greatest  American20 dream? For most people that come to USA,  I21 believe as soon as any of us can, we want to   own22 a house. And those who finally make it , we get23 engaged into a dedicated slavery for as long  as24 we are the owners.25 (Audience participation.)12 
2 MS. MARIANA MOHYLYN:	It is the3 apartment house where you live and rent some.  We4 also believe that what we buy with our blood  and5 sweat is ours. And to our amazement and  rude6 awakening, we find out that , even though it is my7 money that purchased the property, it is my  money8 that pays maintenance  and pays  fuel , heat ,9 electricity, insurance, that also I am really  not10 the owner.11 (Audience participation. )12 MS. MARIANA MOHYLYN:	Why not?13 Do you know who really owns the14 place? The City of New York. And I had  personal15 experience of it.16 I , as a woman, bring up a  child17 without a husband , had very hard time. I was a18 good landlord and kind. The tenants didn't  pay19 too much and some lived for nothing . However, it20 didn' t bother me really. It still was okay.21 But when push comes to shove  and22 I could not pay real estate taxes, what do  our23 City Councilmen do? Once upon a time it  was24 twelve percent interest if you have not  paid25 taxes. It was five years. They made it  eighty2 
2 percent interest compounded daily. That is  the3 fine. And the City takes over the lien  and4 eighteen percent.5 The City Councilmen did make6 that. They don' t want anybody to be owner. It7 means they want here in the City that the  City8 should be owner. And the City doesn' t do a better9 job than private owner.10 Now I was losing a house and  the11 threat was from our finance office here  under12 Giuliani 's government. And I don' t know whether13 he could do anything about it because the  City14 Councilmen are dictating those  things.15 And, of course, the money  for16 the City is necessary. However, we should not  be17 the slaves of the City. The City   - -18 (Audience participation.)19 MS. MARIANA MOHYLYN:	should20 not be then the pusher and the pimp that makes  me21 a whore on and on until I cannot make the  money22 from the tenants to pay all of those  expenses.23 (Audience participation.)24 MS. MARIANA MOHYLYN:	That they25 confiscate and then they sell it . And you know2 
2where they sellit? On the market in front of  the3court for theirown friends for the money that  I4supposedly owe.They pushed	- -  $800,000 they say5	I owe or else we' ll take the house away.6 So what do I do? I don' t want to7 buy. I want to live in the house that I  bought8 because it 's mine.9 But is that America?	Is that New10 York City? It is unreasonable. It is not  really11	freedom. It is not really truth. There' s a12 decept ion, deception, deception, deception.13 Now, I am a tenant now. I  am14 tenant now. I have no  house.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. You16 have to wrap up.17 MS. MARIANA MOHYLYN:	And it 's18 not easy also to be a tenant because woman is  one19 thing and man is another thing. You know what  man20 is. Man thinks that' s their baby, their house,21 their baby. So they want as much money.  There' s22 no end. They don' t know where the end is.23 (Audience participation.)24 MS. MARIANA MOHYLYN:	So I25 think that every  - - listen, listen,  listen.12 
2 The people should own the3 property. And they own my house, they should  own4 the property. They should together with the  City5 because City really own, make the house  and6 invest and everybody has an apartment and  they7 are the owners. And then be comfortable.  You8 don't have animosity there.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 MS. MARIANA MOHYLYN:	You11 understand?12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You' re way13 over time. We appreciate  it.14 MS. MARIANA MOHYLYN:	Because15 we need reasonable rents and we need  reasonable16 City and City should not own my  house.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank18 you. Thank you.19 (Audience participation.)20 MS. MARIANA MOHYLYN:	Barbara21 Simmons. Is she here? Barbara  Simmons.22 (No response.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Janet Henne.24 Yes? Janet , are you here?

2 MS. JANET HENNE:	Good evening.3 I don' t know what to say after4 hearing all the lies. It 's very difficult to5 fight lies.6	You want to give them a raise.7 We've had  - -  I live with a landlord who is  the8 largest landlord in the City, or claims to be,  of9 rent stabilized apartments.10We had no heat most of  the11wint er.It was turned off May 1st , which was12againstthe law. I think they saved money  there.13They' re constantly saving money.14We havestaff that is cut. We have staff  that15gets sicks, goes to the hospital. They know the16staff is notgoing to be there. They' re not17replaced. Wesave money there.18You' re told there' s forty- five19cents on thedollar profit. It's a lot  more.20Believe me.21	You can just stay - - come to  my22building andwatch all the cuts which adds to  the23prof it.24Now I have people living five  in25	a one-bedroom apartment	- husband, wife, two
2 children, and a grandmother to live there to  take3 care of the children so the parents can go  to4 work to pay the rent. They can't  move.5	This is no way to live,  five6	people in an apartment .7	What are they going to do? Get  a8 third job? Certainly can't have another  child.9 And I hear all these  wonderful10 lies about all the expenses are going  up,11	expenses going up . And I see them going down.12 Just come to a building and watch. That 's all you13 have to do.14 I would love to take everybody15 on a tour and you can see all of the increase   in16 prof its, not decrease .17 Thank you .18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 Sabine Zauderer. Is she here?21 A PARTICIPANT:	Yes .22 MS. SABINE ZAUDERER :	I am23 Sabine Zauderer. I'm a  landlady.24 Ladies and gentlemen:25 I'm no politician and I'm  not12 
2 here to acquire your votes . I manage my own3 buildings . I'm familiar with renting, billing and4 paying the bills all by myself .5 I know about  rent control , rent6 stabilization  and  decontrol .7	In April I had six stabilized 8 leases for renewal. My building is on West  End 9 Avenue. My total monthly increase came to about 10	$260.11 Then I opened my oil bill , a12 bill which last year came to about  $4,500,13 amounted now to $7,500. I was thinking that  the14 lousy increases I got were not worth my work .15 If you tenants are able to live16 in buildings fairly maintained, you have to  thank17 the few decontroll ed tenants . If not for them,18 most of the buildings would have to  file19 bankruptcy.20 So be realistic . Protect the21 viability of New York' s real estate, consider the22 high increases in taxes, insurance,  repairs,23 wages and so on.24 What about the repairs to  the25 facades imposed by law? Unl ess you pay for all11 
2 the hardships, you may be faced by  bankruptcies.3 So be realistic and think about increases of  154 percent and continue decontrol of high  rent5 apartments.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank7	you.8 A PARTICIPANT:	Open your books.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10	(Audience participation. )11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'm going to12 read some names now.13 Thank you.14 I'm going to read some names  now15 and see who is here so we can figure out an   order16 here.17 A PARTICIPANT:	Some people have18 signed up twice.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We are going20 to read the names.

Every week I'm in Housing Court with  a19 landlord, most of whom are working two jobs  to20 try to pay the rent .21 The buildings are not in  great22 condition. They're in Brooklyn. They' re not core23 Manhattan and they are paying high rents .24 Something has got to stop.  Where25 are people supposed to go? You have to have  a11

CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right.We' re going to go down to two minut es.(Audience participation.) CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right.We' ll stay at two- and - a - half minutes, but when it 's over, it 's over. And if you're out of luck, you're out of luck.Loren Renz. Are you coming?Let' s go .MS. LOREN RENZ:	Members of the
2	Rent Guidelines Board:3	My name is Loren Renz. I own and 4 live in a landmark brownstone on the Upper  West5 Side. I've been a small property owner  for6 twenty- four years and my purpose all through that7 time has been to improve my  building.8 The house has eight  stabilized9 units including four that have been  continuously10 occupied for twenty- five years or more. Due to11 long- term tenants, two-year leases and very low12 percentage  increases, the rents for these units13 are extremely low for Manhattan, between $500 and  14	$547.15 In fact , they are lower than the16 average stabilized rents in the Outer Boroughs.   I17 heard $500 in Crown Heights. Well , this is,  you18 know, the Natural  History Museum neighborhood.19 Everyone knows that these  rents20 still exist even in the  best neighborhoods.	In21 fact , my tenants, all but one of whom work and22 have very comfortable lifestyles, are among   the23 thousands of lucky ones still enjoying the  great24 Manhattan ripoff. That' s not my term. It's the25 headline for a story on New York City' s crazy15 
2 rent controls in the latest issue of  the3 Economist magazine. And I'm going to give you  a4 copy of that.5 In the past I have paid for6 major repairs and upgrading and for  steady7 increases in taxes and operating costs from  my8 own pocket and also by gradually increasing  the9 rents in the other units by turnover  and10 renovation .11 But now with my taxes going  up12 $5 , 000 in just two years, and heat and electric13 costs skyrocketing - not to mention insurance  and14 other operating costs - this subsidy for  low-15 paying units is not only unfair, it  could16 jeopardize the maintenance of our old  buildings.17 Let me explain18 In this economic climate for the19 first time we are experiencing vacancies in  our20 higher rent units. It took four months for me  to21 fill an apartment vacated last December.  That22 never happened before.23 In addition, I want these good24 tenants to stay and that will likely  mean25 freezing their rents until the economy  turns2 
2 around. So the old formula of using the  higher3 rent units to offset the low pays won' t work in4 this environment.5	The City can instantly raise6 taxes by nineteen percent , yet we have no way to7 recoup that. It 's a terrible economic model .8 A PARTICIPANT:	Open your books.9 MS. LOREN RENZ:	It 's time for10 the Board to address the inequities of ultra  low11 rents in high markets  caused by  - -12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. LOREN RENZ:	Excuse me.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.15 MS. LOREN RENZ:	- - by long -16 term tenancy and low increases .17 I ask you to impose an annual18 surcharge on those rents until they begin  paying19 a fair share of operating  costs.20 I also ask you to vote for  an21 increase of 6 percent for a one-year lease and   1022 percent  for a two -year lease - -23 (Audience participation .)24 MS . LOREN RENZ:	- - to help us25 with skyrocketing expenses.6

CYNTHIA SMITH:	Hl' .I12My name is Cynthia Smith and  I13live on JaneStreet in the West Village.14I stand here as a concerned15 tenant who has lived in my rent - regulated16 apartment for over a decade. Today, my  neighbors17 and I run the risk of being forced to move  away18 from our community if the rent laws are  not19 prot ected.20 Existing rent regulation  laws21 must be strengthened in order to protect  New22 York .23 (Audience participation.)24 MS. CYNTHIA SMITH:	To allow25 these critical laws to expire would cause  a15 
2 housing calamity unlike any New York City  has3 ever seen. To renew them riddled with  loopholes,4 such as luxury decontrol and landlords'  personal5 use provisions, would merely prolong the agony   of6 tenants who can do nothing but watch  affordable7 housing  stock dwindle away year after wrenching8 year.9	Therefore, they must be10 strengthened to protect the rights of  tenants.11 This year we have an opportunity12 to stand up for tenants' rights. This year we   can13 renew and strengthen rent regulation and ensure   a14 vibrant future for New York' s diverse15 communities.16 Rent - stabilized and rent -17 controlled tenants form the backbones of  our18 neighborhoods, establishing  long- term roots and19 invest ing social and financial capital into20 homes,  schools and businesses.21 I love my neighborhood and  the22 great City I live in, but it can only stay   great23 if we make sure that we can continue to  attract24 and maintain our neighborhoods and build   strong25 communities.10 
2	(Audience participat ion. )3	MS. CYNTHIA SMITH:	New York4 City is one of the world' s most diverse, vibrant5 places. Rent regulat ion helps to keep it that6 way.7 (Audience participation.)8	MS.

Joseph Turriciano.17 MR. JOSEPH TURRICIANO:	I am a18 small business owner. And I would like to ask   the19 other landlords where they got this insurance,  a20 twenty- five percent  increase, because my21 insurance went from $1700 to $3900. So it 's more22 than a hundred percent.23 Also, I'd like to say that  my24 rent , average rent , is about $560 a month. Okay?25 The main reason - - hold on  a9 
2	second.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And you're4	getting older.5	MR. JOSEPH TURRICIANO:	Yes. I6 can see that .7 (Laughter.)8	MR. JOSEPH TURRICIANO:	The9 main reason for which I decide to speak is  to10 address the low- rent supplement that used to be11 in eff ect for many years,12 A PARTICIPANT:	Talk into the13 microphone.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.15 MR. JOSEPH TURRICIANO:	Okay.16 - - the low- rent supplement that17 used to be in effect for many years until a   few18 years ago.19 I don't understand the reason20 for abolishing it. The rent paid by many  tenants21 is so low that landlords feel that they  are22 supporting them. I don' t think that there was  any23 criteria to do away with supplementing these  low24 rents.25 Tenants paying low rent are  not9 
2 necessarily  low- income people. Many of them are3 actually wealthy. They have been in  the4 apartments they are occupying for a long- time and5 the rent increases have not kept up  with6 inflat ion and new charges.7 Many of those tenants pay in  the8 range of $300 to $450 which is below the share   of9 expenses paid for them.10 We small building owners  can11 still afford to keep the buildings because  we12 personally take care of them doing many of   the13 repairs ourselves. We cannot have a  payroll14 expense because we cannot afford  it.15 We urge the Panel to  reinstate16 the low- rent increase supplement.17 High rent apartments get  the18 large increase; low rent apartments get a  very19 small one while inflation is the same for  both.20 In deciding the rate of21 increase, the Panel should also consider the   R.S.22 fees assessed  to landlords, garbage collection23 fines for the careless disposal by tenants,  the24 legal fees paid to dispossess tenants who do   not25 pay the rent. Some of them are  professional2 
2 tenants . I mean they are so good in avoiding3 paying the rent from six months to a year.   Then4 they leave to do the same thing to  another5 landlord.6 (Audience participation.)7 MR. JOSEPH TURRICIANO:	The8 Panel - -9 (Audience participation.)10 MR. JOSEPH TURRICIANO:	The11 Panel should take into consideration the  fact12 that some apartments are occupied by the  tenant13 and the immediately family plus several  others14 who are claimed to be  relatives.15 The legal fees to dispossess16 them is high so many landlords let it go and  hope17 for the best .18 Thank you.19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 Quiet .22 We' re going to read the names -23 - these are the names, these are the only  people24 who are going to be  heard.25 Gina Cuevas, you here?

EDWARD RODRIGUEZ:	I like9 many people who come before you have asked for  a10 freeze in the rents. The reason why I want  that11 is because for the past twenty- two years I have12 been fighting landlords in two buildings .13 My buildings, violations  are14 this thick	(indicating). Two weeks ago the15 inspectors came to see if anything had  been16 fixed. The landlord lied and said he had  fixed17 everything.18 They knew the building.  They19 said:  "My God , nothing has changed. "20 Okay.21 I've been to court four  times22 with him, withholding my rent . He gets paid the23 rent  - okay?  - and then we' re back  to square one,24 back to court again.25 This man needs to be done  like9 
2 the Spodeck	(phonetic) Brothers were, put  in3 jail.4 (Audience participation.)5	MRS. EDWARD RODRIGUEZ:	Put in6 jail.7 I have been living out of  boxes8 for the past five years because he' s told to fix,9 he' s told to repair, he doesn't do it.10 My bathroom wall is so bad  the11 t iles will not stick on there at all. Okay?12 It 's time to stop. He has not13 done anything in my building. He has  mostly14 foreign people who do not speak English.   They're15 scared  to death.  There' s no material	- -16 (Audience part icipation.)17 MRS. EDWARD RODRIGUEZ:	When I18 put mat erial on my door, he tears it down.  He19 doesn' t want them to be informed.20 And I've been harassed because  I21 will not allow him to walk over me. I'm   a22 disabled senior citizen on a fixed income and   I'm23 not going to take it.24 He calls me Mrs. Bin  Laden.25 People ring my bell to annoy me - -6 
1	4962	(Audience participation.)3	MRS. EDWARD RODRIGUEZ:	and4 if being Mrs. Bin Laden means to stand up and  say5 no to a slumlord who should be in jail , well ,6 then, I am Mrs. Bin Laden.7 (Audience participat ion. )8 MRS. EDWARD RODRIGUEZ:	Freeze9 the rents and the landlords should open  their10 books. I want to see where he has made any  money.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 MRS. EDWARD RODRIGUEZ:	Open13 the books.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 Gina Cuevas.16 (Audience participation. )17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Gina Cuevas.18 MS. GINA CUEVAS:	Good19 afternoon!20 My name is Gina Cuevas and I  am21 the Manhattan Borough Coordinator for the  City22 Wide Task Force on Housing Court. As a  borough23 coordinator, my responsibilities  are to provide24 pro se litigants in Housing Court with  general25 information on their rights and  responsibilities.12 
2 I am very concerned that if  the3 proposed rent increases are passed , many New York4 City tenants will be impacted greatly and  will5 not be able to remain in their  homes.6 The current fiscal crisis in  New7 York City has meant that average tenants  are8 already being stretched to the limit in terms  of9 what they can afford to pay. With a thirty- three10 percent increase in the subway fare and  an11 increase in sales tax, many New Yorkers  have12 litt le or no room in their budgets to absorb the13 proposed increases.14 With the unemployment rate15 currently at eight - and- a-half percent , thousands16 of New Yorkers are out of work. Many people  who17 are working have had their hours reduced and  are18 not making very much money.19 Tenants are not in a position  to20 pay the highest  increases in fifteen years.  This21 will be especially true for senior citizens   and22 disabled tenants who are on a fixed  income.23 This will also be a hardship  for24 people who receive Jiggetts and other  government25 subsidies.2 
2 Many of the tenants that come  to3 Housing Court are there because their income   is4 not sufficient to pay their rent. I believe  if5 the proposed rent increases go into effect , we6 will see more of our senior citizens and   disabled7 tenants displaced from their  homes.8 Once these tenants are  removed9 from their apartments, what will stop  the10 landlords from raising the rents to  ridiculous11 amounts that even middle- income tenants cannot12 afford to pay because they too have lost  their13 jobs or their income is not  sufficient.14 Not only am I an advocate  for15 tenants in Housing Court , I'm also a tenant in a16 rent stabilized apartment. I live near  City17 College, a neighborhood which at this very  moment18 is being gentrified , and is one of the main19 reasons that many landlords are not  making20 repairs in apartments where tenants have  resided21 for a long period of time and are being  harassed22 with frivolous court proceedings.23 I am opposed to the Rent24 Guidelines Board proposed  increases because  this25 outrageous increase would only benef it the2 
2 landlords. They claim they had a harsh winter  and3 high fuel and insurance costs. While this may  be4 true, landlords have been the only business  in5 town that has consistently made a profit over  the6 last decade.7 Even when8 (Audience participation.)9 MS. GINA CUEVAS:	- - it was not10 warranted ,  landlords  were  given increases.11 Tenants have not done as  well.12 I, like many tenants, have  been13 hit with increases and are not  receiving14 essential services. I have been living in  my15 apartment for eleven years. As a tenant at  this16 building I have been in and out of court  since17 the day I moved in because of repair problems  in18 my apartment.19 I had to live in uninhabitable20 conditions  for months.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to22 wrap up.23 MS. GINA CUEVAS:	Okay.24 As a single parent with  four25 children, this proposed increase will only  cause2 
2 great hardship on me with all the increases  the3 City has imposed on us in the past couple  of4 months.5	The majority of people in  my6 neighborhood are peopl e of color who depend on7 government benefits to pay their rent. Many  of8 them have lived at this neighborhood their  entire9 1ives.10 Their primary language  is11 Spanish, which makes it difficult to  understand12 what the landlord is doing to them when he  claims13 a Major Capital Improvement for things he hasn' t14 completed.15 They are forcing tenants to  live16 in uninhabitable  conditions so that they can get17 frustrated with everything and move  out.18 The new thing landlords in  my19 neighborhood	- -20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We are going21 to move on here.22 MS. GINA CUEVAS:	It 's the same23 holdover notices claiming your apartment is  not24 your primary residence or that you are  not25 allowed to have family reside with you. They  will6 
2 offer you money for your rent  stabilized3 apartment.4 The landlord knows once he  gets5 you out of this apartment ,6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Diana7 MS. GINA CUEVAS:	- - he could8	rent the apartment  to a higher  - -9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Diana10 Juliano, she just took your time  away.11 MS. GINA CUEVAS:	Apartments in12 my neighborhood are now going for as high  as13 $2000 a month . I am seeing many of my neighbors14 get displaced from their homes. Many of them  I15 see as they are trying to navigate the  Housing16 Court process.17 As a rent stabilized tenant  and18 a housing advocate, I implore you to not pass  the19 proposed  rent hikes on - -20 (Audience participation.)21 MS. GINA CUEVAS:	New York22 City tenants who can barely afford to pay  their23 rents and they will be overwhelmed if they  have24 to pay their extremely inappropriate  increase.25 You can make the diff erence in10 
2 so many people' s lives. Are you going to choose3 to do what is right for this City at this time  or4 are you going to be responsible for the misery  of5	these tenants?6	(Audience part icipation .)7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I just want 8 Diana Juliano, whoever you are, to  understand9 that you just lost your  time.10 Janet Bulam. Let 's go.11 (Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That 's too13 bad. That 's too bad.14 MS. JANET BULAM:	The term "poor15 tax" - -16 (Audience participation.)17 MS. JANET BULAM:	- - was crafted 1819 (Audience participation .)20 MS . JANET BULAM:	- - and applied21 by  tenant  advocates  to make you think - -22 (Audience participation.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let 's go.24 Keep  talking .25 MS. JANET BULAM:	- - that only19 
1	5032 poor people live in low- rent stabilized3 apartments.4 Nothing could be further  from5 the truth.6 (Audience participation.)7	MS. JANET BULAM:	The correct8 term  " low- rent supplement " was supposed to help9 small owners like ourselves to catch up with  the10 ever- rising cost to maintain apartments which11 house entrenched tenants.12 All of our below- market rent13 stabilized tenants moved into our  beautiful14 building on the Upper East Side in the mid' 70s15 and never left because it is a great place  to16 have.17 I say "have" because they don't18 always live there.19 To cite an example. Tenant  out20 of college moved in in 1975 paying around $225  a21 month. Tenant is currently a senior  vice22 president with a very prestigious	firm making23 around $150,000 a year and is only paying  $54024 rent .25 Tenant always renewed the8 
2 maximum number of years thereby avoiding  any3 supplement increases except  one.4 Tenant lived elsewhere with an  X5 for eight years, had others living in our  house6 from time to t ime, has a summer getaway, a new7 car, travels extensively and has a wardrobe  you8 would die for.9 Instead of thinking how can  I10 get such a great deal, people should be  thinking11 how can the owner continue to provide  sound12 housing when the rent only doubled in  thirty13 years.14 (Audience participation.)15 MS. JANET BULAM:	The important16 facts are that our taxes are ten times higher  as17 well as our insurance and that our Con Ed  and18 fuel have gone five times  higher.19 Taxes in 1975 were $4,800 ;20 recently $33 , 109.21 (Audience participation. )22 MS. JANET BULAM:	Our building23 is 120 years old and is in constant need  of24 repair.25 Eight out of twenty of my2 
2 tenants pay less than $550 a month. Right now  we3 need a new roof , new sidewalk, repairs to the4 brownstone, paint ed railings and all new waste5 pipes.6	I'm not sure what our  insurance7 bill will be after our three-year contract is   up,8 but I expect that it will be tripled especially  9	after 9/11.10 So I have to wait to do  these11 repairs for fear that I won' t be able to pay  the12 insurance.13 I ask you who will benefit if  we14 pay all our required bills and then the brick  and15 mortar crumbles down around myself and my   family.16 We are a small business. Like all other  small17 businesses we should be allowed to raise rents   in18 proportion  to our increased expenses.19 People who truly qualify  should20 be subsidized by government programs such   as21 SCRIE,22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right .23 All right.24 (Audience participation.)25 MS. JANET BULAM:	- - not by the10 
15062small owner.3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:You have to4wrap up.5MS. JANET BULAM:And surely a6	senior vp should pay his fair share .7 (Audience participation. )8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Debra. Debra.11	MS. DEBRA KABACINSKI:	I wish12 to cede part of my time to someone I 1  m sitting13 next to who represents Marty Markowitz 1   s office.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Marty15 Markowitz was here already today. So he got  his16 chance.17 MS. DEBRA KABACINSKI:	I want18 to comment for landlords.19 People. go into real estate for20 money, doctors go into the doctor business  to21 make money, lawyers become attorneys to  make22 money, secretaries like to make money  too.23 If you can't make money in your24 given profession,	change jobs, learn a trade.25 (Audience participation.)12 
2 MS. DEBRA KABACINSKI:	And I am3 addressing myself to landlords. If you can't  make4 money  at  it , learn a trade.5	(Audience participation.)6 MS. DEBRA KABACINSKI:	The7 current rent regulations must be  extended8 indef initely. MCI increases cannot be added to9 permanent	rents. Rents must be frozen for  those10 who  are permanently  disabled ,  totally disabled11 and those over sixty- five. And that includes no12 increases relating to MCI, no increases  for13 anything.14 You hit sixty- five, why the hell15 should you have to pay more rent if your  income16 is going to be $1000 a month?17 And the same thing for  people18 who are on Social Security disability such  as19 myself. My income is $1300 a month. I just had   an20 eight percent increase last year in rent and  I21 face another $25 MCI increase this year. Where  is22 that money supposed to come  from?23 I am not capable of going  to24 work five days a week like most lucky people.   I25 cannot.6

Come8on.9And my last comment is that  most10 people in the City of New York who work  for11 corporat ions are not looking at a five to eight12 percent salary increase . They' re lucky if they' re13 looking at a one percent salary increase or a  two14 percent  salary increase.15 I used to be a systems analyst .16 If I got a three percent increase every year,  I17 considered myself to be  lucky.18 That 's all I have to say .19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 (Audience participation. )21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you .22 Kate Elvin.2 3	MS . KATE ELVIN:	Good evening,24 ladies  and gentlemen .25 I've been a property owner  on24 
2 the Upper East Side. And I'd like to speak to  you3 tonight about the costs of long - term tenancy in4 New York City.5 For the past ten years  when6 tenants moved out , we could renovate apartments,7 rent would go up and the high rent -paying tenants8 would subsidize the long- term tenants.9 I have in a 20 - unit building ten10 long- term tenants in three- bedroom apartments who11 pay an average rent of a little more $500  a12 mont h.13 Up until recently the other  ten14 tenants subsidized them. But now there is  no15 increases for the newcomers who have  formerly16 been subsidizing the long- term tenants.17 If they renew their leases,18 they' re frequently reduced at no increase or even19 a rent reduction. As other owners have  mentioned ,20 when an apartment is vacant , it often takes21 several months to rent  it.22 (Audience participation.)23 MS. KATE ELVIN:	So the24 newcomers no longer can afford to subsidize   long-25 term people.2 
2 I've had a couple who  earned3 $700,000 a year and live in an apartment  in4 Manhattan. They pay less than two percent  of5 their income in rent because they've had  their6 apartment over twenty- five years.7 Their daughter, who earns  ten8 percent of what they pay, pays twice as  much9 rent . This  is an unfair system.10 It 's t ime to - -11 (Audience participation.)12 MS. KATE ELVIN:	- - give13 adequat e rent increases because right now with -14 - fuel costs have gone up  fifty percent.	I paid15 $10,000 more this year in fuel costs. I  estimate16 that your rent increase that you are giving  us17 will give us $3300 a year in rent increase. I   am18 paying $200 a week in fines for the   Sanitation19 Department which our Mayor assures us is  not20 happening.21 Ladies and gentlemen, it  is22 happening. The City of New York is  squeezing23 property owners every way it  can.24 We deserve a fair rent  increase.25 Thank you very much.2 
2	(Audience participation. )3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Phillip4	Richman.  Phillip Richman.5	Let 's go . Mr. Richman.6 MR. PHILLIP RICHMAN:	Yes. I'm a7 tenant in Washington Heights. I'm in a  rent8 stabilized apartment .9 I'm here because I have  some10 perhaps rhetorical questions.  I'm trying to11 understand what this overall process is  really12 trying to accomplish. And you may be  wondering13 that yourselves.14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. PHILLIP RICHMAN:	I've been16 listening to the pleas of landlords and  owners17 and I've been hearing about their  terrible18 financial straits because insurance and taxes  and19 other costs have gone up.20 And then we also hear all  the21 situations that tenants are subjected  to.22 But I submit this is probably23 not the right place for those considerations.   You24 are not responsible for welfare, for  tenants.25 You' re not responsible for welfare for owners.6 
2 What is your real responsibility  here?3 I submit that there is a real4 responsibility. You are here to support  the5 regulation of rents in order to promote what  has6 been happening in this City for at least  thirty7 years, and I think all the way back to  Fiorello8 LaGuardia, which is the principle that in  the9 City of New York, which is dominated by a  very10 powerful real estate process, which in the  past11 has produced very wealthy people and  very12 powerful people and extremely poor people,  that13 there should be a basic level of  affordable14 housing that doesn' t have any strings attached.15 This is - - your job is  not16 welfare.17 (Audience participation. )18 MR . PHILLIP RICHMAN :	That 's19 the point. It is not welfare for rich people  and20 it 's not welfare for poor people.21 And the arguments that I've  been22 hearing today are requesting just  that.2 3	They are saying, we  - - oh, we24 have this terrible situation, come help us  out.25 Well , somebody probably does need to help them24 
2 out . Certainly the Federal government isn't doing3 their job. The State government is trying to  duck4 things.5	But I don't think that 's your6 job. I think your job is to protect the  basic7 stabilization.8 But what are you actually  doing?9 Over the years what you have done is  steadily10 increased .11 (Audience part icipation.)12 MR . PHILLIP RICHMAN:	An13 increase  - -  so there seems to be a bias  against14 your basic purpose. And I ask you to live up  to15 what your responsibility  is,16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Wrap up.17 MR . PHILLIP RICHMAN:	- - which18 is fair rent stabilization.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 (Audience participation. )21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Joyce22 Holland. Joyce Holland.23 MS. JOYCE HOLLAND:	Good24 evening, everyone.25 I am a small landlord here  in6 
2 the City and I just want to share with you  a3 story.4 My mother decided to buy5 property here after living in a building  in6 Harlem for some years, and the City at one  point7 had taken over the building that we were  living8 in. And that 's why she decided to move.9 Aft er which we moved into a10 brownstone,	she saved her money, she worked  many11 different jobs, and I learned how to work  too12 from that exercise.13 I, just like many other  small14 landlords in this City, we' re nurses, we' re15 doctors, we' re artists. I heard somebody comment16 earlier - -17 (Audience participation.)18 MS. JOYCE HOLLAND:	Excuse me.19 Okay.20 We were all once tenants in  this21 City. So, therefore, we can appreciate what  it 's22 like to be a tenant.23 Therefore, I think that  tenants24 should understand we just don' t make increases25 just  frivolously. We make  increases  - -2 
2 (Audience participation.)3 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Let 's go .4	Come on.5	MS. JOYCE HOLLAND:	We make6 increases because we absolutely need  them.7 (Audience participation .)8	MS. JOYCE HOLLAND:	Aside from9 the taxes, aside from the insurance, aside  from10 all the other costs that were mentioned  this11 evening, we also have to worry about the  tenants12 who do not pay rent. We have to take them  to13 court. On the average it comes out to be in  my14 experience $4000 to $5000 for each tenant. If   you15 have four tenants, you cannot make any prof it .16 (Audience participation .)17 MS. JOYCE HOLLAND :	And that 's18 what my experience has  been.19 I had four tenants back to  back20 to back who decided not to pay rent .21 (Audience participation. )2 2	MS . JOYCE HOLLAND :	It almost23 put me in bankruptcy.24 This is my personal  experience25 and I hope that when you decide for sure that  you23 
2	are going to do these increases -  okay?3 A PARTICIPANT:	Open your books.4 MS. JOYCE HOLLAND:	Why? Why?5	Why would I work hard?6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Don' t debate .7	Let I s go .8	MS. JOYCE HOLLAND:	When you9 decide that you're going to make these  increases10 for sure, think of people like me , think of11 people like these people in the audience  who12 worked very hard all of their lives. We don' t do13 this just because we like it. We do it  because14 these are our homes.15 Thank you.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 (Audience participation. )18 MS. JOYCE HOLLAND:	Nancy.19 Nancy, let 's go. It 's your turn.20 MS. NANCY BRODESKY:	My name is21 Nancy  Sandor Brodesky.22 Present	my name is Nancy23 Sandor Brodesky,  President of Beach Haven24 Neighborhood	Council.25 My mother, Lillian Klein  Sandor,9 
2 was left a widow with two children to bring up  on3 home relief. I spent my childhood in St.  Luke' s4 Convalescent Home, shelters and foster homes  and5 Pleasantville  Cottage School.6 My mother' s body was too7 mutilat ed to be shown at the funeral.8	I'm sixty- eight years young. I9 was born on November 7, 1934 at 11:20 a.m. in  the10 morning. I don' t get to go on vacations like you.11 I don't get paid for what I do. What I do is  for12 love.13 But I'm sorry I can't - - I  don't14 know what you do because you have no conscience15 and no feelings, as long as it 's not yourselves.16 (Audience participation.)17 MS. NANCY BRODESKY:	What I do18 is for love because my mother' s body was too19 mutilated	to be shown at the funeral. I'm  ashamed20 to be an American.21 But you people up there, you  all22 suck and everyone of you.23 (Audience participation.)24 MS. NANCY BRODESKY:	As long as25 one person goes without food or housing, it 's the9 
2 whole world because of despicable people like  all3 of you.4 Like all governments  - - our5 alien government has sent out nuclear weapons  of6 mass destruction and no one questions it.  Because7 I know who is responsible, those who have a  smirk8 on your face. It 's all government who is9 responsible for 9/11.10 Oh, yes! And the smirk on your11 face when you hear the truth because you have no12 heart , not even a dollar bill or a - - you   have13 absolut ely no conscience, no feelings. All of  you14 are empty inside. You're the ones who are  really15 poor because it comes from here in the  heart.16 (Audience participation.)17 MS. NANCY BRODESKY :	And for18 all eternity we have to put a moratorium on  war19 and the end of the manufacture of weapons for  all20 eternity because of the people like you who  are21 sitting up there now .22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right.23 MS. NANCY BRODESKY:	Where24 would you be without your  money?25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay . Nancy.2 
2 MS. NANCY BRODESKY:	It is you3 who are homeless.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 Thank you. Okay.6 (Audience participation.)7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mark Mano.8 Mark Mano.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead, Mr.11 Mano.12 MR. MARK MANO:	I would like to13 say a coup e of things. I'm sure you are  all14 familiar - -15 (Audience participat ion.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You got to17 talk into the microphone.18 MR. MARK MANO:	I'd like to say19 a few things.  I know - -  I'm  sure you're all20 familiar with a number of them.21 A PARTICIPANT:	Can' t hear you.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You got to23 keep quiet.24 MR. MARK MANO:	Yes. That would25 help.8 
2 When the City takes over  a3 building,  that building  comes off  the tax  - - real4 estate tax, water tax, insurance, wholesale  fuel5 cost and they can't operate that building for  a6 profit. They can't wait to get it off  their7 hands.8 Vacancy decontrol  is working9 very fine in four boroughs. There is a  question10 to ask you why isn't it working in  Manhattan.11 There was an article in  The12 Times a couple of weeks ago about a woman  making13 $100,000 a year  living  in a Mitchell - Lama14 subsidized apartment. That apartment should  be15 going to some people here who really need  those16 apartments.17 That does not belong to a  woman18 who is making  $100,000 complaining.19 (Audience participation.)20 MR. MARK MANO :	This format is21 not to punish landlords. And by denying  an22 increase will not solve any problems,  only23 exacerbate them. This is a very, very  tough24 business. And if you added the hours that I  must25 work in my building because I cannot afford   to2 
2 bring in a painter or whatever, and I  worked3 today in my building, I could not operate it   for4 a profit .5 Have any of you ever been  in6 Housing Court and see the kangaroo circus  that7 is, where tenants can go for years and no  pay8 rent? And by showing up at eleven or  twelve9 o'clock, where I have to be at nine o'clock  with10 my attorney at $250 an hour, and it costs  me11 $5000 in legal fees for a judge to say give  her12 another six months, her dog ate the  rent?13 (Audience participation.)14 MR. MARK MANO:	There is a15 woman here tonight who said she can't find  a16 $1000 studio apartment. Well , if we didn't have17 rent control , maybe she would find one.18 You can't compare this to  any19 other industry. The computer industry, you can20 buy a computer for nothing today. But  nothing,21 nothing  has what  it takes to run - - the22 extraordinary talent and monies to run  an23 apartment house in New York  City.24 The agencies, the thirty25 postings in the lobby, the rent forms  and2 
1	5222 regulations, the violations,  the stopping of3 rent. If anyone had to complain, go to  Housing4 Court and you see how that complaint  is5	adjudicated. You will find that the judge  will6 order a stop payment and that 's the truth.7 (Audience participation. )8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You got to9 wrap up now.10	MR. MARK MANO:	Rent control -11	-   rent control - - one more second,  sir.12CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Well , hurry13up.14MR. MARK MANO:Rent control is15	the textbook example of how to screw up  an16economicsystemin America.17CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18(Audience participation.)19CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Rita Desilva-20Johnson.21Is she here?

MONROE LITMAN:	Look, I9 love Charles Dickens, Scrooge, I say to  you10 Scrooge isn't only for Christmast ime. It ' s  for11	full t ime.12 It ' s the biggest	- - we have to13 be bett er people. I'm an American.	I went to14 school . I went  to Cooper Union.  I got a15 scholarship for four years for free. I  studied16 with art teachers and so on, had a  wonderful17 educat ion .18 I went to Queens College  for19 free and I graduated	'52.20 The point is I didn' t have to21 pay anything. These poor young people today,   they22 have to work and study. I don't know how they  do23 it.24 (Audience participat ion.)25 MR. MONROE LITMAN :	It amazes12 
15242me .3All right. Now, what am  I4saying?5	The upshot of this thing is, on6	the bus a six-year old young fellow  said7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Speak into8	the mike. Speak to us.9	MR. MONROE LITMAN:	" I know10 God created man, but who created God? "11 That 's a six-year old who said12 that .13 I'm an American. And what do  I14 find? I find that the President of the  United15 States is the resident of the United States.  He16 wasn' t elected fairly when they were supposed to17 count all the votes .18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Monroe, are19 you going to talk - -20 MR. MONROE LITMAN:	In the21 United States, in Florida, what did they do?  They22 said , no, don't  - - stop counting.2 3	Well , I could have waited for24 the proper count.25 Look, everybody,24 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Monroe,3 what 's your position on the rent increases?4	MR. MONROE LITMAN:	A lady was 5 here before and a number of people spoke  on6 material before. But she asked you people  how7 many people are renters. The lady in the  corner8 was a renter. Everybody else had their  own9 private homes or condominiums or whatever.10 And, furthermore, they made over 11	$50,000.12	Now the point is maybe you  are13smarter thanIam, but the pointis - -I've never14made $50,000ayear.15 But the point is that we  should16 be working with each other. We should be  caring.17 There was a New Yorker cartoon which said,   these18 two people walking out of church, and one says   to19 the other, a man says to the woman, he  says,20 " Love thy neighbor?  Love thy enemy? Well , I  don't21 even find my friends  enjoyable."22 So the point is we had better23 review - - we had better review - -24 (Audience part icipation.)25 MR. MONROE LITMAN:	- - the kind15 
1	5262 of people we are and be more kindhearted  to3 everybody.4 That 's the reason I'm here.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Monroe,6 you're out of time. Thank you. Thank you.  Great7 job.8 (Audience participation.)9	MR. MONROE LITMAN:	Daniel10	Andrejczuk.11	MR. DANIEL ANDREJCZUK:	Right12 here .13 Hello! My name is Daniel14 Andrejczuk.15 Could you please raise hands  all16 who are tenants? Raise your  hands.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.18 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCZUK:	Thank19 you very much.20 You can see right now not  many21 landlords came here. I'm a landlord. Before  I22 became landlord I was a tenant. So I  understand23 two sides : how to be a tenant , how to be a24 landlord .25 That not so many landlords  here12 
2 because they're working. They're  fixing3 apartments.4 (Audience participation .)5	MR. DANIEL ANDREJCZUK:	They  6 are taking second and third jobs to  make7 payments, to make payments for the taxes,  water8 and sewage and damage that tenants are doing  to9 their apartments, and save money for lawyers  to10 evict tenants who are not paying rent , at least11 to collect rent. Eviction is a treat . But at12 least to pay lawyers to collect the rent .13 I would like to address the14 Board that rent increase should be, in  my15 opinion, for one year a minimum of 9 .5 percent	- 1617 (Audience participation. )18 MR . DANIEL ANDREJCZUK:	1519 percent  for two years.20 And we don't need any more  rent21 control . It is a shame that we still have rent22 control.23 Rent stabilization, yes.  Tenants24 need some protection because landlords  they're25 not all good. I don't think that all  landlords17 
2 are good. But no rent  control.3 Thank you.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 (Audience participat ion.)6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	By the way -78 (Audience participation.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	By the way,10 for those of you who are interested,  we11 understand that the Legislature will be  probably12 adopting a four-year extension  tonight.13 So we are in business here.14 Priscilla Durant. Priscilla,15 you're coming? Okay.16 MS. PRISCILLA DURANT:	All17 right.18 Good evening, Board Members.19 I am here to discuss a  problem20 which is your rent raise, also your landlord.   Why21 don' t you find a decision to rectify this between22 the tenants and the landlord? That mean you   have23 to go up on salaries for us to pay this  rent.24 Okay?25 (Audience participation.)10 
2	MS. PRISCILLA DURANT:	Now if3 you pass a bill for high salaries, they can  then4 pay their bills. All right?5 (Audience participat ion .)6	MS. PRISCILLA DURANT:	If you7 are going to increase on these agencies which  you8 are cutting, you are cutting all the agencies  -9 all right? - if all this money is going to be  put10 towards them, renovating some houses, no it 's11 going out the country.12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. PRISCILLA DURANT:	It 's14 going out the country. You must take care of  home15 first , not other people. Home! We make the money.16 Why shouldn' t we use the money for our needs, not17 other needs?18 You must help your people  first19 here  that ' s helping  you. We are paying the20 salaries here. All right? You must help  us.21 And that means that you  must22 listen to all sides, landlord and tenant , and we23 both need. Okay?24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 You did a great job.7 
2	(Audience participation. )3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Filippo4 Arlia. Filippo Arlia. Is he  here?5 Is that you, Filippo?6	MR. FILIPPO ARLIA :	Good7	evening .8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How you9	doing?10 MR . FILIPPO ARLIA:	I'm going11 to be brief .12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good.13 MR . FILIPPO ARLIA:	The14 situation is	the landlord cannot afford  the15 rents as low as they are. If you don' t give us a16 raise, we got to go bankrupt .17 And the City, when it  takes18 over, it 's worse than us.19 So if you have any say to it ,20 try to help us and help them to, somehow to  give21 them some kind of incentive to make the   situation22 better .23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .24 Jennifer Vallone .25 (Audience participation .)10

FAY GREENBAUM:	Members of2 
2the Board:3My parents were born and  raised4here in theCity.5(Audience participation.)6MS. FAY GREENBAUM:	My brother7 and I were raised in New York City. I grew up   in8 public housing and went to public schools. I  went9 to Hunter High School , Sarah Lawrence College  and10 Columbia University.11	I have worked very hard. I've12 put my life' s blood into the City, into building13 my community and into building the  City.14 And I have a couple of  questions15 because I've been living in my apartment at   the16 end of this month for twenty- six years. I'm  a17 rent stabilized tenant on the Upper West  Side.18 I've had four MCI increases in the last  year.19 Count ,  count them.20 And if I am about to get a  5.521 percent or an 8.5 percent rent increase, I  will22 be forced to leave my City. That' s being  uprooted23 in the deepest possible way that you can  talk24 about.25 My rent over the time that  I've12 
2 been in this apartment has increased almost   three3 times already without an 8.5 percent  increase.4	Also over this period of  time5 since the State laws were changed and  decontrol6 has come in, fourteen apartments in my  building7 have been decontrolled . The new tenants pay    -8 these are large apartments - the new tenants  are9 paying unconscionable amounts of money, $9000   a10 month rent , $8000 a month rent. A two-bedroom11 apartment goes for $3500 a  month.12 If there' s going to be an 8.513 percent rent increase, that 's going to be $42 , 00014 a year rent. Okay?15 We' re going to have families,16 only families making  six figures are going to  be17 allowed to live in my building  basically.18 Most of the families in  my19 building are not making six figures. I have  a20 very good education and I've worked very hard   but21 I have never in my life made $50,000 or  even22 close to it.23 And , you know,  I have looked24 I grew up in Brooklyn, in the Bronx. I  have25 looked in Brooklyn. I have looked in Queens.   I've5

Monique Dana, is  she12 here?13 MS. MONIQUE DANA:	Yes .14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay .15 MS. MONIQUE DANA:	H ,  I16 My name is Monique Dana. I'm  a17 small property owner representing myself and  my18 family members who have owned on the Upper  West19 Side for about forty  years.20 Like many others here, I have  a21 lot of personal stories I could tell you  about.22 In addition to my job where I work at least   sixty23 hours a week, I'm also the handyman, I clean   the24 toilets, I take out the garbage, I've been  to25 Housing  Court .10 
2	(Audience participation.)3	MS. MONIQUE DANA:	I've done all4 of those.5 In the past years I've given a6 lot of personal stories and it seems that  nobody7 cares. So tonight I am going to talk to  you8 specifically about the facts. Many of the  facts9 are in the Rent Guidelines study and also in  a10 study on housing  deregulation " that was  done by11 the MIT Center for Real  Estate.12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. MONIQUE DANA:	First , last14 year you projected our costs would go up 6.415 percent , but yet you passed increases of 216 percent and 4 percent for one and two  years.17 This year you're telling us our18 costs went up by 16.9 percent and your  study19 indicates next year' s costs will go by 15 percent20 and over two years by 20 percent , but yet you are21 only recommending a 5.5 and 8 .5 percent increase22 for one and two- year leases.23 The last time I went to  the24 store and bought tuna, instead of being 3  cans25 for $1.00, they went for 2 for $1.00 . That 's a 504 
2 percent  increase. They didn't say, oh, Monique,3 we are really sorry you lost your job. You' ll4 just pay five percent because we know you  are5 having a tough time.6 (Audience participation. )7	MS. MONIQUE DANA:	As far as no8	supplemental  adjustment , I have a tenant  - -9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.10 MS. MONIQUE DANA:	- - I have a11 tenant off Central Park West that pays just  under12 $250 for a one- bedroom apartment off Central Park13 West . My real estate taxes are just short of14 $40,000. Her annual rent of $3000 does not  pay15 her portion of the real estate  taxes.16 I also want to say that  rent17 regulation is actually hampering wealth  creation.18 If you look at people that are living in  their19 apartments, they feel tied to them  because20 they've got a cheap rent. Housing in New York,   as21 per the Corcoran study, over the last three   years22 prices for studios, one- bedrooms and two- bedrooms23 have averaged approximately a 46 percent   increase24 over three years.25 All of these people in  regulated10 
2 apartments are not buying apartments  because3 they've got a great deal.4 (Audience participation.)5	MS. MONIQUE DANA:	And in New6 York we have a much higher percentage of  rental7 housing than in any other City I believe in  the8	us .9	In the study by Henry10 Pollakowski from the MIT Institut e of Housing11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to - 1213 MS. MONIQUE DANA:	I will.14 - - he indicates that  with15 deregulation you would not see an increase in16 cost. I would like all of you to read  this.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Diana20 Juliano.21 MS. DIANA JULIANO:	This is22 I'm from Brooklyn, and this is actually my  first23 t ime here.24 I've lived in a rent  stabilized25 apartment for about twenty- five years. My13 
2 apartment was painted once and that was  only3 after  I made  a complaint , paid  the fine and then4 later painted the apartment.5 For two years eight apartments  -6 - there were four apartments that were vacant  for7 two years.8 I mean at a time when there  was9 a crunch, I just didn' t understand why. And then10 he just painted it and then, you know, sanded  the11 floors and the rent went up.12 I have not - - I'm a  health13 professional with a good education. I have  not14 had a raise in five years, no cost of living.   I15 have no contract. I'm in no union. If I don' t16 like it , I can leave.17 And there are not a lot of  jobs18 floating out there for health  professionals.19 Years ago, in the	'70s, it was like a guaranteed20 job. Well , it isn't that way now.21 For the first t ime in my life22 I've been confronted with the possibility that  I23 might actually have to leave. I mean I'm  from24 Brooklyn. Brooklyn is inside me. And it 's almost25 inconceivable to me. But it 's really a reality.2 
2 This has been an extreme  eye-3 opener for me and in some ways I consider  myself4 lucky with the landlord that I  have.5 But two years ago when they  said6 they were going to stop rent stabilization,  I7 thought , oh my, God, where am I going to go. If  I8 leave, I could never come back to  the9 neighborhood.	I was born in Park Slope  fifty-10 five years ago.11 (Audience participation. )12 MS. DIANA JULIANO:	I've there13 all my life. If I leave, I cannot afford to  come14 back.15 And recently I read  something16 about , well , if we would  leave, then all of  this17 like young blood could come in. I'm hearing  long-18 term residents  like  - - you know, it 's like a19 liability. Get rid of the long- term people like20 you're a liability.21 I have worked in my22 neighborhood.  I've serviced the underserved my23 whole life in my community. And I think  that24 there  is a major problem both  for landlords  - - I25 can hear some of them. But I think that this  is2 
2 just the t ip of the iceberg. There is really a3 major problem that really has to be  corrected4 over time.5	But I think a raise now  is6 unconscionable.7 (Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Next is11 Stephen Dana or Stephanie Dana?12 (No response. )13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No?14 (No response.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Alistair16 Economachis. Yes? Is he here or she  here?17 MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMACHIS:18 Coming.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Coming, okay.20 A PARTICIPANT:	You know, I was21 one of the people that called yesterday and  was22 told - -23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let 's get him25 now. We will try to accommodate. The longer  we10 
1	5432 talk about  - - we will  try to accommodate3 everybody.4 Let 's go .5	MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMACHIS:	Thank6 you for your time and your patience.7 When you make your decisions,8 I'd like for you to think about more the  big9 picture.10 A PARTICIPANT:	We can't hear.11	MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMACHIS:	It 's12 Alistair Economachis.13 And when I talk about  big14 picture, I talk about the United States as  a15 capitalist country. It should be driven by  the16 free market.17 And most cities in the US,  let18 alone cities in the world , don't have apartments19 that are regulated by rent stabilization.  They20 are driven by the free  market.21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMACHIS:	The23 animosity that you see in this room between  the24 landlords and the tenants isn't because  the25 tenants are bad people in any way and it 's not12 
1	5442 that the landlords are evil in any way.  The3 animosity is driven by rent stabilization  and4 that festers an animosity that does not  make5 living in New York very pleasant either  for6 landlords or for tenants.7	One example that I have as  to8 why these laws are a little absurd to me  are,9 number one is I don't think it's fair that  some10 people are able to live in a $400  apartment11 whereas others have to pay a very high  rent.12 The other unfairness is that  the13 laws are very skewed towards tenants. We just  had14 a situation - -15 (Audience participation.)16 MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMACHIS:17 and this is a repetitive  situation  - -18 (Audience participat ion.)19 MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMACHIS:20 that we see all the time where we had a tenant  in21 an apartment , he was paying $400 or so a month,22 he was making an income of over $200, 000 , he23 lived in New Jersey and he was renting out  the24 apartment at a profit for  years.25 It took us a while to get  him8 
1	5452 into court and to prove our case and to get  him3 out of the apartment.4 So we have a tenant who had  a5 very high income and was profiteering on the  back6 of the landlord. This is purely one example  and7 there are many more that I'm sure you've  heard8 throughout the evening.9 (Audience participation.)10 MR. ALISTAIR ECONOMACHIS:11 Anyway, and again, please think about the  big12 picture when you make your decisions.13 Thank you very much.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.17 We have - - can I - - we have no18 green cards left. All we have is tenants to  hear19 from.20 (Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have22 approximately  - -  ten minutes.  But we  are going to23 try to stay a little  longer.24 Quiet.25 I want everybody to stick to  one2 
2 minute. That 's it. Come up and say that you	I3 assume that very few are going to support a  rent4 increase. Come up and say very succinctly  what5 you want.6 We are going to start here.  We7 are going to hear  - -8 (Audience participation.)9	CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	- - the10 names - -11 (Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Leonard13 Sydney. Are you here?14 MR. LEONARD SYDNEY:	Yes.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let' s go.16 After Mr. Sydney, Joe  Meyers.17 MR. LEONARD SYDNEY:	" It 's like18 fishing, " said Leonore Schloming, the President19 of Boston' s small properties ownership20 association.21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. LEONARD SYDNEY:	" If you23 catch a fish, and you get him out of the  water,24 and he' s flopping in the sand , you have to make25 sure he doesn' t get back in the water. Rent10

My7 involvement in the tenant - landlord wars began8 twenty- five years ago when my  landlord , Mount9 Sinai Hospital , tried to evict forty- five10 families who lived at 1245 Park Avenue at  96th11 Street.12 I determined to fight the13 Hospital 's efforts to throw us out and the other14 hundred people from their homes and  thereafter15 became the co- founder and the co- director of the16 Mount  Sinai Tenants Association.17 The Hospital and its18 representatives used the phony, specious  argument19 that they needed our apartments for their  own20 staff members' housing.21 As everyone knows, Mount  Sinai22 Hospital  owns more rental housing  in my  - -23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Sydney,24 you have to wrap up.25 MR. LEONARD SYDNEY:	I've just6 
2 begun . I've waited for seven hours. I've  waited3 here seven hours.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Sydney,56 MR. LEONARD SYDNEY:	I'm going7 to take my two- and - a-half minutes.8 (Audience participation.)9 MR. LEONARD SYDNEY:	As10 everyone knows, Mount Sinai Hospital owns  more11 rental housing in my general area of the  City12 than any other City landlord.13 My tenants' association  fought14 this eviction effort and did battle with  Mount15 Sinai in the courts, on the streets, in the  media16 and in the New York State  Legislature.17 Guess what , wonder  of wonders,18 after more than three years of bitter warfare,  we19 tenants defeated the hospital and Mount  Sinai20 withdrew  its eviction plan.21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. LEONARD SYDNEY:	However,23 over the subsequent twenty years, from '83  to24 '03, the forty- five families and apartments25 previously  covered by rent stabilization have  now6 
2	dwindled down to less than a dozen such  units.3	Ergo, thirty- five rental4 apartments,  formerly covered by rent regulation,5 have been lost.6 Why do I take up your  valuable7 time with this story? It 's very simple. During8 the passage of twenty years, seventy- five percent9 of once covered rent stabilized apartments  have10 disappeared  from my building, and hence from  the11 rental market.12 If the current legal  structure13 of rent stabilization, as recently  amended,14 continues in its present form, during the  next15 twenty years there will no longer be a  meaningful16 substantial number of rent stabilized  rental17 units that regular average folks can  either18 obtain or continue to live  in.19 It 's really that simple.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Your two-21 and - a - half minut es are up.22 Let 's go.2 3	MR. LEONARD SYDNEY:	Okay.24 So that 's the problem.	I got25 another minute.24 
1	5502 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Why do you3 have another minute?4 MR. LEONARD SYDNEY:	What we5 must do to prevent this most  terrible6	possibility, indeed probability,	from happening?7	Base rent , when MCI increases8 are necessary and properly completed , they must9 be paid for in the future as a rent  surcharge,10 which is a temporary add- on to the legal ,11	registered rent.12 The surcharge disappears  when13 the landlord has recouped  his14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Sydney,15 you have to wrap up. You haven' t told us one16 thing of use about whether or not we should  do17 anything on the rent guidelines and what  number.18 MR. LEONARD SYDNEY:	I am19 saying to you that the 5.5 and 8.5  percent20 increases are immoral , are improper and should21 not be based upon either MCI or fuel  input.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 Thank you.24 (Audience participat ion.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Joe Meyers.12 
2 Joe Meyers.  Is Mr. Meyers here? Joe Meyers. You3 here?4 MR. JOE MEYERS:	Yes.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Coming down?6	There you go. Okay.7 Mr. Meyers, face us.8 MR. JOE MEYERS:	I'd like to - -9	I'd like to face the real peopl e.10	(Audience participation.)11	MR. JOE MEYERS:	You up there,12 you can observe , you can hear anyway. I'll  speak13 into the microphone.14 I want to say that the tenants15 in New York are in a tremendous predicament   now,16 but to some degree we have ourselves to blame   and17 here' s why.18 The only language that  these19 people up here would understand is if we  get20 together and organize and threaten to  withhold21 the rent on a citywide basis unless we  get22 (Audience participation.)2 3	MR. JOE MEYERS:	- - unless24 (Audience part icipation.)25 MR. JOE MEYERS:	- - unless we24 
2 get - - that ' s right - - unless we get the type of3 sentiment that we need.4 You know, when the landlords  go5 upstate  and  bribe these politicians	- -6 (Audience participation.)7 MR. JOE MEYERS:	- - to weaken8 rent stabilization,9 (Audience participation. )10 MR. JOE MEYERS:	that 's all11 done with our money. It is our  money.12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. JOE MEYERS:	They get their14 money from us. They say, look, we are  already15 rich enough to own buildings, therefore, you have16 to keep paying us to live in those  buildings.17 (Audience participation.)18 MR. JOE MEYERS:	And we will19 squeeze you and squeeze you and squeeze you.  And20 you can come to these meetings and say  anything21 you want. We don't care what you say. It's  all22 bull.23 But what would not be bull is  if24 we threatened to hold part or all of that  rent25 until we get the kind of sentiment that we  need ,2 
2 unless we drive the landlords into a  position3 where they are our equal .4 And that 's not been done. That 's5 really what has to be faced.6 So I want to say that for  the7 small landlords, yes, they are being squeezed ,8 but they're taking it out on the  tenants.9 In other words, they are being10 squeezed by the insurance companies. Why  don't11 they stand up to them?12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. JOE MEYERS:	Why instead do14 they want the tenants,15 (Audience participation. )16 MR. JOE MEYERS:	- - the17 innocent tenants, to be squeezed by  these18 insurance companies, by the taxes and  everything19 else that are passed on up?20 And these landlords are full  of21 it because if they weren' t really making money by22 exploit ing the tenants, they wouldn't be in that23 building,  in that business.24 (Audience participation.)25 MR. JOE MEYERS:	There are2 
2 plenty of businesses	- -3 (Audience part icipation.)4	MR . JOE MEYERS:	There are5 pl enty of businesses . There is money to be made.6 They can put their money in the bank and  they7 would get  interest .8 What are they talking about?9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Meyers,10 your t ime is up.11 MR. JOE MEYERS:	Okay.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank13 you.14 MR . JOE MEYERS:	What we need - 1516 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 MR . JOE MEYERS:	- - is a18 citywide general  rent strike  - -19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 MR. JOE MEYERS:	- - until we21 get the kind of sentiment that we  need.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jane Wood.25 Jane Wood.16

ANITA BROWN:	Anita Brown.10 And I want to speak. There' s not enough people,11 tenants speaking here. I'm a social worker and   I12 want to address this  committee.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Come here.14 Let 's go.15 What was your number?16 MS. ANITA BROWN:	85.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	86. Go ahead .18 Go ahead.19 MS. ANITA BROWN:	I 'm going to20 try to make this as quick as  possible.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well , I22 appreciate your pat ience.23 MS. ANITA BROWN:	I made - and24 I brought my book - $14,000 last year, $14,000.  I25 got my books.10 
2 My rent is $901 for a studio  in3 Manhattan. You know, I moved on up to the  East4 Side. I live in a five- flight story, five- flight5 walkup.6 There are women and men  and7 ladies and gentlemen here from the Bronx,  from8 Brooklyn, from all over the City. I can't  move.9 Four years ago I had $5000  in10 savings. I'm now a pet groomer, self - employed, no11 longer a social worker in this City.  Okay?12 So I have to work for myself .13 (Audience participat ion.)14 MS. ANITA BROWN:	I don't want15 to hear another thing that another small  landlord16 has to say about increases. I have been my  own17 indian chief , my own attorney. And if I could do18 it on $14,000, give me one, one of your  buildings19 and I'll turn it around for  you.20 (Audience participat ion.)21 MS. ANITA BROWN:	I worked ten22 years ago at the Prince George Hotel when  they23 were getting  twelve  - - when they were  getting24 $1200 a mont h for homeless families. There is no25 place to put the working class citizens of   this2 
2 City.3 (Audience participation.)4	MS. ANITA BROWN:	None of us -5 - none of you - - you on that Panel may be at    risk6 of losing your housing.7 (Audience participation.)8	MS. ANITA BROWN:	I'm sorry9 that there are landlords, small landlords,  that10 cannot meet their expenses. But you got  another11 choice. Open your books and apply for a  hardship.12 (Audience participation .)13 MS. ANITA BROWN:	And if you14 don't - -15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You need to16 wrap up.17 MS . ANITA BROWN:	If you don' t18 speak good English, call me on the phone .19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to20 wrap up.21 MS.

FAITH STEINBERG:	I signed10 up on Tuesday on the phone.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What number?12 What number did you get?13 MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	I was 9814 and they told me I would be able to speak in  the15 morning.  I would have to speak - -16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Go17 ahead. Go ahead.18 MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	I just19 want to say that of all the people that  have20 suffered from 9/11, the landlords have  suffered21 the least. You heard all of  this.22 (Audience participat ion.)23 MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	What I24 want to say, my landlord is one of these mom  and25 pop  landlords who  in the  1950s or  1    60s bought10 
2 five or six brownstones on the West Side. He  has3 become a millionaire.4	But the greed is bottomless.  He5 has already in my building of nine tenants,  he6 has already decontrolled  two. That ' s over  twenty7 percent loss of affordable  housing.8 And housing is one of the  basic9 necessities of life.10 (Audience participation.)11 MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	We - - you12 know, the rent increases that the Rent  Guidelines13 Boards have perpetrated on the people in the  past14 years, the 5 and 7 and the 2 and the 4, when  the15 landlords were making 11 percent prof it , it 's16 unconscionable.17 (Audience participation.)18 MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	It has19 created homelessness.  If you don't care about20 homelessness,	I would say have an enlightened21 self interest because homel essness is a sign of22 disease in our society.23 (Audience part icipation.)24 MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	It is not25 healthy to l ive in a diseased environment.5 
2 And I predicted this,  these3 draconian measures would cause homelessness.  If4 we increase it 5.5 and 8.5, you know, you don' t5 have to be a rocket scientist , forgive the6 cliche, to figure out that we will have  more7 homelessness, and besides which  it's8 unconscionable.9 I would like to say that you10 have an enormous responsibility and you are  urged11not toraise these unconscionable  rates.12CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13MS.

2Jones.3MS. LAVERNE JONES:	Chairman4MarkusandMembers of the Rent Guidelines  Board.5My name is Laverne  - -6(Audience participation.)7CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.8MS. LAVERNE JONES:	- - Jones.9	I 'm a small property owner.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to11 talk into the mike.12 MS. LAVERNE JONES:	Good13 evening, Chairman Markus and Members of the  Rent14 Guidelines Board.15 My name is Laverne Jones. I am  a16 small property owner in Central  Harlem.17 I offer this testimony in18 opposition to the reported determination that  the19 Rent Guidelines Board is planning on an  increase20 of only 5. 5 percent for a one-year lease and 821 percent on a two- year lease with some thought of22 reducing the vacancy  decontrol.23 Our recent increases have  been24 staggering: utilities up 21.7 percent , insurance25 over 40 percent , fuel over 66 percent , plus   the10 
2 14.5 real estate taxes with their  increases3 projected to go even higher in the coming  year.4 The water/sewer rates have  also5 increased.6	There is a perception that  we7 small owners are just being greedy. How can  that8 be when rent regulat ions do not use appropriate9 informat ion to determine any increases?10 Rent regulations really  are11 unfair and capricious. Rent regulations may  be12 popular but are grossly  unfair.13 We property owners are not  being14 greedy as has been reported in some of the  media.15 We only ask for fairness.16 The Price Index of Operating17 Costs Study showed that our costs increased  by18 16.9 percent last year and the study did  not19 include all of our costs. Yet this Board is  still20 considering  such nominal increases.21 Tenants quote the Mayor's  budget22 cuts and the lingering effects of the  9/1123 attacks. These budget cuts also affect  property24 owners and in a most dramat ic manner. We must25 maintain our taxes, ut ilit ies, insurance, water,7 
2 heat and hot water, as well as  general3 maintenance  and repairs.4 We have no choice. All of  the5 above services are also  regulated.6	As to the City taking over  all7 rent regulations, I can 't see how this would be8 helpful. My own experience, I received  a9 violation from the Department of Building  which10 even the inspector came back to tell me was  in11	error. Yet it took me four months and nine trips12 to the Department of Buildings and  the13 Environmental Control to get the  correction.14 Senator Bruno  - -15 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	You have to - 1617 MS . LAVERNE JONES:	is18 quoted as saying - -19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to20 wrap up.21 MS. LAVERNE JONES:	- - he wants22 to do what 's right for the tenants.23 Well , I ask that you do what is24 right for the small owners.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17

HILDA CHAVIS :	Now,18(Audience participation .)19CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.20MS . HILDA CHAVIS :	Okay.21Listen,22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let 's go .23Let 'sgo.24MS . HILDA CHAVIS:	Hello!25(Audience participation.)
2 MS. HILDA CHAVIS:	I am a3 tenant in the northwest  Bronx.4 (Audience participation.)5 MS. HILDA CHAVIS:	In my6 neighborhood, which is comprised mostly of   low7 and moderate income people, there is a  very8 strong concern being voiced about tenants  losing9 their apartments.10 They also feel that a  rent11 increase of 5.5 percent and 8.5 percent at  this12 t ime would be like a slap in the face for the13 conditions that they are living  in.14 You would be rewarding  landlords15 for slow, inadequate, poor and in many cases  no16 repairs.17 Unlike - -18 (Audience participat ion.)19 MS. HILDA CHAVIS:	- - the Price20 Index of Operating Costs, tenants, their  quality21 of life and expenses are measured in  real22 dollars, in real income or lack  thereof.23 Now, I want to just point out  to24 you that all evening we have heard the plight   of25 the small landlord. Not one of the big guys,  the2 
2 twelve  percent ,3 (Audience participat ion.)4	MS. HILDA CHAVIS:	- - that own5 77 percent of the rent stabilized units are  here6 complaining about they can't make their  expenses.7 (Audience participat ion .)8	MS. HILDA CHAVIS:	They have9 these small landlords come here and plead  their10 case.11 But understand that it's  twelve12 percent of owners that 's going to benefit from13every singleincrease - -14CHAIRMAN MARKUS:You need to15wrap up now.1617MS . HILDA CHAVIS:	- - that isgiven to landlords. While tenants are  becoming18poorer, thattwelve percent  is getting richer.19CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20Thank you.21(Audience participation. )22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jane Wood.23(No response. )24CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jane Wood.25(No response.)

Is Jane Wood  here?4 (No response.)5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Susan6 Steinberg.7 (No response.)8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Susan9	Steinberg.10	(No response. )11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Geraldine12 Scalia .13 Geraldine Scalia, you here?14 MS. GERALDINE SCALIA :	Yes.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Let 's16 go .17 MS . GERALDINE SCALIA:	I'm18 scared. Do you hear me? I'm really  scared.19 I don't think I've been  so20 scared since the last time that I was in  court21 with my landlord.22 There aren' t that many tenants23 here as you look around because they 're  scared.24 They 're scared that their landlords are going  to25 harass them for complaining about repairs  and12 
2 lack of services. And that 's why they' re not3 here. So don' t think there is a poor showing of4 tenants.5 (Audience participation.)6 MS. GERALDINE SCALIA:	A lot of7 commotion going on here, a lot of  emotion.8 (Audience participation.)9 MS. GERALDINE SCALIA:	We are10 talking about an increase in rent that is  so11 disproportionat e we can't believe it.12 But it 's really just a vicious13 cycle. It 's all interrelated. The rents go up,14 the prices in our groceries go up to reflect  the15 high rents in the neighborhood because the   store16 owners think the people that live in  those17 apartments are high  income.18 Our subways go up. We are  all19 complaining about the $2 rate of our subways.  We20 probably wouldn' t mind that much if we got the21 service. But , instead , a couple of weeks  ago  it22 took me two hours to get home from 34th  Street .23 Maybe if our apartments  would24 reflect the increase in rent , would reflect  in25 quality, in maintenance,	in the basic2 
2 necessities, maybe we wouldn' t be as angry . Maybe3 we should think a little bit  more4 (Audience participation.)5	MS . GERALDINE SCALIA:	about6 such a high percentage of  increase.7 The rents have gone up. Have  our8 salaries gone up?9 (Audience participation.)10 MS. GERALDINE SCALIA:	Please,11 insist on stronger rent laws now .12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you .13 (Audience participat ion .)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Chris Cullen.15 Chris Cullen.16 Are you Chris Cullen?17 A PARTICIPANT :	I was 63 .18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Peter Dukas.19 Peter?20 MR . PETER DUKAS:	Here.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Are you here?22 MR . PETER DUKAS:	Here.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you.24 A PARTICIPANT:	She's number 63 ,25 how did you miss her?6 
2 MR. PETER DUKAS:	Thank you. My3 name is Peter Dukas. I'm a Certified  Public4 Accountant  and a resident of Stuyvesant Town.5 I have come here today after a6 long day' s work not to add very much to what  you7 already heard today from the public off icials  and8 the tenants. I simply want to tell you, each  and9 everyone of you, that when you will vote for   this10 outrageous increase of 5.4 percent and  8.511 percent that you should be ashamed of  yourself.12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. PETER DUKAS:	Don't think14 you can hide behind your numbers and your studies15 and say you are being equitable. We all know  what16 the deal is. The deal is not about  recouping17 costs. It 's about vacancy decontrol.18 The deal is not about  escalating19 costs. It 's about vacancy decontrol.20 It 's about putting the squeeze21 on unemployed  individuals which are 7.9 percent22 now in New York City.23 It 's about putting the squeeze24 on seniors who have to choose between  paying25 their rent and buying food and medical  care.2 
2	(Audience participation.)3	MR. PETER DUKAS:	It 's about4 putting the squeeze on the working class  people,5 squeezing them out of their apartments so we  can6 have vacancies, while at the same time  pushing7 those rents up to that $2000 mark that will  get8 them out from under  regulations.9 (Audience participation.)10 MR . PETER DUKAS :	We can call11 it a conspiracy but it 's no secret any longer.12 It 's about a coordinated effort between the real13 estate industry and their cronies, George  Pataki,14 Joe Bruno, DHCR and some of the Members of  the15 Guidelines Board16 (Audience participation.)17 MR . PETER DUKAS:	- - that are18 driving those rents up to that $2000  mark.19 Those of you who vote for  these20 outrageous increases and play into the hands  of21 the landlords should be ashamed of making  a22 mockery of your public  trust.23 (Audience participation.)24 MR . PETER DUKAS:	I strongly25 urge you not to be a tool of the  landlords.4 
1	5722 I strongly urge to preserve3 affordable housing.4 I strongly urge you to vote5 against these increases.6 And I strongly suggest that  we7 see a rent rollback.8 Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Barbara11 Simmons.12 Is that - - what 's your name?13 A PARTICIPANT:	I'm 63 .14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	63 .15 A PARTICIPANT:	Yes.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you17 Barbara Simmons?18 MS. BARBARA SIMMONS:	Yes, sir.19 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Go ahead , Ms.20 Simmons. Go ahead.21 MS. BARBARA SIMMONS:	Good22 afternoon. I'd like to thank God for his  grace23 and his mercy.24 My name is Barbara Simmons and  I25 sits on a new legislative board. I work  with2 
1	5732 Marty Markowitz.	I was here earlier today.3 I'm also a chairperson for 565 -4 70 Lefferts Avenue. I'm a cancer  survivor .5 When I was in intensive  care6 with forty- eight hours to live, my landlord gave7 me a dispossess. I had four evictions. I went   to8 the Appellate Court where I went where he  went9 behind my back with his landlord to try to get   it10 uplifted.11	The judge denied it. I got a12 letter from my Assemblyman stating that I didn' t13 owe him no money.14 He still harassed me.15 A PARTICIPANT:	Go on, sister.16 MS. BARBARA SIMMONS:	Why I'm17 here today is because what happened to me, I  was18 able to deal with it. But I don' t want it to19 happen to nobody else.20 I have a son who I'm trying  to21 put through college. I have to pay for  my22 medicat ion. I've been disabled since 1989. And23 then I was faced with  cancer.24 I've been through the Valley  of25 the Shadow of Death and my landlord tried to   sink12 
2 my ship. If God wanted my ship to sink, he  would3 never have brought me through the Valley  of4 Death.5 (Audience participation.)6	MS. BARBARA SIMMONS:	I stand7 here before you tonight , I didn' t come to argue8 with you. I come to reason with you.9 Whatever happened to me,  please10 don' t let it happen to no one else.11 HPD came to fix my apartment ,12 not just my apartment but the apartment on top   of13 me. And I was overruled by the judge in  Housing14 Court.15 May 26th I was in  Kingsbridge16 Jewish Hospital with chest pains. And I sent  my17 caretaker, who is here tonight with me, down   to18 the court because I couldn' t make it. They told19 them at the court , they over - - they didn' t  give20 me a Order to Show Cause because I was in   the21 hospital. That' s when I had to go to the22 Appellat e Court.23 I mean this is my first  time24 here tonight. I was invited by Eric. He' s the25 Director of Marty Markowitz' s office.7 
2	(Audience participation.)3	MS. BARBARA SIMMONS:	The first4 time I went to Housing Court , they had me sitting5 in there from ten o'clock to 10:3 0. This is my6 condition, sir. How would you like this happen  to7 them and to your mother? Look, I have  hardships.8 I - - every time I went  to the bathroom,  they9 called my case.10 Pardon me, sir. But I ask God  to11 give me strength. I'm a graduate of Joint  Disease12 Hospital . I spent $24,000 to educate myself on13 chronic pain to be able to stand here today,  sir.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well , we15 appreciate your testimony. We really  do.16 MS. BARBARA SIMMONS:	I would17 just like you to come to my building and see  the18 conditions that people are living  in.19 One of my tenants asked me  to20 tell you, when I came out of intensive care  with21 forty- eight hours of living	(unintelligible), he22 told me to ask you why does a tenant have to  go23 through so much pain and suffering to get what  is24 rightfully theirs .25 You understand what I'm saying? .4 
2 You understand what I'm  saying,3 sir? Could you answer the question? Why I have   to4 go through so much pain and suffering? Why do   I5 have to go through so much pain and  suffering?6	And then you want to  increase7 our rents? Look at me. Look at me . I could be8 your mother. I could be your sister. I could  be9 your brother.10 (Audience participation.)11	MS. BARBARA SIMMONS:	I could12 be your friend.13 Look at me. I'm hurting. Look  at14 me. You' re going to let them kill me? I'll  die15 for it.16 (Aud ence participation.)17 MS. BARBARA SIMMONS:	You only18 have to make a choice, but I'm dying. I'm   dying.19 Thank you and God bless you,20 sir.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 (Audience participation.)2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Rosary24 Marinaro?25 (No response.)24 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is she here?3	(No response.)4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	There' s no -5 - 63 was a man who spoke.6 Alison Colby.7 (No response.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is she here?9 (No response.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Elaine11 Bestman?12 (No response.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	James14 Pacheco?15 Yes?16 Right. He was here before.17 MR. JAMES PACHECO:	Yes. Yes.18 My name is Pacheco. You  still19 mispronounce me.20 Listen, I've lived in New  York21 City for fifty years and in my apartment   for22 thirty. It 's gone up three hundred percent. But23 you don' t really care.24 Continuously you voted against25 the human beings that live in New York City  and10 
  2 for the people whose houses they live in .3 Continuously.4 And for a long time I've  seen5 little girls and little boys out in the street.  I6 give them information about all of  the7 possibilities. And they tell me, well , sir, I'm8 homeless, you know.9 I told one little girl there' s10 places you can go. And she says: you see this11 knife wound I have. This is one of those places   I12 can go.13 (Audience participation.)14 MR. JAMES PACHECO:	This is15 what you have done  continuously.16 And whether you've never been in17 those seats before, you are still part of  this.18 You are still doing something at the cost  of19 human lives. And you sit with your children  and20 say how wonderful I am that I make these  changes21 while children outside in the streets are  dying.22 And they tell you: oh, no,  no,23 no, there are places for these children and  they24 show you, just like the Nazis show Jewish workers 252 
2 (Audience participation.)3 MR. JAMES PACHECO:	- - all these4 people are doing fine. And your friends tell you5 you are doing a good job and people are  dying.6 I've seen people dying and you7 are proud of your job. You are  disgusting.8 (Audience participation.)9 MR. JAMES PACHECO:	I am not a10 peaceful man. I work for the  peace movements.	I11 try to say, hey, put your weapons down, you   know,12 because I know that I came with peace, a lot   of13 people wouldn' t listen.14 If I said, listen, the  right15 thing to do is look into your hearts, I know  that16 you'll look into your pockets first.17 (Audience part icipation.)18 MR. JAMES PACHECO:	You know,19 people go to jail and are killed because   they20 kill people. You go to your house and get a   raise21 when you kill people.22 (Audience participation.)23 MR. JAMES PACHECO:	Do you24 understand  this? Do you really  - -  do you know any25 ten-year olds? That 's what I see in the street.2 
2 A mother has to eat. She had  a3 four-year old child with her. This is you.  You4 are guilty of this .5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 MR . JAMES PACHECO :	You want7	any questions? Ask me  questions.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,9 Mr.10 MR. JAMES PACHECO:	I know you11 don' t.12 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	- - Pacheco .13 Thank you.14 (Audience participation. )15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Susan Howard.16 Is she here?17 MS. SUSAN HOWARD :	Yes.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you.19 Susan Howard.20 MS. SUSAN HOWARD:	I'm taking21 names of people who signed up to speak  and22 couldn' t because I want you to know that there23 are an awful lot of tenants that are  suffering24 under the economy of New York City and  the25 constant rent raises that you give us every  year.10 
2 Not only do you give us  rent3 raises every year, but we have to suffer from  MCI4 increases, permanent  increases. I have three5 myself this year from my landlord. We  suffer6 harassment.7 I filed a statement of8 harassment  against my landlord because I'm  the9 head of my tenants association. And they  did10 nothing. They said I didn' t have a case. I didn' t11 have a case even though he harassed me  and12 continues to harass me.13 He won' t recognize the tenants14 association and we are losing tenants in  my15 building  every year.16 There are two tenants we lost ,17 rent controlled tenants this year for  frivolous18 lawsuits brought by my landlord. He has  high-19 priced lawyers. He can continue to bring lawsuits20 against low- income tenants and tell them you  have21 to move or I'm going to buy you out. I might   be22 able to find you a cheaper place in  another23 borough and they leave. They slowly  leave.24 And when they leave, the  rents25 triple. And no one coming in knows the rent   law.2 
2 They only have three months to learn it in   order3 to put in an overcharge.4 And we are losing. Of the  495 units in my three buildings, we have  probably6 lost a dozen in the last two years. Those  rents7 are now $2500 a month, $3000 a month. And  I'm8 talking about tenements. I'm not talking  about9 Upper West Side, pre- war apartments.  I'm talking10 about tenements with tissue- paper walls.11 This is what they are  getting12 from us. They don' t need additional support by13 you to gouge us. They're doing fine all on  their14 own.15 (Audience participation.)16 MS. SUSAN HOWARD:	You don' t17 consider the real increases in  what the	'97 laws18 have done to us as tenants. You put all of   that19 together and you realize that giving them an20 added incent ive this year in this economy with  no21 raises - - in fact , my job, we cut forty   percent22 of the staff , and of the forty percent cut , we23 are now on a three- day workweek half - a- day and on24 a work share program for the rest with the   Labor25 Department with unemployment  because  there's no2 
2	money to pay the workers.3	And an increase on top of that ,4 how are we going to afford to increase  the5 landlords' prof its when we have none of our own?6 Where are we going to get this  money?7 (Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 Some of these names I think  they10 signed up twice, but let me read them  anyway.11 John McDermott?12 MR. JOHN McDERMOTT:	Yes.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You here?14 MR. JOHN McDERMOTT:	I'm here.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.16 I thought  it was - - okay. I17 thought you spoke. But that 's not you.18 Go ahead , Mr. McDermott.19 MR . JOHN McDERMOTT:	All right.20 I'm a nineteen-year rent21 stabilized tenant on the Lower East Side.  These22 rent hike proposals, higher than any rent  hikes23 since the 1980s, presented at the worst  economic24 situation/environment	since the 1930s, not only25 constitute a violation of the human right  to10 
2 housing, they don' t even make good business3 sense.4 In the past two years signs5 advertising apartments for rent have  been6 appearing on more and more buildings all  over7 town. Why? Because they've been vacated  by8 tenants who can no longer afford the rent.  Rents9 are already too high.10 Which brings the  unavoidable11 question: do landlords operat e on the free market12 principles or do they actually through this13 system of guaranteed profits want  corporate14 welfare for their own privileged few selves15 (Audience participat ion.)16 MR. JOHN McDERMOTT:	and17 want survival of the fittest for all the rest   of18 us?19 If landlords actually do  abide20 by free market principl es, the only act ion that21 they can take in this time of severe  widespread22 economic hardship is to roll back the rents   now.23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 Judy Richheimer.2 
2 MS. JUDY RICHHEIMER:	My name is3 Judy Richheimer.	I'm a thirty-year tenant.4	Mr. Lubell , at the  preliminary5 meet ing you stated that owners of pre- war6 buildings are custodians in a sense of the   legacy7 for all New Yorkers. And you cited this fact  as8 one of your justifications  for wanting rent9 increases.10 This reasoning is at best11 misguided , at worst  specious because , of  course,12 MCis can be passed along to tenants and  capital13 increases  - -  capital expenses are therefore  taken14 care of.15 However, I'm very pleased  that16 you raised the issue of custodianship. As  members17 of the Board, you are gatekeepers of no less  than18 the City' s future, of a legacy every bit as19 important as housing stock, by which I  mean20 diversity, which includes economic  and21 professional diversity.22 We will lose this. We will  lose23 the very idea of what New York is - we  celebrate24 the New York we love and the New York we sell   as25 an idea to the rest of the world - without  this5 
2	diversity.3	With the raise you are calling4 for you have effectively killed rent protect ion.5 Without  rent protection no diversity. Without6 diversity no New York.7 (Audience participat ion.)8	MS. JUDY RICHHEIMER:	Be honest9 with yourselves. Be honest with yourselves.  If10 you are in your heart of hearts at least even   a11 little bit dubious about this whole notion  of12 rent protection which you are charged to  uphold,13 please consider no less a free marketeer  than14 Adam Smith who said that when we are  in15 conditions of scarcity and we are  talking16 commodities that are necessary to keep  people17 alive, there must be  regulation.18 (Audience participation.)19 MS. JUDY RICHHEIMER:	As a two-20 year tenant on a two- year lease, I had on my  last21 raise six percent , and that 's not counting MCis,22 six percent.23 With an 8.5 raise, that  will24 mean that in just a little over four years I   will25 be paying close to fifteen percent in a  period9 
2	when my income has gone down sharply .3	Unlike landlords, I cannot  write4	off this raise in expenses.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You need to6 wrap up .7 Thank you .8 (Audience participation .)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .10 How many people in the room11 still want to speak?12 Let 's line up. Let' s go . Let 's13 get it done here .14 And we are going to reprogram  it15 down to a minute- and- a-half , a minute - and- a- half.16 (There was a brief recess in the17 proceedings. )18CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right.19Let 's go.20State your name please.21MS. ELIZA KELLMAN :	Eliza22Kellman.2 3CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Eliza24Kellman.25MS. ELIZA KELLMAN:	Yes.
1	5882 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Go3 ahead.4	MS. ELIZA KELLMAN:	I'm not here 5 to point fingers at anyone, but I'm just here   to6 state my case.7 I am a small owner and my  rent8 is - -  the apartments,  three rooms, four rooms  and9 five rooms, they're as low as $350 a month up  to10 $500 a month for a five- room apartment.11 The cost of living has gone  up12 tremendously since I took over that property.   The13 fuel costs have quadrupled and the taxes,  the14 water rate - - my wat er bill just came and is over 15	$10,000.16 I've done so much repairs,  I17 just put in a new boiler which cost $45,000.  We18 need a new roof right now. And there is no   money19 to do it.20 Even with this small rent I  have21 to go to court with the tenants and most of   the22 money, part of the monies spent on legal   fees.23 Now, in all due respect , where24 is the money to come from? I'm not talking  bad25 about the tenants, but we small landlords,  we16 
2 need the income in order to carry the  property .3 Right now I only have fire4 insurance.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to6	wrap up.7	MS. ELIZA KELLMAN:	I cannot  8 carry liability because I have no  money.9 And so I think that the  small10 owners at least - I don' t know about the rich11 people - but the small owners at least should   get12 a decent increase.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 MS. ELIZA KELLMAN:	And a15 maximum  rent  for the apartments  from $300 - - it16 must have a base figure.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank18 you.19 MS. ELIZA KELLMAN:	So I hope20 that you will consider that. And I'm not   talking21 about , knocking down the tenants because I'm22 talking just about the small owners. We need some  2324 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 MS. ELIZA KELLMAN:	- - increase24 
1	5902	in order to pay the bills .3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank4	you .5	Yes, sir .6	State your name.7	MR . RICHARD STEIGER :	Good8	evening .9	My name is Richard Steiger.10 In about three months I'm  going11 to lose my job . But I'm one among many . New York12 City has lost 236 ,200 jobs since December 2000,13 two- thirds of those since September 11, 200114 according to the New York City Comptroller .15 80,000 jobs on Wall Street have16 been lost in the last two  years.17 A Rent Guidelines Board  study18 found that 105,421 New York City apartments  had19 been reported by owners to have been removed   from20 regulations from 1994 to 2002. That translates   to21 more than ten percent of apartments covered  by22 rent regulat ions.23 The Rent Guidelines Board24 stressed that the number of reported  regulated25 apartments was the floor or lower limit for  such10 
2 numbers since it is based on filings by  landlords3 with the State, and owners have not always  been4 required to report the decontrol of units to  the5 State.6 The proposed 5.5 percent and  8.57 percent figures could very well result  in8 hundreds of families becoming homeless,  according9 to Daniel L. Greenberg, President of the  Legal10 Aid Society.11 Why the landlords deserve12 special treatment when other business owners  are13 left to fend for themselves? Several  business14 owners recently in Coney Island and other  beach15 areas around the City spoke about how  their16 businesses have suffered due to  inclement17 weather. Some said sales have declined  seventy-18 five to ninety- five percent compared to last19 year.20 Are we taking any steps to  help21them?No.22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to23wrapup.24MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	Okay.25New York has always  been
1	5922 something of a pioneer in the field of  fiscal3 mismanagement. Now the Rent Guidelines Board  has4 an opportunity to set a stellar example of  fiscal5 responsibility.6	There are millions of people7 counting on you to do the just and  equitable8 thing. Freeze all rents and help put the City   on9 a more sound economic footing. There are lives   in10 the balance.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	Act13 diligently, act independently and act  with14 compassion.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 (Audience participat ion.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	State your18 name, please.19 Sir, would you give your20 test imony to the stenographer. He would21 appreciate it.
22 Ma' am.23 MS. LAURIE EDMONDS:	Hl•  .I24 is Laurie and I live in a small  building
My name
25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Laurie what?12 
1	5932 MS. LAURIE EDMONDS:	Laurie3 Edmonds.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.5	MS . LAURIE EDMONDS:	in a6 small building  in Manhattan.7 Most of my building consists  of8 co-op owners and five long- time rent stabilized9 tenants, all single women, mostly artists, and  we10 all live in very small apartments,  approximately11 ten feet by twelve feet.12 I've lived there for thirty13 years . And I'm an artist.14 New York has been  disregarding15 the artists and musicians, the creative  people16 that have been making New York City  vibrant.17 (Audience participation.)18 MS . LAURIE EDMONDS:	Most of my19 income comes from drawing children and adults  at20 private and corporate funct ions. My business has21 been going down steadily for the past few  years,22 and especially  since 9/11.23 My workload has dropped24 signif icantly to the point that I'm struggling  to25 pay my bills.6 
2 All along the way when I've  been3 living in my apartment , I thought  I would   do4 bett er and move into a bigger apartment5 eventually. But I'm  stuck.6 I can't afford a bigger place  at7 all. I can barely afford what I have. I've   had8 many, many problems with my apartment over  the9 years. I've been to court multiple times with   my10 landlord.11 Most recently, a very bad  mold12 problem,  aspegillious stacybotris, did not13 realize how toxic it was, and every time I  told14 the landlord about mold in the bathroom,  they15 sent over a handyman to cover it with spackle.   Of16 course,  the spackle  - -  the mold  came through the17 spackle and eventually I became very sick  from18 the mold.19 Again, I told my landlord  that20 this time I knew it was toxic and he  really21 minimized  the situation.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to23 wrap up.24 MS. LAURIE EDMONDS:	P .S. , the25 bathroom was remedied and once the mold  was2 
1	5952	tested by an independent tester at my expense  and3	the Health Department evaluated  it.4 There have been other  things,5 rats. Basically I had to live elsewhere for  nine6 mont hs .7 I've had MCI increases  for8 appliances which died after two years of  usage.9 Essentially, please make my10 apartment and my friends' apartments  habitable,11 safe and affordable. Do not increase 5.5 and  8.512 percent and disallow vacancy  decontrol.13 Thank you.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 (Audience participat ion.)16 MS. MARINA METALIOS:	Hi I17 everyone! Thank you for your time. My name  is18 Marina Metalios. I'm a rent - regulated tenant. I19 live in Stuyvesant Town where I've been  for20 almost a decade and a half.21 And I am very much one of  the22 lucky ones because I've already paid off  my23 undergrad and grad school loans. I don' t have  any24 kids to shelter or to take care of. I have  a25 full- t ime job and it 's got health benef its. I'm8 
2 very much one of the lucky  ones.3 But sometimes I look at my4 neighbors and I wonder how they get by.  My5 neighbors are really lovely, very plain  vanilla6 working people. And I wonder how the  squeezes7 that are put on them are some things that  they8 can endure.9 You've heard a lot of  statistics10 tonight. Please oblige me one. There is  no11 jurisdiction in the United States in which  a12 full- time, minimum wage worker can pay the fair13 market rent.14 Despite all of your efforts  as15 the Rent Guidelines Board , even here in New York16 City it is impossible if you work full- time and17 your wage is at minimum for you to be able  to18 afford the fair market  rent.19 Now, your proposals,  5.5 and20 8.5, the prelim, to me just vitiate all the  good21 that you can do as a board and what the  rent22 regulat ion system can do.23 But the thing that really24 concerns me is what is happening and what  may25 happen to tenants up in Albany where tenants,   as2 
1	5972 I believe you know, are getting  flattened,3 decimated , slayed , cremated.4 What you're doing by  suggesting5 5. 5 and 8.5 percent increases is just kicking a6 wounded dog. Tenants are under attack. You  know7 it and we know you know it.8 Please do the right thing.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 (Audience participation.)11	MR. IRVING MINTZ:	Hello, Mr.12 Chairman, Executive Director and Board  Members.13 Thank you for giving me the opportunity to   speak14 wi th you.15 My name is Irving Lorise  Mintz16 of the 83rd and 84th Street  Neighborhood17 Associat ion, and I live in a rent stabilized18 apartment at 212 East 83rd  Street.19 I and many of my fellow  tenants20 whom I represent today are overburdened with  past21 rent increases even though our landlord' s  incomes22 increase every year.23 Please, we implore you, not  to24 increase the rents again . We urge you to support25 the leadership of Speaker Gifford Miller,  Senator12 
2 Liz Krueger, Assemblyman  Pete Grannis and others3 who have advocated in past bills,  elected4 off icials who have passed bills strengthening and5 extending rent regulation  rules.6 I run a small charitable  not -7 for-prof it that brings magic and mime, music,8 myth and vaudeville to children who face  critical9 illness, kids with homelessness or AIDS  or10 cancer, and to frail elders.11 My rent is eighty percent of  my12 income for a small one- room flat , twelve by13 eighteen feet.14 Soon the building will be hit15 with Major Capital Improvement rent  increases16 because my landlord finally fixed his roof , a17 roof he inherited along with tens of millions  of18 dollars in other Manhattan real estate he  never19 had to work for.20 (Audience participation.)21 MR. IRVING MINTZ:	But I and my22 dedicated volunteer staff work eighty hours  a23 week seven days a week with no vacation for  four24 years. I have a $50,000 student loan debt from  my25 master' s in social work. And after the World2 
1	5992 Trade Center tragedy, we lost our theatre  venue,3 our programs, our funding and other  staff.4	The rents are too high in  my5	neighborhood  for working people.6	In closing, the landlord  has7 tried to evict me many times,  harassment8 techniques . He' s tried to run out elderly9 neighbors, one who saved his building  recently10 from burning down, claiming that her cats  make11 too much noise.12 It goes on and on. I mean  he's13 got a tenant next door to me who bangs on  the14 wall  and my  door at  four in the morning	- -15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to16 wrap up.17 MR. IRVING MINTZ:	- - for four18 years.19 Yes.20 I'm struggling to make  a21 positive difference in the lives of thousands   of22 New York children and elderly as the Trustees   of23 the Little Ole New York that we know and we  love.24 Please meet us, all of us,  just25 not myself , but all the working people half  way7 
1	6002 and vot e for no more rent increases.3 Thank you for your time.4 (Audience participation.)5	MS. MERYL STEIN:	My name is6 Meryl Stein.7 I'm a staff attorney at  DC378 Legal Services where I work ten to twelve hours   a9 day usually helping to prevent the eviction  of10 municipal employees, people who, as you know,11 have been laid off. At least 3000 workers  have12 been laid off.13 And I particularly want to  talk14 about apartments in the outer boroughs since  a15 lot of focus has been on  Manhattan.16 The peopl e that I represent earn17 between $11,000 and $30,000 per year and  they18 take home on the average between $500 and   $70019 every two weeks. Their rents average  around20 between $700 and $900 a mont h. Okay?21 And this is because of all  the22 vacancy, twenty percent vacancy increases, 1/40th23 increases, MCI  increases,  longevity increases,24 all of which were put in place in the 1997  Rent25 Regulat ion Reform Act.
