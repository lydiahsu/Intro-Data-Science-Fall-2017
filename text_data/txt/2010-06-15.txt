2	P R O C E E D I N    G S 3 4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Good  afternoon,5 ladies and gentlemen - the small crowd that it  is 6 at the moment, but we expect it to fill up as   the 7 time goes on - my name is Jonathan Kimmel,  Chairman 8 of the Rent Guidelines Board and I’ d like to 9 welcome you to this public  hearing.10 This is just one meeting in  a11 series of public meetings and hearings to  determine 12 the renewal lease adjustments for rent  stabilized 13 housing units in New York City with  leases 14 commencing on, or being renewed on or after  October 15 1 , 2010 and on or before September 30 , 2011 .16 A few announcements.17 A public hearing to comment on  the 18 proposed rental adjustments will be held  this 19 Thursday, June 17 th from 10 : 00 a. m. to 6 : 00 p. m. at 20 the Great Hall at Cooper Union, 7 East 7 th  Street 21 in Manhattan.22 You can pre- register to speak by 23 calling the Rent Guidelines Board offices  at 24 212 - 385 - 2934 . Pre- registration ends tomorrow, June 25	16 th at 1 : 00 p. m.4 
2 The final vote on the  adjustments 3 to rent stabilized renewal leases will be held  at 4 Cooper Union on Thursday, June 24 th, starting at 5	5 : 30 p. m.6 Drafts of both the hotel and 7 apartment explanatory statements and findings  will 8 be distributed to board members on  Thursday.9 Before we get started, I’ d like to 10 run through some of the rules that we hope to   keep 11 in place for this evening. I know everybody who’ s12 registered has been given a copy of  them.13 Each speaker will have three 14 minutes from the time his or her name is called   to 15 complete their presentation.	In the event that 16 there is a large number of people that wish  to 17 speak, the Chair may reallocate the time.	It might 18 be shortened, but we’ ll cross that bridge when we 19 come to it.20 I’ ll try to call several names in 21 advance.	If you hear your name called, if you   want 22 to move down to the front row so we can be   ready 23 for you to speak.24 Elected officials who show up  will 25 be given a priority and they will be slotted in   to 6 
2 speak as soon as it is possible for us to put   them 3 in.4 If you do have prepared  statements 5 to distribute, if you would please give it to   the 6 staff at the table, either outside or in here  and 7 it will be distributed.8 Let’ s see.	The clock, we do have 9 a clock that will be started. There will be a   beep 10 about thirty seconds before the end of your  time.11 We would like you to try to stick to time as   much 12 as possible. Your allocated time is not affected  by 13 questions that the board members may  pose.14 Do we have anything else?15 Oh, registration will close at 16 8 : 00 p. m. tonight. I will try to alternate between 17 tenant representative speakers and owner 18 representative speakers as the numbers are 19 available.20 So with that in mind, I would  like 21 to start this hearing.22 Our first speaker, Mr. Thomas 23 Diana, representing the owners.24 MR. DIANA:	Thank you, Mr. Kimmel.25 The politicians and seniors by  the 2 
2 dozens who scream that they are paying half  of 3 their income in rent, they complain about $ 3 , 000 a4 month apartments, yet as soon as the discussion  of 5 SCRIE application arises, they all  choke.6 How can they possibly be  paying 7 half of their income when SCRIE kicks in  at 8 one- third of your income?	If you actually read the 9 application, it starts at $ 29 , 000 a year, not 10 including several other government benefits, which 11 would tick it up easily into the mid $ 30 , 000 range.12 Nor the utility bills that every relative on  the 13 planet is paying so that they can claim  residency 14 when the primary tenant moves out.15 So let’ s do some real math using 16 the minimum SCRIE eligibility at $ 29 , 000 , assuming 17 the tenants are telling the truth, about half  of 18 their income.	That kicks in under $ 1 , 200 .	So 19 therefore, any rent under $ 1 , 200 , SCRIE would pick 20 up the increases, whether from the board or  the 21 Major Capital Improvements.22 So what is all the fighting  about?23 SCRIE will pay for all the Rent Guideline  Board 24 increases, all MCI increases.	What’ s the problem?25 Sorry. The simple truth is,2 
2 they’ re not telling the whole truth. I hear a  lot 3 of tenant code phrases. " I pay my $ 200 a month rent 4 on time."	" Half of my Social Security check goes 5 for rent."	On the occasion when you do muscle  the 6 courage to actually ask about real income,  they 7 immediately go off in a tirade.	They never explain 8 how their rents can be well under 1 , 000 and still 9 not qualify for SCRIE.10 The simple truth is that rents  are 11 so cheap, they do not qualify for this very  simple 12 program.13 I have plenty of SCRIE 14 applications.	And contrary to the $ 1 . 50 that the 15 building received in 1972 , SCRIE will pay thousands 16 of dollars annually for truly needy  tenants.17 In 1969 the average rent was $ 400 18 in Manhattan, yet 41 years later we are  still 19 discussing $ 400 rents.	Okay?20 A subway fare in 1969 was 20  cents 21 and a ham sandwich was 40 cents at  Woolworths.22 It’ s been a very long time since we’ ve had that.23 And I really don’ t think it’ s fair to have tenants 24 that are paying their fair share paying for  tenants 25 who got these super cheap rents.2 
2 I looked it up, and according  to 3 your own guidelines, 200 , 000 people are paying 4 under $ 400 and 1 , 200 are paying under $ 99 a month.5 We got to fix that guys. That’ s really not  fair.6 I am gonna ask you one  question,7 is, just as a suggestion.	I think the politicians 8 should have to wait for ten minutes and listen  to 9 whether it’ s tenants or landlords before they get 10 their speech and they march out of here in front   of 11 the news cameras.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Well, they may 13 not get on immediately when they  --14 MR. DIANA:	No.	I’ d like to see 15 you give them a ten minute -- make them listen   to 16 us like you do.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.18 James Jones.19 After Mr. Jones, is it --  please 20 excuse me if I mispronounce a name, Leza  Koretsky,21 Kuleszi. Okay.22 And then Anna Rivera; and 23 Then Gerald Bollinger.24 Mr. Jones.25 MR. JONES:	One female teenager,2 
2 one male teenager under the influence  of 3 prescription contraband drugs - criminal use,  also 4 marijuana cigarettes and concurrently operating an 5 SUV automobile - enlarged truck ( report from Long 6 Island), New York motored upon the property of  one 7 Long Island woman owner mauling her to the  beyond 8 with the enlarged truck SUV.9 The female teenager was quoted by 10 Long Island authorities - dead woman owner was  an 11 old bitch - ( bitch refers usually to a female  dog 12 or canine, old bitch.)13 Queens County case.	What is the 14 significance of the age of the docket,  defendants 15 swayed influence on judge to completely  disregard 16 current case before him ( also known as influence 17 peddling) - swayed influence on judge  to 18 concentrate solely on the thirty year old rap  sheet 19 histories of the prosecutor’ s witness; retrying the 20 thirty year old rap sheet histories, as reported  in 21 The Daily News ( New York - in this case,) due  to 22 the influenced swayed on the judge, the 30 - 40 rap 23 sheet history - 30 - 40 year old instead of current 24 case before him, Sean Bell, Queens  County.25 I thank and give honor to God  for 2 
2 the men and women in police uniform on the night   of 3 December 6 th to 7 th.	The judge signed the warrant 4 for the subdue or apprehension of the  landlord.5 Jones told to show in  Criminal 6 Court January 20 th.	In fact, the police did  subdue 7 the landlord on the night of December 6 th to 7 th.8 I pray that no one takes my words out of   context.9 These teenagers with the criminal 10 use of prescription drugs and marijuana  cigarettes 11 feel that since the World Trade Center Towers  were 12 25 year old, 30 year old, they should be   knocked 13 down.	The Waldorf Astoria Hotel property occupied 14 the block and lot now occupied by the Empire  State 15 Building.	Sherry- Netherland Hotel property once 16 ruined by fire.	The Waldorf was brought down  by 17 fire that is why the Waldorf is on Park  Avenue 18 today.19 Sergeant Ohrenberg indicated the 20 landlord' s fingerprints were sent to Washington,21 D. C.	One community evidence indicated abuse of  the 22 old can trigger child abuse.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.24 Jones.25 Lezek Kuleszi.2 
2 MR. KULESZI:	Yeah.	Hundred 3 thousand families cannot afford to rent in New  York 4 City. They say ( unintelligible) public assistance 5 40 , 000 homeless in City shelters.	Thousands of 6 homeless in the street.	Hundred of thousand move 7 to Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania  because 8 they cannot afford the rent here in the  United 9 States.10 Not they move because they like  to 11 travel to work each day after day three or  four 12 hours.	They cannot afford the rent.	And all this 13 mean the good employees not working.	Means the 14 board is not working properly. And rent  regulation 15 is basically price fixing. And price fixing  is 16 common in the United States.	Price fixing is like 17 -- almost all world is price fixing this  kind.18 What I have more?	Oh, U. S.19 economics is based on market not on price  fixing.20 It' s only here in United States is rent regulations 21 is like kind of price fixing.	We have thousands,22 thousands -- we don’ t have big homeowners here in 23 New York.	And those people should compete with 24 each other. We don' t need rent regulation.25 Competition will bring more and cheaper and  better 2 
2 apartments.	Rent regulation will basically 3 cheating all competition and that’ s why rents are 4 crazy.5 Banks doesn’ t wanna give a6 credit because this is high  risk business.	To buy 7 apartment building is high risk.	Then rent 8 regulation is to protect poor people.	This is 9 nonsense. This is pure propaganda.	Rent regulation 10 creates hundreds of thousands homeless  people.11 Rent regulation creates chaos,12 crimes, waste and that I' m from Communist.13 Communist usually regulate all prices, prices  for 14 shoes, for pants for food. And community  has 15 nothing. No food, no shoes,  no pants.	Millions 16 have died for starvation.17 If this thing is not gonna  change,18 nobody is homeless, New York City gonna  double 19 people and quadruple. And no vote gonna  change.20 This is like changing market law. This cannot  be 21 changed like a ( unintelligible) law.22 Politician, they condemn a  new 23 ( unintelligible) for New York.	Okay.	Fine.	You 24 have a new ( unintelligible) law, but the new  law 25 not gonna work.	They are pushing new law  for 2 
2 housing market.	That is -- this is not  working.3 It’ s too many people, homeless people.4 Thank you.5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.6 MR. KULESZI:	This is -- I  can 7 give this, two pages of  testimony.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.9 Anna Rivera;10 Followed by Gerald Bollinger.11 MS. RIVERA:	Anna Rivera. I have 12 lived in building 61 - 15 43 rd Avenue over 40 years 13 and worked for a super almost 40  years.14 I was given early retirement  and 15 temporary rent consideration until the building  was 16 sold.	My entire Social Security and savings  goes 17 entirely to rent. The rent is already too high  and 18 will continue going up in February with  the 19 expiration of my current lease.20 I want to stay in my apartment  and 21 not be forced out by high rent. I do not want to   be 22 pushed and forced to live in abject poverty  after 23 working for my community for so many years. I   do 24 not see any other system more effective to  keep 25 housing affordable in New York City than the  rent 2 
2 regulation thus to prevent rents from  skyrocketing 3 and also to protect tenants who complain  about 4 dangerous conditions and retaliatory eviction.5 But we need policymakers managing 6 and enforcing the system to understand the  living 7 conditions and what the cost of living means  for 8 working class New Yorkers and retirees. We need  the 9 State and the City to assume this  responsibilities 10 for the living conditions of all vulnerable  New 11 Yorkers.12 With the economic and financial 13 crisis, do we -- can we afford another  rent 14 increase and assume that nothing is happening  and 15 that tenants can keep up paying higher  rents?16 Definitely we are on the verge of a social  crisis 17 due to the indiscriminate increase of  rents.18 The average household income for  a19 family living in rent regulated housing is  only 20 about $ 35 , 000 and has been declining in real terms 21 for the past ten years.	Approximately sixty 22 percent of rent regulated tenants are people  of 23 color.	Forty percent of rent tenants were born  in 24 another country and additional five percent born  in 25 Puerto Rico.2 
2 If the Rent Guidelines Board,  the 3 City, and the State respect and  treasures 4 diversity, you should stop these increases  now,5 today.6 Therefore in order to keep  the 7 rent affordable for working families and  senior 8 citizens, the Rent Guidelines Board should  be 9 reformed giving tenants a voice in order to  hold 10 the landlord accountable.11 The first step to this is  to 12 impose fifty cents rent increase for one year,  one 13 dollar rent increase for two- year lease,14 respectively.	Not to change this institutional 15 behavior and continue not understanding New 16 Yorkers’ families living hardships --17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Rivera,18 would you bring it to a  close.19 MS. RIVERA:	Thank you.20 Just ready.21 -- will be an invitation  to 22 community based organization to escalate the 23 activism in social pressure and the housing  reality 24 in New York City is  possible.25 Thank you.2 
2CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.3Gerald Bollinger.4MS. RIVERA:	Anna M. Rivera,5A- n- n- aR- i- v- e- r- a.6MR. BOLLINGER:	Last year when 7 the board -- two weeks after the board gave  out 8 their approval for an increase, I saw an article  on 9 Yahoo News that said nationwide, rents  were 10 decreasing. So I decided that this is  really 11 unusual.	So this year I’ d be a troublemaker and  do 12 some fifteen minutes of research and see what  I13 could find.14 I did a research on the  Internet 15 with the key words " New York City rent decreases,"16 that’ s it.	And what I came back with was, first  of 17 all, I’ m going out of sequence.18 October 2007 , core Manhattan rents 19 dropped.	July 2009 , and these are all  different 20 months, Rents decreased by 1 . 1 percent in the first 21 quarter and nine percent in the second  quarter.22 July 2009 rents plunged the fastest in New  York.23 September 2009 , business from Business Week, rents 24 are up from 2007 equaled . 5 percent and for  2008 25 3 . 2 percent.7 
2 So I decided to go a little  bit 3 further and I went to your site and took down   all 4 the information for all the increases from, I  think 5 this goes back to 1990 or something like  that.6 What have we got here?	Obviously,7 I’ ve never done this in the past. Okay. Yeah, I’ m8 back to 1991 .	And I took down all those  numbers 9 starting with what I remembered to be my rent  and 10 just made a table that  way.11 Then I went to Toms  Inflation 12 Calculator and got all the inflation rates for  the 13 same period of time.	And when it came out,14 interesting information, of the last 19  years,15 which this comprises, the board -- I' ve got to  find 16 that sheet and I’ m running out of time.17 Anyway, usually the board does its 18 -- comes out to -- and it’ s in here someplace,  75 19 percent of the time the board gives a much  higher 20 increase than the inflation rate.	There were three 21 times or four times when they gave less than  the 22 inflation rate and three times when they gave  --23 two times, I’ m sorry, when they gave exactly the 24 inflation rate.25 I would hope that the board  would 2 
2 be more in line with what the inflation rate  is,3 because that’ s the real cost in the City for 4 everybody. It’ s not unique. And there is a5 precedent set that San Francisco Guidelines  Board 6 does do it that way.7 Also, I want the board to  know 8 that I’ m not a, obviously a landlord, nor am I  a9 tenant of a rent stabilized or a rent  controlled 10 apartment. But in the last three years my  landlord 11 hasn’ t raised my rent at all. And I’ m paying about 12 twenty bucks over what the equivalent  apartment 13 would be in my area.14 Do you want this?15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.16 Jim Galloway;17 Will be followed by Debra 18 Hargrove.19 MR. GALLOWAY:	Good afternoon,20 panel.21 My name is Jim Galloway,22 G- a- l- l- o- w- a- y. I am the coordinator of the Lefrak 23 City Tenants League which is  in Corona.	We 24 represent 1 , 000 of the 5 , 000 families that live in 25 Lefrak.2 
2 And the situation is, is that  the 3 increases every one to two years is hardship on  the 4 tenants. We’ re basically a middle income class 5 family. And when those increases come in, it’ s  a6 hardship. Many parents are one  families.7 And also the other situation is 8 because Lefrak will soon be 50 years old next  year,9 a lot of the facilities are breaking down. And  now 10 management wants us to pay for that in terms  of 11 Major Capital Improvements, which, of course,  we 12 are fighting.13 So any little bit that we can  have 14 to save us, we would appreciate it. And I hope   that 15 you’ ll consider this.16 Thank you so much for your  time.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.18 Debra Hargrove.19 MS. HARGROVE:	Good evening.20 I’ m Debra Patricia Hargrove.	I’ ve 21 been living --22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Hargrove,23 could you speak closer into the mike,  please.24 MS. HARGROVE:	Okay.	I’ m Debra 25 Patricia Hargrove.	I live in Lefrak City.2 
2 And it’ s a hardship when the rents 3 go up every two years. There are single  families 4 that can’ t afford the rents and some of the  parents 5 have to work two and three jobs to pay for   the 6 rent. And you’ re driving the middle class out by 7 having this rent every two years  increase.8 I’ m a single person. And one of my 9 paychecks has to pay for my rent. And so I feel   sad 10 for the people that has three and four kids  who 11 can’ t afford to pay their rent, definitely.12 And actually it' s a major 13 increase, that' s a lot for Major Capital 14 Improvement, that’ s more on top of the rent.	And I15 think we should just, you know, freeze it for  two 16 years so the people could afford to pay the  rent 17 and take care of their families.	Because there’ s a18 lot of evictions ‘ cause people can’ t afford the 19 rent.20 And there’ s peoples moving out of 21 New York.	They’ re moving to Virginia.	They’ re 22 moving down south because they can’ t afford to pay 23 the rent at all.	And I think it’ s a shame. We’ re 24 born in New York. We’ re born in the United  States.25 We should have places affordable for people  to 2 

2	live.345678

HOLDER:	And what neighborhood 15 would you characterize that in?16 MS. HARGROVE:	Corona.17 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.	And just in 18 general, you don’ t necessarily have to tell me, but 19 if you don’ t mind, could you tell me what your  rent 20 is or could you, if it would be better, tell   me 21 about the range of what your neighbors are  paying 22 for their --23 MS. HARGROVE:	Some of them is 24	paying $ 1 , 400 .25	MS. HOLDER:	For what size 

2	apartment?34567
MS. HARGROVE:		One bedroom. MS. HOLDER:	How much?MS. HARGROVE: $ 1 , 400 . MS. HOLDER:	Um- hum.MS. HARGROVE:	Some of them is 
8 paying $ 2 , 000 for a five- bedroom.9 MS. HOLDER:	And those MCI 10 increases that you’ re talking about, do you know 11 how much that is going to add per  --12 MS. HARGROVE:	About $ 50 more. It 13 depends.	It goes by the  room.14 MS. HOLDER:	Per room, though?15 MS. HARGROVE:	Per room.16 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.	Thank you 17 very much for your testimony this  evening.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I have a question.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.21 Did I hear your testimony 22 correctly when you said that half of your  paycheck 23 goes to rent?24 MS. HARGROVE:	Yes.	My whole 25 paycheck. One of my paychecks goes for my  rent.8 

23	how much?4
MR. SCHLEIDER:	And your rent is MS. HARGROVE:	I’ d rather not say,
5 but my rent is expensive.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	But 7 when Ms. Holder asked you to cite your rent,  you 8 cited other rents.9 MS. HARGROVE:	Yes.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And those are not 11 your rents.12 MS. HARGROVE:	No.	Those are the 13 people I know lives in these  apartments.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Would you know how 15 much of their paycheck goes to their  rent?16 MS. HARGROVE:	I don’ t know.	I17 never ask personal questions.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I see.19 A VOICE:	May I answer that?20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No.	That’ s21 fine.	Thank, you though.22 Just out of curiosity, how much  of 23 your paycheck goes to taxes?24 MS. HARGROVE:	Most of the taxes.25 I pay a lot of taxes ' cause I’ m a single woman  and 5 
2 I pay at a higher  rate.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay. So what 4 percentage then would go to  taxes?5 MS. HARGROVE:	Ten to fifteen 6 percent.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Ten to fifteen 8 percent.	You pay a high  rate.9 MS. HARGROVE:	Yes.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	That’ s11 State, City and Federal?12 MS. HARGROVE:	Right.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	Thank you.14 MS. HARGROVE:	Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.16 Okay.	At the moment if there’ s17 anybody who wishes to speak who has not  registered,18 that could be done outside. Otherwise we have  --19 we’ re going to take a slight recess because we’ ve 20 run out of speakers.21 Sir?22 A VOICE:	I would like to --23 outside?24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes.	Please 25 register so we have the information.	We’ d be more 2 
2 than happy to wait for  you.3 Sir, if you would come,  please 4 state your name.5 MR. DAVIS:	Yes.	Hi.6 First of all, my name is  Michael 7 Davis, I’ m a tenant in a rent controlled  unit.8 My apologies for not registering 9 and thank you for waiting.10 MS. ADAMS:	Excuse me.	Did 11 you say you lived in a rent controlled  unit?12 MR. DAVIS:	Rent controlled unit.13 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.14 MR. DAVIS:	And I’ ve been 15 laid off and I have my own personal  economic 16 circumstances that are making it difficult for  me 17 to meet the rent. I took in a roommate to help   me 18 and I’ m basically living on unemployment.19 But what I really want to say  is 20 that I think we have a problem of trying to make   a21 policy where one size fits all. And with  competing 22 and conflicting interests, I think we’ re always 23 going to be running into a perpetual problem  of 24 trying to make something that’ s fair for the 25 greatest number of people.2 
2 I think, however, in today we  have 3 methods given, you know, our -- the technology  at 4 hand to do a more fine- tuned assessment of what 5 really is a fair evaluation of the costs and  the 6 market prices of various units and the  economic 7 circumstances of the tenants on the other hand  so 8 that a more finessed solution can be arrived at  so 9 that we don’ t have contentious meeting every year.10 I mean it just seems that we’ re 11 running over the same ground year after year  after 12 year and not really solving the problem at  the 13 heart of the matter.14 I think there are solutions  that 15 could be arrived at given more of a  brainstorming 16 type session.	But the Town Hall- style meetings and 17 whatever goes on behind closed doors, it’ s simply,18 you know, business as usual with certain  tweaks 19 made to an existing policy.	But I think a  whole 20 complete rethinking of this is  necessary.21 So more than that, I really  have 22 nothing to add at this point.	But I welcome your 23 comments.24 MS. CRUZ:	May I say something,25 Mr. Chair?2 

23	question.4
CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Adams had aMS. ADAMS:	Yeah. I just wanted 
5 to say that I think you’ re absolutely right and  I6 suspect that most of my fellow board members  feel 7 the same way. The legislation that we operate  under 8 now does not allow us to tailor the kind  of 9 solution that you are suggesting. And you  are 10 correct, one size does not fit  all.11 But thank you for your  testimony.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Cruz.13 MR. DAVIS:	Thank you.14 MS. CRUZ: I want to reiterate  that 15 as well. I think your comments are very good  ones.16 In fact, this board attempted to create  a17 differential to try to deal with the needs of  the 18 greater good so- to- speak.	And unfortunately the 19 courts have disagreed with that approach.	And it 20 was certainly an attempt by this board or at   least 21 seven members of this board, to try to reach  a22 better solution for this problem.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: Thank you.24 MR. DAVIS: If you want  some 25 further input, I’ m finally registered.5

Thank you for your attention. CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.Adele Bender.MS. BENDER:	It’ s definitely well 
7 hidden. It took me over an hour to look for   this 8 place and I know Queens and New York quite  well.9 Anyway, my name is Adele  Bender.10 I am a member of JPAC, Joint Public  Affairs 11 Committee for Older Adults, Met Council on  Housing 12 and the Queens Interagency Council on  Aging.13 Proposed rent increases to tenants 14 in rent stabilized apartments is really a  hardship 15 on many seniors residing in those apartments.  The 16 increases is on top of all of the  increases.17 -- can you hear me  okay?18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes.19 MS. BENDER:	It’ s on top of all of 20 the increases that we’ ve been getting year after 21 year.	Not everybody qualifies for SCRIE.	Some 22 people are just slightly above the eligibility  for 23 SCRIE and other benefits such as that.	And we’ re 24 really hurting.25 Medicare doesn’ t cover 7 
2 everything. I pay over $ 200 a month for  my 3 supplemental prescription drugs. They’ re very 4 expensive. Sometimes there’ s a certain amount of 5 coverage. Sometimes there aren’ t. These are the 6 problems that seniors go through.7 Transportation’ s expensive. Some 8 go to the nearby grocery. And food in the  nearby 9 grocery is usually more expensive, but at least  we 10 have some kind of a choice. You can make   some 11 choice among the different foods and try to get  the 12 best price. But when it comes to the rent, it is   an 13 absolute.	There’ s no flexibility at all.14 And I do have to tell you that  a15 lot of seniors are hurting. The senior centers,  I16 was down this morning, senior centers are going  to 17 be closed.	A lot of people bank on those  senior 18 centers for some of their meals.	So, you know,19 we’ re really getting it from all ends.20 Health care is not what it  should 21 be.	We have Medicare. We have supplemental.   It 22 doesn’ t always cover what it’ s supposed to cover.23 And again, as I said, prescription drugs are  very 24 expensive.25 Those people, and some of them  do 2 
2 have savings accounts, they’ re lucky enough to have 3 a savings account.	But right now, it’ s a big one 4 percent, or sometimes less.	And a lot of seniors 5 have to draw on their savings, including -- there’ s6 no -- interest is like almost negligible and  they 7 do have to draw on their  savings.8 Some of us are living longer  so 9 it’ s kind of scary. We don’ t know what the future 10 is going to hold.	So I’ m just hoping, and I’ ll try 11 to make this short.	And I just want to bring  out 12 the fact that, you know, again, as I say, rent   is 13 absolute. SCRIE, if you have a penny over, a   dollar 14 over $ 29 , 000 income, you have to keep paying those 15 increases, those increases in rents.16 Again, medical care and 17 prescription drugs are not always covered in  the 18 way they should be.	And, you know, it’ s costing a19 lot to live. And I do have to say that things   are 20 getting really tough out there. It’ s no joke.21 So I have to let you know that we depend upon   the 22 kindness of strangers.23 Thank you.24 MR. LANGUEDOC:	A question.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Bender,2 

2	just one moment.34567	coming in today.8
Mr. Languedoc.MR. LANGUEDOC:		Ms. Bender, is it? MS. BENDER:	Yes.MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you for Could you tell me of the  people 
9 that you work with, do you know approximately  how 10 much rent they’ re paying and can you tell us  sort 11 of the range of what people  --12 MS. BENDER:	Well, okay.	We have 13 a range of rent, I guess, about  approximately 14 anywhere between $ 700 to over $ 1 , 000 now. One of 15 the people in my building just got her rent  freeze.16 Until she got, it’ s frozen at $ 1 , 100 . So she still 17 has to pinch pennies.18 We got new machines in,  washing 19 machines; it was a quarter more. You know,  that 20 quarter more was bugging her. And she’ s not stingy.21 She’ s a really decent human being.	But this is 22 what a lot of us are going through, the  extra 23 quarter, the extra fifty cents, you know, it’ s a24 problem.25 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Are these mostly 9 
2 single people households living --3 MS. BENDER:	Well --4 MR. LANGUEDOC:	-- with one person 5	--6 MS. BENDER:	Yeah.	Well, widows,7 divorcees, you know, for instance, you know they’ re 8 divorcees.9 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And what size 10 apartments?11 MS. BENDER:	And so you have one 12 person in the house, right.13 MR. LANGUEDOC:	What size 14 apartments do these people have?15 MS. BENDER:	Well, my apartment is 16 a one bedroom.17 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Right.18 MS. BENDER:	The other lady’ s19 apartment, she’ s been there for many years, it’ s a20 two bedroom.	And as I say, she’ s been -- even 21 though people may think well, $ 1 , 100 isn’ t that 22 much and it’ s frozen at that, but, you know, we’ re 23 seniors.	And if you don’ t have it, you know  --24 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I don’ t think it’ s25 not that much.	But --6 
2 MS. BENDER:	You know, so I don’ t3 know what people think.	But, you know, if you 4 don’ t have it, you don’ t have it.	I know she’ s5 very, very -- I mean, years ago when things  were 6 different, sometimes I’ d see her shopping, she’ d7 bring a little shopping bag, you know, Lord  &8 Taylor. She doesn’ t do that any more.	So, you 9 know, these are the kind of things that are  going 10 on with seniors.11 And again, as I say, when you  come 12 see the food, some of the seniors really depend  in 13 the meals that they got at the  senior centers.	And 14 there was a big rally, maybe on TV tonight,  that 15 they’ re closing some of the centers.	This is --16 you know, you have a growing senior population  and 17 our needs are growing and the things that can  make 18 us have a decent quality of life is  diminishing.19 So as I say, we depend upon  the 20 kindness of you strangers and for people that  do 21 have a few dollars more than SCRIE, you know,  raise 22 the level of SCRIE.	Or if you -- I don’ t know, to 23 some people two percent doesn’ t seem much.	When 24 it’ s on top of all of the increases that we  have 25 paid throughout the years, for a lot of us  it’ s2 

2	really a lot.34
MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.MS. BENDER:	So if you have any 
5 questions, I’ d be happy to answer it.6 Thank you.7 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.9 Is there anyone else in  the 10 audience right now who hasn’ t registered and would 11 like to speak?12 ( No response.)13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay. We will 14 take a ten- minute recess.	We have exhausted the 15 current registered speakers in attendance.	So we 16 will -- okay, fifteen minutes.17 We will reconvene at 5 : 00 .18 Thank you.19 ( At 4 : 47 p. m., the hearing was 20 temporarily recessed.)21 ( At 5 : 13 p. m., the hearing was 22 resumed.)23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	We will 24 reconvene very shortly.	We have two speakers so 25 far registered in the following order,  Jessica 5 
2 Anderson and John Rutherford.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	We are 4 back in session.5 Again, if there is anyone here  who 6 has not registered who would like to speak,  that 7 can be done outside the room in the  lobby.8 Jessica Anderson.9 MS. ANDERSON:	Hi. I prepared 10 this in letter form.	So -- we’ ll agree that some 11 rents in the City are  too high.	It is just as 12 wrong that 25 percent or many rents are  too low.	I13 live in a 16 - unit co- op with full rent stabilized 14 apartments and one rent controlled apartment.	The 15 rents are slightly more than half the cost of  the 16 maintenance.	This means that the landlord  unfairly 17 pays for people to live on his  property.18 The rent control and rent 19 stabilization system keeps rent artificially low 20 over the course of years. Rents that are too  low 21 create an injustice that one individual,  the 22 landlord, without his consent, is forced to pay  the 23 living expenses of another individual, the  renter.24 In other words, tenants are living off  landlords.25 Due to this injustice my  small 2 
2 co- op and many other small co- ops, have not been 3 able to keep up with adjustments in the cost  of 4 living. We’ re not just losing money, we are 5 falling behind on our expenses.	Many of us small 6 landlords are forced to work two jobs and  are 7 forced to have both parents work in order to  make 8 up the difference. Is this fair to our  children?9 Not to mine.10 Why does the City treat  all 11 landlords the same? Do you treat the small  bodega 12 at the corner the same way you treat a   large 13 supermarket chain such as Pathmark?	The City 14 unfairly treats small landlords according to  the 15 same standards as large landlords. Small  landlords 16 are being forced to sell out.	Many are converting 17 their two or four- family home into just a18 one- family home. Why is there a housing shortage?19 Maybe the shortage is due to the injustice  of 20 inequitable rent laws and regulations.21 The City is one of the  largest 22 offenders of raising the cost of living to such  a23 high level. The City has raised property taxes  and 24 water costs so high that they take up to 40   percent 25 of the cost of running a building. This 40   percent 2 
2 of running a building is further aggravated by a   25 3 percent rise in the cost of oil in this last   year.4 Literally, and I have the chart to prove it,  we’ re 5 paying an average of $ 2 . 60 over the heat season 6 this year compared to $ 2 . 00 last year. So it’ s7 actually a little more than 25  percent.8 Given all these long term 9 injustices, namely the inequitable rent  laws,10 increasing property taxes and water costs, it  is 11 time for the City to be courageous enough  to 12 overhaul the rent control and rent  stabilized 13 system, both of which are 50 to 80 years out   of 14 date and both of which no longer meet the needs   of 15 the City.16 They not only no longer meet  the 17 needs of the City, they fail to meet the needs   of 18 the City. Is it fair that well- paid actors,19 politicians and bankers have a rent  stabilized 20 apartment while low- income families pay market 21 rates?	And this exists in my building  with 22 families that are low income paying market  rates 23 and families that make below income paying  rent 24 stabilization rates.25 It’ s time for a change. It is time 2 
2 for the landlords to have a system such as   the 3 Federal Government gives itself.	In this system,4 rents are based on the residents’ income  and 5 landlords are justly compensated for lost  income.6 This is only just. This is also a practical,  long 7 term solution to our City’ s housing problems.8 And while I understand this  board 9 doesn’ t have the authority to change the system, it 10 does have the authority to give an increase  of 11 rents that are fair to landlords who  are 12 shouldering the burden of landlord --  tenants 13 basically living off them.14 Now, I also have --15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Anderson,16 please wrap it up.17 MS. ANDERSON:	Sure.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Your time is 19 up.20 MS. ANDERSON:	Look, I have 21 paperwork for you if you want.	I have a water 22 bill.	I have --23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You can put 24 anything you’ d like us to see on the edge of  the 25 platform.2 

23	then.45678	testifying.9
MS. ANDERSON:	Fine.	That’ s it Do you have any questions? MR. LANGUEDOC:	Yeah, I do.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:		Mr. Languedoc. MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you for But I do want to make a  comment.
10 I’ ll give you a chance to respond to it.	But it 11 seems to me that it’ s not fair to equate 12 maintenance on a co- op with -- which has a  very 13 different expense structure from a rental  apartment 14 building to rent.15 And then the other point is  that 16 the person who owns a co- op apartment and is 17 collecting rent on that apartment, the  income 18 they’ re getting in the rent is one thing. They  also 19 have, it’ s also the investment that eventually that 20 apartment is going to be vacant and they’ re going 21 to sell it and make money on the  sale.22 So I think that while --  I23 understand that co- ops have issues with income and 24 they have expenses that they have to pay and  that 25 they’ re looking to their shareholders to pay those 10 
2 expenses, to me it doesn’ t seem very relevant to 3 this board’ s deliberations.4 MS. ANDERSON:	Okay. It --5 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Now I said I6 would give you a chance to comment. So go   ahead.7 MS. ANDERSON:	All right. It does 8 affect us, because as a corporation, we can’ t  sell 9 that apartment for the same amount as we can  for 10 another apartment. We don’ t have the same input.11 We don’ t have the same cooperation.	We have people 12 who are literally living there for a lot below  the 13 cost of -- and it’ s not that I think that  they 14 shouldn’ t get help. I just think that it shouldn’ t15 be an individual landlord that pays  it.16 We basically had to give  those 17 apartments away.	So that affected the corporation,18 how?	It means I don’ t have money for a new   roof.19 It means that I have to scrimp  and save.	It means 20 that every owner in that building is going to  have 21 to be assessed when it’ s time for new roofs  and 22 improvements.23 The money comes from everybody 24 being together. And it does affect how much kind  of 25 cooperation we get, how much we sell  apartments 2 
2 for. You can’ t tell me that it’ s something where a3 person might be spending $ 50 , 000 or $ 60 , 000 over 4 the years, paying somebody’ s rent is the kind of 5 investment you want to make.6 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay.	Thank you.7 MS. ANDERSON:	Thank you.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for 11 that explanation.	I’ m sure Ron appreciates it.12 ( Laughter.)13 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I do actually.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Also -- yes, I’ m15 sure you do.	You’ ve been very good about learning 16 things.17 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I told her --  I18 said thank you.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But I think one 20 of the other points that you might want to  bring 21 out next time, and we do hope that you do   testify 22 again for us, is that the rent stabilized  tenants,23 or your regulated tenants in your property, pay  a24 significant discount from your maintenance.	And 25 really the only difference between your 2 
 2 maintenance and their rent, if you were a   private 3 owner --4 MS. ANDERSON:	Yes.5 MR. SCHLEIDER: -- then you  would 6 also want to see some sort of return on   your 7 investment, some sort of a cash flow over and   above 8 your real estate taxes, your debt service,  your 9 reserve for replacements, all of which you  are 10 paying right now and that the regulated rents  show 11 a significant discount from.12 MS. ANDERSON:	Well, the -- we did 13 Weatherization.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That’ s15 terrific.16 MS. ANDERSON:	We spent $ 80 , 000 .17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And I’ m sure you 18	--19 MS. ANDERSON:	And of course, we 20 didn’ t save any money because of the cost of  oil.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And I’ m sure you 22 don’ t have any violations on your property.23 MS. ANDERSON:	We actually have 24 tons because we have professional tenants  who 25 complain, which is why one of them lives and  has 19 
2 lived there for 18 years for free. I just  haven’ t3 got the manpower to do  it.4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	For free?5 MS. ANDERSON:	Eighteen years for 6 free. I’ ve written DHCR. I’ ve tried just about 7 everything I know how, but I can’ t -- I can’ t fight 8 it. I wrote to DHCR. I asked them to do a   rent 9 adjustment.	Basically we have dockets so old  that 10 when I went to DHCR, they couldn’ t look him up  for 11 me.12 So I asked them to basically  go 13 in, reevaluate it, tell me and the landlord  what 14 needs to be done.	And they said they didn’ t have 15 the manpower to do that, but I should file and   fill 16 out thirty dockets and I don’ t even know what I’ m17 filing for because they don’ t have the accurate 18 information to give me.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So you couldn’ t do 20 this pro se?21 MS. ANDERSON:	I’ m just a22 stay- at- home mom.	I do this for free.	I try to 23 make my neighbors, both tenants and my  fellow 24 owners, some of who are equally low income,  because 25 it takes 50 percent to qualify for  Weatherization 2 
2 of low income and that included owners and  tenants.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Um- hum.4 MS. ANDERSON:	And I just want to 5 make life better for everybody.	I do the 6 gardening.	I do the watering. I pick up  the 7 garbage. I deal with all the problems of  the 8 building, all for free. And I can’ t devote enough 9 hours.	I’ m not a professional. I’ m just -- my 10 mistake was I bought a  home.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Um- hum.12 MS. ANDERSON:	And it’ s a13 co- op.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That’ s right.	You 15 bought a property with tenants.16 MS. ANDERSON:	Yes.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	Thank 18 you.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.2021 John Rutherford.22 MR. RUTHERFORD:	I too have 23 reduced this to written form.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Can you move the 25 mike up so we can hear you,  please.21 

23	this?456	evening.7
MR. RUTHERFORD:	Sure.	How’ sCHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Much better. MR. RUTHERFORD:	Okay.	Good Allow me to begin by saying I am  a
8 New York State employee. And for the last  four 9 employment contracts between New York State and  its 10 employees, each year everyone has started off  with 11 a zero percent raise for the first year and one   of 12 them with a zero percent increase for the first  two 13 years. Every year after that we had an  increase 14 that were percentage- wise smaller than the increase 15 that this board has given to the landlords of  the 16 rent stabilized buildings that we New Yorkers  live 17 in.18 State and City workers, garbage 19 men, policemen, teachers, are the ones living  in 20 these apartments. This is a quasi government  body 21 that every year without fail has raised  rents 22 because they said the landlords’ costs went  up.23 And yet another agency of this same  state 24 government that approved my rent increases,  tells 25 me that I get a zero percent wage increase  the 8 
2 first year and a percentage every year  following 3 that, is less than the increase percentage of  my 4 rent increase.5 I am told to do more with  less.6 When will the landlords be told to do more  with 7 less by you?8 ( Applause.)9 MR. RUTHERFORD:	Especially the 10 members of the panel that are, “ representing the 11 tenants.”	You saw rent increases to the  tenants 12 and public in general with the philosophy that  they 13 are necessary so that landlords will not  abandon 14 their properties. They need to survive. And why  are 15 investors paying millions of dollars for  these 16 properties if they are such marginal  investments?17 In past years, a single owner  was 18 the landlord and we prided and meticulously  tended 19 to his property and in many cases lived in  this 20 property.	The consistent granting of rent 21 increases has caused the inherent net worth  of 22 these buildings to skyrocket and made the  scenario 23 of a tenant/ landlord implausible.24 This has created a situation  where 25 an individual can no longer save and invest  and 2 
2 with a little luck one day buy a 6 or 12   or 3 24 - apartment rental property, because of the rents 4 being so high, these buildings now command  between 5 one to eight million dollars.6 They are bought by investors that 7 mortgage and leverage them for the bulk of  their 8 value and then try to make profits on the  margins.9 I mean the same process just marginalizes  the 10 tenants living in them as they try to month  after 11 month after month reap the enormous burden of  these 12 extraordinary rents putting the entirely family 13 unit not only under stress but  duress.14 Not only do you give  these 15 percentage increases, but you also  approve 16 increases for -- when a landlord replaces a   stove 17 or a refrigerator, a product that has a finite   life 18 span and these increases are permanent. And  the 19 landlord actually profits from them, from  these 20 expenditures in time. And the laughable part  of 21 this is, if he is lucky, the appliance will  fail 22 sooner than later so that he can get  another 23 compounded increase.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Rutherford,25 if you could wrap it up.	Your time is up.2 
2 MR. RUTHERFORD:	And what about 3 the eye- opening rent increases this board has 4 justified in years where they had been  fuel 5 increases and yet when the fuel prices go  back 6 down, there is never a rent decrease or  zero 7 percent increase the first of the next lease  for 8 the landlord.	This just turns into a bonus for  the 9 landlords.10 The past actions that this  board 11 has taken whereby they have set new precedent  by 12 enacting rent increases with a minimum  dollar 13 amount targeted at long time residents has now  been 14 ruled to have been illegal by the New York  State 15 Supreme Court. These board’ s past actions in doing 16 this have not only broken the rule of law, but   has 17 violated the very spirit of the  law.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Rutherford.19 MR. RUTHERFORD:	I have two more 20 paragraphs, sir.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Can you read 22 them quickly?23 MR. RUTHERFORD:	Yes.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.25 MR. RUTHERFORD:	Let me take this 2 
2 opportunity to remind this board that the  rent 3 regulations laws were enacted and this board  is 4 compelled to follow. They were enacted with  a5 spirit in regards to long- term tenants with an idea 6 that if a tenant remained in a dwelling for   a7 period of 20 plus years and faithfully paid  his 8 rent for this time, that he would be in- kind 9 treated as a quasi co- owner in that sense that  it 10 would be taken into consideration that his  faithful 11 rent payments are what contributed and  made 12 possible the eventual satisfaction of the  premises’13 mortgage.	He was never intended to be looked  upon 14 as neither a blight or a  parasite.15 Thank you.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, sir.17 Are there any questions?18 Thank you.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yeah, Mr. Chair.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Oh, Mr.21 Schleider.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Rutherford,23 I’ m sorry, but you read that last paragraph too 24 quickly. Could I just trouble you to read that  last 25 paragraph again. I had trouble following  it.2 
2 MR. RUTHERFORD:	Well, I’ ve broken 3 it up.	Do you want me to start where, this board’ s4 past actions in doing this  --5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No, no.	Past 6 that.	When you started getting into, you  know,7 mortgages --8 MR. RUTHERFORD:	This board --9 okay -- enacted -- the law was enacted with  a10 spirit in regards to long- term tenants with an idea 11 that if a tenant remained in a dwelling for   a12 period of 20 - plus years and faithfully paid his 13 rent for this time, that he would be in- kind 14 treated as a quasi co- owner in the sense that  it 15 would be taken into consideration that his  faithful 16 rent payments are what contributed and  made 17 possible the eventual satisfaction of the  premises’18 mortgage. He was never intended under this law  to 19 be looked upon as neither a blight or a   parasite.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	Now 21 Mr. Rutherford, which law are you referring  to 22 there?23 MR. RUTHERFORD:	Rent 24 Stabilization Law.25 MR. SCHLEIDER: I’ m not --2 

23	the law?4
MS. LEVINE:	Do you know where in MR. RUTHERFORD:	As I said, this 
5 was the spirit of the law.	When the law was 6 enacted, property owners --7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	My understanding 8	--9	MR. RUTHERFORD:	I’ m sorry.	But 10 she asked something.	Can I respond?11 When the law was enacted, it  was 12 enacted with the spirit that there would be a   fair 13 playing field.	We all know of the feudal  systems,14 which caused unstable societies, which people  were 15 taken advantage of.	And this system was created,16 documented in The New York Times  during 17 discussions, that tenants, again, that paid  for 18 years and years and years would be looked upon  as 19 an asset.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right.	Mr.21 Rutherford, I think you' re conflating an issue 22 here. I believe that 20 - year period had to do with 23 an owner not being able to take that apartment  then 24 for their own use, which would, in effect, I   guess,25 make them some sort of quasi co- owner, I don’ t10 
2 know, a life estate or something  like that.	But I3 fail to follow the rest of your argument  there.4 But I thank you for your  testimony.5 MR. RUTHERFORD:	Well, rent 6 control was set up for the long term  tenants.7 MS. CRUZ:	That 20 - year 8 rule does not apply to rent stabilization in  New 9 York City.10 MR. RUTHERFORD:	All you set is an 11 arbitrary figure.	We could take a 10 - year tenant,12 a 15 - year tenant or a 35 - year tenant.	Replace that 13 with a long term tenant.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, then -- but 15 I’ m not going to get into philosophical arguments 16 with you.	Again, thank you for your  testimony.17 MR. RUTHERFORD:	You’ re welcome.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Rutherford,19 would you like to leave a copy of that with   us?20 MS. HOLDER:	I have a21 question.22 MR. RUTHERFORD: Yes.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Holder.24 MS. HOLDER:	I’ m sorry.	I have a25 question.2 
2I appreciate you coming out  and 3your testimony today. And I really do  understand 4your frustration.5Just for clarification though,6 because I am one of the two tenant members, we   have 7 not voted for an increase. And the  justification 8 that you were explaining is a true  justification 9 that’ s been used, but it’ s not one that’ s been 10 espoused by the tenant members on this board as  to 11 why there should be increases.12 And, in fact, we voted and  time 13 and time again, advocate for  a freeze.	And it was 14 my organization, the Legal Aid Society,  that 15 actually brought the case that you referred to  that 16 Supreme Court ruled that these supplemental 17 increases were illegal. It was the Legal  Aid 18 Society along with Legal Services NYC that  brought 19 that case as an Article 78 in Supreme  Court.20 I appreciate though, what is  the 21 import of your -- of your concern. And I think   that 22 the increases that tenants do endure,  the 23 one- fortieth increase, the MCI increases, which 24 again, are not increases that we’ re responsible 25 for, but it’ s all part of this whole system  that 6 
2 the Rent Guidelines Board is a part of, has  caused 3 there to be an escalation and inflation of  rents 4 beyond the affordability, as folks would say,  of 5 this same very City agencies and State  agencies 6 that don’ t give a lot of their workers the  right 7 kind of COLA increases so that they can  afford 8 those increases.9 So I again, appreciate your 10 testimony today and I thank you for your  time 11 coming all the way out here to  Queens.12 MR. RUTHERFORD:	And I appreciate 13 what you did.14 Can I ask a member a  question?15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	No.16 MS. HOLDER:	I’ ll take a17 question.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	If she’ s willing 19 to take it.20 MS. HOLDER:	I’ ll take a21 question.22 MR. RUTHERFORD:	Okay.	I am not 23 that familiar with the process here.	Can you 24 please educate myself and everybody in  the 25 audience. I believe you on your word that you   have 2 
2 not voted for increases and suggested  freezes.3 How is this board structured  then 4 that without fail there are great increases in  an 5 economy where four percent is just  unheard of?	And 6 I mean, are you put at a disadvantage by your   vote?7 MS. HOLDER:	Well, you know,8 it’ s that, definitely and we could have a9 conversation.	But the Rent Guidelines Board is 10 what you see here.	We’ re nine members.	And so as 11 a majority that gets to be able to make the,   you 12 know, determine the increases and some of  the 13 things that follow from here.14 So you have two owner members.  And 15 you spoke to one of the owner members,  Steven 16 Schleider. You have two tenant representatives  and 17 that’ s me and Ronald Languedoc. And then you have 18 five public members.19 MR. RUTHERFORD:	Okay.20 MS. HOLDER:	And we’ re all 21 appointed by the Mayor. And we all have  various 22 terms.	And we get together during the season  to 23 deliberate and go through this whole  process.2425	And I again, appreciate you 

2	participating.34	you.	Thank you.5
MR. RUTHERFORD:	And I appreciate CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And let me 
6 follow up to that, Adriene.7 The two tenant members and the  two 8 owner members, representatives rather, have their 9 constituencies and their interests and they  are 10 valid 100 percent. And the public members  are 11 basically here to balance between the  two.12 MR. RUTHERFORD:	The scales of 13 justice have been tilted for a long time, in   my 14 opinion, sir.	And I don’ t mean that to be, you 15 know, antagonistic.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Not taken.17 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Can I say 18 something?19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes, sir.20 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Hi, there.	Thank 21 you very much for coming.22 I think another point, I don’ t23 remember if it was you or someone else  said 24 something about behind closed doors.	And I just 25 thought I’ d be useful to address that.6 
2 We don’ t talk behind closed doors 3 in this board. We are covered by what’ s called  the 4 Public Meetings Law.	And so we as a board are  not 5 permitted to speak in any forum other than a   public 6 forum when a meeting that’ s open to the  public.7 So, you know, what you see is what is happening.   I8 can go up to one member of the board and speak   to 9 them privately, but I’ m not permitted by law to  --10 to like convene a private meeting of the  board 11 members.12 So Ms. Holder and I as the  tenant 13 members, we’ re, year after year advocating for a14 rent freeze. And the owner members are  advocating 15 year after year for the highest possible  increases.16 And that’ s -- for better or worse, that’ s the 17 system that we currently have.18 MR. RUTHERFORD:	Okay.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.20 MR. RUTHERFORD:	Thank you.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Once again, is 22 there anybody in the audience who has  not 23 registered who would like to  speak?24 A VOICE:	Can you repeat that?25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I’ m sorry.	I2 
2 said is there anyone in the audience who has  not 3 registered and would like to speak?	We have gone 4 through all of our registered speakers who  are 5 currently here.6 Okay.	As much a I hate to do  it,7 we’ ll take another ten minute recess.8 ( At 5 : 36 p. m., the hearing was 9 temporarily recessed.)10 ( At 6 : 13 p. m., the hearing 11 resumed.)12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	We are 13 back in session.14The next speaker, Pantelis 15Bezanis;16Who will be followed by Elizabeth 17Connelly.18Who will be followed by Trinh Eng.19MR.FREUD:	Mr. Chairman,20with your indulgence,this is Mr. Pantelis Bezanis 21and --22MS.ADAMS:	Your mike’ s not 23on.24MR.FREUD:	It’ s not on?25MS.HOLDER:	No, it’ s on. You just 
2 have to get up on  it.3 MR. FREUD:	Okay. Is this 4 okay?5 We have an owner here,  Mr.6 Bezanis, who does not speak English  very well.	He 7 came down with what I think what is an   interesting 8 case that I would like to just present to   the 9 board.10 Mr. Pantelis Bezanis owns a11 six- family building in Flushing. The building is 12 apparently totally leased to an organization  called 13 Heart Share Human Services of New York. He has  six 14 two- bedroom apartments. The lease is executed with 15 Heart Share Human Services. The average rent in  the 16 building is about $ 1 , 100 a month.17 There are two clients of  this 18 social service agency in each of his  apartments.19 And he came down with a problem, which is not   your 20 problem, which is that he has a lease dated 7 / 15 of 21 ‘ 09 , which has not been renewed.	None of his 22 leases have been renewed.	Although, fortunately 23 his rent is being paid.24 Obviously his costs have gone up.25 I also have here Mr. Bezanis’ survey from the  New 2 
2 York Rent Guidelines Board, if you would like  that,3 Andrew, which indicates that his insurance  costs 4 have gone up, he tells me, even though he  heats 5 with gas, his gas bill is substantially  higher 6 today than it was just a few years  ago.7 But I think the main point of  this 8 particular case is that -- I don’ t know who  Heart 9 Share of New York is. We will try to help him   get 10 his leases renewed.	But the point of this is  that 11 there are many such organizations.	Many of our 12 owners, such as Mr. Bezanis, lease out  their 13 apartments to various types of social  service 14 agencies, whether they are AIDS assistance  groups,15 I’ m not sure what this group is, but there  are 16 dozens of such social service agencies who pay  the 17 rent for their clients.18 So that, in effect, there is  a19 large share of apartments, rent  stabilized 20 apartments in New York where regardless of  what 21 rent increase you approve this year, the tenants  in 22 those apartments do not bear the costs. It’ s a23 subsidized social service cost. And I think  you 24 need to bear in mind when people come up   and 25 testify here or just in general, that there is  this 2 
2 huge amount of funds flowing into the housing  stock 3 not from the tenants, but from social  service 4 agencies.5 But that does not mitigate  the 6 fact that Mr. Bezanis’ costs are going up, his  real 7 estate taxes went up as much as anybody else’ s.8 His water and sewer charges obviously  went up.	And 9 you are not incurring a hardship upon -- you’ re  not 10 imposing a hardship upon any tenant when  you 11 address, in a realistic manner, the real  cost 12 increases that Mr. Bezanis faces.13 Thank you very much.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.15 Freud.16 Thank you, sir.17 Elizabeth Conky.18 MS. CONKY:	Good evening.19 I am just here to -- I was  asked 20 to come and kind of represent my tenants in   my 21 building. I live at 215 West 14 th Street in 22 Manhattan. I’ ve been there over 27 years.23 And I just wanted to talk a  little 24 bit about myth versus fact.	And I think in my 25 case, and in many folks' cases, the myth that  we’ re 2 
2 all paying a very cheap rent.	And, in fact, I  pay 3 more than adequate rent with no services.  Leaking 4 ceilings, my tenants -- nobody responds  to us.	Our 5 supers don’ t respond.	We have leaking ceilings 6 with plaster coming down on our heads. And so  the 7 myth is that we’ re getting these great services 8 when, in fact, we’ re not.9 And I can speak for myself.	I pay 10 more than a fair amount  of rent.	And I just feel 11 that when I get adequate amount of services,  I12 would -- I think that people would be more  than 13 happy and understand that there would have to be  a14 rent increase. But I think that we have to  consider 15 services need to be improved.16 So I don’ t have too much more to 17 say.	I just was mentioning also that we do   most 18 of, I have done a tremendous amount of work in   my 19 apartment, but I don’ t do plumbing and I don’ t do 20 electric. And it is really difficult to live like  a21 civilized person.	And I think that people think  we 22 don’ t live properly. And, in fact, I do my best  to 23 try to maintain my apartment.	So I hope that you 24 consider our problems with our  services.25 And like I said, we would be  more 2 
2 than happy, I would to, I understand increases  are 3 inevitable but I think our services have  to 4 improve.5 So I thank you very  much.6 MS. ADAMS:	Question.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 Ms. Adams.9 MS. ADAMS:	Where did you say you 10 live?11 MS. CONKY: I live at 215 West 14 th 12 Street.	I’ ve been there 27 years.	I had a lease 13 up until four years ago and now there was a   new 14 owner and they refuse to give me  a lease.	So I’ m15 actually here with -- I have a letter from the   City 16 that I no longer will get an increase until  they 17 give me a lease.	But I’ m here to represent all the 18 wonderful people in my building.19 MS. ADAMS:	Do you or your 20 neighbors have any reason to think that  your 21 building may be in line to be flipped to a co- op  or 22 condominium?23 MS. CONKY:	Well, we’ ve had much 24 of a scare with the fact that we thought that   they 25 would condemn the building because the owner  had 2 
2 also had many violations and we fought very  hard.3 We formed a little tenant group and we made  some 4 progress.	But we’ re very afraid. You live in fear 5 that you’ re gonna lose your apartment all the time.6 MS. ADAMS:	Yeah.	I asked the 7 question because we’ ve heard from a number of 8 tenants who in the cases where there were  no 9 services, felt that that was -- that was the  case.10 MS. CONKY:	Right.11 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you very much.12 MS. CONKY:	Okay.	Thank you.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.14 Trinh Eng.15 MR. ENG:	Good evening.16 Members of the Rent Guidelines 17 Board, my name is Trinh  Eng.18 I would like to thank you for  the 19 opportunity to speak to you this evening and  tell 20 you why I feel the RGB must approve a   fair 21 guideline this year.22 I have a 16 - unit building in 23 Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. I’ ve been struggling to 24 make ends meet these last 12 months. I’ ve made 25 numerous repairs and improvements to my  building.2 
2 I’ ve put in new windows in some apartments.	I’ ve 3 had to buy three new refrigerators, two new  stoves 4 to replace the ones that were not  working.5 I have a very good  working 6 relationship with my tenants and I’ m always 7 reachable.	And I address all of my  tenants 8 concerns within, you know, a reasonable time  frame.9 This year my property tax  was 10 increased by 13 . 8 percent and I don’ t know what 11 next year will bring. But my guess would  be 12 probably more of the same.13 In July I’ m facing a 12 . 9 percent 14 increase in my water and sewer rate that  was 15 approved by the New York City  Water Board.	And 16 they project that that rate will increase  by 17 another 11 . 5 percent in July of 2011 . This is the 18 fourth consecutive rate, double digit increase  to 19 the water rate.20 In addition to these fixed  costs,21 there’ s always unexpected costs that come up.	For 22 example, my boiler and hot water heater broke  down 23 in January and I had to spend thousands of  dollars 24 repairing it. I have to use my own savings to   make 25 these repairs.2 
2 You know, in addition to that,  I3 would like to replace the broken sidewalk  around 4 the building, but I can’ t. I can’ t do that, simply 5 because I do not generate enough income to  cover 6 those costs. So I cannot continue to improve  the 7 quality of my building without a fair  guideline 8 increase this year.9 I realize that this is  tough 10 economy and, you know, it’ s a tough time. But  it 11 affects everyone. It affects me as well as  my 12 tenants. And it’ s not fair for me to bear  the 13 burdens of the increasing taxes and operating  costs 14 all alone.15 Now, I have five units that  are 16 renting below $ 1 , 000 . And those units don’ t even 17 cover their operating cost. So, you know, these  are 18 tough times for everyone but, you know, if  small 19 owners are driven out of the business, there’ ll be 20 a serious deterioration to the community  and 21 affordable housing stock in New York  City.22 So I thank you again for  the 23 opportunity to present my case and I urge you   to 24 please vote for a fair guideline  increase.25 Thank you.2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.3 Ms. Eng, are all of the 16  units 4 in your building stabilized?5 MS. ENG:	Yes, they are.6 MS. ADAMS:	When did you purchase 7 the building?8 MS. ENG:	Eighteen months ago.9 MS. ADAMS:	Eighteen months ago?10 MS. ENG:	Correct.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.12 MS. ENG:	Thank you.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yarrow 14 Willman- Cole.15 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	Hi. I just 16 wanted to make a point that Ms. Conky is an   SRO 17 tenant. She didn’ t maybe really clarify that.18 So -- but my name’ s Yarrow 19 Willman- Cole. And I’ m a tenant organizer with 20 Goddard Riverside SRO Law Project.	I’ m wearing the 21 Tenants and Neighbors shirt, because I  support 22 their work.23 We want to thank the board  for 24 voting a zero percent increase for SRO tenants  for 25 2009 - 2010 . The SRO -- the zero percent increase was 2 
2 really a great relief to the population  --3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I’ m going to 4 have to ask you to slow  down.5 MS. WILLMAN- COLE: You really have 6 to ask me to do  that?7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I can’ t8 understand a word.9 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	You can 10 understand.	You can understand.	Just concentrate.11 ( Laughter.)12 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	Many SRO 13 tenants -- now you gotta give me ten extra  seconds.14 Many SRO tenants are on limited and fixed  incomes 15 and didn’ t receive any increase in their Social 16 Security checks at all.17 So to be clear --18 MS. ADAMS:	We really can’ t19 understand you.20 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	To be clear, to 21 be clear, to be clear for those you who  are 22 unaware, SRO buildings often have a high volume  of 23 small units and tenants have bathrooms and  kitchens 24 in the hallways for common  use.25 More than ever in my four years  of 2 
2 the Law Project, I received an increasing number  of 3 phone calls from people desperate to  find 4 affordable housing and hoping that our office  can 5 assist them in locating an affordable  SRO.6 Unfortunately, we’ ve not been able 7 to point tenants to any SRO that is renting  rooms 8 to New Yorkers for a number of years. If we   could 9 direct them to an SRO building that is  still 10 renting to tenants, I would actually consider  an 11 SRO landlord’ s request for an increase from the 12 board is perhaps reasonable.13 But the reality of the  situation 14 for SRO landlords is that in their quest  to 15 maximize profits, they’ ve looked towards other 16 forms of making money. So a great number of   SROs 17 are renting to tourists. Despite their  Certificate 18 of Occupancy or their fire safety systems  not 19 permitting these kinds of rentals, they’ re using a20 loophole to continue to make enormous revenue  from 21 nightly rentals.22 For an example, one recently 23 converted SRO at 201 West 87 th Street called Pink 24 on the City, misleadingly caters to all  female 25 tourists	Yes, there are male permanent SRO   tenants 2 
2 still in residence, but they charge up to  eight 3 tourists $ 35 a night, a profit of $ 280 . A permanent 4 tenant in this building pays a monthly rent  of 5 around 430 . When the landlord looks at converting a6 hotel, they convince tenants to change rooms,  take 7 cheap buyouts and actually have greatly  compromised 8 services.9 In 2008 the landlord of  this 10 building took the 4 . 5 percent increase granted by 11 the RGB. Although they were at the  time 12 warehousing a number of units, it was  virtually 13 impossible for tenants to successfully argue  that 14 the building fit within the 85 percent  proviso.15 Therefore, a number of tenants, one of whom was  a16 taxi driver who had lost his job due to an   injury,17 ended up in Housing Court fighting a non- payment 18 cases looking for ways to pay the  rent.19 Did the landlord in this  building 20 care about the four percent increase or even  want 21 it?	Roughly $ 20 a month more from this one  tenant.22 No. Very clearly, they wanted the tenant to  be 23 evicted so they could make way for a much  more 24 profitable illegal hotel operation.25 Furthermore, landlords also 2 
2 supplement their tourist rental practice by 3 renting rooms to the City, DHS, HRA and HPD,  for 4 a total of $ 2 , 500 a month sometimes.	This is 5 something that usually we’ re able to stop after a6 few months of advocacy, but often landlords  never 7 really intended to rent for long periods of  time 8 this way anyways, just until the tourist  season 9 picked back up.10 Additionally, landlords make 11 profit by renting to students at a much higher  rate 12 than the legal registered rent. Students stay for  a13 short period of time and aren’ t up for a fight  in 14 complaining about their overcharges to the  DHCR.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I hate to ask 16 you to wrap it up, because I don’ t know how  much 17 faster you can go.18 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	No problem.19 MS. ADAMS:	That’ s why she was 20 talking fast.21 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	So landlords 22 have found renting to students not very risky  for 23 them and actually very profitable.	So these are 24 only a few of the ways that SRO landlords  make 25 money and they’ re not limited to these alternatives 2 
2 and they often will warehouse their buildings  so 3 that they can sell them for a considerable  profit 4 or try to convert them.5 So SRO landlords this year do  not 6 deserve any increase from their permanent  rent 7 stabilized tenant rents. And to grant  SRO 8 landlords an increase for any perceived lack  of 9 profits, when in reality SROs are very  profitable 10 enterprise, only imposes increases on those  tenants 11 who can least afford to pay increased rents  and 12 this would be unjust and misguided.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: Do you have  a14 copy of that?15 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	No.	Sorry.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEl:	Okay.17 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	It’ s really 18 illegible, but if I can get you a better copy,   I19 will e- mail it to you guys; is that all  right?20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	That would be 21 fine.22 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	All right.23 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Holder.25 MS. HOLDER:	So just tell me how 2 
2 many SRO, you know, rent regulated  permanent 3 tenants are there left in New York  City?4 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	Oh, I would 5 love to know that. The number is  obviously 6 dwindling every year. I mean our office is  seeing 7 an increased number of cases for tenants that  are 8 being brought to court. And like I said,  since 9 about 2005 no SRO landlord is actually renting  to 10 any New Yorker. In some cases these illegal  hotel 11 operations deny the right for anybody coming  in 12 with a New York State ID, because they fear,  I13 think, that a tenant -- a person would try  to 14 become a tenant.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Excuse me.	That 16 was an answer to that question?	I tried 17 concentrating.	I mean I took  --18 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	Are you 19 insulting me?20 MR. SCHLEIDER: -- that 21 admonishment to heart.22 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	Because I feel 23 that’ s insulting.	Would you like me to answer  the 24 question another way?25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I believe the 2 
2 question was, do you know many SRO tenants  there 3 were.4 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	I said I do  not 5 know, but it’ s dwindling.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	That part 7 I understood.	I just didn’ t understand the rest of 8 your answer.9 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	Okay.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I’ m sorry.11 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	I’ m sorry you 12 didn’ t.13 MS. HOLDER:	So, Steve, just let 14 me finish and you can ask her some  questions.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Sure.16 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.	Great.17 So you were saying that  the 18 numbers are dwindling.	You’ ve been saying -- and 19 you also said that you don’ t know of any  owner 20 right now that is renting like exclusively  to 21 permanent residents, tenants?22 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	Uh- hum.23 MS. HOLDER:	What are the range of 24 rents that you’ re seeing in the units that come 25 into your office?2 
2 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	You mean the 3 long term permanent tenants?4 MS. HOLDER:	Um- hum.5 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	I mean we do 6 see all sorts of rents that  tenants pay.	I mean,7 it’ s surprising for a tenant that doesn’ t have 8 their own bathroom that they’ re going to be paying 9 a rent of $ 800 or $ 900 . I know in one building some 10 of the students are paying up to $ 1 , 500 .	And of 11 course, this is a completely illegal rent, but  they 12 aren’ t -- like I said, in my testimony rather 13 quickly, they aren’ t really interested in fighting 14 to try to get their rents lowered. But we do see   a15 lot of tenants paying upwards of $ 800 .16 MS. HOLDER:	And what services are 17 provided and what do the units look  like?18 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	Well, just to 19 be clear, I mean, we’ re talking about mostly SROs 20 that are owned by private landlords. There are  SROs 21 that are run by non- profits and that’ s an 22 exception, of course, to everything that I spoke  on 23 today. But SRO, private SRO landlords often do  not 24 provide any services to their SRO  tenants.25 In some cases a tenant did move  in 2 
2 with furnished quarters and so that is a   service 3 that essentially the landlords will provide for  the 4 tenants. In some cases they have beds when  they 5 moved in.	Well, then usually they moved in  like 6 more than six or seven years ago, if not longer   so.7 Currently they don’ t offer services.8 MS. HOLDER:	What kind of 9 services are SROs usually obligated to  provide?10 MS. WILLMAN- COLE: I mean -- I’ m11 not sure, I guess, they aren’ t -- so there’ s12 different types of SROs.13 MS. HOLDER:	Right.14 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	So the 15 non- profit SRO do provide some services. Those that 16 have mentally ill tenants or tenants that have  been 17 placed from the shelter system, they do  provide 18 those tenants services.	But their rents are not 19 based on any RGB increase. So they’ re kind of  off 20 the table for this discussion. But as far  as 21 private landlords running SROs, there are no  real 22 services that they provide beyond just  maintaining 23 the building, if they even do  that.24 MS. HOLDER:	And how large are the 25 units typically?2 
2 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	Gosh, I’ m not 3 good with numbers, but 13 by 8 , very small. That’ s4 usually, I think, the average size.	Most SRO units 5 can legally allow two tenants and no more. And  in 6 some cases, they’ re big enough for just one tenant.7 MS. HOLDER: And what are  the 8 conditions of a lot of these  units?9 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	Well, they’ re 10 quite -- in some cases, they’ re quite bad.	And 11 some of these buildings where they’ re doing 12 simultaneous tourist use, they have 13 maintained like the areas where the tourists  are 14 staying. And the quality for where the tenants  are 15 staying, which is sometimes very separate, they’ ll 16 actually push tenants to the back of the  building 17 or to the higher floors.	They don’ t clean.	They 18 don’ t fix.	Electricity will go out in  those 19 sections and they won’ t really do anything where 20 the permanent tenants are residing.21 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider,23 did you want to follow  up?24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The non- shelter 25 services that the non- profit owners of SROs provide 2 
2 -- well, let' s hold that maybe for Thursday.3 Do you know of any SRO  buildings 4 that have sold recently?5 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	Mostly what I’ m6 aware of what is happening is landlords  will 7 contract out to a third party that will start  to 8 rent the rooms and do the tourist  rentals.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No.	That’ s not 10 what I asked.	I said --11 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	That is all 12 I’ m aware of as far as like any change in  ownership 13 or running of the building.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That’ s not a15 change of -- I’ m asking if you know of any  that 16 have been sold.17 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	Again, I’ m not 18 in real estate, so I’ m not really sure.	Like I19 don’ t know.	My side of what I’ ve seen is the 20 person that the tenants will be answering  to 21 changes, right, their management changes ‘ cause the 22 building is run by a  hotel.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But that’ s not 24 necessarily ownership, right?	Okay.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	Thank 2

MR. LANGUEDOC:	I’ d like to ask CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:		Mr. Languedoc. MR. LANGUEDOC:	I’ m sorry.	Do 
7 you know -- does your office work with  tenants 8 where the owner is applying, owner of an SRO  is 9 applying for a Certificate of No  Harassment?10 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	Yeah.	I mean,11 we see an increasing number of SRO landlords  trying 12 to -- actually, in the case of Pink on the   City,13 201 West 87 th Street, they actually got their 14 Certificate of Non Harassment.	They haven’ t15 converted their building. It’ s still an SRO.	The 16 C. Of O. Is still  the same.	But we do see a lot  of 17 SRO owners applying for the Certificate of  Non 18 Harassment to try to convert their  building 19 legally.	And that means it’ s usually lost.	But,20 yeah.21 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And do you have 22 any idea how many units have been lost due  to 23 Certificates of No Harassment being  issued?24 MS. WILLMAN- COLE:	I don’ t have a25 count actually.	It’ s been something that has been 7 
2 hard for us to keep track of because of the   Census 3 has changed, or the New York City vacancy  survey 4 never -- no longer does  SRO counting.	But I can 5 definitely tell you we’ ve seen an upward trend in 6 the number of applications for  CNHs.7 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay. Thanks.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	Thank 9 you.10 Chris Atheneos.11 Good to see you again.12 MR. ATHENEOS:	So good evening,13 members of the Rent Guidelines  Board.14 As many of you know, my name  is 15 Chris Atheneos and I’ m a small owner from Brooklyn,16 operating a family business, operating  several 17 properties in Brooklyn.18 Things are getting much worse for 19 owners and operators of rental buildings in  New 20 York. We’ re getting squeezed every which way and 21 most specifically by the City and  government 22 agencies. We’ re expected to pay increases in our 23 real estate taxes, water, sewer, payroll.	Yet we 24 aren’ t compensated for these increased costs with 25 comparable increases in the annual guideline.2 
2 One of the most unfair  things 3 about the PIOC is that only measures the  increase 4 in a specific cost.	Yet, it doesn’ t measure the 5 frequency of that cost.	For instance, a new 6 building or building built even 20 year ago  does 7 not need to replace pipes in a building as old   as 8 mine, which is 80 years  old.9 Last month, for example, we had  a10 leak in the living room of a first floor  apartment.11 We ended up breaking the walls and the  ceilings 12 from the basement, from the cellar, all the way  up 13 to the top of the third floor bathroom. It’ s on  a14 six- story building, to change all of the hot and 15 cold risers. The job cost $ 5 , 200 and I attached it 16 to my testimony. I haven’ t paid it yet  though.17 So you could see this  for 18 yourself.	This doesn’ t even include closing up all 19 the holes and repainting all these rooms,  the 20 walls, the ceilings, which will probably  add 21 another $ 4 , 000 to the job.	And we only changed the 22 risers halfway up. And this is just one example  of 23 what we face everyday. Some things can be  deferred.24 Some cannot.	Rotted, leaking pipes cannot be 25 deferred.	If we had enough resources, we  would 2 
2 plan on changing the risers on a periodic basis  but 3 we can’ t work like that.4 Unfortunately, we must address 5 issues as they arise. But at some point what do   we 6 do when everything goes at once?	We’ ve postponed 7 our facade repairs long enough. But water leaks  all 8 this past spring have forced us to forego  the 9 patchwork and put up a sidewalk shed and hire  an 10 engineer.	We’ ll spend over $ 20 , 000 before we even 11 take out one lensel or grind one mortar  joint.12 The job is expected to cost  over 13 $ 100 , 000 .	We’ ll have to put a mortgage on the 14 building to pay for this.	But how many mortgages 15 can we put on the building?	How much interest must 16 we pay for this maintenance?17 The Guideline increases don’ t come 18 close to covering this expense and we’ ll still have 19 to put a roof on at  some point.	The lower rent 20 adjustments started to address the inequities  of 21 the clear imbalance in rents in  my buildings.	I22 mean it’ s grossly unfair that some tenants pay $ 600 23 while others pay $ 1 , 200 for the same apartment just 24 because they lived in the building longer. Wouldn’ t25 it be great if we could go to the local   supermarket 2 
2 and pay $ 1 . 25 for a gallon of milk just because we 3 lived in that neighborhood for 30 years. Yet  the 4 poor guy who just moved here from Denver must  pay 5 $ 4 . 99 for that same gallon of milk just because 6 he’ s new in town.	It’ s ludicrous.7 So I urge the board to consider  a8 six percent increase on a one- year renewal and a9 twelve percent increase on a two- year renewal.	But 10 taking note that not all owners are going to  pass 11 the guideline on to their tenants, because  simply 12 in the outer boroughs it just exceeds what  the 13 market will bear.	But it will at least let us  pass 14 this increase along to those long term, low  rent 15 stabilized tenants.16 Thank you.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.18 MR. ATHENEOS:	Okay.	See you 19 next year.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Andrew Latsko.21 MR. LATSKO:	Good evening, board 22 members.23 My name is Andrew Latsko and  thank 24 you for letting me speak to you for the third   year.25 I am manager of properties  in 2 
2 Brooklyn and this is our  family business.	This is 3 our sole source of income that supports  multiple 4 members of my family.5 Last year I stressed for the  board 6 to consider the renewal of the minimum  rent 7 increase and I applaud you for doing so. It was   a8 small step in the right direction with a  system 9 that I feel is broken. And it was discouraging  to 10 see that our courts came out against a system  that 11 has private citizens subsidizing other  private 12 citizens with no just compensation, incentive  or 13 consideration of any kind.14 But last week I was  anticipating 15 being at this meeting and wondering what I  wanted 16 to convey and say to the board. And we   were 17 working in a hallway at the time and we   were 18 painting the hallway, the entry doors and  the 19 hallway in the building. This was not the  mandate 20 of any City agency or anything like that,  just 21 because we take pride in the building that we  put 22 our name on and our tenants come home to   every 23 night.24 And -- excuse me. While I  was 25 standing there, I was looking at the frame that’ s2 
2 on the wall in the hallway that we’ re required  to 3 mount there. And that’ s for HPD or any other  City 4 agency coming to make an inspection of  the 5 building.	They put the little yellow card in  there 6 with a notation of that inspection on that  day.7 And notice, I just said the frame, because  our 8 frame there has no card in it, because of the   fact 9 that we have never had any HDP inspections that  our 10 tenants have called for at the building. Nor do  we 11 have any violations on this building and nor do  we 12 have any violations on any other building that  I13 manage.14 My question is, why is there  still 15 a system where these tenants can come up  here,16 stress these horrible living conditions that 17 they’ re living under and somebody like me who is 18 really in the classification of a Class A   Building,19 as it should be, and we’ re all kind of paired  into 20 one system year after year after year after  year.21 And that’ s a question I have for the  board.22 And it made me think, what is  the 23 breaking point?	What stops us from doing just  the 24 bare minimum to satisfy the City agencies  that 25 oversee us?	Is the City relying on just the  pride 2 
2 and the good work ethic of the few to keep   carrying 3 the day here?	I know that as a landlord and  a4 manager I wouldn’ t be able to sleep if I knew  some 5 of my tenants were coming here and telling some  of 6 the stories that these people are.	What happens 7 when people like me just doze off and get to   sleep 8 eventually?9 There are many of us who  are 10 considered to do all the right things by  our 11 tenants and by the City. But we’ re still saddled 12 with tenants that are stabilized at archaic  rents 13 that are absolutely absurd. And with other  tenants 14 who are at market rents, we’ re given very limited 15 options when our expenses are going up to  balance 16 that out.17 So for those of us who  facilitate 18 the availability of clean, well maintained,  warm 19 and safe rental housing for a living, we rely  on 20 you to provide good increase guidelines year  after 21 year to keep us going.	We’ re a vital part of this 22 City and we’ re an asset.23 Thank you.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25 MR. SCHELIDER:	Beautifully put.2 
2CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Liz Gardner;3Followed by Greg Bronner;4Followed by Dawn Jones.5MS. GARDNER:	Hi.	Did you all 6get acopy of my testimony?7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I’ m sorry?8 MS. GARDNER:	I provided copies.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Absolutely.10 MS. GARDNER:	You got it?11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	No, no.	But 12 you can provide it.13 MS. GARDNER:	I did.	Outside.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Oh, outside.15 Okay, then we’ ll have it.16 MS. GARDNER:	Okay.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	We don’ t have 18 it now.19 MS. GARDNER:	On the front of my 20 testimony I have Article 25 of the  Universal 21 Declaration of Human Rights.	And it states,22 everyone has the right to a standard of  living 23 adequate for the health and well being of  himself 24 and of his family, including food,  clothing,25 housing and medical care. Then it goes on.  But 7 
2 that’ s the way I’ d like to start out tonight.3 Ladies and gentlemen, my name  is 4 Elizabeth Gardner and I’ m a tenant at Van  Buren 5 Apartments in Sunnyside, Queens, owned by  Bronstein 6 Properties.	My address is 47 - 21 41 st Street,7 Apartment 5 J.8 My rent has risen 38 percent  in 9 the last eight years -- oh, my unit is  rent 10 stabilized.	My rent has risen 38 percent in  the 11 last eight years because of your Rent  Guidelines 12 Board increases on top of two fraudulent  MCI 13 increases applied for by my landlord  Bronstein.14 My building is litigation over  the 15 fraudulent MCI increases which New York  legislation 16 permits the landlord to collect even though  tenants 17 have challenged them and even though the amounts  in 18 question bring the level of the fraud to a   felony.19 Why are MCI increases never considered when  you 20 vote?21 I’ m a legal secretary at a22 prestigious international law firm on Park  Avenue.23 When I first took my rent stabilized apartment,  I24 used to work a fair amount of overtime. Now  I’ m25 happy to have a  job.2 
2 When I first took the apartment,  I3 looked forward to raises of 3 . 5 to 4 percent.	But 4 for the last two years staff where I work  have 5 received no raise. And when we finally did  receive 6 a raise this month, the highest given was  two 7 percent on June 2008 numbers. So my income  has 8 remained virtually the same for five years. And I’ m9 in a good profession.10 But I’ m not here to sing sad 11 songs.	I am here because I am angry and  disgusted.12 Our Federal Government declines to deal  with 13 political terrorists. I say as tenants, we  should 14 not participate in a process with people  influenced 15 by landlords who also threaten us at our homes  but 16 in this much more insidious  way.17 I decry this board’ s callousness 18 in voting increases to the poor and middle  class,19 when everywhere in New York City people  are 20 suffering economically and people like Joe  Bruno,21 Hiram Monserrat and that also soon- to- be- indicted 22 criminal, Pedro Espada, people like them, and  you 23 on the board, are slowly destroying our homes,  our 24 neighborhoods --25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Gardner, if 2 
2 you could wrap it up.3 MS. GARDNER:	I am here to  ask 4 the two tenant representatives, Mr. Languedoc  and 5 Ms. Holder to boycott this board, to say no to   its 6 biased futile process and step down. Perhaps if  you 7 did, and if all tenant advocates refused  to 8 participate in this board, this ill- conceived body 9 would be disbanded.	Perhaps the dead silence from 10 tenants would force a democratic change for  all 11 time and how rent increases for rent  regulated 12 apartments in New York City are decided and  how.13 If you step down and if  alternates 14 refuse to participate in this process, then  no 15 longer could any of your colleagues or the  Mayor,16 our legislators or the Governor, pretend that  the 17 Rent Guidelines Board is fair and just. They  would 18 have no basis upon which to maintain the  pretense 19 that the votes you take are for the greatest  good 20 for the greatest number.21 And I’ d like to end tonight with a22 quote from Barbara Buhler of the New York  City 23 Department of Planning.	The only reason 24 homelessness exists in a land so rich with  natural 25 resources is because a person’ s need for a home  is 2 
2seen as ameans of someone else making a  profit.3Thank you.4CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.5MS. LEVINE:	Just one comment.6CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Levine.7 MS. LEVINE:	I’ m really -- I8 really don’ t even know what to say because we  sit 9 here under statute that requires us to come up  with 10 a number.	I’ m just curious as to whether you’ ve 11 spoken to your elected representatives with  the 12 same anger and with the same passion as you have   to 13 the members of this board accusing us of  being 14 political terrorists.15 MS. GARDNER:	I certainly have on 16 many occasions.17 MS. LEVINE:	When our only, our 18 only job is to come up with a number after we   weigh 19 an enormous amount of evidence and to try and  come 20 up with some kind of fair procedure. We are  not 21 responsible for the economic situation that all  New 22 Yorkers and the rest of the country find  themselves 23 in.	We only have to weigh the evidence in front    of 24 us.25 The statute, which you --  is 7 
2 flawed in that it does provide for a one size   fits 3 all treatment of all tenants, of all  rent 4 stabilized tenants.	And there’ s very little that 5 we can do about it.6 So you’ re clearly a highly 7 intelligent, well- spoken person working in a law 8 firm.	Please look at the statute.	Please look at 9 -- please consult with the people that you  work 10 with and perhaps come up with a better plan  for 11 Albany and for the City Council to protect  people 12 in all situations.13 But asking to shift the burden 14 onto landlords and calling us a bunch of  political 15 terrorists is really not a viable  solution.16 MS. GARDNER: I really shifted  the 17 burden onto landlords.	And I have to disagree  with 18 you. There is something you can do. You can  vote 19 zero.	You can vote zero.20 ( Applause.)21 MS. GARDNER:	You do not have to 22 vote an increase.23 MS. LEVINE:	Again, as the City 24 Council increases real estate taxes and water  and 25 sewer rents and, you know, the landlords had  the 2 
2 same burdens as all New York City  residents.3 MS. GARDNER: I disagree.	I4 disagree with my whole heart and  soul.5 MS. LEVINE:	Okay.	And have you 6 sat and --7 MS. GARDNER:	There is no -- there 8 is no statute in our law anywhere and there is   no 9 court that ever said that a landlord has to make   a10 minimum of 10 or 15 percent a year. And   if 11 landlords want to make 10 or 15 percent a year,   why 12 don’ t they go and invest in a hedge fund  or 13 somebody like Bernie Madoff, because those are  the 14 types of the returns that he  guaranteed.15 You shouldn’ t be expecting to make 16 your God damn profits off of us who are  middle 17 class and poor people just trying to get  along.18 And you can vote zero.	You can speak.19 ( Applause.)20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.21 Greg Bronner.22 MR. BRONNER:	Good evening.	I23 hope that my testimony was provided to you  in 24 advance.	I have a brief  presentation.25 My wife and I own two  apartments 2 
2 that are rent stabilized.	That’ s it. They’ re both 3 in Brooklyn at 11 Schermerhorn Street. No. 2 E  is 4 occupied by John since 1978 .	He pays a rent of 5 $ 813 a month.	4 E is occupied by Mike since 1972 .6 He was paying $ 661 . 50 .7 The maintenance on these is,  you 8 know, very high.	It’ s $ 676 . 64 for the first one 9 and $ 575 . 13 for the second one.	Our gross profit 10 on the entire collection of apartments, that  was 11 about $ 2 , 000 , a little more.	That’ s before we 12 actually paid for things like the plumbing and  the 13 toilets, and the fact that we had to replace  the 14 appliances.	And that also is before we  actually 15 had to pay financing.	And that also ignores the 16 fact that we did no maintenance that we did  not 17 have to do this year.	So we lost about $ 13 , 000 18 this year.19 That’ s unavoidable.	The co- op 20 maintenance costs are basically, over half of it  is 21 taxes and utilities.	The rest of it is  financing 22 for things like the new roof that  they did.	And 23 the rest is actual repairs on the building, as  well 24 as, you know, basic things like trash pickup  and 25 washing of the hallways.2 
2 All this stuff is built in.	I3 can’ t do anything about it. It’ s got, you know, the 4 assessments are going up as other people’ s5 apartment buildings get more destabilized.	My 6 taxes go up. I can’ t control this.7 We have no fat in our budget  at 8 all.	We do all the  work ourselves.	We don’ t -- I9 prepared all this on a free operating  system.10 There’ s nothing left to cut. I even like meter  out 11 the stamps and sometimes I walk over to save a   buck 12 on stamps.13 Over the last 24 years, and  I14 actually looked at all the financial  statements,15 inflation has been about 2 . 95 percent. Our rents 16 have been 2 . 95 percent as well but only because of 17 the last fixed dollar amount increases in the  last 18 couple of years.	Before that they were tracking 19 well below inflation. And the recent court  decision 20 may mean that we have to give a lot of that   back.21 The co- op has announced to 6 to 822 percent increases from now for several years to  pay 23 for the new roof.24 And over the last 24 years  taxes 25 have gone up much faster than inflation than  water 2 
2 and sewer have also gone up much faster  than 3 inflation.	We have nothing left.	Now, when a4 tenant gets in trouble -- and by the way, both   of 5 our tenants’ apartments are 700 square feet in  an 6 elevator building. They’ re affordable on minimum 7 wage for two people. You know, not easy, but  they 8 could do it.9 If a tenant has trouble, they  have 10 SCRIE, they have DRIE.	They have -- you know,  if 11 you get really in trouble there’ s a program  for 12 one- off rental assistance.	You can ask your 13 landlord for a preferential rent.	You could get a14 roommate.	You could move to a cheaper apartment  or 15 you could get another job if you’ re capable of 16 working.	But at- risk landlords like us have 17 nothing.	Can’ t get an MCI for the co- op because 18 J 51 and if a co- op uses its reserved fund, you 19 can’ t get it.	It takes years.	I tried. I gave  up.20 Can’ t get hardship.	That’ s21 explicitly prohibited. I can’ t subdivide the 22 apartment into two and rent it twice and I can   rent 23 it for 12 hours at a  time.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Please wrap it 25 up.2 
2 MR. BRONNER:	And I can’ t get 3 financing.	So I’ m asking you, long term tenants 4 have gotten an excessively good deal.	We need a5 fixed dollar amount for everyone because this  will 6 disproportionately help the low- cost apartments and 7 it needs to be greater than  inflation.8 So I’ m asking you for $ 100 for 9 everyone.10 Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.12 Mr. Bronner, I remember your 13 testimony from here last year.	Refresh my memory,14 did you buy these two apartments as  investment?15 MR. BRONNER:	We hoped to move 16 into them.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	How long have 18 you owned them?19 MR. BRONNER:	About two and a20 half years but it’ s not affordable.	I can’ t sell 21 them.	No other landlord can make money on  them 22 either.23 MS. ADAMS:	Were they 24 stabilized when you bought them?25 MR. BRONNER:	Yeah.	They’ re 2 
2 actually purchased at a price lower than it was  25 3 years ago. They’ ve actually lost money.	The last 4 guy who owned them for 25 years lost money  in 5 capital because the rents are so  low.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.7 Dawn Jones.8 MS. JONES:	Good evening.	My 9 name is Dawn Jones. And I reside at 10 West  135 th 10 Street, the best address, as stated by the  late 11 Honorable Percy Sutton, his former residence,  in 12 the Village of Harlem.13 I would love to stay at  my 14 residence because the proximity to the rich  culture 15 and the culture institutions in  my vicinity.	My 16 own personal situation is both of my parents  are 17 deceased. Our home in Teaneck, New Jersey went  into 18 foreclosure.19 The reason I’ m testifying is this 20 has been a hardship for me. I’ ve applied for  three 21 Mitchell Lama Co- ops where there are high 22 application fees and waiting lists of five to  seven 23 years.	I was turned down for homeownership due  to 24 insufficient income.	I’ m letting the board know 25 I’ m paying a high percentage of my income for  rent,2 
2 $ 1 , 068 . 90 , after I pay the essential bills,3 apartment insurance $ 773 , Con Edison with level 4 billing $ 81 , this has gone up, Time Warner basic 5 cable $ 91 . 91 , Verizon, with no long distance,6 $ 43 . 87 , health insurance $ 420 . 06 , transportation 7 Transit Check $ 41 . 08 , union dues, DC 37 , Local 371 ,8 $ 34 . 48 .	I come home -- I make $ 1 , 085 every two 9 weeks so you can do the  math.10 I cannot feed myself with  this 11 amount left over.	I cannot afford another rent 12 increase.	I have been working for the City  for 13 twenty years. My overtime wages have been  reduced 14 in the past year due to compressed  overtime.15 My landlord is trying to  displace 16 our tenants.	Our building has received an  MCI,17 Major Capital Improvement rent increase. This  is 18 fraudulent because tenants should ( sic) have to pay 19 for a necessity like functional windows.	As a20 result my rent is $ 200 behind.21 There are problems in our  building 22 such as bathroom overflows when we take a shower.  I23 have kept the bathroom door open when I take  a24 shower.	The walls behind the shower are  cracking.25 There is pest infestation of roaches and  some 2 
2 apartments are experiencing bed bugs.3 The owner harasses me and  my 4 neighbors by knocking on our staircase and  our 5 doors in the middle of the evening. I’ ve been 6 forced to sleep in the living room. They  harass 7 other tenants, especially seniors.	There are many 8 apartments in our building that have already  been 9 decontrolled and there are only a few  rent 10 regulated tenants left struggling to stay in  their 11 homes.12 The new tenants are paying  market 13 rent.	I testified last year about the  concrete 14 details of the filing eviction of working people  I15 know personally in Harlem to prove  my point.	A16 guidance counselor, a Harlem hospital worker  and 17 photographer, teacher, a human resource 18 administration retired manager and HRA  supervisor;19 her telephone is disconnected. And a worker  from 20 the former Manhattan Borough President’ s office.21 She’ s died of malnutrition.22 I have even showed you all  my 23 non- selection letters from jobs I have applied.24 Once again, please consider these individuals  as 25 well as myself when making  our decision.	You are 2 

2	killing us.3456
Thank you for listening. CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.William Clark.Again, if there anyone in  the 
7 audience that hasn’ t signed up outside, please do.8 MR. CLARK:	Hi.	Thanks for 9 letting me come down.10 My name is William Clark.	I guess 11 I wear a number of different hats ‘ cause I  manage 12 properties for a living which I don’ t own.	All of 13 them are -- all the rentals are  ostensibly 14 stabilized, although I think only one apartment  is 15 left that were stabilization matters at  all.16 And I own two apartments that  I17 rent out.	And then though I should probably  thank 18 you guys for squeezing the market so tightly  that 19 I’ m able to make more money on those than  I20 normally would be able to.21 But what I really want to  talk 22 about is taxes.	One of the buildings I  manage 23 downtown, this year’ s tax bill will be $ 722 , 936 .24 That’ s 82 units available for rent. If you do  the 25 math, that means that everybody in that  building 7 
2 pays $ 725 a month in property taxes before I  turn 3 the lights on, before I heat it, before I pay   my 4 super, before I clean it, before I do  anything,5 $ 725 a month from each person going straight to  the 6 City.7 And you have to wonder where  that 8 money’ s going.	It’ s going to fill in the hole from 9 apartments whose rents are so low that the taxes  on 10 the buildings are ridiculously low also.11 So what we have at this  point 12 between the low rent increases that have been  given 13 out over the years, you’ ve stopped reaching into 14 the landlords’ pockets and picking them clean  and 15 you’ ve reached through to the second half of 16 tenants to make up for the difference. And that  is 17 the problem with this system here is that we have   a18 group of people who are getting an  unconscionably 19 good bargains.	And we have another group of  people 20 who are paying their own rent plus their  neighbors.21 And that’ s why I’ m going to second 22 the gentleman before me and ask for a flat  rent 23 increase for everybody, since obviously the  courts 24 don’ t know a fair solution when they see one,  maybe 25 the appeal will go well. But $ 100 -- if you take  a2 
2 $ 2 , 000 apartment, a six percent increase on that’ s3 120 bucks. Somebody is paying for $ 400 , which I4 have somebody in the building I live in pays   for 5 $ 400 a month for a two bedroom, I think that  they 6 can handle a little bit more than a $ 24  increase.7 So $ 120 for everybody.	No one in 8 the any of the buildings that I manage is going   to 9 get a $ 120 increase this year, because they’ re all 10 on preferential rents and I get as much as   the 11 market will bear. I’ m going to raise the legal 12 rent.	I have legal rents on one bedrooms  at 13 $ 6 , 000 .	We’ re never gonna get that.	I don’ t even 14 want it.15 But the preferential rents that  we 16 have prove that the market works, that you can  have 17 a stable market and housing that people want to  pay 18 for. But right now we’ ve developed a system whereby 19 we just overtax the living daylights out of  rental 20 property and then they use you guys to --   the 21 politicians unfortunately use you guys to  shield 22 them from the consequences of their  actions.23 So that’ s my time.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25 ( Applause.)2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	As of this 3 point, we have no other speakers so we will  take 4 another break.5 ( At 7 : 00 p. m., the hearing was 6 temporarily recessed.)7 ( At 7 : 30 p. m., the hearing was 8 resumed.)9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	We will 10 resume the hearing.11 Cono Mazza;12 Followed by Michael Mazza.13 MR. MAZZA:	Good evening.	My name 14 is Cono Mazza.	I’ m here with my brother.15 We own a six- family house in 16 Greenpoint.	And throughout the years, you know,  we 17 tried to maintain a clean,  liveable building.	But 18 with the high cost of real estate taxes,  water,19 sewer charges, heating oil and -- it’ s getting a20 little bit harder for us to maintain the  building.21 You know, two to four  percent 22 increase for one year and whatever the  other 23 percentage is, I don’ t think it’ s enough.	I mean,24 we’ re struggling to maintain this building, you 25 know, and we cannot raise whatever we want, so  we 2 
2 have to ask you guys to give us a   little help.	You 3 know, it’ s very hard to maintain a six- family 4 building, you know.	I mean, everybody’ s5 struggling, you know.	So I mean, we would like  to 6 give whatever we, you know, could on the  rent 7 increases.8 My brother is here also.	I don’ t9 know what he wants to say.	We have, you know,10 tenants that they pay less than $ 700 , you know.	We 11 cannot maintain, you know, a building that  tenants 12 pay $ 700 .	We have, you know, we have expenses,  you 13 know, forget it.	It’ s incredible, you know.	And 14 tenants complain that two percent, four percent  is 15 a lot. It doesn’ t even cover the surface of  the 16 bills that we have.17 Now, this is ridiculous.	Every 18 year we go through this.	This is the first time 19 that I -- I came over here,  you know.	And I don’ t20 see no other landlords or whatever, you know,  but 21 it’ s ridiculous, you know.22 We have to put up with all  the 23 buildings that they’ re building in our 24 neighborhood.	I live -- you know, we have to  build 25 in Greenpoint.	You know, they’ re building 2 
2 skyscrapers and they get like $ 3 , 000 , $ 4 , 000 rent.3 And we’ re trying to get like to two to four  percent 4 increase and we can’ t even get that.	This is 5 ridiculous.	You know, Mayor Bloomberg has got  to 6 do something about this. This is  ridiculous.7 So I asking you to, you know,  try 8 to get the best for the landlord, you know. I   know 9 it’ s a tough time for everybody, you know.	But,10 you know, always, you know, it seems like  the 11 tenant always got the rights.	I think they got 12 more rights as a landlord,  you know.	Forget it.13 It’ s ridiculous. You know, they don’ t see you and 14 what our expenses are.	They only look at how  much 15 rent they pay.	All right?16 We had a tenant that, you know,  he 17 moved out.	He trashed the whole apartment.	Okay?18 We had to fix the apartment.	It cost us $ 6 , 000 to 19 fix the apartment to put it in, you know, in use   to 20 rent it out.	And we couldn’ t even get in touch 21 with the guy because he moved out in the middle   of 22 the night.23 So this is ridiculous, you  know,24 two percent, four percent, you know, it’ s25 ridiculous, you know.	Even if it was 10  percent 2 
2 increase, we would never be happy, you  know,3 because it’ s a lot of -- you know, it’ s a lot  of 4 bills that we have.5 Thank you very much.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Mazza,--7 MR. CONO MAZZA:	Yes.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	-- are all of 9 your units stabilized?10 MR. CONO MAZZA:	One is -- as a11 matter of fact, one became exempt  permanently,12 because my mother used to  live there.	And, you 13 know, she passed away so that was owner, you  know,14 owner occupied apartment.	So that’ s the only one 15 that is, you know, not stabilized.	All the 16 other --17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And what’ s the 18 rent on that apartment?19 MR. CONO MAZZA:	Right now we gave 20 them a preferential rent.	Okay?	Because, you 21 know, we want to -- because we competing with  this 22 big buildings in our neighborhood.	Because, you 23 know, we have to get whatever we can,  you know.	So 24 we gave him like preferential rate for $ 1 , 700 . So,25 you know, it’ s not bad, you know, but it’ s not 2 
2 enough to maintain the building, you  know.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And what would 4 you like to see as an  increase?5 MR. CONO MAZZA:	Well, I want it 6 to be fair, you know.	I mean you know, I feel  --7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	We know.	We 8 need a number.	What do you think?9 MR. CONO MAZZA:	Well, now is 10 the proposal two to four for one year and four   to 11 six for two years?12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Two years,13 right?14 MR. CONO MAZZA:	Two years,15 right.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes.17 MR. CONO MAZZA:	And I think four 18 percent is not much, you know, and for one  year.19 Two years, you know, I think five percent is   fair,20 you know.	I mean I feel that, you  know,21 everybody’ s struggling, you know.	But they have to 22 look at it, you know, on the landlord side  also,23 you know.	That’ s what we want.	We want a fair 24 share of, you know, whatever’ s coming to us.25 You know, sometimes they don’ t pay 2 
2 the rent, you know, so we have to take them   to 3 court to get them out.	So it’ s more money coming 4 out of our pocket. So who owns the building,  the 5 DHCR, you know, the City of New York, or we, as   the 6 landlord?	I don’ t think we own the houses anymore,7 the buildings.	The City owns it because they  tell 8 us what to do.	We’ re not the landlords anymore.	I9 don’ t feel like I’ m the landlord.	I collect the 10 rent, but I don’ t feel like I’ m the landlord.	Me 11 and my brother over there.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 Any other?	Thank you, sir.14 MR. CONO MAZZA:	Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Michael Mazza.16 MR. MICHAEL MAZZA:	Good evening.17 Just go according to my  brother 18 says, because he takes care of the building,  which 19 I’ m the partner.	And I’ m the one that also got to 20 come up with money just when the building is  gonna 21 be new payments and which also tenants they’ re 22 moving out, like he says, and they destroyed  the 23 apartments.24 So I will say, you know, that I   go 25 along with my brother because I know when we   going 2 
2 broke.	So pretty much I think that the  percentage,3 you know, it should be fair.	So I guess, I don’ t4 know what my brother says, five percent for,  you 5 know, for one year.	And I think that pretty  much 6 think it' s good for it, you know.	So I guess it’ s7 all up to, you know, what you guys figure,  you 8 know, what’ s good for the landlord.	So I don’ t9 know what to tell you.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.11 MR. MICHAEL MAZZA:	Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	George Subraj.13 MR. SUBRAJ:	Hi.	Good evening.14 I’ m a owner/ operator rental 15 properties in Queens. And these buildings  are 16 getting older, maintenance, more maintenance 17 required and the cost of such maintenance is  going 18 up.19 Not only the City of New York  has 20 raised their water rates by  fifteen percent.	Many 21 other things, repairs are going up, the cost  of 22 goods are going up.	Insurance is going up. And if 23 they make a raise their taxes by fifteen  percent,24 all I’ m looking for is half of that.	If I can get 25 six percent, seven percent, I’ ll be happy.2 
2 I’ m a hands- on manager. I do from 3 roof to basement.	Yes, I can repair a roof. I  can 4 repair locks.	Paint. I’ m hands on that’ s why I’ m5 able to cut the cost.6 And like one of the gentlemen  said 7 earlier, when you go to court because these  people 8 are not paying their rent because of hard  times,9 the judges just keep giving them more, reward  them 10 by giving them more time and more time, and by   the 11 time it gets to six and eight months -- I had   a12 tenant that ruined my apartment for over 25  months 13 before he was evicted.14 Then they said they cannot put 15 good money behind a bad cause.	When it was six 16 months, it -- whatever is to keep adjourning  in 17 order to show cause, you can get as much as   six 18 orders to show cause. And that comes in around  the 19 holidays and then you have Thanksgiving.	They 20 don’ t evict anymore.21 I had a guy who was supposed to  be 22 evicted and after Thanksgiving they said  because 23 there’ s some kind of moratorium they couldn’ t24 evict.	He’ s still there. This is now June, going 25 on to July.	He still owes me a lot of money,  Maybe 2 
2 about 12 months rent or something like  that.3 I don’ t know what’ s happening with 4 the system.	The system is breaking down. The  court 5 is rewarding people for bad behavior. If the  City 6 is bulging with money, the banks are bulging  with 7 money, if you have five families, six families  --8 those are regulated.	They tell us what we  can 9 charge, two percent or four percent.	They used to 10 do with the guys were bulging  with money.	The oil 11 companies didn’ t want to -- the fuel is $ 2 . 99 , the 12 next day is $ 6 . 00 , not six, five and change, or 13 getting close to there.	Why can’ t I do the same 14 thing?15 They have money they can  probably 16 afford to do what the banks and the big  companies.17 Small landlord, you got a five family house,  you 18 stuck.	Yes, you stuck bearing all this pains  from 19 the tenants who will be rewarded in the  court 20 system that length of time.21 And all I’ m asking for is be fair,22 that what the City is increasing our expenses  by,23 do the same thing.	The tenants that are really 24 doing bad and some are indeed doing bad  or 25 underemployed, they have programs to pick up  for 2 
2 that.	They can get a Section 8 voucher if  anything 3 is still available, the City gives them a one  shot 4 deal and you can go on  and on.	Let them pick up 5 the slack.	Why should I subsidize as a  private 6 entity, subsidize a tenant?	I’ m in this for a7 profit. I need to be successful. I don’ t want  to 8 fail.	I’ m here to succeed.	And with your help,9 maybe I can do that.10 Thank you for this opportunity.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.12 Questions?13 ( No response.)14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	So far we’ ve 15 exhausted the speaker list.16 Registration for anyone that does 17 show up we’ ll stay open until 8 : 00 .18 So we will take another  short 19recess.20( At 7 : 30 p. m., the hearing was 21temporarily recessed.)22( At 8 : 00 p. m., the hearing was 23resumed.)24CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:Okay.We are 25back in session.
