P R O C E E D I N G    SCHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We are going Good morning.My name is Marvin Markus. I  am 
 8 Chair of the New York City Rent Guidelines  Board.9 I' d like to welcome you to one in 10 a series of public hearings and meetings  all 11 designed to meet our statutory requirements  of 12 promulgating an allowable lease increase for  rent 13 stabilized, loft stabilized and hotel  stabilized 14 apartments, which will take effect October 1 , 2008 .15 And the increase of these 16 allowable percentages will remain in effect  to 17 September 30 , 2009 .18 Just another announcement.	I19 think that most people are aware that we will  be 20 here at the Great Hall at Cooper Union at 7   East 21 7 th Street on Thursday, June 19 th, beginning at 22	5 : 30 p. m.23 In addition, for board members,24 the Explanatory Statements, the Draft  Explanatory 25 Statement of Findings to be reported on and  adopted 23 
2 in the final vote, are in your folders. If  anybody 3 would like to make any comments, changes  or 4 additions, you should submit them to  staff.5 With that, I' d like to begin the 6 public hearing.7 The first speaker will be 8 Mr. Anderson.9 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Hello,10 Chairman and Members of the  Board.11 I pronounce increase all the  time.12 You know the taxes never going  to die.	All Bush 13 mentioned for few years and nobody cares, that  the 14 City or the State the year before -- before  meeting 15 a lot of politicians of the City Council, they  just 16 keeping these bums.	They don' t care nothing.	They 17 receive big salary and increase their  salary.18 But you must strike out  business 19 between landlord and tenants.	Not too much to 20 fight.	The majority of tenants, they lie.	But it 21 depends on how you will  vote something.	They can 22 never do nothing.23 They mention Tom Duane.	He' s a24 politician.	They don' t care, all of them.	It' s25 the Governor, Lieutenant Governor and Joe  Bruno,2 
2 and Silver, this Sheldon Silver.3 So let' s see the jury that they 4 take seriously come to raise  the rent.	It went up 5 six and half times in 2002 up to now, six and   a6 half times for fuel cost.7 Tax cannot -- can never go  down.8 And insurance they help to ensure some to raise  the 9 price of insurance so terrorists and  insurance 10 company work together to cut everybody all  the 11 time.12 So we take this very  serious 13 because you are smart people. And for waste all  the 14 time on stupid things, talking with  the tax.	It 15 doesn' t make sense.	Because I feel a few  people 16 who said that nothing goes up.	Let' s freeze the 17 rent to be zero and these people and everybody  they 18 say zero.	I' m sure.19 These are not educated people 20 saying this.	Because they all the working people 21 who are honest, working too much and they  looking 22 for peace.23 Bible says that big man is  not 24 small man, definitely all the time.	That will 25 continue for ever and ever.	But the day we see 2 
2what' sgo on next meeting, vote and take it  easy.3Any questions?4( No response.)5CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No. Thank you,6 Mr. Anderson. Appreciate it.7 Mr. JAMES ANDERSON:	Okay.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	See you next 9 year.10 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Have a nice 11 day and nice night.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.13 Mr. JAMES ANDERSON:	Don' t never 14 waste my time and stupid man  --15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank 16 you.17 Anita Romm.18 ( Applause.)19 MS. ANITA ROMM:	Good morning.	My 20 name is Anita Romm.21 I' m the songwriter for 22 Metropolitan Council on Housing.	And I' m a rent 23 stabilized tenant in a building that has  gone 24 co- op.25 And there is quite a bit  of 6 
2 mishigoz between shareholders and tenants, a  very 3 hostile atmosphere.4 I have read the reports,5 especially the Income and Expense Study, and  I6 found out that landlords' incomes rose at a  greater 7 rate than their expenses.	When we remember all the 8 rent increases during the years such as 2002 , there 9 should have been a rent  rollback.10 We really deserve a rent  freeze 11 now.12 What will be the consequences  of 13 greatly increased rents? We already have a  high 14 percentage of people paying more than half of  their 15 income for rent so they have less to spend on   goods 16 and services. This will result in  business 17 failures, unemployment, homelessness, broken 18 families and children languishing in orphanages  on 19 a diet of gruel.20 Do you really want to see  this 21 Dickensian picture or will you do the right  thing 22 and vote for a rent  freeze?23 Laissez- faire, mon derriere.24 Any questions?25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good job,2 

2	Anita.	Thank you.345678 9	names: 1011121314	D- o- a- l.1516
Any questions? ( No response.)CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good job.We need some new songs next year. Ed Korman.I' m going to read a few of the Ed Korman will be next;Followed by William Stanford, Jr.; Followed by Sandy Rosen;Followed by Jeanette Doal,Mr. Korman. Go ahead.MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	Good morning,
17 Mr. Chairman, and Members of the  Board.18 My name is Edward Korman.	And I' m19 the Executive Vice President of the Small  Property 20 Owners of New York.21 You have heard and will  continue 22 to hear from owners, mostly small ones, about  the 23 rising costs from fuel, repairs, both real  estate 24 and water taxes and rising assessments, new  laws 25 geared for the tenants in Housing  Court.17 
2 There are many small houses that 3 still have rents in the 600 and $ 700 range  which 4 cannot sustain these rising costs.	All these 5 increases in taxes, water and fuel are killing  the 6 small owners. You must reestablish the low  rent 7 adjustment. It is not a poor tax, but  an 8 equalization process.	We all have to share the 9 burden of rising fuel and maintenance costs.  As 10 vendors and others pass increases onto us, we  need 11 to pass some of it onto the  tenants.12 A likely guideline for the  low 13 rent adjustment could be, up to $ 1000 , increased by 14 $ 75 . Rents about $ 1000 would be increased by the 15 guideline. Rent control has a fuel service  charge.16 Perhaps it also can be considered for  rent 17 stabilization for these times.18 Consider a minimum legal regulated 19 rent that could vary by borough.	This is, and will 20 continue to be, the cause of the deterioration  and 21 loss of fine buildings, homelessness and 22 unaffordable housing, mostly in the six  to 23 fifteen- family range.	Houses which are owned and 24 maintained by small owners, mom and pop owners,  and 25 newly migrated families that have saved and  saved 2 
2 to be able to own a piece of this wonderful   City,3 many of them will and are losing their homes  and 4 investments.5 There are a lot of good  owners 6 that care for their tenants but no one cares  as 7 long as the tenants -- the tenants can get to   live 8 rent- free.	Tenants that are on subsidies have  jobs 9 working off the books.	Working off the books is 10 why owners will not rent to some tenants.  Nobody 11 cares.12 Many owners are starting to  sell 13 off. Unfortunately, for the tenant the only  ones 14 that can afford to buy the houses today are  the 15 foreign developers and the people  with cash.	Do 16 you have any idea what they are doing to  the 17 housing?	When they get through with the   housing 18 industry, there will only be the rich and  the 19 projects left New York.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.21 MS. ADAMS:	Yes.22 Mr. Korman, you are President or  a23 member of the Small Property Owners  --24 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	I' m Executive 25 Vice President.2 

23	President.4
MS. ADAMS:	Executive Vice Of that organization, how many  of 
5 the building units are stabilized?6 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	I would say 7 most of them.8 MS. ADAMS:	And that would be how 9 many?10 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	I think we' re 11 up to about ten thousand.12 MS. ADAMS:	Ten thousand?13 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	Yes.14 MS. ADAMS:	And what' s the 15 largest number that the organization has ever  been?16 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	Well, it 17 depends on the condition.	He could own some 18 buildings and have a secondary job, which most  of 19 the owners have because they need to subsidize  the 20 small properties, and could -- I know of one or   two 21 that own their own and manage for other people  who 22 may cannot do it themselves.23 MS. ADAMS:	Okay.	Thank you.24 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I' d like to ask 25 a question.5 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.3 MR. LANGUEDOC:	If you know, I4 did some research on this, quite a bit of   research 5 on this over the past few days, that the  vast 6 majority of the one million or so rent  stabilized 7 apartments in New York City are owned by a   very 8 small number of people. Yet we -- we haven' t  heard 9 very much, this Board has not heard very much  from 10 that small of number people at all.	And I' m11 wondering do you have any idea of how many of   those 12 landlords --13 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	I can give you 14 an answer to that.15 In today' s government process 16 there is the RPIE which people have to file  which 17 the small owners are against.	So nobody knows what 18 they' re doing.19 Secondly, a lot of buildings  in 20 the Ridgewood area, the Bushwick area, and  Bed 21 Stuy, are owned by small owners as well that  are 22 not educated or they don' t have the resources to 23 own a computer.	When you don' t own a computer --24 because right now the City of New York requires  you 25 to file most of your stuff on- line to save  paper.2 
2 So I think that a lot of these buildings are   lost 3 in the system.4 And if you go into Ridgewood  where 5 you have an old property that' s been there for 6 fifty years, most of their tenants are of  their 7 own, are the people of their own ethic group  and8 they can' t afford to buy a computer.	But yet 9 everything keeps going up.10 And I think that everybody has  to 11 start to look at every -- the interaction  between 12 every City agency because every City agency  says 13 well, we need an increase.	Water was increased 14 eleven and a half percent a couple months  back.15 Don' t quote me on the timeframe.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Fourteen.17 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	Fourteen and a18 half.	And besides the water being fourteen and  a19 half now, it was eleven and a  half.20 Real estate taxes.21 The Mayor doesn' t know if he' s22 going to be able to keep the  seven percent.	But 23 DOF, Martha Stark, boy, she' s coming up with the 24 assessments that are killing us.25 And the City agencies have  to 2 
2 start to talk to each other.	Because I know some 3 tenants can' t afford the increase and we can' t4 afford to absorb every increase that' s given.	And 5 people are starting to sell out.	I' m telling you,6 something going to happen.	This City' s is going to 7 be totally different in a couple of  years.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	First, I don' t11 know where that statistic comes from that a  small 12 minority of owners own the vast majority of  units.13 I' ve never seen that. So I don' t put any stock to 14 that statement or in the way that question  was 15 phrased to you.16 But Mr. Korman, thank you  for 17 coming out.18 And our own research, in  the 19 Income and Expense Report, shows that expenses  for 20 buildings are increasing at a faster pace  than 21 building income is increasing.22 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	Correct.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	What scenario do 24 you see, given that roughly ten to eleven  percent 25 of buildings right now are distressed,  financially 2 

2	distressed?34
MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	Yes, they are. Well, I think a lot of this  --
5 like I said before, my prior statement, a lot   of 6 the buildings are distressed and a lot of  the 7 owners don' t know what to do. But in the last  few 8 years we' ve had the Led Law which is really a  big 9 burden on the people.	We' ve got buildings that 10 have aged that need updating, plumbing,  electric 11 and so on, and you can' t do both. And if you can' t12 get a decent income to cover it, you' re in  trouble.13 And I know for a fact that a   lot 14 of small owners, the building is their part time  --15 is their part- time job.	They have to have a16 building to sustain their families.17 And it was said once before -- I' m18 on the community board in Brooklyn.	And on there 19 were a number of minorities and elderly people  that 20 keep saying - Ms. Harkins, ( phonetic) rest in  peace 21 said, you buy a building, it' s going to help  you 22 when you get older. Unfortunately, she passed  away 23 and unfortunately her building went down the  tubes 24 because she couldn' t afford to subsidize. This is 25 the key. Everybody' s got to get together.5 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.3 MR. EDWARD KORMAN:	If we don' t4 all get together, tenants, owners, the  government,5 all the agencies, the RGB and the State, you' re  not 6 going to have good housing  projects here.	The only 7 thing you' re going to have are Manhattan, where all 8 wealthy people are, and you' re going to take all 9 our buildings that the developers, the  foreign 10 developers get and they' re going -- you' re going to 11 have projects.	This is what it' s going to be. I12 mean you don' t have to be a rocket science  to 13 realize what' s going on.14 I' ll invite anybody to spend two 15 days with me in Bushwick and Ridgewood and you' ll 16 see what' s going on. They' re taking -- I sold a few 17 of my properties.	The only people that could 18 afford to buy them are the people with cash,  which 19 are the foreign developers and some of these  ethic 20 groups.	Because of -- it' s very difficult to get 21 right now.22 And believe me, I have a  good 23 relationship with my tenants.	That building has no 24 violations, but I had to sell it because I  couldn' t25 bear it anymore simply because I' m getting too old 2 
2 for it.	My children don' t want it so I sold it  to 3 the development.	Do you know how many families  are 4 not in the building anymore, that the buildings  are 5 being turned into co- ops and condos?	You go from a6 six- bedroom to fifteen- bedroom like that.	We have 7 to wake up, everybody.	This is not a joke.	This 8 is not a joke.9 ( Applause.)10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 William Stanford, Jr.13 Mr. Standford.14 MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:	You know 15 what your problem is, you think everything has  to 16 be -- everything has to be done  your way.	That' s17 why I' m fed up with you.	Everything has to be your 18 way. That' s the message you send us.	The message 19 you send us here was this is your  way.20 You' re increasing the rent the 21 last two years alone, yet you didn' t go after  any 22 of the landlords and leave the tenants, who don' t23 make repairs, have broken ceilings, broken 24 bathrooms, broken sinks.	There' s no excuse for 25 that.2 
2 What do you intend to do  about 3 that?	What do you intend to do about  the 4 apartments that are roach- infested,5 rodent- infested?	I don' t even need to be saying 6 that.	Why are you going on about some damn  rent 7 increases?8 We still have buildings that  are 9 in deplorable conditions, broken stairways,  mold 10 and mildew, asbestos.	What are you going to  do 11 about that? Or are you are just going to  continue 12 increasing rents?	You know what your problem  is,13 you can' t expect everyone to work for Goldman Sachs 14 like yourself. You need to think  about that.	Okay?15 And when you set the  public 16 hearings, you know, you shouldn' t start at 10 a. m.17 at a time when people are still working. That  makes 18 no sense.	When you vote, make the vote,  the 19 preliminary and final votes, you shouldn' t start 20 them at 5 : 30 .	You should start them later. People 21 are still working at 5 : 30 .22 When are you going to wake up  and 23 realize that?	You starting these in the  morning 24 and people are still working, that makes no  sense,25 high school kids and everyone. And everyone  cannot 2 
2 be here.	Did you stop to think about that?  No.3 I' m surprised you' re still here 4 especially after what you did in  2006 .	I already 5 mentioned that. Okay. I' ll be so glad when you  step 6 down because the last two years though you' ve just 7 have shown me how cruel you  really are.	I8 criticized you about your behavior. You' re slopping 9 up, you' re off the wall mood swings.	Okay?10 I complained about two of  your 11 teammates a few days ago because they were,  you 12 know, the other thing, you know, the owners  want 13 one thing and they want more and the tenant  and 14 landlords want less. And this is  getting 15 ridiculous.	They need to work together.16 There' s no excuse for this. What 17 you did, that performance at 22 Reade Street,  why 18 you' re still here. I was hoping that Bloomberg 19 would drop you like a bad  habit.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 21 wrap up.22 MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:	Well, I' ll 23 wrap up.24 Like I said before, Marvin,  you 25 need to get out of here.	And as I said it  before,2 
2 you' re a bigger pimp than Peter Kalikow.	Like 3 Peter Kalikow, you want more money.	Okay. Like 4 Bruce Ratner, you --5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you wrap 6 up, please.7 MR. WILLIAM STANFORD:	Okay.	I' m8 wrapping up.9 Like I said before, you and  Peter 10 Kalikow could pass for King Kong Bundy and Big  John 11 Studd and Bruce Ratner and Bobby Heehan. We  need 12 you to wake up.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 Thank you.15 ( Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sandy Rosen.17 ( Applause.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Pull the mike 19 down.	Sandy, pull the mike down.20 MS. SANDY ROSEN:	Members of the 21 Rent Guidelines Board, my name is Sandy  Rosen.22 I would like to first thank  you 23 for the opportunity to speak to you this morning  to 24 tell you why I feel the RGB must approve a   fair 25 guideline this year.2 
2 My family has owned and operated  a3 six- family home in Brooklyn for 53 years. I started 4 living there when I was twelve years old and  took 5 over the daily operations of the building in the  6	1980 ' s.7 When my parents bought the 8 building over five decades ago, it wasn' t because 9 they wanted to make a profit, it was because  they 10 wanted to make an investment in their future and  in 11 mine.12 I' ve been to an RGB meeting before 13 but feel compelled to speak up this year as   my 14 expenses have increasingly spiraled out of  control.15 In 2007 KeySpan charges were 16 $ 9 , 292 , 19 . The New York Water Board, $ 3 , 174 . 81 . The 17 Department of Finance, $ 6 , 506 . 25 . And my building 18 insurance was $ 6 , 129 . 01 .	I just received a  bill 19 from the Water Board.	The amount due by July 31 ,20 $ 3 , 635 , by July 31 st. This is only a partial list 21 of my expenses. These are the big expenses  that 22 keep increasing.23 Unfortunately the guidelines do 24 not break down laws based upon the number of  units 25 in a building as well as the expense of running   a7 
2 small building. A one- size- fits- all guideline does 3 not work. If the small landlord does not get a   fair 4 increase, we' ll start seeing owners simply walk 5 away from properties, destroying community. If  you 6 remember the 1970 ' s, we don' t want to go back 7 there.8 I was once a tenant so  I9 understand the dilemma. However, for tenants  to 10 live in a well- run and safe building, the landlord 11 needs the affordability to keep it up. If the  small 12 landlord does not get their increase, you  will 13 start seeing owners walk away from properties. So  I14 will repeat myself, the landlord needs 15 affordability to keep it up. This is not  about 16 making a profit. This is about survival in  a17 country that is literally wiping out the  small 18 property owner.19 There is an urgent need for  the 20 system to change. But until then, the RGB  must 21 value and support owners of small properties  as 22 they are the hardest hit.23 Again, I want to thank you for  the 24 opportunity to present my case.	And please vote 25 for a fair guideline this  year.2 

23	building?4
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where' s your MS. SANDY ROSEN:	I live -- it' s
5 near East 4 th Street and Avenue P, which is still  a6 decent neighborhood, but the rents do not  comply 7 with the expenses I have.	I have a SCRIE  tenant.8 I have tenants who are on  rent stabilization.	I9 was once a rent controlled tenant  myself.10 Now, let me explain.	Perhaps we 11 need subsidies. The City is not going to do  this 12 but it' s necessary, maybe financial subsidies for 13 landlords who want to make improvements, but  need 14 something to be kicked back  to them.	Certain 15 tenants get welfare.	They get SCRIE. They get 16 help. There are some that aren' t even citizens in 17 the United States and they find a way to get   some 18 assistance.19 Small landlords -- and maybe we 20 have to break it down for you in units,  small 21 buildings, middle- sized buildings and large 22 buildings, and compare expenses based upon the  size 23 of the building. The laws are not commensurate  with 24 the number of buildings -- the number of  sizable 25 apartments in the building.5 
2 I have six tenants.	My expenses 3 may be as much as someone who has a $ 500  building 4 -- a 500 - tenant building but they can get more. I5 live in Manhattan so you don' t have to tell me  what 6 goes on here in Manhattan. You just have to go   to 7 the Lower East Side to see what' s going on to  the 8 change in the neighborhood.9 But one has to be fair  and 10 reasonable to both tenant and landlords.	I11 understand their dilemma, but they don' t understand 12 what a small property owner has  to face.	You are 13 literally lumping us in with everyone else and  you 14 cannot. It should be broken down according  to 15 number of tenants in a building  --16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 MS. SANDY ROSEN: -- and  their 18 expenses.19 MS. HOLDER: I have a  question.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Another 21 question. Go ahead.22 MS. ADAMS:	How many of your six 23 units are rent stabilized?24 MS. SANDY ROSEN:	They all were.25 It' s just recently because I tried to put in  some 2 
2 improvements.	I had to -- so I' m entitled to  get 3 more as a result of putting  it in.	And the reason 4 why I did is because I have a daughter and   I5 figured maybe somewhere down the line it would  be 6 some benefit to her.	It won' t be.	I don' t even 7 know if I can keep the  building.8 Unfortunately right now the law is 9 more in favor of people who are buying rather  than 10 selling.	Anyone who has got money will come   and 11 get a break. The seller is desperate to get   out.12 So if you want to keep basic neighborhoods to   be 13 safe and to be secure and people want to move   into 14 these buildings, landlords certainly have to  do 15 improvements, otherwise they' re not going to get 16 the tenants they want in order to be able to   pay 17 rent.18 And I have to tell you, the  laws 19 happen to be such that we haven' t been able  to 20 share our credentials of perspective  tenants.21 You' ve got to deal now with pedophiles.	You' ve 22 got to deal with people with all kinds of  credit 23 problems. People who lie.24 I was -- just my basic concern  is 25 the small property owner, the small property  owner 2 
2 that' s in the boroughs.	Not the small landlord who 3 owns a townhouse in the West Village or who owns   it 4 on Sutton Place, who owns it at Beekman or  Park 5 Slope where that neighborhood has grown 6 exponentially.7 I don' t know what else to say. I8 find it very frustrating that I had not spoken  out 9 before and talking about people why aren' t the 10 small landlords coming forward.	I think it' s11 frustration, quite frankly. I think -- I' ve been to 12 one meeting where there was such horrendous,  such 13 screaming, such carrying on that people  could 14 literally could not have an opportunity  without 15 being shouted at and it gets to a point  where 16 people just give up.17 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Just to clarify.18 My question was, why are no large owners coming  to 19 testify if the vast majority of the units are  owned 20 by large --21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Ron, you' re 22 saying that again.	It doesn' t hold up.23 MS. SANDY ROSEN:	Listen. I can' t24 speak for them.	I don' t know how many small 25 property owners there are.2 
2 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.3 I have a question.4 MS. SANDY ROSEN: Sure.5 MS. HOLDER:	I really do 6 appreciate you coming here this morning.7 I think that we all know  that 8 being here on the Board for these years and  that 9 used to attend these hearings as a staff  attorney 10 for Legal Aid and, you know, including people  who 11 work for me in my organization for rent  stabilized 12 tenants, everyone is very emotional about  this 13 issue, as I know you are and other small owners   who 14 have testified before.15 And I appreciate the fact  that 16 you' re talking about the type of city that we' re 17 living in because that' s exactly what my concern 18 has been, is that landlords tenants are  seemingly 19 fighting against each other, but there are  always 20 other economic pressures that we can sort of,  as 21 groups, can control that actually make it  very 22 difficult to be able to live in New York for a   rent 23 stabilized tenant or also to own a small  building 24 or be a small landlord.25 And so I really do appreciate  that 2 
 2 and we know that prices have gone up for  services 3 and goods for everyone.4 You had said something about 5 subsidies.	And it seems that the landlords  are 6 receiving some form of a subsidy right now,  because 7 you were saying that you have six units and  they 8 are regulated.	How much is that rent?9 MS. SANDY ROSEN:	What I legally 10 could get.	First of all, it' s the owners'11 apartment so that' s not a fair assessment.	But it 12 would be legal.	And I mean all the money I put  in.13 I have to tell you what I had to put in would be 14	$ 2000 .15 I, in good conscious, the kind  of 16 building that I own, which I would never deem it   be 17 to able to ask that kind of money, I would   be 18 lucky, for a two- bedroom apartment, the way things 19 are going around and what kind of money I put   in,20 if I could get $ 1200 for a two- bedroom apartment, I21 would be considered very lucky.22 Now it will take me, I don' t know 23 how many years, to basically get back what I   put 24 into this building to try and salvage it so that   I25 could get some money for my daughter and my  son.15 
2 I' m a senior citizen. I can' t even collect my 3 Social Security. And I' m not going to go into  my 4 personal income.	It' s not fair.	I just feel when 5 there' s a lot of politicians getting raises, and 6 when people get raises, instead of spending it  in 7 places that doesn' t make sense, give it to every 8 citizen in this country.9 I' ll use my mother' s famous line,10 charity begins at home.	You have to find ways  to 11 help people salvage properties that the  owners 12 didn' t want to keep.	By the same token, you  have 13 to help tenants.14 But let me tell you - and  then 15 I' ll let other people speak - for my SCRIE  tenant,16 who' s not even a citizen of the United States,17 okay, she this person.	I get a tax credit.  Guess 18 what?	The tax credit doesn' t matter because my 19 income is not so low that it doesn' t help me.  I20 need the money. I need the cash. I need to be   able 21 to spend the money so I can keep it for   if 22 something breaks.23 Today I had a plumber come  in.24 $ 227 just to snake out a pipe. I mean I don' t  want 25 to belabor this.	Everyone has got issues.	I just 2 
2 think the laws don' t bring people and landlords3 together.	You can' t compare small to middle to 4 big.5 I hope you guys can rectify it.  I6 really, really hope. It' s not necessarily you per 7 se. It' s your Congressman.	It' s our Senator. It' s8 your Governor. It' s your Mayor. Many of them don' t9 understand the problems.	They' re way above in a10 different stratosphere.	They' ve got to see and be 11 involved and taking to areas and deal  with 12 landlords and at least let them show what' s  going 13 on.14 I don' t argue with this gentleman.15 There are good landlords. There are  slumlords.16 There are good tenants and there are  abusive 17 tenants. You cannot generalize and that is a  big 18 problem, generalization.	That' s been the problem 19 in our country.20 So I' ll let you all go and thank 21 you very much.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 ( Applause.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jeanette Doal;25 Followed by Marolyn Davenport;2

JEANETTE DOAL:	My first 6 three renewal leases were optioned at two to  four 7 percent and I was able to renew for a  two- year 8 period.9 Since 2004 , with the option of 3 . 510 percent, 6 . 5 qualified, 4 . 27 , followed by a three 11 and 5 . 75 , I cannot afford to renew for more than 12 one year at a  time.13 Since 2004 , my rent jumped from 14 $ 970 to $ 1100 .	I pay $ 1 , 110 and 33 cents each 15 month now and that is  your doing.	Why?	The poor 16 and middle class in rent stabilized housing  are 17 getting forced out with the current high  utility 18 and gasoline costs.	We can' t afford any further 19 increases in housing.	I know there are people  who 20 say and there will always be the poor among  us,21 yes, but the rich will see to  it.22 May 2 nd, the Department of City 23 Planning, my duly elected representative,  Senator 24 Duane, spoke regarding a legislative  draft.25 Unelected landlords and board members told  me 2 
2 inappropriate testimony and politics should not  be 3 part of this discussion.4 May 5 th, the preliminary vote,5 Mayor Bloomberg publicly stated he did not  think 6 politics should enter into the decision,  your 7 decision.	Politics and economics both describe and 8 determine who gets what and  where.9 The United States of America and 10 the City New York is not an oligarchy and ruled   by 11 elite.	We' re a republic rule by representative 12 individual liberty, the government, justice, checks 13 and balances.14 And we are democrats here,  not 15 republicans.	You are part of the oligarchy,   an 16 administrative form ruled by the few,  without 17 justice, no checks and balances.18 I didn' t vote for you.	I voted 19 for Senator Duane.	I want legislative review of 20 your actions. I want judicial review of  your 21 actions and I want the opportunity to battle  your 22 actions.23 These are checks and balances, as 24 my friend, Arkila Meir, ( phonetic), who' s a Yale 25 Constitutional Law Professor, advised me.	Our 2 
2 checks and balances act to secure the blessing  for 3 liberty for each person. He further said,  the 4 administrative form of government, which we 5 practice here, characterized by yourself,6 professional public appointees, you establish 7 policy, you make policy.	You review your own 8 policy, making an execution of  that policy.	There 9 is no balances the separation of powers. Liberty  is 10 not secure for the individual tenant.11 Our proposal is that you undue  the 12 damage you' ve done since 2004 by applying minus 13 10 . 75 percent and minus 19 . 5 percent for the 14 upcoming renewal leases.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 MS.

MS. HOLDER:	Wait.	I have aHow long have you been in  your MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	I' ve been in 
8 my apartment ten years.9 MS. HOLDER:	Ten years and you 10 said your current rent is $ 1100 ?11 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	Right.12 MS. HOLDER:	How many bedrooms 13 do you have?14 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	I have one.15 MS. HOLDER:	And what are the 16 conditions inside the apartment?17 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	That goes back 18 to how I initially rented the apartment. I  didn' t19 know it was a rent stabilized apartment. I   was 20 absolutely defrauded by the landlord.	He charged 21 me the rent of $ 1850 per month and had to go  to 22 rent stabilization.	I went through the DHCR,  the 23 court system, got the rent back to ' 88 .24 But in that process the  landlord 25 began -- her two law firms presented information  to 8 
2 the State that stated that there were  apartment 3 improvements when, in fact, they were having  a4 difficult time trying to prove that.5 So the conditions in the 6 apartment, to answer your question, I don' t have 7 the improvements that should exist.	The apartment 8 needs painting.	The plumbing needs to be re- done.9 There needs to be new windows, those kinds  of 10 things.11 MS. HOLDER:	And I' m not 12 necessarily asking you what your  income is.	Can 13 you tell me what it is that you  do?14 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	I work for 15 medical research.16 MS. HOLDER:	And what percentage 17 of your rent -- of your income is your  rent?18 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	Well,19 currently right now it' s a very high percentage.	I20 would say it' s above fifty percent.21 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.	Thank you.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 MS. LEVINE:	Excuse me.24 Where is the apartment?25 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	My apartment 2 
2 is Upper West side.3 MS. LEVINE:	And you said you 4 originally signed for $ 1850 --5 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	Right.6 MS. LEVINE:	-- without knowing 7 that it was rent stabilized.	So you actually are 8 in a better position now than you were when  you 9 signed the lease because you made the decision  to 10 go into it.11 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	No. I wasn' t12 offered that. I was offered a month- to- month.	It 13 was a bait- and- switch.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 Marolyn Davenport.16 Go ahead.17 MS. MAROLYN DAVENPORT:	On behalf 18 of the over 12 , 000 members of the Real Estate Board 19 of New York, including owners, builders,  managers 20 and brokers of high- rise residential property, I21 urge the Rent Guidelines Board to set  reasonable 22 and fair rent increases which reflect today' s23 substantially increased costs.24 The Price index of nearly eight 25 percent is the largest in five years and  is 2 
2 actually much larger for the vasty majority  of 3 buildings that are oil- heated. In the six previous 4 years, operating costs rose by more than  forty 5 percent. Over the same period, allowable  rent 6 increases have risen by half of that. This kind  of 7 situation cannot continue without seriously 8 jeopardizing our housing stock.9 The PIOC calculates the rent 10 increases required to cover the increased  operating 11 costs and in virtually every year of this  decade,12 the Rent Guidelines Board has approved  rent 13 increases that fall short of the amounts  necessary 14 to simply cover increased costs.15 Operating costs have been led by 16 skyrocketing fuel and utility costs. Fuel oil,  and 17 to a lesser extent, natural gas price  increases 18 have been making headlines for the past year.  With 19 oil topping $ 130 a barrel, there is no end  in 20 sight.21 This can be expected to  continue 22 to increase in the foreseeable future so it  is 23 essential that the guideline rent increases  be 24 sufficient to cover these costs.25 Additionally, utility costs have 2 
2 been rising at double- digit rate increases for the 3 past few years. Electric rate cases have  included 4 huge increases for utility infrastructure  repairs 5 as well as substantial amounts for Con Ed to   put 6 toward energy efficiency programs.7 Con Ed' s increase for this year is 8 fifteen percent and they have already  submitted 9 additional increases for next year.10 These rate increases are for the 11 delivery of services.	Commodity prices have risen 12 even faster. Additionally, the PSC has approved  a13 three- year package of increases for natural gas 14 averaging ten percent a  year.15 The cost of water and sewer  has 16 increased rapidly over the last few years, and  it 17 expected to do so at twelve percent a year   going 18 forward. We had, as you know, a fifty  percent 19 increase this year. Last year eleven and a  half.20 The 6 . 4 percent decrease in the 21 real property tax last year hardly compensates  for 22 the next increase of eighteen percent over  the 23 previous six years. The tax increases of the  past 24 few years are combined with substantially 25 escalating assessments of high- rise apartment 2 
2 buildings. The real property tax burden  is 3 extremely high with real estate taxes having  risen 4 by over 100 percent over the last six years  for 5 high- rise apartment buildings. They are the largest 6 single expense for many residential  buildings.7 Labor costs continue to rise, in 8 part, as a result of increasing health and  pension 9 costs. And our members are also experiencing  very 10 high costs for repairs and maintenance, possibly  as 11 a result of the construction  boom.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 13 wrap up.14 MS. MAROLYN DAVENPORT:	For all of 15 these reasons we need fair rent increases  which 16 mirror the commensurate rent increases of the  PIOC.17 Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 Yes. Question.20 ( Applause.)21 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.23 Madga.24 MS. CRUZ:	Ms. Davenport, thank 25 you for coming today.2 
2 MS. MAROLYN DAVENPORT:	Sure.3 MS. CRUZ:	You represent property 4 owners of larger buildings; is that  correct?5 MS. MAROLYN DAVENPORT:	That' s6 correct.7 MS. CRUZ:	Can you give the Board 8 your views on the threshold low rent  adjustment 9 that some of the small property owners have  been 10 advocating.	How would that help, if at all,  the 11 larger property owners?12 MS. MAROLYN DAVENPORT:	I didn' t13 mention it in my testimony.	We' re strongly 14 supportive of it across the City.	We think it 15 would be a very beneficial effect on the  housing 16 stock throughout the five boroughs.	I didn' t17 mention it because I do tend to represent  the 18 larger owners, the owners of larger buildings.	And 19 there are -- quite frankly, fewer of my  members 20 have smaller buildings.	So we' re very much in 21 support of that policy.22 MS. CRUZ:	And why do you think 23 it' s a good policy?24 MS. MAROLYN DAVENPORT:	Because 25 it' s essential to maintain and preserve our housing 2 
2 stock.	It' s that simple.	When expenses exceed 3 income, as the woman two speakers ago said, you  can 4 hardly hold onto your building.5 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.6 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.8 Adriene, go ahead.9 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you for coming 10 this morning.	I appreciate your candor.11 When you say larger buildings, you 12 had said earlier, and I didn' t catch it, what  is 13 the definition of owners of larger  buildings?14 MS. MAROLYN DAVENPORT:	I don' t15 have a specific definition.	Our members' buildings 16 tend to be high- rise buildings.	So a definition of 17 high- rise would be 75 feet in height.	That' s how I18 say it.19 MS. HOLDER:	And with this 20 supplemental rent increase you said it was for  your 21 members' benefit.	What did you mean by that  in 22 response to my colleague' s question?23 MS. MAROLYN DAVENPORT:	Our 24 members of the Real Estate Board are focused  not 25 exclusively in Manhattan but predominately in 2 
2 Manhattan.	Some of their buildings are in  Downtown 3 Brooklyn, in Queens now.	But they tend to be 4 Manhattan- oriented.5 MS. HOLDER:	And so can you 6 explain when you say some landlords may have  little 7 are no --8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The rent --9 based on our history, when we passed a  supplemental 10 increase, based on the dollar amount, their  rents 11 generally end up the same.12 MS. MAROLYN DAVENPORT:	Correct.13 MS. HOLDER:	Right.	And so what 14 would you have us do, if it could be possible,   to 15 be able to deal with this issue in a fair way   given 16 the different types of landlords and sizes  of 17 landlords who really are a one- size- fits all 18 approach to deal with owners as well as  tenants?19 MS. MAROLYN DAVENPORT:	In the 20 past you have had supplemental rent  increases.21 Although the low rent increase, as well as  the 22 percentage. I am here because I feel very  strongly 23 that the percentage increases need to fully  cover 24 operating cost increases, but to preserve  housing 25 across the City, but also the impact of  an 2 
2 affordable rent increase.3 MS. HOLDER:	And, in fact, that 4 impact, or as you say, would then be placed  on 5 those tenants of the one- size- fits all approach,6 but for those tenants, such an increase might  then 7 constitute them paying 80 percent of their  income 8 towards rent.	What should we do about  that?9 MS. MAROLYN DAVENPORT:	We have 10 always felt that that kind of question  requires11 some form of government subsidy. It shouldn' t be 12 the private owners providing rent  subsidies.13 MS. HOLDER:	And should that 14 subsidy occur before such a supplemental  was 15 granted or it should be  granted?16 MS. MAROLYN DAVENPORT:	I' m not in 17 government.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 Richard Steiger;20 Followed by Arnold Fine;21 Followed by Mr. Jones, James 22 Jones; and 23 Then Wilson Westvind.24 Go ahead, Mr. Steiger.25 MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	Good 2 

2	morning.3
I testify every year at  this 
4 public hearing and I' m not quite sure why I do  it.5 It seems to be an exercise in  futility.6 I cite statistics about the  loss 7 of affordable housing. Indeed, just two weeks  ago,8 New York State' s highest court approved the mass 9 evictions of rent stabilized tenants in the  East 10 Village so the building could be converted into  a11 five- story mansion.	But I do know why I' m12 testifying this year.13 My sister lives in a two- family 14 house in Queens.	The owners told her that  they 15 need the apartment for their daughter and she  must 16 vacate by June 30 th.17 We' ve been looking and we cannot 18 find an affordable rent stabilized  apartment.19 Studios are going for $ 1300 , $ 1400 a month and 20 more.	My sister receives supplemental  security 21 income.	I would like to help her but I' m  facing 22 hundreds of dollars of major capital  improvement 23 increases in my rent stabilized  apartment.24 My sister, at the age of 59 , is 25 resigned to the fact that she will be homeless  in 4 
2 fifteen days.	I don' t know what kind of a  society 3 we are that people are so expendable that we   allow 4 people to fall away like a feather in the  wind.5 Where is care, compassion and 6 humanity?	We must start to put people  before 7 profits.	I hope I' m not asking too much for   the 8 Rent Guidelines Board to think about the  most 9 vulnerable people in this city and how we might  be 10 able to support them and help them in their time   of 11 need.12 You can that do by voting a  zero 13 percent increase for one and two- year leases.14 Thank you.15 ( Applause.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Chairman.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.19 MS. CRUZ:	I just -- I want  to 20 make, first, one statement and then a question  to 21 you.22 Because I was involved in  that 23 case that you referenced about the Court  of 24 Appeals.	I can definitively tell you that   the 25 Court of Appeals did not hold in favor of   mass 2 
2 evictions.	The Court of Appeals, in that  case,3 simply allowed the owner to go prove its case  of 4 good faith in Housing Court and an eviction of  any 5 of the individuals involved in that case is still  a6 speculative question.	We don' t know if it will or 7 will not happen. And the Court of Appeals  simply 8 confirmed the law in allowing the owner to  prove 9 its case.	So --10 MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	And to take 11 our apartments.12 MS. CRUZ:	No. For that owner to 13 go to court and prove  his case.	That' s all.	The 14 owner may lose.	The owner may win. But that is  all 15 that the Court of Appeals  authorized.16 My question to you is, where  has 17 your sister been looking for  housing?18 MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	In Astoria 19 and Jackson Heights.20 MS. CRUZ:	Okay. Thank you.21 MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	You' re 22 welcome.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.24 Adriene, did you have a question?  No?25 MS. HOLDER:	No.2

12 I' m trying to sell, which have fallen being the  way 13 the market was last year.14 Anyway, I want to give you  some 15 figures of what' s going on in the buildings.16 Water and sewer went up fourteen 17 and a half percent from 3635 and an increase  of 18 $ 527 just now.	Okay?	Insurance has gone up from 19 2836 .	It only went up $ 15 this year because I20 cannot get led insurance of any kind. So  that 21 dropped my insurance by more than a $ 1000 from  two 22 years ago.	Forget about out led insurance. You 23 can' t it.24 Taxes, 5968 , six- family building.25 I don' t know when it' s going up. I haven' t gotten 12 

2	the bill yet.3
Con Edison, on average, it' s a
 4 six- family building so the hallways and the boiler.5 It' s $ 470 a month. Now they want a 5 . 8 percent 6 increase.	I just got the notice from Con  Edison.7 KeySpan gas just got an  increase 8 two years ago, paid 5132 last winter over the  year.9 This year I don' t know what they' re going to ask 10 for a raise.	All these things coming up  raises.11 Right now I have a $ 591 increase 12 for this year.	That' s without taxes and without 13 KeySpan going up.	And we know taxes are going  to 14 go up. It doesn' t matter if they keep the tax  flat.15 They raise the assessment.	The assessment goes up,16 your taxes go up.17 The next thing I have, I have  a18 six- family building on the block with 32 other 19 six- family buildings, twenty- two buildings on the 20 odd side, ten buildings on the  even side.	I can 21 give you four buildings on the line where the  rents 22 have reached their limit, not your limit,  their 23 limit.	The rent -- the legal  rents are:	$ 1343 , 24	$ 1554 , $ 1664 , $ 1556 , $ 1357 , $ 1402 , $ 1265 , $ 1301 .25	The actual rents that are  being 
2	collected are:	$ 1230 , $ 1236 , $ 1225 , $ 1220 , $ 1240 ,3 $ 1225 , $ 1250 . This is what' s going on.	It' s capped 4 already. You can' t get anymore. That' s what the 5 neighborhood calls for.6 This is Kensington.	This is not a7 bad neighborhood or anything. This is a  decent 8 neighborhood.	You people are here looking for 9 $ 1300 for a studio? Come here.	You can get an 10 apartment, two- bedroom apartment $ 1200 . No problem.11 That' s the first thing.12 The next item is you don' t take 13 into account several items.	For instance, I do 14 most of the work in  my building.	I spend hours, 34 15 hours one month, 21 hours another month, 32  hours 16 another month. I do plumbing, I do the  electrical,17 I change fixtures, I change switches, I  change 18 faucets, I change toilets. I do all that  work.19 Nobody takes that into account.20 Led paint abatement.	I have a --21 they came and tested the apartment.	There was no 22 led in the apartment. All my apartments  are 23 completely led- free.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to 25 wrap up, Mr. Fine.3 
2 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	All my 3 apartments are completely renovated.	It still 4 needs to be painted.	1912 building? You' re going 5 to find led paint.	Guaranteed if you chip that 6 wood, you' re going to find led paint.	Three months 7 of this.	This is what' s going on and nobody 8 understands it.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, Mr.10 Fine.11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Question.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question. Mr.13 Schleider.14 MR.

23	$ 990 .4
MR. ARNOLD FINE:	Maybe $ 980 ,MR. SCHLEIDER:	So they' re 
5 nowhere near what the legal maximum rents are  on 6 the block and they' re nowhere near what the 7 collectable rents are on the  block.8 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	You can' t9 collect the legal maximum.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No. I' m agreeing 11 with you. That' s fine. They' re nowhere near what 12 the market will bear, right?13 What' s the lowest rents that you 14 have in your buildings?15 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	Right now I just 16 got a tenant on SSI and so she' s paying $ 935 ,17 two- bedroom apartment.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Two- bedroom 19 apartment, $ 935 .20 Thank you.21 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Question.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. Mr.23 Languedoc.24 MR. LANGUEDOC:	So there' s25 really nothing this Board could do now  because 5 
2 you' re saying that the legal regulated rents are 3 higher than what you can  get?4 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	On two 5 apartments.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	On two 7 apartments, Ron. Only two.8 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay.	On only 9 two apartments?10 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	On two 11 apartments.12 MR. LANGUEDOC:	You gave a whole 13 list of rents --14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	He' s talking 15 about the whole building.16 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	I can get you a17 comparison of four buildings on the block of  the 18 landlords that I know I can get the names for   you.19 Actually, you have a copy  there.20 MR. LANGUEDOC:	So many 21 landlords in your neighborhood are unable  to 22 collect the regulated rent.23 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	Right.24 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Let me ask you 25 this, you said -- you talked about KeySpan and  Con 2 
2 Ed.	You' re building provides heat and hot  water.3 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	Yes.4 MR. LANGUEDOC:	By oil or heat?5 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	By gas.6 MR. LANGUEDOC:	By gas. Okay.7 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	One of the 8 landlords provides it by oil.	And he was telling 9 me he uses an average of 3 , 000 gallons a year. Now,10 the oil has gone up $ 3 . 99 a gallon. It' s going up 11 even higher.	And if you multiply that 3 , 000 12 gallons, that' s much higher than what I' m paying 13 for gas by about two and a half  times.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It' s 12 , 000 a15 month.16 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Do you pay for 17 heat and heat water for the  tenants?18 MR. ARNOLD FINE:	Yes, I do.19 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 James Jones;22 Wilson Wetvind;23 Ann Messner; and 24 Then Marty Rosenman.25 Mr. Jones, how you doing today?2 
2 MR. JAMES JONES:	Fine.	Thank.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good. Go ahead.4 MR. JAMES JONES:	This nation,5 United States of America, has a right to  defend 6 itself when attacked. In fact, the  responsibility 7 to defend its citizens.8 A black woman working in  the 9 Borough President Office said she heard say  the 10 black tenants of Wadleigh Court wanted a  black 11 applicant with no money to get Wadleigh Court on  a12 give me give for basis.13 Why does the United States 14 maintain a military presence in  Rheinstein,15 Germany? The war has been over in excess.  Germany 16 has demonstrated a pattern of leading  major 17 conflicts, military struggles against the United 18 States.	Empire Japan was not losing the hand  to 19 hand fighting against American forces. Empire  of 20 Japan was not persuaded until President Harry  S.21 Truman was sworn in as United States  President.22 Senior tenants, Wadleigh Court 23 indicated a apartment five previous or  prior 24 tenants did not distribute crack cocaine, etc,  but 25 were well known users of cocaine,  etc.2 
2 Again, the Corporation Counsel,3 100 Church, uses the word applicant. Word  landlord 4 does not appear in summary.5 The applicant attacked Jones 6 Plumbing contractors with corny, disingenuous,7 racial, rhetorical jargon. In light of his  multiple 8 luxury automobiles, etc, etc, etc, New York  City 9 government had removed, booted him and  his 10 organization from building.11 Why was he/ them back at Wadleigh 12 Court? Applicant approach New York City Chinese  or 13 Asian worker in a closet somewhere  demanding 14 Chinese workers sign the money over to  him.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, Mr.16 Jones.17 MS. HOLDER:	I have question.18 Mr. Jones.19 Thank you.	You testify before us 20 every year and I appreciate your coming  in.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Twice a year.22 MS. HOLDER:	Where do you --23 Twice a year.24 Where do you live, Mr.  Jones?25 MR. JAMES JONES:	Well, since this 2 
2 incident, when he attacked the plumber in  the 3 courtyard, a great crime was perpetuated. What  they 4 were working on in the guest room, it  erupted 5 again, it exploded again.6 And it was like two feet of  water.7 And again, the guest room. And this  applicant,8 immigrant applicant, he sicked the police on me.  He 9 said I attacked, that I caused.	He omitted the 10 part that he attacked the plumber or in  the 11 courtyard.	He omitted that.12 But he brought two 13 plainclothesmen, two uniform from 28 th and he said,14 I preyed on the plumber. I alone attacked  the 15 plumber. He didn' t say that. He started calling the 16 plumber a white boy and they ran in fear of   their 17 lives.18 MS. HOLDER:	Mr. Jones, where do 19 you currently live?20 MR. JAMES JONES:	Well, since I21 left the apartment I' ve been with friends.22 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.	And where is 23 that?	So you' re living with someone --24 MR. JAMES JONES:	Well, the -- I25 -- I was put in the apartment by H.   Cohen 2 
 2 Corporation.	And they sold the building. They   sold 3 the building.	And in that time, Smart  Fusses 4 Organization bought it and some other people  bought 5 it, Brooks bought it.	And someone named Mulberry 6 Corporation bought it and they sold it to this  guy.7 MS. HOLDER:	Mr. Jones, how long 8 have you been living with  friends?9 MR. JAMES JONES:	Well, I wouldn' t10 like to go into a figure  of that.	But see, the 11 important thing about this, he didn' t say that the 12 28 th Precinct --13 MS. HOLDER:	Mr. Jones, we' re 14 running out of time.	Just, I appreciate --15 MR. JAMES JONES:	But then there' s16 an element of a rap  sheet.17 MS. HOLDER:	No, i understand.18 MR. JAMES JONES:	You know, never 19	--20 MS. HOLDER:	Mr. Jones, how long 21 have you been out of your current  apartment?22 MR. JAMES JONES:	Well, the 23 building was erected in 1912 .24 MS. HOLDER:	How long have you 25 been at your current apartment, you' ve been living 20 
2 at your current apartment, your previous  apartment?3 MR. JAMES JONES:	Well, again, I4 would like to say that whenever the Police  would 5 come and call, you get a wrap sheet which they   will 6 always use against you when it' s convenient.7 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 ( Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Wilson 11 Westvind.12 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	That' s my 13 wife. She' s not here.14CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	That' s okay.15MR. LARS WESTVIND:	I' m Lars 16Westvind.17CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Hold on 18one second.Let me just read some names.19Ann Messner is next.20Marty Rosenman;21Followed by Sandra Rivera;22Followed by Robert Spitalnick.23Go ahead, Mr. --24MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Lars, L- A- R- S.25I have owned -- me and my wife,  we 
2 own smaller buildings that are under  rent 3 stabilized.	Some of the rents --4 MS. ADAMS:	How many units?5 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Well, we have 6 one SRO building with fifteen units and another  one 7 with ten units.8 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Is that an SRO 9 also?10 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Yes. And we' ve 11 got a third SRO that has also I think, eight   SRO 12 units.	And we have -- just cannot understand  why 13 there are no increases in rents for  SROs.14 We also have some rent  stabilized 15 apartments where the rent, the increase this  year 16 is three percent for a one- year lease and last  year 17 it was four and a half  percent.18 The costs have gone up more  for 19 the SRO buildings than for the rent  stabilized 20 buildings.	The SRO buildings we pay  the 21 electricity, we pay for heat, we pay  for 22 everything. We do the cleaning.	Everything 23 basically.	And' s it just incomprehensible to me 24 that you do not give the same rent increases  for 25 SRO buildings as you do for rent  stabilized 2 

2	apartments.3
CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are your 
4 buildings a hundred percent SROs?5 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	No. One of 6 them is.	The other two are not.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. And the 8 one that is, what are the other tenants, they' re 9 stabilized --10 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Yes.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	-- tenants?12 And do you run a hotel at  all?13 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	No.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So where are 15 you buildings?16 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	In Harlem,17 Central Harlem.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So they' re 19 just SRO' s just --20 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Yes.	They' re 21 very nice. They' re renovated.	I mean I renovated 22 them myself over a period of years. When I   first 23 came up there, you know, there were --  the 24 neighborhood was very, you know, very run  down.25 And you know, I provided a very nice  accommodation 4 
2 at a reasonable price.	You know, it' s just -- I3 just can' t understand why you don' t increase the 4 rent.5 And obviously the costs go up,  you 6 know, the real estate as gone up a lot. The   oil,7 the water and sewer, electricity, you know,  the 8 cost of labor, apart from my own, which is,  you 9 know, I' m not charging anybody.10 But it' s just absurd to me that 11 you don' t give the same rent increase for an  SRO,12 which actually our costs increase more for the  SRO 13 than they do for a rent stabilized  apartment.14 MS. HOLDER:	I' m sorry.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I think we 16 have a question.17 MS. HOLDER:	I actually live in 18 Central Harlem.19 Where is your building, sir? And  I20 appreciate you coming to testify this  morning.21 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	I have one on 22 129 th Street between Fifth and Lenox and on 130 th 23 Street between Fifth and Lenox. I actually live  on 24 130 th Street as well.25 MS. HOLDER:	What' s the address 2 
2 of the one on 129 th?3 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	It' s 19 West 4 129 th Street.5 MS. HOLDER:	And what about the 6 one on 130 th?7 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	It' s 31 West 8	130 th.9	MS. HOLDER:	And you' re saying 10 all of those units are rent stabilized  SROs?11 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Yes.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	They' re hotel 13 stabilized.14 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Pardon?15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	They' re hotel 16 stabilized, right?17 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	You know,18 another thing is I don' t even know what you' re 19 talking about exactly when you say  hotel 20 stabilized.	I don' t -- I also know many different 21 people in the neighborhood who own SROs.	And I22 have to say that no one really knows exactly  what 23 the rules are and everybody is doing  something 24 different.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I understand 10 

2	that.3
MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Why don' t you 
4 have a clear policy and, you know, give  rent 5 increases based on actual increases in cost and  the 6 rate of inflation instead of some hokus pokus  panel 7 that, you know, I can' t -- I mean I' m sorry for --8 but I have been trying -- I tried to get a hold   of 9 this organization by e- mail over the past couple of 10 years. Nobody has answered me. There' s nobody to 11 talk to.	It' s basically something, you know, very 12 nefarious and it' s difficult to deal with.13 MS. HOLDER:	When you say that 14 everyone' s doing their own thing, what do you mean 15 by that?16 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	I' m saying 17 that no one understands what the rules are  and18 everyone is just doing different things on  their 19 own, different owners of SROs.20 MS. HOLDER:	Like what?21 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Well, some of 22 them are charging increases like as if it was  rent 23 stabilized apartment.	Other -- you know, I  mean 24 that' s one particular thing.	And, you know, and 25 actually most people are doing that.4 
2 MS. HOLDER:	And you said one of 3 your buildings are all hotels?4 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Yes. Nineteen 5 is all SROs.6 MS. HOLDER:	And how many units 7 is that?8 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	It' s fifteen 9 units.10 I' ve actually -- and another thing 11 is I just --12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. We got 13 another question from Mr. Languedoc.14 MS. HOLDER:	And how many units on 15 130 th Street are SROs or hotels?16 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	There are -- I17 think there is, it' s ten or eleven.18 MS. HOLDER:	And how many are 19 apartments?20 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Two.21 MS. HOLDER:	And what do they 22 rent for?23 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	The 24 apartments?25 MS. HOLDER:	Yes.2 
2 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	One is a3 floor- through apartment that the former owner had 4 rents for $ 1750 , which is actually relatively low.5 And the other apartment is a studio apartment  that 6 rents for -- it just -- the rent just  went up.	I7 think it' s $ 950 .8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And how much 9 do your SRO units rent  for?10 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Anywhere from 11 $ 60 a week up to $ 750 .12 MS. HOLDER:	$ 750 ?13 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	A month.14 MS. HOLDER:	A month?	That' s15 the highest?16 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Yes.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank 18 you.19 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Thank you.20 MS. CRUZ:	I have a quick 21 question.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Another 23 question here on the other  side.24 MS. CRUZ:	So let me just 25 understand your testimony.2 
2 You' re saying that because you' ve 3 not gotten or your type of owner has not gotten   a4 rent increase for many, many years and you don' t5 understand the rules, that basically  --6 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	I think I --  I7 think I understand the rules but I' m not  absolutely 8 positive because, you know --9 MS. CRUZ:	Right.10 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	But I know 11 that other -- because I know many other owners  in 12 the neighborhood, I know that they don' t understand 13 the rules.14 MS. CRUZ:	Right.	And what kind 15 of pressure does that put on you in managing  your 16 building?17 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Well,18 basically it' s -- you feel like, you know, what' s19 going on.	Why am I being punished, you know?  I20 mean on this particular building on 130 th Street,21 the real estates taxes, I think they went  from 22 $ 3400 to $ 11 , 000 in the last couple of years and 23 yet you don' t allow any increases.	Why?	I mean 24 -- and I also sometimes you have very  difficult 25 tenants that have been there for a long time  and 2 
2 you can' t raise the rent.	It creates a very 3 difficult situation.4 MS. CRUZ:	When you say a  very 5 difficult situation, can you describe the kinds  of 6 pressures that you confront specifically?7 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Well, nobody 8 likes -- nobody likes, you know, having to pay  out 9 for other people without getting some kind  of 10 compensation.11 MS. CRUZ:	Okay.	Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I have a14 question.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Another 16 question. We have another question.17 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I just have a18 question.19 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Sure.20 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Because you said 21 that -- you said that you pay electricity  for 22 the --23 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Yes.24 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Were you aware 25 that you have the right under the law to convert  to 2 

2	individual -- 3
MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Yes, I do. But 
4 some of these are -- you know, some of them   are 5 very small rooms, you know.	I mean and it' s like 6 having, you know -- I mean it would create  other 7 difficulties.8 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Right.	But still 9 legally you could do that.10 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	I could, I11 could, but it might cost me $ 40 , 000 , you know.12 MR. LANGUEDOC:	You could get an 13 MCI increase for that.14 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	How long is it 15 going to take me to get that money  back?16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	Why -- why are 18 costs not compensated for?	How can this Board tell 19 us that there should be no increases for SROs  while 20 everybody knows how much the costs have gone  up.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.22 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	What' s the 23 reason for that?24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider,25 go ahead.4 

23	question.45	question, sure.6
MR. LARS WESTVIND:	That' s my MR. SCHLEIDER:	Just one quick How many tourists do you  have 
7 living in your hotel to give you  --8 MR. LARS WESTVIND:	I don' t have 9 any tourists in my hotel.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 Ann Messner.13 MS. ANN MESSNER:	It' s over my 14 head.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I think we 16 should have everybody line up in sized places  so 17 that we can --18 MS. ANN MESSNER:	Does that mean 19 short is first?20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.21 Go ahead.22 MS. ANN MESSNER:	Hi! Good 23 morning.24 My name is Ann Messner. I am  a25 tenant at the Lower East Side. I' ve lived on 7 
2 Clinton Street since 1982 .3 This is the first	time I  am testifying 4 in front	of you	and	I ' m doing	so because	I ' ve 5 reached sort	of an incomprehensible	situation 6 with how	I live	and	what I do  in New	York .7 I am a member	of the	arts community .8 I ' m not somebody	who has put profit	before	how	I9 do my work however . So I have	maintained	a rent 10 stabilized apartment on Clinton Street . I have	a11 studio	in Williamsburg . And I pay	both rents . I12 have since 1982 , paying	the increases as they 13 come .14 The	last couple of years	the numbers 15 have begun to not crunch for me  in terms	of , you 16 know , all	the bills	that I have to pay  for 17 including	rent . The	studio	is not	stabilized 18 obviously .19 And	the	reason	I ' m in front	of you	is 20 because if my rent	- and , again , I ' m speaking to 21 you appropriately only	about the	rent stabilized 22 rent -  if my rent continues to increase	the 23 amount	that	it has , at some point	in the	near 24 future	I will have	to make	the	decision : Am I25 giving	up my home ,  am I giving	up my studio .2 
2 And	I ' m now sixty	years	old	and	I3 hadn ' t imagined	that that	is where I would	find 4 myself	after	a lifetime	of diligent	work . That ' s5 not where	I  imagined myself to be .6 Now	- - so , that ' s one thing .7 The	other	thing , which I - - just a8 brief	narrative	about my building . About	four 9 years	ago	it was	sold . I don ' t know	who	the	new 10 owner	is . It ' s turned into	a 42 Property 11 Corporation . And	the tenants one	by one	were 12 approached and were	offered buyouts .13 At this	point	- -  that was starting 14 about	four years	ago . At this	point	I am one of 15 only - - there were	seventeen units . At this	point 16 I am one	of six	tenants	remaining	in the 17 building .18 I was approached	for	a buyout . I have 19 no intention	of taking	a buyout because	that ' s20 where	I live . I don ' t want	to move . That	is my 21 home .22 So I live	basically	in an abandoned 23 building , only six	tenants .24 I know	that they ' re planning - - and 25 I ' ve heard people talk	about this	throughout the 2 
2 morning - - that	their plan	is to renovate , you 3 know , turn the , convert	the building	into co - ops .4 But	since	like	the way it ' s developing 5 in terms	of the	rent increases	or this , there ' s6 no place	for	me to go . I like	where	I live . I7 like my life . I like what	I do . I think	I ' m a8 valuable	member	of the	community .9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .10 We have	a question .11 MS . LEVINE :	I have	- -12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Risa .13 MS . LEVINE :	- - a couple	- - just a14 quick	number	of questions .15 How	big	is  your apartment ?16 MS . ANN	MESSNER :	Not - - what	do you 17 mean " how	big ? "18 MS . LEVINE :	How	many bedrooms ?19 MS . ANN	MESSNER :	I have two 20 bedrooms .21 MS . LEVINE :	And	what ' s your rent ?22 MS . ANN	MESSNER :	My rent	is $ 800	for 23 my apartment .24 MS . LEVINE :	And	what was the number 25 - - what was	the	buyout	offer ?2 
2 MS . ANN	MESSNER :	Excuse me ?3 MS . LEVINE :	And	what was the buyout 4 offer ? What ' s the number that	the	landlord	- -5 MS . ANN	MESSNER :	The buyout offer 6 that I was offered	was	$ 170 , 000 .7 MS . LEVINE :	Thank you .8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Go ahead .9 Do you	have a question ?10 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Did	you	say	that there 11 were - - did	I understand you to say	that	there 12 were vacant	apartments ?13 MS . ANN	MESSNER :	Most	of the 14 building	is vacant .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	The eleven 16 apartments that	were vacated remained vacant .17 MS . ANN	MESSNER :	Yes . And	the 18 storefront is vacant . It ' s increasingly	become 19 more and	more vacant .20 The	one	thing	I want	to add	is that 21 historically	in the	building the	tenants 22 obviously	sort of agreed to  do their	own	work .23 For instance , the landlord	has	never	painted my 24 apartment . There	are new windows	that I25 personally put in . They ' ve never	really	done 2 
2 anything . And that	was	just sort	of the 3 agreement , that	we  would fix our	own	apartments .4 Anyway	- -5 That ' s probably not	the	way	things	are 6 usually done	but	that is how artists	homesteaded 7 that neighborhood .8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .9 MS . ANN	MESSNER :	You ' re welcome .10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .11 ( Audience	participation . )12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Marty	Rosenman .13 MR . MARTY	ROSENMAN :	Hello ! I ' m14 Martin	Rosenman . I ' m here	from	the Stuyvesant 15 Energy	Company . We sell	oil and natural	gas .16 And	I wanted to just	present one of 17 the peripheral hardships to landlords .18 You ' ve all	been inundated , I ' m sure ,19 with price schedules , all	sorts of graphs about 20 what ' s happened	with the price of energy	over the 21 last year .22 But	how	this will	impact	for the 23 following	season	real estate is that	with the 24 price	doubling since last	June , any	receivable 25 that an energy company	has	that ' s sixty	days will 2 
2 be the	equivalent of a hundred	and twenty days 3 next season . There ' s no energy	company that	can 4 carry	that .5 So the	only way a company can exist  is 6 to squeeze the landlord , co - op owner , to pay 7 faster . And	it ' s survival . The	banks	are	not 8 doubling	our	lines	of credit and	that ' s the	only 9 place	we can	go to .10 We ' ve tried to have	some	of the 11 customers	that are	past	due clean	up their	bills 12 by July , start budgeting in August because 13 regrettably	seventy - three	percent	of the	energy 14 usage	is over four	months , December	through 15 March . Real	estate	can ' t even	get	into a  position 16 to be able to budget . And	it ' s a regrettable 17 situation .18 I ' ve lived	through the seventies and 19 eighties	with embargoes . This	is the	worst	I ' ve 20 ever seen	it .21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Any questions ?22 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr . Chair ?23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Go ahead , Mr .24 Schleider .25 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Thank you , sir , for 2 
2 coming	down	and	testifying .3 And	it ' s a very dire	situation .4 The	landlords	that can ' t meet your 5 credit	terms , does	that	increase	the	expense for 6 all landlords ?7 MR . MARTY	ROSENMAN :	Well , if you 8 can ' t meet our credit terms , the	problem	that I9 see for next	year is that	- - we deal	mostly	in 10 commercial or multi - dwelling real	estate .11 If they	can ' t pay	- - well , I ' ll get to 12 that - - if they	can ' t pay , we are	not going	to be 13 able to carry them .  So where do they	go to get 14 their	energy ?15 MR . SCHLEIDER :	My question goes	to ,16 if you	can ' t carry	them , and you	have business 17 costs , you have	ongoing	business	costs , does that 18 make your	business	need	to increase	your	price	- -19 MR . MARTY	ROSENMAN :	Without a doubt .20 We ' re working	- - regrettably , this 21 industry	works on a cents	per	gallon	margin , not 22 a percent . If we worked	on a percentage	increase ,23 if something	was	a $ 1 . 00 and then	it ' s $ 4 . 00 we 24 would	be making	four times	the	amount of  money .25 Regrettably , if an item	costs ninety 2 
2 cents	and	we  charged a ten	cent markup , that ' s3 wonderful	at ninety	cents , at three	dollars	we ' re 4 still	charging the	same	ten cents . So our 5 interest	expense	has gone	way	up .6 And	I speak for all	of us in  the 7 industry . Our extension	to bad	debts	has	gone way 8 up and	obviously	our cost	has	gone up with	the 9 cost of diesel fuel	and	the normal inflation  in 10 operating	a business . So we have	to pass	that on 11 to real estate .12 So it ' s like a double whammy . The 13 price	of energy	has	gone up , the	margins	that we 14 operate we ' ll have	to add	to that .15 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Okay .16 So if the	landlords	today are saddled 17 with these extraordinarily	high fuel	expenses ,18 the percentage of landlords that	can ' t make	that 19 and put stress on your	business , then you have	to 20 then move	that extra cost	load	onto	your	other 21 customers . And even	if the	customers	that 22 couldn ' t pay	today	can	eventually	catch	up , they 23 are still	going	to bearing	the	brunt	of that 24 extra	layer	of credit cost	that you ' ve incurred .25 So it keeps spiraling up .2 

23	than that .4
MR . MARTY	ROSENMAN :	It ' s even	worse The	ones that	can ' t catch up going 
5 into next	season , and it looks like	quite a bit ,6 I mean	we ' re prepared to drop	twenty - five to 7 thirty - five	percent	of our	business .8 Now , we ' ve been in business	since	1934 9 and it ' s a sad state of affairs that	we are	going 10 to have to walk	away from	almost	a third	of our 11 business .12 What perplexes	us and what	should	be a13 concern is where	does the	landlord go to get 14 energy . The	utilities will	cut	you off in  a15 minute . I mean we ' re not a utility . We ' re 16 basically	an oil	company .  Where is the landlord 17 going	to go if  he owes	X company	for	a hundred 18 and twenty days	and	we can ' t afford	to carry it 19 anymore , where does	he go to get	heat , oil	or 20 energy	for hot water and heat ? Where	does he go ?21 The tenants	certainly need	it . The landlord	needs 22 it to run	a building .23 It ' s a Catch 22 .24 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right .25 So then	you ' re telling us there ' s a5 
2 natural ceiling	to how	much credit expense	you 3 can layer	on to your cost	because	you have 4 competition	also	in your field . So your	result	- -5 your only	strategy	to preserve your	business is 6 to then drop	those	landlords that	are having real 7 difficulty in meeting the	fuel .8 MR . MARTY	ROSENMAN :	Correct .9 Everybody	in our	industry faces	the 10 same dilemma .11 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Thank you .12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Any additional ?13 ( No response . )14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .15 ( Audience	participation . )16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Sandra Rivera .17 Followed by Robert Spitalnick ,18 Followed by Melvin Edelstein ,19 Followed by Jessica	Anderson .20 Sandra	Rivera .21 MS . SANDRA	RIVERA :	Good	morning .22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Good	morning .23 MS . SANDRA	RIVERA :	I brought	this 24 young	man	here today . I did prepare	myself	for 25 over thirty - one	years living at Independent 2 
2 Plaza , being	an active	member	as a tenant living 3 there	for	over thirty - one	years .4 Today , Independent Plaza	is in the 5 Supreme Court pending a J - 51 process	with the 6 Article 78 .7 I can go on and  on about	what America 8 has taught me as a Latina , working , going to 9 school , working , going	to school , working , going 10 to school , and then	work hard	enough	to save the 11 money	to live in Independent Plaza for thirty - one 12 years .13 Today I am a worker . I ' m a case	worker 14 with three degrees	trying	to help	young	adults	-15 that ' s why I brought this	young man	here	today	-16 because I want the	Board to understand that	when 17 Hillary Clinton	was	speaking about and  writing 18 about	generations or that	we are	communities ,19 that we love	each other , and I looked up  an 20 African proverb	that said	" a village	without 21 generations	of families	is like a tree  without 22 roots . "23 Now , this	is a part	of our	roots , a24 young	man , nineteen	years	old , his mom just 25 passed	away . And	I ' m very	personal with	it 2 
2 because I interview	young	men	and	women	like this 3 gentleman , that	are	losing	their	parents	by 4 illnesses	that they	don ' t know	about	- cancer , I5 mean so many	different	diseases out	there , AIDS 6 and other	conditions that	if I bring	a medical 7 doctor , he wouldn ' t even know	how	to  explain it .8 So today I ' m giving	him	the	time to 9 express himself	so like	that Board Members ,10 public	members , tenant	members , chairman , and 11 everyone	else a part of  this America	understand 12 that young people need	your help .13 And	we can ' t continue to pay the 14 escalation of rents .15 And , yes , landlords	are	saying	they 16 can ' t afford	it because	of the	escalations , but 17 what about our future , our	generations of 18 children	that cannot continue	to pay	this ?19 And	if you	raise	the	rent one more 20 time , this individual will	be a homeless 21 individual . And	we have	over 35 , 000	children 22 right	now	in foster	care waiting	for	someone to 23 take them	out of those	little	cubicles that	you 24 call homes for children .25 So I ' m going to give	him	just a minute 2 
2 if everybody	will allow	him to speak .3 Thank you .4 MR . JONATHAN LOADHOLT :	How	are	you 5 doing ?6 I ' m Jonathan Loadholt ,7 J - o - n - a - t - h - a - n , that ' s my first	name , last	name , 8	L - o - a - d - h - o - l - t . 9 A VOICE :	Talk	louder .10 A VOICE :	Can	you	please	speak	up .11 JONATHAN LOADHOLT :	Sorry .12 My name	is Jonathan	Loadholt . I live 13 at 1404 New	York	Avenue	in Brooklyn , New	York , 14	11210 .15 I was living there with	my mother ,16 Chantay Loadholt , until	her - - I ' m sorry , excuse 17 me , this	is taking	a lot from	me - - untimely 18 death	- I ' m sorry , I apologize	- May	7 , 2008 . I19 was there	for about	all	my life .20 I ' m here pleading	for the right	to 21 take over	her Section 8  so that I  can continue	to 22 live there , the	only home	I had ever	known . But 23 they ' re telling	me - - they ' re telling me that I24 can ' t because I don ' t exist . And	I have	proof 25 that I do . I ' m on her Section	8 lease . I ' m on the 15 
2 lease , I ' m on the voucher	and	everything	like 3 that .4 I presented this	to them	and they ' re 5 not trying to hear	me at all .6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Are you	talking	the 7 Housing Authority ?8 MR . JONATHAN LOADHOLT :	Yes , sir , I9 am .10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We ' re not the right 11 forum . I think you	probably understand that .12 This is an individual case	that	the 13 Housing Authority should be - -14 MS . SANDRA	RIVERA :	Right .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You know , we ' re 16 happy	to help , but	this	is not	something	that 17 we ' re in charge	of .18 MS . SANDRA	RIVERA :	This is the 19 reason	why I brought him here , Chairman .20 I brought	him	here for you	to 21 understand that	children are being homeless 22 overnight	because of the rent . He has to  pay 23 nine hundred	and	something	dollars , and	his 24 father , who	does	not live	with	him , has	to pay 25 child	support $ 66 a week .2 
2 And	now	because his	mother	is 3 deceased , he might	not	receive	that	without	a4 hearing , and	that might	take three or four 5 months .6 But	I brought	him	here as an example .7 I have	plenty	notes	here . I could	have 8 just wrote another	page	for you that	I ' m sure 9 that you ' re aware of the escalation	of rent . But 10 I want	you to understand that	if you	raise	the 11 rent , if you	raise	this	increase , for landlords 12 to get	an increase , there	are	children that	are 13 being	affected every single day . You	have over 14 35 , 000	children	and	it includes this	young	man ,15 age nineteen , on the list .16 If you	raise the	rents , this child	and 17 over 35 , 000	children will	be homeless .18 And	right	now	- -19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We a  question here .20 MS . HOLDER :	Not	a question . Go ahead .21 Finish .22 I wanted to ask , I don ' t even know	if 23 the young	man is finished	with	his testimony .24 What you ' re saying is you live	in a25 rent stabilized	apartment	and	you	have a housing 2 
2 choice	voucher that	helps	to make	that apartment 3 affordable ; and	even as the - - I ' m assuming ,4 you ' ll tell	me if I ' m correct	- - I ' m assuming 5 that as the	rent	goes up , the	housing choice 6 voucher does	not	so  then there is  also going to 7 be a gap	in terms of what	your	contribution	will 8 be which	will increase	and	probably	go above 9 thirty	percent of your	increase .10 MR . JONATHAN LOADHOLT :	Yes , ma ' am .11 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .12 And	right	now	you ' re having	trouble 13 getting that	voucher to be allowed  to transfer	to 14 you so that	you	could be the beneficiary	of that 15 voucher .16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	I think Legal	Aid 17 should	take	this	case .18 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .19 Well , I ' m sure	Legal	Aid	or Legal 20 Services	would like	to take the case .21 Of course , there ' s always an issue	of 22 capacity	because	we can	talk about the thousands 23 of children	and	other folks in his situation   that 24 we don ' t have the capacity	to represent .25 But	are	you finished	with your 2 
2 statement , young	man , because	we would like	to 3 hear from	you ?4 You	finished ?5 MR . JONATHAN LOADHOLT :	Yes , ma ' am .6 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .7 I also , having	been	at the	Legal Aid 8 Society , I wanted to ask both	of you . We also see 9 the phenomenon of children	aging	out	of foster 10 care . And	although	people	like	to think	that our 11 young	people	in the	community	that age out	of 12 foster	care	have	other	types of subsidies and 13 assistance , they	oftentimes do not . And	that 14 safety	net for them	is quite " holey , " if you 15 will , and	people	fall through	it .16 What are you seeing	in terms of some 17 of the	children	who	are	aging	out	of foster	care 18 and their	ability to secure housing	for 19 themselves ?20 MS . SANDRA	RIVERA :	What I ' m seeing 21 is that when	the	child	is fifteen , sixteen , all 22 the way up to eighteen , ready	to go to college ,23 unable	to go to college	because their foster 24 mother	who raised them	does not have	enough	money 25 to save for	them	to go to college .2 
2 So that	derails them . This	individual 3 is trying	to stay in school . Now	he ' s confronted 4 with the	only sole	parent	passing	away and	has	a5 lot of changes , rapid changes .6 MS . HOLDER :	And	what happens to those 7 foster	care	children who never received	a foster 8 care placement ?9 MS . SANDRA	RIVERA :	Oh , they go right 10 into the	system	called	welfare	and right	into 11 programs	that - - or , yes , jail , correct , jail ,12 because they	don ' t have	a family .13 They are generation - to - generation 14 families . They don ' t know	who	they are . They only 15 know that	they ' re black , Hispanic , white , Asian ,16 whatever .17 I mean	we ' re talking	about	race . We 18 should	talk	about the human part	of our	lives .19 People	are human	out here	and	they are being 20 dropped off	like	they ' re bubble gum .21 Children are having	children and 22 leaving them	in the	hospitals	because they	have 23 no affordable housing available for	them .24 MS . HOLDER :	Young man , is there 25 anything	else that	you	wanted	to say ?2 
2 MR . JONATHAN LOADHOLT :	She	spoke	for 3 me enough . She is saying everything	that	I feel 4 and that	I ' m going	through	right	now . I just 5 asked	for	the time	for	you	guys to hear	her	and 6 me .7 Thank you .8 MS . HOLDER :	Thank you .9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you . We 10 appreciate it . Thank you .11 ( Audience	participation . )12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Robert Spitalnick ;13 followed	by - -14 MR . ROBERT	SPITALNICK :	Good morning .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Hold	on a second .16 - - followed by Melvin Edelstein ;17 Jessica	Anderson ;18 Janet Ziff ; and 19 Elizabeth	Crane .20 Go ahead .21 MR . ROBERT	SPITALNICK :	Good morning ,22 Mr . Chairman , and Members	of the	Board .23 I am a  small property owner . My wife 24 and I are	partners . We own	nine buildings 25 throughout the City , Brooklyn	and	Manhattan ,2 
2 walk - ups , and one elevator	building	in Sheepshead 3 Bay , Brooklyn . That ' s a seventy - one	unit 4 building .  Most of the tenants	there	are	Russian .5 Ninety - nine	percent	of them are rent	stabilized .6 Some of them	pay	full rent	stabilized rents , some 7 of them pay	concessionary	rents under the amount 8 allowed by rent	stabilization .9 Some of the tenants	in that	building 10 are SCRIE	tenants . Some	of them are	Section	811 tenants .12 We have	a  building in Sunset Park 13 where	the	average rent	in my estimation	is about 14 $ 800 a month . The tenants	- - if we can get	the 15 rent stabilized	rent from	them , we ' re fortunate .16 We have	buildings	on the	Upper	East 17 Side of Manhattan where , if we have	the 18 opportunity , we renovate apartments . But	the only 19 reason	we renovate	apartments , and this	is a fact 20 of life in this	City , is to get the	apartments 21 out of this	system .22 Where - - I ' ve been sitting	here	for an 23 hour now	listening	to the	testimony	and	I very 24 much sympathize	with the stories	of the	tenants 25 who say they	can ' t afford	to pay	the	rents .2 
2 The	question I  have , and	it ' s3 something	that Ms . Holder	spoke to earlier , we 4 have a system here	that	really	doesn ' t benefit 5 anybody . It doesn ' t benefit the owners . The 6 owners	cannot make	ends	meet . We are	a customer ,7 I ' m a customer of Stuyvesant Fuel	Oil . I have a8 building	which uses	oil	with Stuyvesant	our 9 supplier . And I was	in my office	this morning and 10 we received	a bill	from	Stuyvesant for a  balance 11 of  over $ 6000 on  that building from	oil	bills 12 going	back to January that	were $ 40 , 000 . And I ' m13 still	paying	for	this past	winter ' s fuel	bills 14 because I don ' t have the cashflow	to make those 15 payments .16 And	so we are	going	to make	that 17 payment this	month	and	hopefully	Stuyvesant	will 18 give us credit for	next	year . But	God knows	what 19 happens if they	don ' t .20 Now , that ' s a fact . We ' re suffering 21 under	the	system . Everyone	suffers under	the 22 system .23 And	really	the	reason that	everyone 24 suffers under the system is because	it ' s based 25 upon false economies . It doesn ' t work . And	the 2 
2 only real	economy that	I submit would work	is to 3 put everything in the fair	market	and let the 4 rents	be what they	would be like	everybody	else .5 It seems to me that	it ' s the owners 6 who have	to subsidize the	tenants	that can ' t pay 7 their	rent . Why	that is , why it  is that	the	fuel 8 companies	are not subsidizing	anybody , why	- -9 everybody	goes into	the	store	and	they can	buy 10 milk . Nobody	says they	can ' t charge	what	they 11 need for	milk .12 There are	food	shortages	around	the 13 world , fuel	shortages around the	world , and	we 14 are the ones	who	have to compensate	the	tenants .15 So I wrap	up by requesting	that	on the 16 issue	of fuel , that	there	be a fuel	increase this 17 year and	that we get reasonable increases , and 18 hopefully	sometime	in the	near	future the powers 19 that be in Albany will	eliminate	this unfair 20 system .21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .22 ( Audience	participation . )23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Any questions ?24 ( No response . )25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .2 
 2 Question . Sorry .3 MR . LANGUEDOC : Hi !4 Could you	tell	us how many	units you 5 own ? You	said you own nine	buildings . How many 6 units	in total ?7 MR . ROBERT	SPITALNICK :	About	two 8 hundred units .9 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Two	hundred	units .10 And	what ' s the	spread of  like between 11 the highest	and	the	lowest	rents ?12 MR . ROBERT	SPITALNICK :	Well , we have 13 tenants that	are	fair market that	are paying over 14	$ 2500 .15 We have	tenants that	are	- - and	the 16 reason	that	they	pay that	is because	we were able 17 to - -  we invested in those	apartments a18 significant	amount	of money , not	from profits ,19 but we ' ve had to go into our own	savings	and 20 hopefully	see that	money back	over the long 21 period	of time .22 MR . LANGUEDOC :	So how many	of these 23 two hundred	units are rent	stabilized ?24 MR . ROBERT	SPITALNICK :	Eighty 25 percent .15 
 2 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Okay .3 And	of the	rent stabilized	units , of 4 these , I guess , 160	rent stabilized	units , what ' s5 the highest	and	the	lowest	rents	that you - -6 MR . ROBERT	SPITALNICK :	The	highest ,7 approximately $ 1500 / $ 1600	a month , and the	lowest 8 are as low as  $ 800	a month . And we have	a9 smattering of rent	controlled	apartments	that pay 10 as low	as $ 250 a month .11 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Okay .12 So the	lowest	rent stabilized rent	is 13	$ 800 .14 MR . ROBERT	SPITALNICK :	That ' s15 correct .16 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Okay . Thank	you .17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you , sir .18 Melvin	Edelstein .19 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	I appear 20 before	you today	as a tenant of 444	East	82 nd 21 Street	in Manhattan	and	a member	of its	tenants 22 committee .23 Although landlords request	a24 significant	increase as a result	of increased 25 operating	expenses , when determining	that 14 
2 increase , it is important	to take	into 3 consideration their	increased	ability to pay for 4 these	expenses from	increased	income .5 My father , who	owned	two 6 rent - controlled	apartment	houses	in Brooklyn from 7 the 1940 s through the 1960 s , could not benefit 8 from the	measures subsequently	passed by the New 9 York State Legislature	to gradually	eliminate 10 rent control	and	rent stabilization , measures 11 that have	significantly	increased	landlords '12 income .13 One , luxury and vacancy	decontrol .14 Has	the	Rent Guidelines	Board 15 conducted	a  study of the number of apartments 16 that have	been removed	from rent	stabilization 17 and rent	control	during	the past	year or two - -18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Yes .19 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	- - as a result 20 of luxury	decontrol	and	vacancy decontrol ?21 Has	the	Board	studied the increases  in 22 the rent	rolls ?23 As of October	4 , 2007 , 163	out	of 415 24 apartments in my building , or about	two - fifths	of 25 all the apartments , had	been decontrolled .2 
2 How	did	that happen ?3 Considering the high	turnover in 4 tenants in my building , the rent	quickly	exceeds 5 $ 2 , 000	per month . This	change	is abetted	by the 6 landlord ' s ability	to raise the rent	by twenty 7 percent for	a two - year	lease for	new	tenants in 8 vacant	apartments and the	possibility of making 9 improvements	in vacant	apartments	and then 10 increasing the rent	permanently by 1 / 40 th of the 11 total	cost of the improvement .12 Furthermore , it is not very	difficult 13 today	for	a two - income	family	to earn more	than 14 $ 175 , 000	a year , the other	part of that	couplet .15 A one - bedroom	apartment	currently 16 rents	for	over $ 3 , 000 a month . Apartment	17 - C on 17 my floor	just rented for over	$ 3200	a month .18 Two - bedroom	apartments	rent for close to  $ 6000	a19 month .20 Major Capital	Improvements	( MCIs ) .21 Our	landlord recently received	an MCI ,22 which	translated	into a permanent	increase	in the 23 rent of all	rent	stabilized apartments . He will 24 certainly	ask for more .25 Because	of the	time	I ' m going to speed 2 
2 it up . Okay ?3 Another	thing	is three - year	leases 4 have been	eliminated . Now	we only	have two - year 5 leases . In a five - year	period	you	now have	- -6 ten - year	period	you	have five	rent increases . It 7 used to be three	in a nine - year period .8 Concessions .9 The	landlord in our	building has three 10 major	concessions : An antenna	on the	roof , a11 garage	- -12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Could	you wrap	up ,13 please ?14 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	Yes . Okay .15 In my opinion	the	Board	should	take 16 into consideration	not	simply	the	increases	in 17 the landlord ' s operating expenses , which	I do not 18 deny - I would be absurd  to deny	it - but I19 absolutely think	that the	Board should take	into 20 consideration the landlord ' s ability	to pay	and 21 the fact	that gradually	rent stabilization	and 22 rent control	are	being	eliminated .23 And	I would point	to the	fact that	the 24 State	Assembly just	passed	a package	of bills 25 which	have addressed the concerns	of the	tenant ,2 
2 including	abolishing rent	vacancy	decontrol ,3 adjusting	the limits for the rent	- -4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .5 Any	questions ?6 Mr . Languedoc .7 MR . LANGUEDOC :	All	right .8 Obviously	I think	we all	get the 9 point	that this	is a very	profitable	building ,10 this particular	- -11 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	Yes , it is .12 MR . LANGUEDOC :	- - building .13 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	And	it ' s not 14 atypical , the other	point .15 MR . LANGUEDOC :	I agree .16 How	many rent	stabilized	units	are 17 left in this	building ?18 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	Okay .19 Well , I just - -20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Sixty	percent .21 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	Right .22 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Sixty percent ?23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Yes . Forty percent 24 according	to the	testimony .25 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	According	to 2 
2 the - - these	are	the landlord ' s figures , not 3 mine , by the	way .4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Well , okay .5 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Well , according	to the 6 landlord ' s figures	sixty percent	are	rent 7 stabilized .8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Correct .9 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	No - - yes ,10 sixty	percent are rent	stabilized .11 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Out	of how	many	units 12 total ?13 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	Okay . There 14 were 415	apartments	- - there are	415	apartments 15 in the	building .16 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Okay .17 So that	sixty	percent - -18 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	Thirty - five 19 story , and another	wing	seventeen	stories .20 MR . LANGUEDOC :	So approximately 250 21 rent stabilized	apartments .22 And	do we know	what	the	ranges	of the 23 rents	are	for those	250	rent stabilized 24 apartments ?25 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	I can give	you 2 
2 mine . I currently pay $ 1890 . 01 for a two - bedroom 3 apartment .4 MR . SCHLEIDER :	On the Upper East 5 Side ?6 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	This is on 7 East 82 nd Street	between First Avenue and York 8 Avenue . Yes .9 MR . SCHLEIDER :	A doorman building ?10 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	A doorman 11 building , absolutely .12 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Do you have	a terrace ?13 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	Excuse	me ?14 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Do you have	a terrace ?15 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	A terrace , no .16 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Views of the river ?17 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	I ' m sorry .18 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Views of the river	or 19 a cultural - -20 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	No , I have	no 21 view of the	river .22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Just	a street line .23 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	In fact , I24 have obstructed	views .25 MS . HOLDER :	Do you	know	what your 2 
 2 neighbors	pay ?3 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	My neighbors ?4 No , I don ' t . I simply know	that	there 5 are many	tenants	in the	building	who	are	like 6 myself	and my wife , we ' re retired	university 7 professors . We live	on Social	Security and 8 pensions . We ' ve lived in the building for 9 thirty - one years	and many	of us are	close to that 10 $ 2000	threshold .11 In my case	I won ' t be - - have luxury 12 decontrol	because our income will	never	get	to 13	$ 175 , 000	a year .14 But	others , I have no idea .15 But	the	main point is we ' re  in danger 16 because of the rapid increase	in rents of hitting 17 that $ 2000 threshold and having a much  larger 18 percentage of the apartments decontrolled . And 19 that means essentially	that people who have 20 contributed	to the	community , who	worked	all 21 their	lives	and	who	are	now on pensions	and 22 Social	Security	are	going	to end	up having	to 23 leave	the	City .24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	What	subject	did 25 you teach ?14 
2 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	History , my 3 specialty	being	the	French	Revolution .4 ( Laughter . )5 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	Had	nothing to 6 do with housing	or rent	control .7 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Which side ?8 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	I would	like 9 to mention - -10 ( Audience	participation . )11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	The French 12 Revolution .13 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	I ' d just like 14 to mention - -15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay .16 We want	to be overthrown , by the way .17 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	No , no . I ' m18 not asking that	the	Board	be guillotined . Don ' t19 worry .20 No . I would like	to mention	something 21 which	might	surprise you . As I said , my father 22 owned	two	rent controlled	buildings	in Brooklyn .23 I have	enormous	sympathy for the	small property 24 owners , which my father	was one . He always , by 25 the way , felt that	all	politicians were 2 
2 Communists because	no one	would do anything	for 3 people	like	him .4 So - -5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	So you had a6 balanced	upbringing .7 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	That ' s8 probably	why	I went	into the French	Revolution .9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .10 MR . MELVIN	EDELSTEIN :	Dealing	with 11 social	justice .12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you , Mr .13 Edelstein .14 MR . SCHLEIDER :	It ' s a matter of 15 opinion .16 ( Audience	participation . )17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Jessica	Anderson .18 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	Hello !19 Thank you	for	letting me  talk .20 I became a landlord	sort	of by 21 accident . I lived or I bought	my first home	in 22 Queens	in a co - op building . The corporation	had	a23 landlord	walk away	from	his rent	stabilized 24 apartments and the	corporation , meaning	all	the 25 shareholders , suddenly	became	landlords .2 
2 The	first	thing we did is we   offered 3 all the tenants	their apartments	for	free . They 4 could	take ownership of their	apartments	for 5 free . Four out of the six	refused , actually	five 6 out of the six refused	because	they ' re paying 7 under	$ 600 a month	and	our	maintenances	are 8 $ 1000 . And our maintenance	is a $ 1000 because we 9 have to pay	the	mortgage . We have	to pay	the 10 fuel .  We have to pay the water .11 They didn ' t want	to basically pay	what 12 it takes	to live	in the	building	and	were content 13 to let	their	neighbors	pick up the slack .14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	All right . So 15 you ' ve got six units in your - -16 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	Six	units	out 17 of a sixteen - unit building . It ' s two	- -18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	So ten units	- -19 it ' s a co - op or condo ? Co - op ?20 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	Co - op .21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	So ten units	are 22 paying	- -23 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	For	sixteen .24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Because	the	other 25 six are rent	stabilized .2 
2 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	Well , fifteen ,3 because one	accepted ownership .4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay .5 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	Our	fuel	bill 6 last year	was $ 35 , 000 . This year	it ' s already 7	$ 35 , 000 .8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	So your	point is 9 that the	co - op owners should not	be subject	to 10 stabilization or should	get fair	increases .11 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	We should	get 12 fair increases .13 And	basically	we ' re all	working 14 people . Some	of the	owners	are	retirees . My 15 husband works in the school system . We ' re not 16 wealthy . We can ' t afford to subsidize our 17 neighbors .18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay .19 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	We can ' t20 afford	to pay their	taxes	and	rent .21 MR . SCHLEIDER :	A quick	question .22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Any questions ?23 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Yes .24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mr . Schleider .25 MR . SCHLEIDER :	So in a co - op where 8 
2 your maintenance	doesn ' t allow for any profit ,3 this is just	pure operational	- -4 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	No , it doesn ' t5 allow	for	any profit .6 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- - expenses .7 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	Yes .8 MR . SCHLEIDER :	So here	is an example 9 of  a landlord that	has	pure operational	expenses 10 well above what	the	rent stabilized	tenancy	pays .11 I think this	speaks	volumes .12 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	Yes .13 A VOICE :	Open	your	books . Apply for a14 hardship	increase .15 ( Audience	participation . )16 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	It ' s very 17 difficult	to get	a  hardship increase .18 ( Audience	participation . )19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	All right .20 There ' s no debate	with the	audience .21 Ma ' am , no audience debate . I ' m sorry .22 But we can ' t take questions from	the	audience .23 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	Are	there	any 24 other	questions ?25 I mean	we ' ve already	had	an 2 
2 assessment . We ' ve already	assessed for heat	$ 170 3 a month for	eight months and we still owe $ 17 , 000 4 for fuel . We just had to  pay another	month ' s5 assessment .6 I can ' t keep going on like	this . I ' m7 going	to have to lose and	move	from	my first home 8 in this City .9 MR . KIMMEL :	I have	a question .10 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	Sure .11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Go ahead .12 Mr . Kimmel .13 MR . KIMMEL :	Okay .14 My understanding	of the	law	is  that a15 co - op owner	in this	situation	has	certain 16 options .17 First of all , you	could	go after the 18 sponsor who	defaulted on its obligations .19 Second	of all , you could	dissolve	the 20 co - op and	sell the	property .21 So - -22 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	Well , we could 23 - - the	solution	is selling	that , but	I want	to 24 live in my home . I don ' t see why	you	make it 25 legal	for	somebody	else	to basically	be 2 
 2 subsidized by their	neighbors .3 MR . SCHLEIDER :	That ' s a solution	from 4 the tenant advocate .5 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Well , it ' s not	- -6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Go ahead , Mr .7 Languedoc .8 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	I mean	- -9 MR . LANGUEDOC :	We can ' t do anything 10 about	the	fact that	the	sponsor defaulted on  its 11 obligation .12 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	Right .13 But	I understand	why	he defaulted .14 MR . LANGUEDOC :	We can ' t - -15 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	Would you	pay 16 out of your	pocket	for	five people ?17 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Well , look	at it this 18 way . If five	people	got	together	and	purchased	an 19 apartment	building	and , you know , one of them ,20 one or two of them	pulled	out , and so the other 21 three	were having a hard time , that	wouldn ' t be a 22	- -23		MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	So basically 24	- -25	MR . LANGUEDOC :	- - basis for us to 
2 grant	rent increases .3 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	So , basically 4 your advice	is that	I can	afford	a lawyer and go 5 after	the	old owner	and	persecute	him because he 6 didn ' t want	to keep	subsidizing five	other 7 people .8 MR . LANGUEDOC :	I ' m saying	that	you ' re 9 situation	is sympathetic , but	it ' s not under our 10 jurisdiction .11 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	It is .  If they 12 weren ' t paying $ 600	a month , they	would	have 13 taken	ownership . You ' re the one who	kept	the 14 rents	illegally	low .15 They had an opportunity	to be owners 16 and they	would have	been paying for	three - bedroom 17 and two - bedroom	apartments	basically	$ 1100	a18 month	and	$ 1000	a month .19 And	I don ' t think	there ' s anybody	here 20 who won ' t pay for a pre - War three - bedroom 21 apartment	$ 1100	or $ 1200 a month .22 MS . HOLDER :	Well , those	who can ' t23 afford	it .24 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	Well , I can ' t25 afford	it either . I mean you all	make ends	meet .2 
2MS . HOLDER :	I totally understand	what 3you are saying but	you	understand	the tension on 4the other	side .5MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	I do .6MS . HOLDER :	So I see everyday	people 7who can ' t afford	$ 1100 .8And	so , you know , again	the	tension is  9 as a Board we ' re being	asked to do the 10 impossible ,  which is to figure	out with	all	these 11 economic	pressures	on everybody where best	to 12 apply	the	pressure .13 And	I guess the issue  is untenable	and 14 it ' s not	one	that allows me  to sleep	at night .15 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	How	do you 16 know that	they can ' t afford it ? Do you have	their 17	W - 2 s ?18 MS . HOLDER :	Well	- - and	exactly . I19 guess	the	response	- -20 ( Audience	participation . )21 MS . HOLDER :	- - and	as a tenant	rep ,22 the response	that I would	have	is that how	do I23 know that	owners	- maybe not you , but perhaps 24 other	owners	- are	not	able to , you	know ,25 properly	run	and	maintain	and	run	their	business 18 

2	- -34
MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	Well , - -MS . HOLDER :	- - because	they have	not 
5 opened	their	books .6 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	Well , I ' d be 7 glad to open	UP our	books . I ' ll show	you	what we 8 pay .9 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr . Chair ?10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Yes .11 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Because	it ' s a co - op 12 and you have	securities , you ' re audited	each 13 year . So your books	are	open .14 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	Exactly .15 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Second , you	had	a big 16 spread	between what	the	rent regulated rent	was 17 and what	the	maintenance was .18 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	It is .19 MR . SCHLEIDER :	So there	was no 20 economic	incentive	for	these tenants	to  step up 21 and take	on a burden of ownership	because - -22 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	Exactly .23 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- - their	positive 24 leasehold	interest	is worth money	to them .25 Sorry . What you ' re saying is maybe 5 
2 they couldn ' t afford it . I don ' t see	that . I3 agree	with the speaker .4 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	Well , one	of 5 the people who can ' t afford it , he works	as a6 construction	worker .7 But	the	other	person	who	is in a  free 8 market	apartment , well , he ' s a landscaper . His 9 rent is triple what	the	construction	worker ' s is .10 Is there	that big a difference	between their jobs 11 from what	they pay ?12 Tenants	will talk	about	how	rents	for 13 people	are fifty	percent . But	it ' s not fifty 14 percent for	the	people	living	in  rent stabilized 15 apartments . It ' s fifty	percent	for the free 16 market	apartments .17 ( Audience	participation . )18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	No . That ' s a - -19thank you .We appreciate the testimony .20( Audience	participation . )21CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Janet	Ziff , please .22This is the order :23Janet Ziff ,24Followed by Elizabeth Crane ,25Followed by Mary	McCune ,
2Followed by Diana	Tomassetti ,3Followed by Catherine Hoeg ,4Followed by Martin Landsam .5Janet Ziff .6MS . HOLDER :	Excuse	me .7But	before	you	dismiss the	previous - -8A VOICE :	What	number are you up to ?9CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We ' ll answer	that 10in aminute .11Yes , ma ' am .12MS . HOLDER :	Before	you	dismiss	the 13 owner	who	had come , I mean	I think the fact	is 14 that often the statistics	that	you quoted in 15 terms	of how	much percentage of folks ' income 16 they are	paying	in their rent , we actually	have 17 the statistics and	we actually are basing it  on 18 rent stabilized	tenants .19 Absolutely	is the	case , because	rent 20 stabilized tenants , their	salaries have	remained 21 pretty	much	static . They ' ve only	gone up a  little 22bit .23And	our	own research	shows	that	of the 24Rent Guidelines	Board .25So I ' m not	quibbling	with you . I just 
 2 want to make	sure that	we are	clear	because	I3 know the	Chair has	kind	of , you know , wrapped you 4 up a little	bit	more quickly .5 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	I have no 6 problem - -7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You got	to go to 8 the mike . Got to go to the	mike .9 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	I thought I  was 10 done .11 MS . HOLDER :	Yeah . I understand .12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Yes . No such	luck .13 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	I have no 14 problem with	understanding	that people need	help .15 I just	don ' t see	why the help	should	be coming 16 from private	citizens when	it ' s the	City ' s job .17 ( Applause . )18 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	I understand 19 and sympathize that	people	can ' t afford	rents .20 But you don ' t know	that	about	all	of the	rent 21 stabilized apartments . There are	a lot of people 22	- -23 ( Audience	participation . )24 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	There are a  lot 25 of people	who can afford more	rent .23 
2 The	City itself , when they	have 3 subsidized apartments , they have	a request	for 4 W - 2 s and	they base	the	rent on that . And	they 5 base the	rent not only	on the	W - 2 of the	person 6 living	there , but their	adult	children working 7 there . And if there	are	people	living there 8 illegally , they	call HUD .9 Can ' t you	give	us landlords	the	same 10 ability ?11 ( Audience	participation . )12 MS . HOLDER :	We have	no control	over 13 that part .14 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	But	the	point 15 is is that you ' re basically allowing	private 16 citizens	- -17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	There	are many 18 things	we have no control	over	that	we get	talked 19 about , right ?20 MS . JESSICA ANDERSON :	I ' m sorry .21 Basically	you ' re allowing	private	citizens	to 22 have to pick	up the	City ' s responsibility . And 23 that ' s just	wrong .24 ( Audience	participation . )25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .2

JANET	ZIFF :	Eleven .9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Hold	on one	second .10 Let me answer this .11 People	needed	to pre - register . If you 12 pre - registered , you	come in at any time , we  take 13 your number	unless	we ' re past	your number .14 So we ' re only	up to number	eleven	on 15 tenants and	number	forty on owners . But	people 16 come in and	out .17 If you ' ve not	pre - registered , and	you 18 walked	in  and registered , you	are	going	to be 19 here a long , long time .20 Janet .21 MS .

2 heat and	hot	water	and	ask	that you	reinstate the 3 price	differential	for	tenants	like	myself	who 4 have to absorb the	fuel	increases	ourselves .5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We got you .6 We ' ll look	at it . And we ' ve done it in 7 the past , and we ' ll certainly	look at it this 8 year . We understand .9 MR . LANGUEDOC :	I have a question ?10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Go ahead .11 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Ms . Ziff , could	you 12 just tell	us approximately	how	much	have	you been 13 paying	for your	own	heat and hot	water ?14 MS .

MS . JANET	ZIFF :	No , I don ' t .MS . HOLDER :	- - is your	rent ? You	don ' t know ?MS . JANET	ZIFF :	Offhand I don ' tCHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .Elizabeth	Crane , please . ( Audience	participation . )MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	Good	morning . I have	copies	of my remarks	and	some 
12 documentation to distribute to  the Members	of the 13 Guidelines Board .14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	All right . We ' ll 15 get somebody	down . Go ahead . Why	don ' t you	start .16 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	Good	morning .17 Members	of the	Rent	Guidelines	Board ,18 my colleagues and members	of the	audience .19 My name	is Elizabeth	Crane	and	I am 20 proud	to stand here	before	you	at Cooper	Union ,21 where	my grandfather graduated	as a civil 22 engineer	in 1912 .23 He went	on  to purchase what	was	then 24 known	as Watson	Estates	and founded	Rosedale 25 Management Company	to build apartment buildings 12 
2 and put in streets	such	as Watson , Evergreen ,3 Wheeler and	Elder Avenues	in the	area now known 4 as Soundview .5 These apartment buildings are still  in 6 private hands and owned	by the	children ,7 grandchildren , great grandchildren and other 8 family	members of the original owners .9 And	Rosedale Management	Company ,10 founded in 1917 , is still	a family business	run 11 by my father , myself and my son .12 I come	before	you	today	because	I am 13 concerned	about	my continued ability	to manage 14 these	buildings	and	others	without reasonable 15 guideline	increases	and	increases	for long - term 16 tenants . I stand	before	you today	because I need 17 your help .18 I manage approximately 1200	units	in 19 eighteen	family - owned buildings built or 20 purchased	by my grandfather and my father in   the 21 Bronx , Brooklyn	and	Queens	and	in neighborhoods 22 such as Highbridge , Morris	Heights , Soundview ,23 Pelham	Parkway , Jamaica , Flatbush , Crown	Heights ,24 Marble	Hill , Inwood	and	Washington Heights .25 These are	or were	tough , proud	old 2 
2 neighborhoods , and	these are solid ,3 well - maintained , family	buildings	in these 4 neighborhoods with	few , if any , violations , no 5 mortgages . We maintain	heat , hot	water and	other 6 essential	services , no rent overcharge 7 complaints , compliance	with New York	City 8 building	codes and	we pay	all	of our	bills ,9 including	real estate taxes , payroll	expenses ,10 and water	bills	on a timely basis .11 And	therein lies	the	problem . Our 12 tenants are	comfortable	in their	apartments	and 13 with the	services that	we provide . As a result ,14 they stay . In fact , more than	fifty	percent	of 15 our tenants	have	been in their apartments for  ten 16 or more years and more	than twenty - five	percent 17 have been	in their	apartments	for	more than 18 twenty	years .19 Unfortunately , due to rapidly 20 escalating costs , such	as fuel , increased City 21 burdens placed on building	owners , the age	of the 22 buildings	and increased	demands on the 23 infrastructure placed by larger families	living 24 in smaller spaces , we find	that we cannot survive 25 without a meaningful rent	increase this	year .2 
2 Many of our buildings , even	without 3 mortgages , barely broke	even at the	end	of last 4 year .5 The	guideline	increases	for	these 6 low - rent , long - term	tenants is insufficient	to 7 allow	income	to outpace	expenses .8 Overall , more	than one - third of my 9 tenants pay	in the	$ 500 , $ 600	or $ 700 range	for 10 rent , and	in several of the buildings , such	as 11 those	on Watson	and	Evergreen	Avenues that	I12 spoke	of earlier , it is more than	half .13 A percentage increase on these	low 14 rents	is not	sufficient .15 Past Board	determinations have 16 unknowingly	penalized those of us who manage  our 17 buildings	in a responsible	manner	so that our 18 tenants stay	and	stay and	stay . It is time	to 19 encourage	us to continue to  do business	in this 20 manner	and reward us with	a reasonable guideline 21 increase	and	a long - term tenancy	bonus .22 One	unintended	consequence	of the 23 percentage increases that	have	been	approved in 24 prior	years	is that	the	gap between	the	most and 25 least	expensive	apartments	has	widened .2 
2 I ask you	to spread	the	increase 3 around	more	equitably this	year by approving an 4 additional increase	for	long - term	tenants paying 5 low rents	so that others do  not bear	a6 disproportionate	share	of the	burden .7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Could	you wrap	up ?8 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	And	what	about 9 those	tenants in Soundview , on Watson and 10 Evergreen	Avenues in the buildings that	my 11 grandfather	built ? I have	included copies of my 12 2008 Apartment Registrations , edited	to show the 13 date that	each tenant moved in so  that you	will 14 see for yourselves , Members of the Rent 15 Guidelines Board , how little additional	income	a16 percentage increase	will generate	and how 17 important	a minimum	rent adjustment	on long - term ,18 low - rent	tenants	will be .19 Thank you .20 ( Audience	participation . )21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .22 Any	questions ?23 Mr . Schleider	has	a question .24 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Thank you , Ms . Crane ,25 for your	testimony .2 
2 The	number	of buildings	and	the	number 3 of apartments , please ?4 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	Approximately 5 1200 units spread over	eighteen buildings .6 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right .7 And	of those 1200	units , percentage 8 that are	rent stabilized ?9 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	That	are	rent 10 stabilized ? Ninety - seven percent , and the 11 remaining	three	percent	are rent	controlled .12 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Thank you 13 Now , you made	mention that	the 14 longevity	increase , some sort	of supplemental 15 increase	would be necessary .16 Over the past , let ' s say , four	or five 17 years , because of the paltry rate	of increase 18 that this	Board	has	provided net	operating 19 incomes have	been compressed significantly	as 20 expenses	outpace	the rate	of collections . So net 21 operating	income	comes	down .22 Now , you said	that you don ' t have 23 mortgages	on these	buildings at all .24 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	That ' s correct .25 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right .2 
2 If you	had	mortgages	on these 3 buildings	similar to the vast	majority of 4 landlords , what	state would your	buildings	be in 5 right	now ?6 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	I would	be 7 unable	to make the	mortgage expenses . The repairs 8 are done . They ' ve come	from cash	income . I would 9 be in even worse	condition	than I am in now .10 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Okay .11 If the	Board does	not grant	this 12 supplemental , or an increase for	longevity , low 13 rents , how are you	going to make	ends meet	going 14 forward ?15 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	With	tremendous 16 difficulty .17 MR . SCHLEIDER :	And	that difficulty 18 would	be ?19 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	The	owners 20 would	see	even less	income	next year	than they 21 did this	year where	they saw $ 5000 to $ 10 , 000 at 22 the end of  the year	for	the building	as  a whole .23 MR . SCHLEIDER :	That was the 24 distribution ?25 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	That	was	it ,2 
2 divided among thirty partners , $ 10 , 000 .3 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Okay .4 There has	been	much	talk	about	having 5 a fuel	surcharge . All right ?6 ( Audience	participation . )7 MR . SCHLEIDER :	What would	you	say 8 would	be a fair	fuel surcharge	to cover	the 9 increase	in fuel	and utility costs ?10 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	I really	don ' t11 know . I ' d leave	it up to the Members	of the	Rent 12 Guidelines Board . It ' s not	solely	the fuel . It ' s13 every	single	burden	that ' s been placed upon	us .14 For	instance ,  annually I send out	- -15 as required , I send	out	window	guard	notices . I16 sent out	inquiries	regarding children under	the 17 age of seven	in their apartments . I get	back less 18 than half	of one	percent of those , which	requires 19 me - - so in a typical 60 - unit	building , I get 20 back three of them .21 Now , a percentage	increase , three 22 percent on a $ 500 to $ 600	rent , doesn ' t cover my 23 hard and	soft costs	of following	up on something 24 like that	alone .25 It ' s hard	to peg	it solely	to fuel .2 
2 It ' s across - the - board City	requirements ,3 lead - based paint	requirements . And I agree	that 4 they are	important , but	I don ' t even	have the 5 participation of the tenants who	live in the 6 apartments who are	to benefit	from these	types	of 7 things .8 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Thank you .9 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Mr . Chair ?10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Yes , go ahead .11 MR . LANGUEDOC :	I just	wanted	to say 12 that - -13 A VOICE :	Use	the	mike .14 MR . LANGUEDOC :	- - you	make a15 statement	overall more	that - -16 A VOICE :	Could you	use	the	mike ,17 please .18 MR . LANGUEDOC :	- - overall	more than 19 one - third	of your tenants	pay	in the	$ 500 , $ 600 20 or $ 700 range .21 But	yet	when I look	through	the 22 registration	information you provided , the	lowest 23 one I saw	was $ 574 . So I think your	statement is 24 a little	disingenuous .25 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	That ' s between 2 
2 $ 500 and	$ 600 . That ' s the	$ 500	range .3 MR . LANGUEDOC :	It ' s closer to $ 600 4	than $ 500 .5 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	Add	up the 6 numbers that	are	paying	under	$ 800 .7 MR . LANGUEDOC :	I only	saw	- -8 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	More	than fifty 9 percent in my buildings .10 MR . LANGUEDOC :	I only	saw	three 11 apartments where	the rent	was	less than	$ 600 out 12 of this whole huge	stack .13 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	Less	than $ 600 .14 But add up the amounts	that are paying in  the 15 $ 500 range , in the	$ 600	range	and	the $ 700	range 16 in the	information	that	I supplied you , you	will 17 see that	it ' s fifty	- - one - third	are	paying	in 18 that range , and	that apartments haven ' t turned 19 over . Fifty	percent	of them have	not	turned	over 20 in more than	ten	years .21 MR . LANGUEDOC :	I think	you ' ve 22 exaggerated .23 ( Audience	participation . )24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Who is talking 25 there ? You got to shut	up . Do you	understand 5 
2 that ? You ' ve got	to keep quiet .3 ( Audience	participation . )4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You ' ll get your 5 chance .6 MR . LANGUEDOC :	I made	my point .7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You ' ll get your 8 chance . But	you ' re not	supposed to be talking 9 now .10 ( Audience	participation . )11 MS . HOLDER :	I have	a question .12 Thank you	for	coming	out	this morning .13 I appreciate	everyone being here	early on a14 Monday	morning .15 One - third	of your	apartments - - you ' re 16 telling us one - third of your apartments	rent in 17 that range . But	if we were	to pull your	Apartment 18 Registrations for the other two - thirds of the 19 apartments , what ' s the	highest	rent	of the	- what 20 is it ? - 1200 units	that you all	own ? What ' s the 21 highest rent	that you have	in those	units ?22 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	In those 23 buildings	I have	one or two apartments that	have 24 reached $ 1300 as the collectible	rent . Sometimes 25 the rent	stabilized	rent , of course , is more than 2 
2 that but	the	actual	collectible rent . And there 3 is probably	a handful of those , but	not	more than 4 that .5 MS . HOLDER :	And	in what	parts	of the 6 City are	those apartments ?7 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	Jamaica .8 MS . HOLDER :	Jamaica , Queens ?9 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	Yes .10 MS . HOLDER :	And	so you ' re offering a11 concession or some	kind	of a preferential rate	or 12 rent on those apartments ?13 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	Yes .14 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .15 And	then what	are	the other	ranges	- -16 and how many	do you	have in that	range ? You	said 17 a couple . Is this two out	of 1200	apartments in 18 all these	neighborhoods ?19 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	Yes .20 If you	look through	the	list of 21 neighborhoods , these are hard	neighborhoods	where 22 both landlords and	tenants	are	struggling . I23 certainly	understand that .24 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .25 Well , I am familiar	with	the 2 
2 neighborhoods and I  know that	- -3 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	And	the	top	of 4 the market is frequently driven by  the Section	85 housing subsidies . That	is the	top end of the 6 market .7 MS . HOLDER :	Right .8 But	I ' m still	looking at these 9 neighborhoods and it seems	as if a lot of  those 10 neighborhoods are gentrifying . You said	fifty 11 percent of the rents .12 I ' m not	going	blind , right ? Are	the 13 lights	dimming or - -14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Yes .15 MS . HOLDER :	- - am I having an 16 episode ?17 Okay .18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	That	is a signal 19 though .20 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .21 You ' re saying	that fifty	percent of 22 your tenants	actually are	what	you call	long - term 23 tenants .24 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	Yes .25 MS . HOLDER :	But	then the	other fifty 2 
2 percent , how	long have	they been	in place ?3 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	Under ten 4 years .5 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .6 And	those	rents ?7 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	Those rents	are 8 generally	anywhere	from	the $ 800	range up to the 9 highest is about	$ 1350	that I have .10 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .11 Thank you .12 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	You ' re welcome .13 MS . CRUZ :	Ms . Crane , thank	you	so 14 much for	coming	here . I know your	family	is 15 absolutely among	the most	conscientious	property 16 owners	in the City , and	frankly , if all	property 17 owners	could	emulate your	family ' s business , we 18 wouldn ' t have these	problems that	we are 19 confronting	here .20 My question to you is , when	you 21 increasingly	find that	the	cost of managing	these 22 buildings	in areas	of the	City	that	are 23 confronting	all	of these economic	pressures , you 24 cannot	meet	your	expenses	if the	guidelines	do 25 not continue	to commensurate with	your expenses ,2 
2 what would be the pressure	on you	and your 3 family ? What	would	be the	options	that you	would 4 have to begin to consider ?5 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	Well , the 6 options become to sell	if it ' s possible	to sell .7 To cut	back , which we don ' t want to 8 have to do in terms	of the	services	that	we are 9 providing .10 Not	to perform	repairs , to wait	until 11 the conditions are	such	that it can ' t be 12 tolerated	anymore . But	ultimately	that destroys 13 the housing	stock .14 MS . CRUZ :	Do you	ever find	that your 15 tenants are	able	to sublet	and	get more	rent than 16 you ' re charging	them ?17 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	It rarely 18 happens in the neighborhoods that	I ' ve discussed .19 It certainly	happens in some of my  other 20 buildings	that I have not	addressed	in my remarks 21 here today . I manage some	buildings	in Manhattan 22 and I do  find that	in some	of those	buildings 23 that certainly has	become	an issue and we  have 24 stopped it when	we have	found	it occurring .25 MS . HOLDER :	And	it ' s illegal .2 
2 MS . ELIZABETH	CRANE :	Correct . It is 3 illegal . And	it happens	increasingly	more often .4 MS . CRUZ :	Thank	you .5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .6 ( Audience	participation . )7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mary	McCune .8 Mary McCune ;9 Followed by Diana	Tomassetti ;10 Followed Catherine Hoag ;11 Martin	Landsam ;12 Mickey	Gensler ; and 13 John Vassilakos .14 Go ahead .15 MS . MARY McCUNE :	Hi !16 My name	is Mary McCune . I ' m a staff 17 attorney	at the	Columbia University	Legal 18 Services	for	New	York City	West Harlem Community 19 Advocacy	Partnership where	I represent low - income 20 tenants living in West	Harlem . And I ' m also	a21 tenant	in one of the buildings	that	Ms . Crane 22 manages . So I would	love to entertain any 23 questions	you might	have about that .24 In my three years	working in West 25 Harlem , I have seen	drastic changes . Rents	have 2 
2 doubled and	tripled	as a result of large	vacancy 3 increases , MCI increases , the	regular Rent 4 Guidelines Board	increases	and	an increasing 5 number	of apartments becoming	deregulated .6 Low - income	tenants are increasingly 7 subjected	to harassment	as landlords	make efforts 8 to evict	them by any means	possible .9 Older tenants	in the	building are 10 denied	essential	services	and	repairs while	the 11 landlords	gut renovate	vacant	apartments .12 Landlords	file groundless	lawsuits against 13 tenants in the hopes that	overwhelmed by the 14 housing court system , they	will simply give	up 15 their	apartments	and move	out .16 It is ironic to hear	landlords 17 claiming	they cannot cover	the	costs	of 18 maintaining	their buildings when	they have	the 19 resources	to pay	hundreds	of thousands of dollars 20 per year	on renovations	and legal	fees .21 For	example , I represent	several 22 tenants living in three	buildings	bought	by the 23 same owner in Hamilton	Heights . When	the	owner 24 first	took over	the	building , he immediately 25 filed	dozens	of eviction proceedings	against the 2 
2 tenants , most on the basis	that the	tenants	were 3 not named	on the	lease .4 When a number	of those cases were 5 dismissed , he started court cases	saying	the 6 tenants had	washing	machines in violation of 7 their	leases .8 When those	cases	were dismissed , he 9 started nonpayment	proceedings against the 10 tenants for	rent	which	he had	rejected during the 11 previous	court proceedings .12 Ultimately , the landlord ' s legal 13 tactics resulted	in emptying approximately	72 of 14 the 120 apartments	in those three	buildings .15 Unfortunately , landlords	are all too 16 successful with	these cases . Many	tenants give	up 17 their	apartments	because they	do not	know their 18 rights	or are forced to give up defending  the 19 cases	because they	risk	losing	their	jobs if they 20 miss work	due to the constant	court	appearances 21 involved .22 Across	the	City rents are going	up .23 The amount of construction	and	renovations	going 24 on in vacant	units	in these buildings demonstrate 25 that most	landlords	are	not suffering 2 
2 financially . Many of these	units	are	off	the 3 market	for months at a time  as they	go through 4 gut rehabilitation .5 Although fuel	costs	may	have gone	up ,6 so have the	number	of deregulated	apartments .7 In voting	on the	rent guidelines 8 increases	for renewal leases , the	Board	must take 9 into account	that renewal	lease increases are 10 just one	of the	ways in which	owners	can	increase 11 the rent	for	their	properties	and	recognize	the 12 reality that	an increasing	number	of tenants are 13 paying	fifty	percent or more of their  income 14 towards rent .15 I also	wanted	to address	really 16 briefly the	longevity increase that	is being 17 thrown	around .18 I represent tenants	in buildings of 19 all sizes	in  Harlem . I have the mom	and	pop	owner 20 as  we  have the corporations that	own	huge numbers 21 of buildings . And I have to  say all	of these 22 buildings	have a substantial number	of 23 deregulated	apartments .24 Most of my tenants are paying  $ 800	or 25 more . Those	days	when there were	people	paying 2 
2 $ 500 , $ 400 , $ 300 , are long	gone for	the	most part 3 in Harlem .4 Many of my tenants , if you	grant this 5 longevity	increase , will basically become 6 homeless . It ' s not	going to assist the  landlord 7 except	by helping them	to deregulate	the 8 apartments .9 As in the	areas where the rents	are 10 still	depressed , I would have	to say	that they 11 are not going to be able  to collect	that	rent 12 anyway . That ' s also	not	going	to be of  any 13 assistance to the owners .14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Any questions ?15 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Question .16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Go ahead .17 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Do you	have any 18 comment on the proposal	that there be a  minimum 19 rent increase ?20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	I think	she	just 21 made it .22 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Well , she ' s talked 23 about	longevity , but I didn ' t - -24 MS . MARY McCUNE :	Yes .25 I don ' t think	it ' s - - I agree with	the 2 
2 people	that	say	that the landlords  should have	to 3 open their books . I don ' t think it ' s fair . I4 think	- - I understand the	difficulty	that the 5 Board	faces	in balancing the challenges	faced by 6 the small	owners .7 But	the	tenants basically are  also 8 stressed	to the	max .9 And	we  hear a lot	about	they don ' t10 want to subsidize the tenants , but aren ' t we 11 essentially	asking	tenants	to subsidize	the 12 landlords	by granting these rent	increases ?13 ( Audience	participation . )14 MS . MARY McCUNE :	And they	do their 15 tax - -16 ( Audience	participation . )17 MS . MARY McCUNE :	I ' m still waiting 18 for my taxpayer	- -19 ( Audience	participation . )20 MS . MARY McCUNE :	- - instead of being 21 a rent	payer . I only got one of those .22 ( Audience	participation . )23 MS . MARY McCUNE :	And I ' ve become 24 very impatient .25 I - - you know , I respect	Ms . Crane	and 2 
 2 her family ' s commitment	to their	buildings . But 3 after	I ' ve lived	in one	of the	buildings	managed 4 by them , and	we had	a rent	reduction	for	over 5 three	years	because	they wouldn ' t do basic 6 repairs .7 So landlords are	giving	up money all 8 the time	because	they aren ' t managing the 9 buildings	properly	and	we shouldn ' t have	to 10 subsidize	their	economic mistakes	frankly .11 MR . LANGUEDOC :	What	were the repair 12	- -13 ( Audience	participation . )14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	All right .15 MS . MARY McCUNE :	I know , just	to be 16 fair , Ms . Crane	wasn ' t managing the	building at 17 the time	the	rent reduction went	into effect .18 They did	continue for some	time after she took 19 over .20 MR . LANGUEDOC :	What were	the	repair 21 issues	that	caused	the	rent to be  reduced ?22 MS . MARY McCUNE :	We had	a flag - - - we 23 have a flagstone	path in front of the  building 24 and some	of the	flagstones	were missing	and 25 cracked .13 
2 We had	an elevator that	wasn ' t3 working . We had	broken	mailboxes . We had	- - I ' m4 trying	to remember	now .5 We had	one	that went	on for	the 6 longest , was	- - I think	we had	two separate	rent 7 reductions , and	the	thing	that	took	them	longest 8 to fix	was a broken	doorknob on the	front door .9 So it wasn ' t a question	of economic 10 infeasibility , it was a question	of poor 11 management .12 So there was a range	of problems .13 MR . LANGUEDOC :	And	how	many 14 apartments are in your	building ?15 MS . MARY McCUNE :	The building	I live 16 in has , I believe , 82 apartments .17 MR . LANGUEDOC :	Eighty - two .18 MS . MARY McCUNE :	Yes . And	a number 19 of them are	deregulated	at this point .20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .21 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Chair ?22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	No .23 Mr . Schleider	has	a question .24 MR . SCHLEIDER :	The	Hamilton Heights 25 portfolio	- all	right ?  - who owned it before this 2 
2 property	manipulator came	in ?3 MS . MARY McCUNE :	You know , I ' m really 4 not sure	because	I wasn ' t involved with	the 5 building	before	that .6 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right .7 Could it have	been long - term ownership 8 that finally	got	squeezed	to a point	where	they 9 had to sell	out ?10 MS . MARY McCUNE :	I don ' t believe	so ,11 no .12 MR . SCHLEIDER :	You	don ' t believe	so 13 but you don ' t know	for	sure .14 MS . MARY McCUNE :	I think	there are 15 some buildings where that	has	- - well , actually ,16 most of the	owners	I know	they	just	cashed	out 17 and they	made a huge profit .18 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Cashed	out	or ran 19 away from	their	buildings	because	- -20 MS . MARY McCUNE :	Cashed out 21 honestly .22 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- - they	- -23 MS . MARY McCUNE :	Yeah . I do see	- -24 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Another	thing	you 25 said , about	oil , you said	oil	may	have gone	up .2 
2 You don ' t believe - - you said	oil	may have	gone 3 up , the price of oil - -4 MS . MARY McCUNE :	No , I know that	it 5 has .6 ( Audience	participation . )7 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- - may	have gone	up ?8 MS . MARY McCUNE :	I ' m not	saying	it 9 didn ' t .10 MR . SCHLEIDER :	You	did	in your 11 testimony . You said	it may	have gone	up . And you 12 kind of dismissed it . I think	it ' s a very serious 13 and important factor that	this	Board	needs	to 14 consider .15 MS . MARY McCUNE :	And it ' s a very ,16 very important factor that	many of my tenants 17 don ' t get	heat and	hot	water that	they ' re paying 18 for .19 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Fine .20 You	also say - - in your	universe of 21 rents	you	said $ 800	was	more the	norm . Right ?22 MS . MARY McCUNE :	Yes .23 MR . SCHLEIDER :	What about 24 neighborhoods in the Bronx	where	rents certainly 25 are lower	than $ 500	a month ? How	about buildings 2 

2	out in - - 34
( Audience	participation . )MR . SCHLEIDER :	- - Bushwick where 
5 rents	are	lower	than $ 600	a month .6 MS . MARY McCUNE :	I ' m having trouble 7 hearing your	question .8 Could you	repeat	it , please ?9 MR . SCHLEIDER :	All	right .10 ( Audience	participation . )11 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Quickly .12 There are	rents much	lower	than	this 13 $ 800 a month	universe that	you ' re familiar	with .14 ( Audience	participation . )15 MS . MARY McCUNE :	You know , I worked 16 in the	Bronx	for	a number	of years and I ' ve been 17 in Manhattan	now	for three	years , and I can	tell 18 you when	I left	the	Bronx	three years ago , most 19 of my tenants , those $ 500	rents were	long gone .20 I ' m not	saying	that	there aren ' t some 21 that still exist , but there  are very	few	of them 22 left .23 MR . SCHLEIDER :	There are	plenty	of 24 them . In fact , our	data	over here	shows	that 25 there	are . In fact , the	average rent	in some of 5 
2 these	neighborhoods	is less than	$ 700 a month ,3 average rents .4 So - -5 MS . MARY McCUNE :	Between	$ 500	- -6 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- - if you ' re thinking 7 about	- -8 MS . MARY McCUNE :	- - and $ 800	- -9 MR . SCHLEIDER :	- - if you ' re thinking 10 in view of your	individual	cases , that ' s fine ,11 but don ' t project the whole universe	based	on 12 that .13 MS . MARY McCUNE :	Well , then I don ' t14 see you do the same	thing	when	the small	owners 15 come and	not	generalize	from their experiences	to 16 everyone	else .17 Because	you have	very few - - the 18 evidence	that I ' m hearing	here	today	is highly 19 anecdotal	from the	small owners as well .20 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Actually it ' s not .21 MS . MARY McCUNE :	Okay . We can 22 disagree	about that .23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Adriene .24 MS . HOLDER :	Yeah .25 A couple - - thank	you so much for 2 
2coming in .3MS . MARY McCUNE :	Sure .4MS . HOLDER :	A couple of things .5Just to my colleague ' s point and 6 making	sure	that	I understand .7 With those	apartments that	might be 8 renting anywhere	from I guess	he ' s saying $ 500 9 they still exist , those	are in - place	tenants .10 And	to the	extent	that I don ' t know 11 where	all	of those	apartments	still	are , but to 12 the extent that	there is a range , let ' s say , from 13 $ 500 on up , have	you noticed any	type of trend	in 14 terms	of what the incomes	of those individuals 15 are ?16 MS . MARY McCUNE :	The incomes	are 17 basically	stable	or going	down . Most	of the 18 people	that	I ' m aware of that	live in these 19 apartments are usually	older people	who	are 20 retiring	and	whose	income	is going down .21 So these aren ' t , you	know , people 22 starting	up , they ' re going	to be getting	salary 23 increases	every	year for the foreseeable	future .24 These	are	people	that are	losing	income .25 MS . HOLDER :	Right .6 
2 And	our	own statistics show	that the 3 majority	of people	in rent	regulated	housing 4 actually	have what	would be considered lower 5 rents , rents	of like - - I mean	incomes , incomes 6	of $ 32 , 000 to $ 34 , 000 a year .7 MS . MARY McCUNE :	Sure .8 I have	a lot of people that	are 9 disabled	that have	lost	their	income .10 So it ' s not always just	elderly 11 people , but	a lot of people that	just unforeseen 12 circumstances result in them having	some	sort of 13 disability and losing their employment as  a14 result .15 MS . HOLDER :	And	of the	apartments 16 that you	actually see in Northern	Manhattan	that 17 are actually	vacant , like	those apartments	that 18 would	be available	to folks in the community  who 19 actually	find themselves displaced because	of 20 escalating rents	or who	are trying to get  larger 21 apartments , what	are you seeing - - because	of 22 increase	in family	size , what	are	you seeing are 23 those	rents	for	vacant	apartments	in Northern 24 Manhattan ?25 MS . MARY McCUNE :	Well , basically ,7 
2 the rents	are completely unaffordable , especially 3 Northern	Manhattan . There ' s just	been this	whole 4 wave of MCI	increases . So then	when	the	apartment 5 becomes vacant , they are basically doing	gut 6 rehabs , even	though	- - I ' ve been	seeing	a lot of 7 turnover	- I guess	my experience	is a little 8 different	from Ms . Crane ' s .9 So  often in my building	the	apartments 10 are turning	over	every	one	or two	years , a11 certain percentage	of them , and they ' re doing the 12 same rehab every	year . So every year	they take 13 out the sinks and put in new  sinks .14 So it ' s a little	artificial	what ' s15 going	on there .16 But	I think they	are	basically 17 unaffordable .18 We are	even trying to get - - when	we 19 have tenants	that are having difficulty	paying 20 their	rents	for	whatever reason and	they ' ve been 21 brought to court , we try to settle the cases  by 22 having	them	move	into a smaller 23 apartment	in the	building	as an alternative , for 24 an elderly person ,  as an accommodation .25 And	the	rents	are	just simply 2 
2 completely unaffordable	even for	a smaller 3 apartment .4 MS . HOLDER :	And	have you	noticed	in 5 these	- - I know	you ' ve been practicing housing 6 law for a while	- - have	you noticed	any	types of 7 trends	in the types	of eviction cases that	are 8 coming	in through your	doors ?9 MS . MARY McCUNE :	Well , I think , as I10 tried	to say	a little bit	in my testimony , they 11 are mostly holdovers at  this point , though	not	to 12 say that	there aren ' t lots	of tenants that	are 13 struggling to pay their	rent .14 But	we are	seeing	owners	that are 15 taking	over	buildings and	their sole	intention	is 16 to empty	them and double or triple the rent .  So 17 they just	start	these cases . Like	I said , they 18 hire investigators . They look	at the	name from 19 the mailbox . If the	name on the mailbox	doesn ' t20 match	the	lease , they just	send these blanket 21 eviction	notices	to everyone in the	building . And 22 the same	with the washing	machines , et cetera . So 23 we have just	seen huge	numbers	of those .24 And	another type	of  a - - seemingly	if 25 they start the holdovers and as a  requirement  to 2 
2 start	if they have	to refuse the	rent in a3 certain period of time , and then	they want	it - -4 they ' ll never start	accepting	the	rent . And	so 5 these	cases	drag	on and	drag on and	drag	on , and 6 then after a  year they	want all the	rent , and 7 they are	basically	sort	of just hoping that	the 8 tenant	won ' t be able to come up with	that after 9 that period	of time . And sometimes they ' re right 10 unfortunately .11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .12 MS . MARY McCUNE :	Thank	you .13 ( Audience	participation . )14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	I ' m going to read 15 approximately ten names , and these names , and 16 after	these	names we are going to  be taking	a17 break .

Sabine	Zutterer ; and Faith Steinberg .A VOICE :	What	number are you on ,CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We ' re going	to end 
7 on the	tenants with	16 .8 And	then we ' ll be - - we are	going	to 9 take us to around  - - that	should	get	us to 10 around , based on my time , around	one	o ' clock , and 11 then we ' ll take	a break	for about	twenty	minutes .12 Diana .13 MS . DIANA	TOMASSETTI :	Yes . Hi ! Good 14 morning .15 My family	has	been property	owners	for 16 the past	forty years . We own approximately	ten 17 units	with about	a hundred	tenants .18 One	building in particular	is a19 fifty - unit building	and	it is eighty	percent rent 20 stabilized and ten	percent	- -21 A VOICE :	Talk louder , please .22 MS . DIANA	TOMASSETTI :	- - and ten 23 percent rent	controlled .24 The	long - term	tenants that	have	been 25 there	almost	the	forty	years that	we ' ve owned the 7 
2 building , it ' s been	impossible	for us to catch	up 3 to the	cost	of living because	of the	small 4 increases	that we can have	when the	lease 5 expires .6 You	know , the	basic	fact	is that 7 tenants need	housing and landlords need	tenants .8 So we really	need each	other .  We need to find 9 some sort	of balance .10 And	no one	is going	to actually	walk 11 away . We are	very happy	that doesn ' t happen	when 12 we are	debating	things . But we have	to at least 13 come to a happy	medium	where we both	can	survive .14 Some kind	of landlords have	- - get	a15 bad rap . And	this is our livelihood .  We all 16 deserve a slight	profit	in order	to live .17 Everybody	does .18 I understand tenants ' point	of view as 19 well . It ' s difficult all around . But	we have to 20 come to some	sort of meeting of the	minds 21 so - to - speak .22 And	I hope	that these new  rent 23 guidelines can do that .24 Thank you .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We ' re going	to try 2 
2 to meet the	minds .3 Any	questions ?4 ( No response . )5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .6 Catherine	Hoeg .7 MS . CATHERINE	HOEG :	I am a  senior 8 citizen living on a fixed	income .9 A VOICE :	A little louder .10 MS . CATHERINE	HOEG :	I am a  senior 11 citizen living on a fixed	income . I live	in a12 rent stabilized	apartment .13 I ' m not	here asking	for	charity . I ' m14 here because	it is the	country ' s responsibility 15 for hard - working , low - income people	to have 16 affordable housing .17 ( Audience	participation . )18 MS . CATHERINE	HOEG :	We are now 19 living	in a  situation where real	estate	is 20 building	only for the rich . Whoever	created	rent 21 stabilization I applaud	them .22 On the	other hand , the real	estate 23 greeds	have	been	allowed to build	luxury 24 apartments for the	rich	while	the	government has 25 neglected	affordable housing .2 
2 When landlord	reps vote	the	high rent 3 increases , they	are	deliberating	killing	off 4 stabilization and the people who	live in them .5 In the	midst of all	of this , the 6 landlords	get away	with	not showing	why	they need 7 more and	more money . This	has	been said	before 8 and I ' m going to say it again . The landlords 9 should	open	their books	to the	public and show 10 why they	want more	money .11 ( Audience	participation . )12 MS . CATHERINE	HOEG :	The landlords 13 have made	a great deal	of money from	stabilized 14 apartments because	the	rent stabilized tenants 15 stay in their apartments .16 Now , when	an apartment is empty , the 17 landlord	charges	the new tenant market prices . A18 great	deal of new tenants	who	pay	market	prices 19 have moved out .  Maybe if the landlord stopped 20 charging	market	prices , we wouldn ' t be in the fix 21 we ' re in .22 ( Audience	participation . )23 MS . CATHERINE	HOEG :	It is in 24 everyone ' s interest	to sustain	affordable 25 housing , and	that includes	the	government , the 2 
2 landlords	and the like .3 While the	landlords	are	sweeping the 4 stabilized tenants	out	of  their buildings ,5 construction	is dedicated	to building homes	for 6 the rich . The moral	fiber	of the	country	weakens 7 considerably .8 In the	mean time	the	tenants like 9 myself	and others will	always	fight	and	stand up 10 for our rights . I believe	- -11 ( Audience	participation . )12 MS . CATHERINE	HOEG :	I believe	that 13 affordable housing	is my inalienable	right	and	no 14 one can convince	me otherwise .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .16 ( Audience	participation . )17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Well	done .18 Martin	Landsman .19 Mr . Landsman , are	you here ? Landsman .20 Yes ? You ' re coming	down . Okay . Hiding behind that 21 policy	there .22 MR . MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	Good	afternoon .23 My name	is Martin	Landsman . I ' m the 24 owner	of a mixed - use AIR building	with twelve 25 residential	units , six	of which are	under the 2 
2 stabilization code . I own	no other rental 3 properties .4 My current	square	foot rental amounts 5 for the stabilized	units average	fifty cents per 6 square	foot	per	month . The	six	stabilized units 7 occupy	forty	percent of the total	building 8 residential	square	footage	and	pay twelve percent 9 of the	total	rental	amount .10 As a specific	example , I have a 1750 11 square	foot	unit	that pay	thirty - one	cents	per 12 square	foot	per	month . A five	percent increase	to 13 this rent	will yield thirty - two - and - a - half	cents 14 per square foot	per	month .15 Just a quick review	of some	of the 16 reality numbers	of operating a building	like 17 mine .18 Last February , I burned	about three 19 thousand	gallons	of # 2 fuel oil . At $ 4 . 00 a20 gallon , fuel	will cost	at least $ 12 , 000	for	the 21 month , or about	$ 425 a day .22 At that	rate , it will take	less	than 23 one day - and - a - half	to consumer the thirty - one 24 cents	stabilized	tenants rent	on fuel cost	alone .25 Let ' s not	forget	that I pay	more than 2 
2 twenty - five	percent	of the	total	rent collected 3 for property	taxes .4 We all	know the endless	list of other 5 expenses	that are the reality	mandates of 6 operating	any building	in New	York .7 My issue as a  one - building	owner is 8 being	put	into the	same	category	for	rent 9 increases	as operators	who	control hundreds	or 10 thousands	of units . I have	no issue	or expertise 11 to comment on their	financial	concerns , but	it is 12 apparent	that a  large operator would	be able to 13 average out	the	good and bad rental	amounts	and 14 still	survive with	the	traditional type	increases 15 that this	Board	has	passed	on .16 Well , let	me tell	you I can ' t survive 17 with this	thinking .18 It  is important for	you	to understand 19 the type	of tenants	who	occupy	and are being 20 financially	protected in my building . And I  also 21 think	you	should	understand from	my  point of view 22 I ' m supporting a group	of total strangers under 23 government mandate . I support	families of a24 college professor , another	college professor and 25 successful commercial artist , a business	owner 2 
2 and a school	teacher . Some	have two	homes .3 You ' ve all	been presented with 4 stories , scenarios , numbers and facts about	the 5 plight	of small , single	building	owners	like me 6 countless	times	now . The system in the year	2008 7 is broken . It works	for	a privileged	few , but at 8 the expense	of so many	others .9 I would	ask the Board Members to 10 embark	on a new	approach to rent	increases	now .11 Make a recommendation that	owners	with less	than 12 twenty	or twenty - five units be phased out of the 13 system .14 These owners are	financially doomed .15 ( Audience	participation . )16 MR . MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	Alternately ,17 distinguish	between	large	and	small	building 18 operators . Our needs are clearly	different	so 19 recognize	and deal	with	this fact	realistically .20 Approve	real , substantial increases to 21 landlords	like me who are	so far	below in the 22 rental	market . We should not be supporting	people 23 who do not need	it .24 As a base	line , reimburse small 25 building	owners	like me using	the	same formula	as 2 
 2 the City	and	Federal governments	do for	Section	83 housing tenants .4 May	I remind you	that under	this 5 program , struggling	people	are	required	to pay	up 6 to thirty	percent of their	adjusted	gross income 7 in rent .8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .9 ( Audience	participation . )10 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Mr . Chair ?11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Question . You have 12 a question .13 MR . SCHLEIDER :	This AIR building	is 14 where	exactly ?15 MR .

MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	Stabilized .11 MS . HOLDER :	How	long has	the	tenant 12 been in place ?13 MR . MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	Twenty - five 14 years .15 MS . HOLDER :	And	what kind	of income 16 does your	tenant	have ?17 MR . MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	Say it again ?18 MS . HOLDER :	What kind	of income	does 19 the tenant have ?20 MR . MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	College 21 professor , the husband	is self - employed .22 MS . HOLDER :	They ' re still	working ?23 MR . MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	Yes .24 MS . HOLDER :	And	the twelve units ,25 are they	all	- - did	you	say all of your	units 6 
2 were rent	stabilized ?3 MR . MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	No . Half	are 4 stabilized .5 MS . HOLDER :	Half are stabilized	and 6 half are	- -7 MR . MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	Free	market .8 MS . HOLDER :	What are the	range of 9 rents	that you have	in your building ?10 MR . MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	Free	market ?11 MS . HOLDER :	Yes .12 MR . MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	Free	market	to 13 the rents	- - all	of my stabilized , the most	- -14 the highest	stabilized	rent that	I have	is $ 640 .15 The others are from	$ 540 to $ 640 . Those	are	the 16 six .17 MS . HOLDER :	And	how much	do the 18 unregulated	units go for ?19 MR . MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	Much	more .20 MS . HOLDER :	Can	you tell	us ? Can	you 21 share	with us ?22 MR . MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	You know , I ' ve 23 been - - with	all	due respect , I ' ve been	listening 24 to that question	being	asked and	I find	it 25 disingenuous	from the point of view	that	you 2 
2 would	almost	expect	- - it ' s like	you ' re expecting 3 us to , that	group , that	extra	money	that	we get ,4 if we got	a lot	of money from	them , the 5 implication	is that	the	other	people	shouldn ' t be 6 paying	anything , that those - - the other	six 7 people	should be making	up the	difference .8 And	I really find	it the	wrong	type of 9 question	- -10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You don ' t want	- -11 MR . MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	- - to ask .12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You don ' t want	to 13 answer . Okay .14 ( Audience	participation . )15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You don ' t want	to 16 answer .17 Thank you .18 Do you	have another	question ?19 MS . HOLDER :	Well , but I think	- -20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	The answer , he said 21 much higher	and	he doesn ' t want to give	a - -22 MR . LANGUEDOC :	You	want us to  be 23 sympathetic	because	you	have - -24 MR . MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	I ' m not asking 25 for your	sympathy . I ' m asking	for	an equitable 2 

2	solution .34
( Audience	participation . )MR . MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	I didn ' t come 
5 here for	sympathy .6 ( Audience	participation . )7 MS . HOLDER :	I appreciate	that	you 8 came here	this morning	and	I appreciate	the	fact 9 that you	are	sharing with	us what ' s going on with 10 your business . But	you ' re sharing	us limited 11 information	for	us  to be able	to really 12 understand .13 MR . SCHLEIDER :	No , he ' s not .14 ( Audience	participation . )15 MS . HOLDER :	Are	you going	to - - the 16 issue	for	us is not	necessarily what	the	tenants 17 are paying , you	know , as individual	tenants . The 18 issue	for	us  is what your	total rent	roll is 19 which	allows	you	to maintain the	building as well 20 as to make  a profit	and	to  stay in building .21 MR . MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	I have a22 non - stabilized unit , the one I ' m talking	about	is 23 a sixth - floor unit . I have	a non - stabilized	unit 24 on that floor , pays	$ 2900	a month .25 MS . HOLDER :	And	is  that the highest 5 
2 of the	unregulated	units ?3 MR . MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	No , it is not .4 ( Audience	participation . )5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You don ' t need	to 6 answer .7 MR . MARTIN	LANDSMAN :	I ' m not going to 8 answer .9 A VOICE :	Yes . Let him answer .10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	No , he does	not .11 Thank you .12 Let ' s go .13 Let ' s move	on .14 Mr . Gensler .15 MR . MICKEY	GENSLER :	I represent	the 16 Skyview Tenants	Association in Riverdale .17 For	over twenty years I  have  attended 18 the Rent	Guidelines	Board	hearings and appealed 19 to their	sense of fairness . And my pleas	have 20 been ignored	by the	Mayors	and	their	Boards .21 I will	now	appeal	to the	conscience of 22 the Board .23 The	Mayor	and	the	RGB are equally 24 guilty	of forcing people to be trapped by  the 25 unscrupulous	mortgage bankers	and	subprime 2 
2 lenders . Their constant	increases	on rent led 3 tenants to believe	that	they would lose	their 4 apartments so they	bought	into	the American	dream 5 of ownership	and	purchased	homes , co - ops	and 6 condominiums	they could	not afford .7 At best	many of these purchases	were 8 marginal	and	they fell	into the hands of  these 9 vultures .10 This makes	the	Mayor , the Rent 11 Increase	Board and	some	of our	elected officials 12 co - conspirators .13 As for	the	nonsense	of the	price of 14 oil , it only	costs	more	if you	use it . We had a15 very warm	winter	and early	spring .16 ( Audience	participation . )17 MR . MICKEY	GENSLER :	Many	days	when 18 the temperatures	hovered around fifty - six degrees 19 the landlords gave	no heat	that day .20 Respectfully , Mickey	Gensler .21 ( Audience	participation . )22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you , Mr .23 Gensler .24 ( Audience	participation . )25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	John	Vassilakos .2 
2 Go ahead .3 MR . JOHN VASSILAKOS :	I thought this 4 was the United States of America , the land	of 5 opportunity , the	land of free	enterprise . But it 6 seems	as if the	landlords	are	regulated	by you ,7 the Rent	Guidelines	Board .8 The	land of opportunity	is  taken away 9 by you . The	land	of free enterprise	is taken away 10 by  you . It is just	not	fair .11 New	technology , the	information	is 12 here . The	City , State and	Federal	government has 13 at their	fingertips	the	information	needed	to 14 look on an individual basis  the bottomline	net 15 income	of each building	in New	York	City .16 They can , if they	choose , decide on an 17 individual basis	automatically	through the	use	of 18 computer	software the rent	increase	for	each 19 building	every year .20 If the	Board cannot	offer a21 double - digit	increase and	some	type	of fuel 22 surcharge	at least	during	heating	season , you 23 leave	me no choice	but	to  start my campaign	with 24 Senator Thomas Duane and Assemblyman	George 25 Latimer to have	the	RGB	Board	eliminated	in the 2 

2	future .3
Remember , just	like	any	business , if 
4 you do not adapt	to the	changes around you , you 5 will be eliminated	through	the	competition	for 6 success .7 ( Audience	participation . )8 MR . JOHN VASSILAKOS :	I suggest the 9 RGB Board	start	looking	beyond	this	year ' s rent 10 increases	and establish	a new	system .11 If not , some type	of oversight 12 committee	or a computer	will replace	your 13 authority .14 ( Audience	participation . )15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .16 We ' re looking	for	that computer .17 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Can ' t wait	for	it .18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Roberta	Arnona .19 Roberta	Arnona .20 You	don ' t have	to run . It ' s okay .21 We ' ll wait for you .22 Okay . We ' re ready ?23 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	Yes .24 It ' s Roberta Arnone , actually , with an 25 " e " at the end .4 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	It ' s what ?3 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	Arnone with	an 4 " e " at the end , not	an " a . "5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We don ' t have it 6 spelled that	way .7 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	Okay .8 My name	is Roberta Arnone . I ' m an 9 occupant	of the	Tempo Hotel and have	served	as 10 volunteer	guardian	ad litem in housing court  for 11 the past	three years .12 Although my testimony today	is based 13 upon my own	personal experiences , I ' d like	to 14 share	that I have assisted	several SRO tenants	in 15 New York	City who have	suffered the	same	or 16 similar complaints	as my own .17 I was a market	rate	tenant	of the 18 Tempo	before	it became	offering daily rate 19 rentals of the modernized	units to tourists . I20 paid a broker a  large sum	of money , received a21 one - year	lease .22 It was	represented to me at the	time 23 that it was	a rent	stabilized	building and	I24 would	receive a renewal	lease	at the	end	of my 25 year .2 
2 A year	later , the	landlord	sent 3 written notice to about	one hundred	and	ten 4 market	rate	tenants	to vacate	in thirty	days .5 Because we pay market rent , we were	no longer 6 protected	by the	rent stabilization	laws . About 7 one hundred	and	ten	tenants who all	paid	an 8 exclusive	broker	fee of two months rent	or more 9 to Citihabitats	were driven out of their	homes	in 10 thirty	days	because	the	landlord	wished	to 11 instead offer those	units	to tourists .12 The	very same	building owner who 13 didn ' t have	a conscience when	it simultaneously 14 threw	out	over one	hundred	people	into the	street 15 now seeks	your compassion .16 A neighbor	took me into	his	apartment 17 and I have been	residing at the Tempo ever	since .18 About	two	hundred units	are being	offered to 19 tourists	at very	high daily rates .20 Tourists crowd our only	two	elevators 21 with luggage	and	assemble	tour	trips	in our 22 lobby . They	smoke marijuana . They	bring	the 23 distinct	odor to our hallways . They	have	loud 24 arguments	and parties after drinking	alcohol and 25 leave	their	waste in their	rooms	uncovered	with 2 
2 no regard	to the	residents	of the	building	who 3 must live	with the	odors , noise and	roach 4 infestation	they	create .5 On several	occasions	I have	shared	the 6 elevator	with young	intoxicated male	tourists and 7 it wasn ' t pleasant . They are on vacation	and do 8 not share	the same	level of restraint that	a9 permanent	neighbor	would .10 Tourists bring bedbugs with	them and 11 unusual illnesses that	our	local	doctors	must try 12 to combat	with very	strong	and	expensive 13 antibiotics	for	twice the	regular	dosage	term to 14 adequately rid .15 Because	of the	high	elevator traffic ,16 our second elevator	on the	right	hand side	is 17 constantly under	repair . Public spaces of the 18 hotel	are	off limits to residents	and offered 19 only to tourists	such as the fitness	room and 20 lower	level	washroom that	is often under	lock and 21 key .22 And	my understanding	is that there	is 23 even a business	center	at the	penthouse	level for 24 tourists	24 / 7 .25 Not	once have	we , the residents , ever 2 
2 been notified of common	hotel	amenities	and	I do 3 not even	have unfettered access to my  own 4 building ' s laundry	room	to clean	my clothes	each 5 week . I must	first	call	the front	desk .6 This year	alone we have	not	had	hot 7 water	and	adequate	heat	on at least	ten 8 occasions . Considering	that winter spans	over 9 three	months , ten is a  significant number of days 10 to be inconvenienced .11 However , tourists	in modernized	units 12 are not affected	by this as they	have their	own 13 electronic temperature	devices	in each room	with 14 hot or cold	air	conditioning as they	desire . I15 know this	first - hand because I resided in one of 16 those	units	for	an entire	year .17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Could	you try to 18 wrap up , please .19 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	Okay . I ' m sorry .20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	It ' s okay .21 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	Hotel	residents 22 in my building are	supposed to receive a  weekly 23 supply	of paper	towels	and	toilet	paper	and	weeks 24 are often	skipped with	no advance	notice	or any 25 offset	offered . When they	do deliver	paper	goods ,2 
2 they place toilet paper	and paper	towels	in used 3 garbage because . I heard this	from a  neighbor and 4 didn ' t want	to believe	it until I  personally 5 received	my paper goods	in a used	bagel	because 6 that had	cream cheese residue	on the	side , a7 coffee	stirrer and	a few drops of coffee	at the 8 bottom	of the because .9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You need	to wrap 10 up .11 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	Well , I have	a12 little	bit more . I ' m sorry . I ' m going to just 13 try .14 We had	extermination	services that 15 went from	weekly	to monthly to not at all .  No 16 notice	or explanation was	even	given	to 17 residents .18 In sum , hotel	residents	are	not	given 19 the bare	minimum	of what is legally	required , yet 20 the hotel	landlords	have ample resources . They 21 are making much	more money	with daily rate	hotel 22 guests	than	traditional	building	owners	do with 23 strictly	rents from	year - long	permanent 24 residents .25 There is no comparison among the  two 2 
2 types	of building owners who have	completely 3 different	budgets .4 To allow a  landlord , who	already has 5 much deeper	pockets , a rent increase	on units 6 that he or she continually	fails	to maintain 7 would	set	a bad	precedent .8 It is not	okay	for three	hundred and 9 fifty	people	to share one	elevator in a10 seventeen - story	building .11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You have	to wrap 12 up .13 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	And	I will	right 14 now .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	No , no , no . You 16 have to wrap	up now . What	do you	want ? What	do 17 you want	from us ? You can ' t keep	going on the 18 individual case . You need	to tell	us what ' s your 19 recommendation .20 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	My 21 recommendation is that	you	should	not increase 22 the rents	and do not listen  to their	claims	of 23 crying	poverty .24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .25 Any	questions ?2 

234	question .5
MS . HOLDER :	Yes . Question .CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Go ahead . There ' s aMS . HOLDER :	How	many units are  in 
6 your building ?7 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	I ' m not sure . I8 just - - around two	hundred	and	fifty .9 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .10 And	how	many of those are  occupied ?11 Are they	all	occupied ?12 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	As far as I13 know , yes . I mean it looks	full . There may	be a14 handful that	maybe	are	vacant .15 MS . HOLDER :	All	rent stabilized ?16 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	No . That ' s what 17 I ' m saying . Most	of the	building	is occupied by 18 tourists	who	are	paying , I don ' t know , $ 250	a19 night .20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Are you	aware that 21 the allowed	rent	increases	for	the last	couple	of 22 years	has	been zero ?23 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	Yes .24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay .25 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	I have been 6 
2 living	there .3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay .4 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	And I understand 5 that . But	I thought	the	whole	purpose was - -6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	And also	in the 7 years	when there	was an allowed increase , there 8 was a provision , a proviso , that	if there was a9 certain amount of the  units over	and	above	- I10 forgot	what	the	number	was	- that	even those 11 tenants would not get a  rent increase . Are	you 12 aware	of that ?13 So when	was the last	time your	units 14 had a rent increase	by actions	of this Board ?15 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	I think it  was 16 several years ago .17 But	the	issue	is it ' s supposed	to be 18 based	on budgetary	needs . There is none	if they 19 are maintaining	these buildings with	high 20 profits . There ' s not poverty there . They	are 21 making	profit . They	are	not treating	the	existing 22 residents	nicely . They ' re not	even doing	what 23 they are	supposed to do .24 We are	supposed to reward them	with an 25 increase ? I don ' t see that	as being	fair .2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	This	Board ' s3 actions have	not	rewarded	anybody	with an 4 increase	- -5 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	I understand 6 that .7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	- - for the last	- -8 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Seven years .9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	So we appreciate 10 your coming	here .11 MS . HOLDER :	How	large	is your 12 apartment	or your room ?13 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	I have a14 one - bedroom	and	I split	it  with my neighbor	so we 15 split	it into two studios .16 MS . HOLDER :	Do you	know the 17 dimensions , the	dimensions	of your - -18 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	I don ' t know .19 It ' s a small	apartment . It ' s not	a large ,20 spacious	one - bedroom .21 MS . HOLDER :	And	you share	bathrooms ?22 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	We share	a23 bathroom	and	a very	small	kitchen . The kitchen	is 24 smaller than	the	bathroom .25 MS . HOLDER :	And	how much	do you	pay ?2 
2 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	We pay around 3 $ 450 a month .4 A VOICE :	Oh , come on !5 MS . HOLDER :	And	how much	do the 6 other	tenants pay in that	building ?7 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	There ' s a range 8 of seven , eight . I know	someone paying eleven .9 But	the	daily	rates	are	going for	$ 250 10 a night and	they	far exceed the amount of 11 existing	units there that	are	occupied by full 12 residents .13 MS . HOLDER :	And	you are continuing 14 to experience different	types	of services than 15 the tourists ?16 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	Yes . Inadequate .17 MS . HOLDER :	And	also diminished 18 service .19 MS . ROBERTA ARNONE :	Yes . Grossly 20 inadequate . They ' re just - - they	are	trying	to 21 drive	us out . But they	are	making	an extensive 22 profit	on - - most of the units in  the hotel	are 23 for daily	rate tourists . It ' s just a small 24 handful of us remain . It ' s probably	twenty 25 percent or less .2

CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you .MS . HOLDER :	Thank	you .CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Sabine Zutterer . ( No response . )CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Is she here ? Sabine ( No response . )CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Faith	Steinberg . MS . FAITH	STEINBERG :	Good	morning	or 
11 good afternoon .12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Hold	on a second ,13 Faith .14 MS . FAITH	STEINBERG :	If I were	going 15 to write	a manual on " How	to Create	More 16 Homelessness , " I would	follow	the	advice	of the 17 landlord	that I  heard in Brooklyn	last week :18 Raise	rents	across	the	board to $ 50 a month	for	a19 one - year	lease and	$ 75 for	a two - year lease .20 This man epitomizes	the	motto popular 21 among	the	yuppies " greed is good . "22 I think	he epitomizes the generic 23 bloodsucker . He would have	people	sign over	their 24 paychecks	directly	to him	if he could .25 I occasionally	worked in the business 11 
2 world	and	real estate is like	other	businesses .3 They mostly	seem	to have their good	years and bad 4 years . And some	products or services	don ' t do as 5 well as others . That ' s business .6 But	real estate is  not comparable	to 7 other	businesses	in one	important	way . Real 8 estate	and landlords deal	with	a basic necessity 9 of life . We need	Federal help	which	the	U . S . had 10 until	that great	communicator	Ronald	Reagan	cut 11 it way	back	to almost nothing .12 As for	myself , I ' m not here	to 13 complain	about my own circumstances . I live	in a14 studio	apartment	in a brownstone	in a chic 15 section of town , the Upper	Westside . I ' m rent 16 stabilized and because	I don ' t get much	money 17 from Social	Security , I have SCRIE . Thank 18 goodness	for	SCRIE	because	without it I would  be 19 among	the	homeless .20 But	I am educated , single and  very 21 resourceful	and	get	by .22 But	I was	a child	of the	Great 23 Depression and I  can tell	you	it wasn ' t great . My 24 parents were	immigrants , six kids , on home	relief 25 as  they called welfare	in those days	and	I know 2 
2 the humiliation	and	degradation that	comes	with 3 poverty .4 I think	most of this	Board	has	no idea 5 what that	might	be like . Living in such 6 circumstances for a meaningful	period of time 7 should	be a prerequisite in order	to sit	on this 8 Board , except for the tenant members , of course .9 The	business world pays	unskilled ,10 hard - working , non - union	but essential workers the 11 pathetic	minimum	wage and	the	landlords	want the 12 highest rents . These workers live	in 13 neighborhoods where	services are	minimum , usually 14 do not	have	checking accounts	because banks	won ' t15 accept	them , and	the people are intimidated	and 16 even have	to pay	fees to pay their bills	with 17 money	orders , and even	to cash	their	paychecks .18 They pay high	prices	for	inferior	food 19 services	and	on and	on .20 These workers	are	being	put	through 21 the wringer	from	all directions . That real	estate 22 guy thought	he was	being squeezed . He ain ' t seen 23 nothing .24 So I don ' t give a damn about that 25 landlord	and	these	real	estate	people who I ' m2 
 2 sure are	making	a profit . It just	isn ' t enough 3 for him or them .4 Greed is like	a bottomless	pit .5 I say give	landlords	a half	percent 6 for a one - year lease , a three - quarter percent for 7 a two - year lease , no more , or maybe	even	less .8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank	you . Thank 9 you .10 ( Audience	participation . )11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	We will	be in 12 recess	until	a quarter	after one .13 Let	me  read the first four	names when 14 we come back :15 They are :16 Roberta	Bernstein ;17 Regina	Shanley ;18 Jimmy Silber ; and 19 Marcell	Rosenblatt .20 A VOICE :	What	number is that ?21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Tenant numbers	are 22	17 and	18 .23 ( Which	were all the	proceedings	in the 24 morning session	of the	public	hearing which	ended 25	at 12 : 58 p . m . )23
