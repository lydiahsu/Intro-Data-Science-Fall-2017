2 third of the universe is at market within  the3 regulated universe. So I would think that  at4 least a third of tenancies in the market  today5 are preferential rents or pract ically market6 rents even though there are legal  limits.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Pagan.8 MR . PAGAN:	Just a follow-up on9	the question before.10	A VOICE:	We can't hear you.11	MR . PAGAN:	In reference to the12 additional charges that come up , can you explain13 to us what the 1/40 is?14 MR. DAN MARGULIES:	Well, the15 1/40th increase is an increase that is  available16 for improvements to an individual apartment  as17 opposed to building wide . That adds 1/40th to the18 rent ; for exampl e, the owner puts in a new19 refrigerator,  it ' s 1/40th of the cost of that.  If20 the tenant is in occupancy, it can only be  done21 with the tenant 's consent. They request a22 refrigerator and agree to an  increase.23 And  if the apartment  is vacant ,24 the owner can put in new equipment and add it  to25 the base rent.12 
2 MR. PAGAN:	Is it limited to the3 equipment?4 MR . DAN MARGULIES:	Excuse me?5 MR. PAGAN:	Is it limited to the6	equipment?7	MR. DAN MARGULIES :	It 's limited8 to the improvements. And there are  improvements9 which the Division of Housing accepts  and10 improvements that they don't accept.11 MR . PAGAN:	All right.12 And the l/40th applies for  forty13 months?14 MR. DAN MARGULIES :	No, no, no.15 Because , as with most  aspects of16 rent regulation, the intent is not to  compensate17 the owner dollar for dollar . The intent is to18 provide the owner an incent ive to continue19 investing in his property, something that I  wish20 some of the tenant groups and this Board  would21 work on .22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	The answer is23 no . Okay.24 Any additional questions?25 MR. CASTELLANO:	Back to the8 
2	MCis, I was just curious.3	The owner is entitled to take  an4 increase if approved by DHCR of an MCI as  a5 result of an investment in the  building.6 I was wondering where that7 appears on the real property income and  expense8 statement.9	MR. DAN MARGULIES:	It's a10	capital expenditure.  It doesn' t appear.11	MR. CASTELLANO:	Anywhere?12 MR. DAN MARGULIES:	No.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 Mr. Rivera has one  clarification15 to make.16 MR. RIVERA:	Mr. Margulies, you17 mentioned that DHCR had the statistics. We  have18 not gotten those statistics.19 MR. DAN MARGULIES:	I can't20 remember  - -  I know the question was asked  them21 how many preferential	rents there were22 registered . I'm not sure if they gave us a23 statistic in answer to that. I don' t recall24 specifically.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We will have12 
2	to ask the question.3	MR. DAN MARGULIES:	But as I4	say, from our experience about one- third of the5	universe, the regulated rents are essentially   the6	same as market rates.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.8 Thank you.9 Next.10 (Audience participat ion.)11 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Our next12 speaker is Florence Rice, to be followed  by13 Andrew Hoffman and Phoebe  Wiener.14 MS. FLORENCE RICE:	Good15 afternoon. I'm Florence  Rice.16 I have - -17 A VOICE:	Can't hear her.18 MS. FLORENCE RICE:	Can you hear19	me?20 I have ten points I would  like21 to speak to.22 Once  economic  interests  - banks,23 landlords, real estate entrepreneurs  and greedy24 politicians	- decide they are going to move on  a25 community to maximize profits, all systems   kick20 
2 in to assist  them - housing  court , welfare ,3 foster care for children, education  system,4 prisons and jails.5	Number two, economic racism is6 the rule rather than the exception and it  means7 that black and brown people are  effectively8 locked out of participating	in society as9 equitable partners. We are not at the table  when10 major decisions are being  made.11	Number three, what we have now12 is a well oiled and moneyed effort to  continue13 urban removal. That means that the gears are   in14 motion to remove all black, brown and poor  people15 out of New York City  permanently.16 Number four, the Rent17 Stabilization Board is stacked to make the  lives18 of regular hand- working people in this City  so19 diff icult that they cannot afford to remain  in20 this town no longer.21 Number five, senior citizens  are22 being put out of their apartments that they  have23 lived in for twenty, thirty and forty  years24 because we had become criminals because  we've25 lived in an apartment for that many  years.12 
2 First the agencies kick in  and3 label poor elderly black people incompetent , and4 then they have them shipped out , with the help  of5 major landlords, to nursing homes and  the6 landlords take over their apartments, jack up   the7 rent , triple what it was and remove the apartment8 from the rent stabilization  category.9	Number six, as our communities10 in Harlem and Washington Heights whiten up  at11 increasing rates, our neighbors are being   forced12 out.13 Number seven, the city of  the14 very rich and the very poorest of the poor.  And15 we know who they will be, don' t we?	We always16 know who they will be. They' ll be the black,  the17 brown and the poor who have been manipulat ed  by18 economic racism.19 Number eight , whether we are20 talking about housing or health, crime  or21 education, it doesn't matter, economic  racism22 means that we blacks and browns are locked out   of23 the seats of power and have no control over   these24 systems that dominat e our lives.25 Number nine, landlords  are10 
2 making plenty of money or they would get out  of3 the business. The very  richest4	(Audience participat ion.)5	MS. FLORENCE RICE:	- - of the6	rich - -7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Wrap up,8	please.9	MS. FLORENCE RICE:	- - made10 money on the stock market while everyone  else11 just keeps gett ing poorer and poorer .12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. FLORENCE RICE:	Number ten,14 rents should not only not be increased , but  rents15 should be rolled back so that people can  afford16 to stay in their apartments that they  have17 inhabited all of their lives and that  that18 neighborhood  lives of thousands here in New York19 City can continue.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 MS. FLORENCE RICE:	And I am22 guilty,  I'm  in criminal , number  one , because I'm23 black, and number two, because I lived to  be24 eighty- three.25 So now you kick out the  old10 
2 folks, send them to nursing homes and do  anything3 you damn pl ease because it 's money that buys4 anything.5 (Audience participation.)6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let the7 record show that we gave you forty- five extra8 seconds for being eighty- three.9 Go ahead.10 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Our next11 speaker is Andrew Hoffman. After that it will  be12 Phoebe Wiener and then Richard Alpert .13 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	Good14 afternoon.15 My name is Andrew Hoffman and  I16 come here today to speak about the  continuing17 problems property  owners face managing  mult i -18 family housing in New York.19 I 'm an owner, manager of20 rentals, co- ops and condos throughout New York21 City . I 'm  also the Vice  Chairman of the Community22 Housing Improvement Program known as CHIP .23 As in past years, the  current24 Rent Guidelines Board proposed increases have  not25 kept up with my current increases in  expenses.7 
2 One fallacy I see of the  rent3 guideline system is the market basket  approach4 for ascertaining  increases and decreases in my5 expenses. While the market basket approach is  a6 start , the reality is that it does not take into7 account many of the items associated with   running8 housing.9	The basket created in 1970  and10 last updated in 1982 is in critical need of   an11 update. Many things have  changed since	'82, most12 particularly the Division of Housing  and13 Community Renewal , Housing  Court , lead paint ,14 asbestos regulations, Department  of Buildings'15 regulations. They've all  increased.16 One of the issues the  current17 system cannot address is the huge swings  in18 single expense items. Large increases in  energy19 costs this past year and a decrease  most20 currently has shown that the system is  flawed.21 Add to that the fact that  many22 of us decided to forego the significant  energy23 swing and decided to lock in our energy  costs24 this past year has further complicated the   issue.25 While many of my fellow owners have seen   energy10 
2 costs decrease, I've only seen a small   reduction3 because I tried to hedge the wild fluctuation   of4 the previous year by buying energy futures  only5 to lose out in the short  term.6 Now we have the problem  with7 insurance. The market basket is only beginning   to8 not ice the fluctuations in insurance.9 CHIP put together a task  force10 recently putt ing owners and insurance executives11 together to try to figure out what ' s going  on .12 The only thing that we came out of the meeting   at13 our first meet ing last week, the only thing that14 came out of the meeting was that we are going   to15 be looking at increases of fifty to a  hundred16 percent and many of us are going to be looking   at17 increases of at least three hundred  percent.18 Add to this the fact that we  are19 getting coverage with higher deductibles and   now20 lead insurance in being excluded. The factors   are21 many with 9/11 being only the straw that  broke22 the camel ' s back.23 The industry' s benchmark is now24 approaching rates of $500 to $600 per DU  to25 properly ensure a mult iple- family building.2 
2 There were a lot of pretty  smart3 people in this room and the only thing that   came4 out of it is competition for insurance  business5 has dried up and the rule of supply and  demand6 has forced us into these large  increases.7 Supply and demand; nothing the8 founders of the rent regulatory system  know9 anything about.10 We need your help. Two and  four11 percent  increases are not enough. Economic12 conditions are such that market rate  apartment13 rents that are subsidizing the low- rent14 stabilized and controlled apartments are  coming15 down. We are only seeing vacancies on the  market16 rent apartments. Stabilized tenants are  not17 moving and a small percentage  increase on the18 already low apartments doesn' t help.19 Thank you.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 Any questions?22 (No response.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me make24 an announcement. The stenographer needs to take   a25 break. So we will do two more speakers and   then2 
2	go to a ten- minute break for the stenographer.3	MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Our next4	speaker is Phoebe Wiener and then Richard  Albert.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And then we6 will have a ten-minute  break.7 Phoebe Wiener or Wiener?8	MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Phoebe Wiener9	or Wiener, are you in the  hall?10AVOICE:Couldyou say what11numbers those are,please?12	MR. McLAUGHLIN:	She's number1315onthetenants' list.14OKay.15Richard Albert.16CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We will take17 one more after that.18 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	That will be19 Janet Henne ,  I believe,  or Henne.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Bru- Mar21 Tenants Association.22 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Bru- Mar23 Tenants Association.24 MR. RICHARD ALBERT:	My name is25 Richard Albert. I'm the part owner and  sole17 
2 manager of a rental complex in  Queens.3 I want to talk to you  about4 several items regarding insurance, past , present5 and future, all of which affect very  seriously6 the upward trend in insurance  costs.7 This past January I got a  letter8 from my insurance company saying that the  new9 square footage in our apartment complex is   77,47510 square feet. For sixty years it was 46,154   square11 feet . All of a sudden they discovered this, a12 sixty- eight percent  increase in our square13 footage which resulted in a sixty- six percent14 increase in our insurance.15 I went to my broker and  said16 what can I do. I mean this is  crazy.17 He  said ,  stop complaining. My18 other clients are paying up to three  hundred19 percent , sixty- six percent is the low end, pay20 it . And I did.21 Secondly, I have a tenant  who22 works for a hospital , has got free health23 insurance. So he sends his kid for a chest  x-24 ray, a four or five-year old kid, comes back, the25 kid has lead poisoning. The doctor reports it   to2 
2 the Health Department . The Health Department3 comes in, finds a violation, yep, there' s lead on4 the outside of the window ledges and on the  front5 door. And the violation, it costs $12,000 , six6 months . I'm still doing - - I called this   friend7 and I was supposed to go to an EBT today. I  came8 here today to tell you about  it.9 Then the tenant comes to me  and10 he says, Mr . Albert , I want  to move out . How11 about letting me out of my lease and give me  back12 my security .13 I said: fine, how about  letting14 me out of the lawsuit.15 He said: I'll think about  it.16 He came back to me and he said ,17 oh, no, that lawsuit is going to be my  child' s18 educat ion fund.19 So I said I'm not letting  you20 out of it . And we' re currently in the middle of a21 lawsuit ,  $10 million  I believe.22 Lastly, I was notif ied by the23 City that they plan to build a gas station  right24 alongside my complex. Part of this gas station   is25 36,000 gallons of storage of gasoline .2 
2 This was opposed by the3 community board, by the Borough Office of  Queens4 and me.5 I just got a letter from  Helen6 Marshall , our Borough President , saying I'm7 sorry, BSA has approved this thing. They  were8 sorry but that 's all we can do.9 So here I am now faced with10 36 , 000 of gasoline . If you read the news, the11 latest thing that the terrorists want to do  is12 use gasoline tanks as a terrorist  item.13 If my insurance company  finds14 out about this, can you imagine what my  rates15 will be?16 Thank you.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I hope18 they're not in the audience.19 Any quest ions?20 (No response.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,22 sir.23 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	This will be24 the last speaker before our  break.25 As an update, we are up  to2 
12162number16 on the tenant list and the next  speaker3is 27.So if you are pre- registered and you are4on thelist before that , you have to go upstairs5to thedesk and tell us that you are here .6 And on the owners' side, we  are7 up to speaker number 20 when we  return.8 So, once again, if you are pre-9 registered, you' re okay.10 Is Ms. Janet Henne here?11	MS . JANET HENNE:	Ladies and12 gentlemen :13 My name is Janet Henne and  I'm14 President of my tenants association  which15 consists of about five hundred  units.16 And I reside in Rego  Park,17 Queens.18 My tenants are paying sixty  to19 seventy- five percent of their income. We have20 been hit by four MCis, Major  Capital21 Improvements, in the past year. Of course we  all22 know that a Major Capital Improvement is a  rent23 increase. It 's also a repair, not an improvement .24 And that 's the only way we can get a building-25 wide repair is if the landlord can put in for   an12 
2 MCI which he knows after four years,  thirty3 years, whatever the law is, he can put  in.4	Rents have gone up from  $6005 since 1997 to $2000 with MCi s, vacancy6 decontrols, Rent Guidel ines Board increases, et7 cetera.8 And also we are losing  an9 apartment  every mont h now - - again, this is  in10 Queens  - - off rent controls  altogether.11	Our landlord , I believe, is the12 largest and richest in New York, doesn' t make13 repairs unless we call in an inspector, put in   a14 reduced services or threaten a rent strike.  I'm15 talking about repairs, things like leaks,  nothing16 cosmetic.17 To itemize the many forms  of18 harassment used to get rid of tenants so  that19 they can go off of a rent stabilization, it  would20 take me a half - hour.21 Hundreds of my neighbors  are22 highly traumatized survivors of 9/11 . They were23 in the Towers, the vicinity of the Towers  and24 have lost their jobs and are still losing   their25 jobs.12 
2 How do I counsel them about3 losing their homes?4 How do I counsel myself?5 To me the rent gouging is  the6 equivalent of 21st century robber barons and  war7 profiteers.8 (Audience participation .)9	MS. JANET HENNE:	Way past10 ordinary greed.11 (Audience participation. )12 MS. JANET HENNE:	Are we selfish13 to deny someone forty, fifty, sixty  percent14 profit , a new Lexus, a new SUV made from our15 blood and our children' s blood and fear?16 We have over two/three  people17 that are living in studios now; four/f ive people18 living in one- bedrooms.19 Two bedrooms are now over  $2000,20 of course, all off stabilizat ion, which any21 tenant or company  - - which tenants are filled   in22 those $2000 apartments are either transient  or23 their companies  are paying  their rent .24 How can we rebuild and  destroy25 people who live here at the same time? We   cannot10 
2	rebuild the City and destroy the  people.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	If you could4	wrap up, please.5	MS. JANET HENNE:	We should6	decrease the rents, not increase  them.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 (Audience participat ion.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ten minutes.10 MR . McLAUGHLIN:	And , again,11 we' re up to 24 on the tenants' list and 20 on  the12 owners' list.13	So,- -14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It 's 3 :1515 now. Be back at 3 :25, the starting time.16 Thank you.17 (At 3 :15 o'clock p.m. there was18 a recess in the proceedings. )19 (At 3 :27 o'clock p.m. the20 proceedings were resumed.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We are ready22 to get started.23 So try and come back as soon  as24 you can.25 We are ready to get  started.14 
2	The next testif ier is?3 MS. VISSER:	James Anderson.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	James5	Anderson.6 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	I'm here.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	James8	Anderson, that 's you? Go ahead, Mr. Anderson.9	MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Yes.10 Honorable Members of the  Rent11 Regulation - -12 A VOICE:	Can't hear you.13 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Honorable14 Members of Rent Regulation:15 I would pray that you get right16 idea to claim to try to help  us.17 According to the Bible, big  shot18 (unintelligible.) according to the people in  the19 earth, big shot is right for people that we  like.20 So I go l ight now.21 Destroy this two trade world22 center, they help insurance company to write  the23 insurance. That 's maybe not true.24 Big company, fuel company,25 American, together with Arabic , they raise too10 
2 much fuel , but they stop it. But fuel very tight.3 And small man, I like  anyway.4	So when the apartment become5 vacant , see, Pagan declare not necessary to raise6 the rent. And the new tenant says definitely  must7 be painted , which costs a lot of money. According8 to Pagan, not all right. I like talking  truths.9 And Rivera force landlords  to10 sell the building which is harassment and  the11 landlord must press charges, take them to court ,12 because he go like Fidel Castro .13 So we live in the greatest  city,14 the richest city, easy for jobs, easy  for15 everything. But liberals start with  maybe16 fifty/sixty years to change the law against the  -17 - the civil rights. So now the landlords will  not18 have equal rights like  tenants.19 Landlords declare one-year20 lease, tenant says two, and tenant dictate to  him21 according to the law when they change it , must22 get two years.2 3	So landlords in New York City24 l ive like Indians in reservation. And I'm not25 educated, stupid , but I house high class educated24 
2 people that New York City' s union unique for  this3 reason because  economic recession.4 So we have a lot of people  with5 big salary, commissioners and other  politicians,6 parasites, who receive over $100,000, over7 $150, 000. They are working against the City.  They8 don' t care for the no one problem, but political9 nonsense,  liberals working with the tenants win10 elections. Conservat ive who help working peopl e,11 unions, landlords to win election, they do not   do12 nothing.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you14 wrap up, please.15 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	One second.16 One time I see 1980, that  one17 year eleven percent raise. For what reason18 turning down? Anybody able to answer it  because19 you're smart people. The smartest , Rivera,  Pagan20 and Holder.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank22 you.23 We appreciate the vote  of24 confidence.25 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Last year2 
2 nobody asked me question. Now you don' t ask me3 questions. That is discrimination.	I will talk to4 my lawyer and maybe press  charges.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. I hope6	so.7	MS. VISSER:	The next speakers8	are Paul Podhaizer, Nick Petras and Marc  Landis.9	Mr. Podhaizer, is he here?10 Your time is running.11 MR. PAUL PODHAIZER:	I'm12 waiting  for the reporter. A special dispensation.13 My name is Paul Podhaizer.  I'm14 Chairman of the Brightwater Towers  Tenants15 Council located on Seventh Avenue in  Coney16 Island.17 I also represent the Trump18 rental buildings located at 2940 and 3000  Ocean19 Parkway in Coney Island.20 I speak for 1500 concerned21 rental families, mostly senior citizens. We  have22 come here in this 90 degree heat to present  to23 the Rent Guidelines Board our reason for  urging24 the Board to replace the proposed unwarranted  two25 and four percent increase with a rent  reduction.10 
2 For many years the Rent3 Guidelines Board has granted overstated  rent4 increases and high vacancy allowances.  Those5 increases may have seemed small and  insignificant6 in their effective years. However, now in  2002,7 seven years later, the results are in  Brightwater8 and Trump Rentals, they are as high as $1700   from9 a high of $700.10 Also, this prevails  throughout11 the City of New York . One does not have to be an12 accountant major to understand that due to  the13 cumulat ive effect of the overstated Rent14 Guidelines Board decisions the average  rent15 increases for long- time residents are over forty16 percent higher than they should  be.17 Do you wonder why you have in18 attendance Brightwater  tenants who sometimes get19 boisterous? What could be worse for a  proud20 citizen than facing an unaffordable,  unwarranted21 high rent increase that could result  in22 deprivation of quality food, clothing  and23 medicine, life' s essentials?24 Please do not misconstrue  my25 remarks.  I am not ant i- landlord.  I do believe2 
2 landlords are entitled to a fair prof it and they3 are doing better than that.4 I ask, do you know of any  other5 business where the owner is guaranteed a  profit.6 A landlord is protected against loss by  providing7 by proving his case for a hardship  increase.8 If he needs Major Capital Improvements, that 's9 paid for by the tenant as a permanent  rent10 increase.11 In conclusion, we appeal to  you12 before you make your final decision, times  are13 not that good. Middle income people are  losing14 jobs .15 Review and consider how  the16 cumulative effect of the past overstated  rent17 increases have resulted in the loss  of18 affordable, middle- income housing.19 The young and skilled middle-20 income are forced to live and work away from  New21 York City, a tremendous tax loss.  Without22 affordable housing for the young and middle  class23 New York City will wither and die .24 The future of New York City  is25 in your hands . Do with it wisely and fairly.2 
2 A reminder: a one and  two3 percent may be a cost of a cocktail to  the4 affluent . However, to some tenants it may mean5 the loss of nutritious meals and/or  medical6 necessities.7 I thank you for your time.8 (Audience part icipation .)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 (Audience part icipation .)11 MS. VISSER :	The next speaker12 is Nick Petras, followed by Marc Landis,  followed13 by Lewis Barbanel.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Nick Petras.15 MR. NICK PETRAS:	My name is16 Nick Petras and I'm representing my  family' s17 interests. Among other things, we own  several18 hundred rent stabilized apartments, about  ninety19 percent of which are in Queens  County.20 I'm a lawyer with an MBA  in21 finance from NYU . My dad bought his first22 building in 1959 and I've been in charge of   our23 day- to- day operations of our real estate business24 for the past several years .25 I would like to talk about two10 
2	things.3	One is the low rents of long-4 term tenants, and the other is something  that5 we've done for our buildings to increase  physical6 security .7 I think everybody in New York8 knows	and I've heard some of the  testimony9 today	that the longer a tenant has been in  a10 rent regulated apartment , the better the deal the11 tenant most likely has.12 I think there was something  in13 The New York magazine recently about  that.14 Savvied owners of New York15 apartments also know that the lowest rents in  a16 building aren't rent controlled tenants, but  they17 are the long - time rent stabilized tenants . They18 are the tenants from the early	'70s .19 In 1981, as an example, my20 family purchased a 48-unit building on  29th21 Street in Astoria where my dad first set up  his22 law practice , consisting mostly of one- bedroom23 apartments with a total of 127 rentable  rooms.24 The average room rent in  this25 building	is $249, almost $250, or $675 a  month10 
2 per  apartment .3 Last year' s operating costs,4 including the real estate taxes, were about  $1255 a room a month. We budgeted for higher  operating6 costs this year due to an increase in the cost  of7 insurance and heating oil.8 When my dad bought the  building9 in 1981, tenants were attempting to get a  7A10 administrator appointed and were conducting  a11 rent  strike. Well ,  I guess the striking  tenants12 got the well - run building they wanted. More than13 thirty- seven percent of the tenants in the14 building have lived there twenty years or  more.15 This number includes only four rent  controlled16 apartments.17 Average rent for the long- term18 rent stabilized tenants, those who have  been19 there twenty years or more, is $510 a month  or20 $193 a room.21 That should be put in  contrast22 to my operat ing cost of $125 a room.23 Obviously, these tenants  don't24 cover - - that 's just operating costs - -  their25 proport ionate costs. Considering our cost of2 
2 debt , which admittedly is cheap now, and our cost3 of equity, which is not as cheap by  definition,4 these tenants don' t cover their proportionate5 share of running the building.6 Sad to say, perhaps we would  be7 better of f if we didn' t run a nice building8 there, you know, we didn' t paint the halls as9 much and didn' t do as much maintenance .10 A longevity increase of  six11 percent or more for tenants in possession  ten12 years or more will help to make these tenants  pay13 their fair share of costs.14 The second thing I would like  to15 talk about is in 1998 we started  installing16 access control systems in our buildings.  These17 serialized keys give us the ability to  limit18 access to buildings. And the reason we did it  was19 we found people who didn' t have a right to be  in20 the building, in our laundry room, for  example,21 or kids hanging out on the roof who had keys  to22 the front door that they got from neighbors  and23 acquaintances.24 These costs are not MCiable25 other than we are going to do one with  an2 
1	2302 intercom system and they are not reflected  in3 your data.4 You have to think about some  of5 these costs when you evaluate what it is. It 's6 not just the PIOC. There are other things that  we7 do - computer systems, whatever  - that are    our8 actual costs and we spend the money because  we9 think it 's the right thing to do.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11	MR.

There are quite a few  pages.5	But basically	- - this is for6 Lester Denenberg.7 Please allow me to  introduce8 myself to you. My name is Lester Denenberg and   I9 am a tenant who resides in the Wavecrest  Gardens10 Housing Complex in Far Rockaway, New  York.11 I came here today to tell you  a12 story on how my landlord, the Rockaway One  Co .13 LLC, squeezes out the tenants and  particularly14 the senior citizens and Section 8 tenants  from15 their apartments in order to decontrol  the16 apartments and to collect fatter  rents.17 The landlord last year in  200118 took me to court twice. He was in a  hospital.19 He' s got a condition. In fact , that is what he20 was just hospitalized  for. He suffers from21 cellulit is in the left leg. And he was put in  the22 hospital for like ten days or two  weeks.23 So he was away. He had been  in24 the hospital twice. He was late with his  rent25 because he was hospitalized. He got letters   from6 
2 the hospital.3 The landlord still brought  him4 to court and it was  dismissed.5 The landlord also said you  got6 to pay on the 1st. He said my Social  Security7 comes on the 3rd. The landlord said I don' t  care.8 But he finally straightened  that9 out.10 Okay?11 Also he said that they  are12 trying  - -  and he' s a Section 8 tenant. They've13 tried to raise his rent to $1650. And he was   in14 court with that and that too was  dismissed.15 I'm trying to shorten this  for16 you because he is a very meticulous,  detailed17 gentleman. But these are the kind of things  he18 says happened to him.19 And they are having  these20 problems, you know, within this building.21 So this is basically hi s story.22 Thank you very much.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 (Audience participation.)25 MS.

We manage and/or own 1300 units  in7 the five boroughs of New  York.8 What I came to talk to you  today9 about is primarily the insurance increases . I'm10 sure you've already heard that typically we  are11 seeing forty percent  increases.12 However, last week we had a  very13 terrible situat ion where the increase was much14 higher.15 I will go back to a previous16 case though about three months to show  the17 extremes .18 On a building in Queens,  a19 twelve- story elevator building, fire-proofed20 building, which is the best type of  construction21 that you can have, the renewal was a  ninety22 percent increase. It went from $240 per unit   to23 $480 per unit.24 And the irony there being  is25 that even though it was a fire-proofed  building,5 
2 they insisted on raising it higher than  forty3 percent because the cost  of reconstructing	it4 from scratch is that much greater .5 And when you ask that the  whole6 idea of building a fire-proofed building was  that7 it wouldn' t burn down as easily as another8 building and it 's less destructible, they could9 care less. The problem is the replacement cost  on10 that.11 But as I mentioned before,12 something that happened this week was a  Brooklyn13 package of buildings, older buildings. There  are14 some claims. They're mostly elevators.  The15 insurance went from $285 a unit to over $800  a16 unit . That  is over a two hundred  percent17 increase.18 The owner could not even get19 lead paint coverage, of which lead he did  not20 install or paint in the building, but he' s still21 liable for.22 The average rent in that  group23 of buildings is $600. He is now paying $800  per24 month, more than one month' s rent , for his25 insurance, which is not even fully covered .2 
1	2352 These rents are after an  MCI3 program in those buildings bringing them to  a4 better condition, new boilers, new electrical   and5 new windows.6 The second item I mentioned  that7 I would like to discuss, that after  September8 11th we seem to be dealing in a deregulated  world9 so to speak where you have even  stabilized10 apartments  - - we have  a building  downtown on11 Clinton Street where the average rents were   $150012 for new tenants moving in after a  gut13 rehabilitat ion. At this point in time we reduced14 those rents. South of Canal Street we  reduced15 them even more.16 And when you take back an17 apartment in an old walkup that 's a hundred years18 old, it still requires a $40,000 gut  renovation19 whether you can get the $1400 or $1500 or not.20 So we are seeing the rent  rolls21 being reduced in the market area whereas the   rent22 stabilized rents are artif icially low.23 I thank you for your time.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 Any questions?2

LINDA ZOBLOTSKY :	while23 
2 I pay my rent on time. I carry my share of  the3 burden.4 That landlord in New York  State5 and New York City goes unpunished while  good6 tenants 1   who may not pay a month' s rent because7 they are not getting services 1	are thrown out on8 the sidewalk.9 I pay $710.33 for a tiny 10 x  1310 studio. I've been there nine- and - a- half years. I11 do musical theatre and off ice jobs. My rent  is12 one- half to one- third of my monthly income.13 My landlord owns several14 residential and commercial buildings. He is  not15 poor. We've lost good commercial tenants  who16 wanted to pay a rent increase so my  landlord17 could get a Kentucky Fried Chicken  establishment.18 He is not poor. He has  replaced19 our lobby with a lobby that looks the same.  He20 can show repairs on paper 1	but it doesn' t look21 different.22 In the meantime in our23 apartments we live with leaking pipes 1	pipes that24 burst 1   rusty wat er 1   a building that is infested25 with mic e 1	rats and roaches.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES 1  INC.521 Fifth Avenue 1       New York1       New York 10175

I have a cracked window.  My9 landlord doesn' t think that that needs to be10 repaired. And I didn' t break it.11 My super loses the keys to  my12 apartment .

There are a14 lot of keys float ing around in my building to my15 apartment  that my  landlord has lost .16 In my building we help keep  our17 hallways clean and we pick up trash in our  air18 shaft because our landlord can collect that  rent19 and cash that rent check but he doesn' t provide20 these necessary services and we want our  building21 to be clean.22 Because we help save our23 landlord operating costs, I ask for a zero  rent24 increase and stronger rent  laws.25 (Audience participation.)8

I'm a small property owner.   I9 own an eight - family apartment building I bought10 in 1981 when my mother died .11 My mother died because  she12 refused to go into a nursing home and she  had13 medical support turned off. She had  emphysema.14 Okay?15 I put all my money into the16 building, my total inheritance, including what   I17 paid the lawyers. I then proceeded to try to  run18 the building which started to lose money .19 The person who I thought  was20 going to give me some advice , his relatives had21 owned the building  prior  to that , took off , went22 across the country. I was left holding the  bag23 myself. I had some teaching experience . I  started24 teaching in the public  schools.25 I was doing that , taking courses5 
2 and trying to run the building and trying to  make3 up the deficit in part - time jobs here and there,4 little things as an art ist to cover the cost of5 trying to ensure I had money for  payment.6	As a result , I collapsed with7 chronic fatigue and I spent the next two- and - a-8 half years in bed.9 I did try and sell the  building10 and I couldn't get the price I felt I needed  to11 cover what I had emotionally put into it and   in12 terms of my mother' s death .13 So I struggled to make  the14 building a much bett er building because that  was15 my goal and to get decent  tenants.16 As a result of that , I can say17 that from what I have been hearing in these   rent18 controlled boards, I can obviously see that   there19 are some people who cannot pay their rent ,  who20 cannot afford their  apartments.21 This is not my business.  My22 business is to run a building, but I  can23 sympathize with their situation.24 There' s also a problem of25 landlords like I who pay two mortgages and   have7 
2 had enormously high expenses with a tenant  who3 both trashed an apartment , who caused a lead4 abatement problem because he bought  another5	building and tore that apart , where I had to pay6 eight mont hs rent free in order to get him out of7 the building plus pay a lawyer' s fee. And indeed8 the first check I gave the lawyer bounced  because9 I couldn' t get to the bank fast enough to try and10 cover the small amount that was  needed.11 At the end of this these  people12 moved out at the end of their eight  months,13 trashed the apartment for which my  insurance14 company covered $3000 of a $4000 cost. So I  had15 to fix up that apartment.16 And I moved myself	into an17 apartment where a lady was rent controlled  who18 apparently did not file for a Senior  Citizen19 SCRIE because she had too much money. I  moved20 into the apartment , and had to fix up my21 apartment and that apartment and half of  another22 apartment and the apartment that I had moved  out23 of.24 That 's almost like three- and- a-25 half apartments in one year. But the tenant  who6 
2 was above me,  the apartment  I used , had  managed3 to crack my ceiling in the living room. So   I've4 got to replace that in the apartment that I  moved5 out of.6 And where I moved in, the  tenant7 had ruined the ceiling so I had to replace   that.8	Then after I had no money,  I9 said I can't do anything more, I found out  that10 the joists were dry runned under the  kitchen11 floor. In fact , one joint was missing over12 against the wall because a prior tenant  had13 flooded a whole half of the  building.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Please try to15 wrap up, Maude.16 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	So I did that17 and I got that done.18 Now, in spite of the fact  that19 I've survived this for twenty years, Mr.  Rivera20 wants to tell me if I can't make a prof it , I21 should sell the building.22 It seems to me that as an  artist23 I appreciate creative thinking and I  can't24 understand what the direction of this Board   is.25 It seems like it 's a political problem. And it9 
2 seems like it takes expertise and it takes  people3 who are qualified for that . And it doesn' t seem4 to be going in that direction. It seems to  be5 going in the direction of hitt ing the landlord  on6 the head in order to try and help the tenants   pay7 the rent.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to9	wrap up.10 Thank you.11 Any questions?12 (No response.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 (Audience participation.)15 MS. VISSER:	State Senator Tom16 Duane, followed by Mary Hommann and  Elizabeth17 Ronis.18 SENATOR TOM DUANE:	Good19 afternoon.20 I'm Tom Duane and I  represent21 the 27th Senatorial District in Manhattan. And22 I'm here today to voice my strong opposition to   a23 rent increase for New York City rent   stabilized24 units .25 (Audience part icipation.)10 
1	2452	SENATOR TOM DUANE:	As I'm sure3 you all know, rent in the City of New York  is4 amongst the highest in the country. The rate  at5 which rent has been increasing illustrat es that6 the highest priority  for rent regulation policy7 of our City is protect ing the profits of the8 landlords rather than  fairness.9 (Audience participation. )10 SENATOR TOM DUANE:	If we11 cont inue to raise rents at the proposed rate,  we12 may soon find ourselves living in a  homogeneous13 community of elite, upper class tenants. At  a14 time when many New Yorkers are struggling  with15 job security and are trying to cope with  the16 aftermath of September 11th, we need to help   New17 Yorkers feel secure rather than fearful of   losing18 their homes.19 Decontrol  and unconscionably20 high rents will inevitably drive out  long- term21 residents of our  neighborhoods.22 The Price Index of  Operating23 Reports, as you know, for Fiscal Year 2002 showed24 that landlord costs have decreased  significantly25 from years preceding.3 
2 How then can we possibly  justify3 a call for further rent  increases?4 The cost of living in New  York,5 whose largest component is rent , has been6 increasing at a rate far faster than  salaries7 have. This means that New Yorkers spend  more8 money on rent than on anything else, which  makes9 rent increases at this time a de  facto10 tremendously unfair and unjust  sanction .11 Because  landlords' costs12 decreased by more than 1 .6 percent last year,  I13 advocat e strongly for a rent rollback .14 (Audience participation.)15 SENATOR TOM DUANE:	At the very16 least ,  I encourage  the Board  to consider a rent17 freeze until such time as the  relationship18 between salary and rent becomes  more19 proport ional.20 (Audience participation.)21 SENATOR TOM DUANE:	About22 148,000 apartments have become deregulat ed in  the23 last ten years, according to the 1999 New  York24 City Housing and Vacancy Survey, and there   are25 still far too many New Yorkers who are  being2 
2 forced to live beyond their means in order  to3 keep their homes.4 And I'll move quickly.5	These proposed	increases6 represent particular hardships for poor  and7 working class tenants in this City, the very  same8 people who we should be working hardest  to9 protect .10 I also want to take a moment  to11 comment on the poor tax that was finally  done12 away last year. This tax can be  extraordinarily13 dangerous in that it has the ability to  totally14 demolish a large segment of the community  of15 long- term tenants in the City and I am strongly16 opposed to its reinstatement.17 And ,  lastly,  I firmly believe18 that a rollback for SROs/hotels is important  as19 well . Now more than ever we have to work to20 safeguard the homes of our residents. The  ability21 to have a habitable, safe and affordable  home22 should be the goal of our greatest , bravest and23 most resilient city.24 Let 's tell the people of the25 City of New York and the State and the  nation6 
1	2482 that affordable housing is the cornerstone of  our3 housing policy and not an idea that only  exists4 in the hypothetical.5 Fairness for landlords and6 tenants is possible. Let 's reach for it.7 Thank you.8 (Audience participation.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are there any10 questions?11 (No response.)12 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Our thanks,13 Senator.14 SENATOR DUANE:	Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We appreciate16 your time.17 MS. VISSER:	Mary Hammann,18 followed by Elizabeth Ronis and William  Jordan.19 MS. MARY HOMMANN:	Members of20 the Rent Guidelines Board. My name is  Mary21 Hammann.22 I live at 350 East 52nd Street23 in Manhattan where I've lived for almost  thirty-24 four years .25 In my opinion rents should be10 
2 decreased or at most remain the same due to  the3 1.6 percent decrease in landlord operating  costs4 largely as a result of the lower utility and  fuel5 costs.6	As you know, this  information7 comes from the Board' s own study released in8 April of 2002.9 Year after year tenants  have10 been told that rents must be increased because  of11 an increase in landlord operating costs. How  fair12 is it to continue to increase rents when  these13 costs are admittedly down?14 Mine is a no frills  studio15 apartment for which I now pay $801.28 a month.  If16 increases are allowed each year, my home  will17 soon become unaffordable to me. At age  seventy-18 nine, I am too old and disabled to deal with  the19 horror of the prospect of having to move out  of20 town away from a familiar neighborhood and  close21 friends.22 I cringe to think of the  expense23 of locating a new home somewhere in another  city,24 the expense of the move itself and the wear  and25 tear of such a move on my precarious  health.7 
1	2502 I urge you to approve either  no3 increase this year or at most a half  percent4 increase for one-year leases and one percent  for5 two-years.6 I wanted to point out that7 before World War II landlords expected to have  a8 few vacancies and were content with profits  of9 about five percent. Now we have only a 3 .510 percent vacancy rate. So owners all in  general11 are making  out  fine. Let ' s not kid ourselves.12 Landlords of large buildings13 know this which is why they are not  represented14 here today.15 This new attack on long- term16 tenants is another shockingly inhuman  approach.17 Apartments are not just commodities. They  are18 people' s homes, the homes of good citizens, who19 should be respected , not treated as liabilities.20 New York has today become a get -21 rich or get - out city, which was coined by Nancy22 Franklin in The New Yorker a couple of years  ago23 and I think it ' s perfect.  It perfectly  describes24 the way you feel if you're not rich in New  York.25 Thank you very much.2

MARY HOMMANN:	I live at12 52nd and First in Manhattan . I pay a little over13 $800 a month.14 And what was the other quest ion?15 MS. HOLDER:	How long have you16 been there?17 MS. MARY HOMMANN:	About thirty-18 four years .19 MS. HOLDER:	How many units are20 in the building and how would you describe  the21 composition or how would you describe the type  of22 tenants that live in your  building?23 MS . MARY HOMMANN:	Actually24 older people have become a minority, very  much25 so. People are moving in and out in that  building7 
1	2522	with young kids, babies,  everything.3	We are not a liability in  that4	building. There are so few of us now, old people .5	MS . HOLDER:	How many units?6	MS. MARY HOMMANN :	And there are7	about a hundred and thirty- six apartments.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you9	eligible for Senior Citizen Rent  Exemption?10 MS. MARY HOMMANN :	Not quite . I11 have a little bit too much money, about  $25,00012 instead of $20,000.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay. Thank14 you.15 (Audience participation.)16 MS. VISSER:	Elizabeth Ronis,17 followed by William Jordan , followed by Judy18 Siegel.19 MS. ELIZABETH RONIS:	My name20 is Elizabeth  Ronis . I own a  seven- apartment21 building in Manhattan which I've owned since 22	1976 .2 3	I live in one of the units.  They24 are beautiful three- room apartments .25 First , I want  to dispute the24 
1	2532 claim that insurance rates have increased  only3 sixteen percent . My insurance rates have gone up4 almost two hundred and  thirty percent	in the last5 two years  - -  two hundred  and thirty percent in6 the last two years with no increase in the  amount7 of coverage .8	My insurance rates have  gone9	from $1650 in 2000 to $3600 in 2001 to $6400  in10 my current renewal. And that was only because  my11 insurance broker searched for a month to get  a12 lower rate .13 I have with me insurance14 schedules from my insurance broker if you  would15 like to see them . The figures do not include16 boil er insurance, which is another $800 to $100017 a year .18 Utility prices, according to  my19 records, have not decreased . Water rates are up20 6.5 and we all know that taxes will go up  again21 this year.22 My total rent roll is $7381.39  a23 month . This month the total of my mortgage plus24 the addit ional $2500 I had to pay for insurance25 was equal to $6500 . Add $500 Con Ed and the10 
2 super' s charge and that uses up my total rent.3 This leaves me nothing for  repairs.4	This building is now thirty-5 five years old and requires more and more  repairs6 and replacements. This month I 've had to install7 new heat ing pipes in the front part of the8 building for a cost of  $5000.9	In addition, I've had to  install10 backflows- out , a new City requirement , for11 another $500, plus change the release  valve.12 That ' s $5500, plus  my  approximately $400013 mortgage for a total of  $9500.14 This does not include the  cost15 for replacing and repairing defective  plastering16 and repairing the affected area on five  floors,17 the cost of which I estimate at another  $2000.18 Add another $500 for Con  Ed,19 plus my super, this brings my cost to $12,300  for20 July, $5000 more than my rental income for  the21 next month as well .22 It will not be long before  I23 have to do the same in the other half of  the24 building. From where am I going to get  this25 money?10 
1	2552 In 1999, I had to replace a3 boil er. That cost me $16,5000.4 Oh! An addendum to the  previous5 statement . These pipes are not an MCI.6	I had to replace a boiler  for7 $16 , 500. It will be another five years before I8 break even.9 My rents are as  follows:10	$740 - -11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Try to wrap12 up , please.13 MS. ELIZABETH RONIS:	I 've had14 tenants there for twenty- six years and their15 rents are now $740.16 I 've spent my entire life17 working for this building. And then I go to  my18 job. I think that a standard increase  throughout19 all boroughs does not make sense. Everything  is20 more expensive in Manhattan.21 I ask that you reassess your22 figures in the light of reality. I ask for  relief23 and fairness in your  rulings.24 Going on this way will result  in25 more building abandonments.11 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .3	(Audience participation .)4	MS. VISSER :	William Jordan,5	Judy  Siegel , Rhoda Lyman.6	MR. WILLIAM JORDAN:	Hi! My name7	is Bill Jordan . I am a photographic art ist .8 Can you hear?9 VOICES :	No.10 MR. WILLIAM JORDAN:	Is this11 turned on?12 My name is Bill Jordan . I'm a13 photographic  artists in the State University14 system, a loft tenant and a member of  the15 Steering Committee of the Lower Manhattan  Loft16 Tenants Associat ion, which represents ten17 thousand loft tenants in New York City .18 First of all , I believe that any19 increase in rents in New York City post 9/11  and20 in the wake of the current very deep recession  in21 the nation is absurd.22 But I want to particularly23 direct the Board to the special situation of  loft24 tenants .25 My own situation is  instructive10 
2 and totally representative of most loft  tenants3 in New York City.4 I moved into my loft in 1977 .5 Since that time I have invested literally  over6 several hundred thousand dollars of my own  funds7 to make my loft semi- livable as have many loft8 tenants.9 I also pay for my own heat , hot10 water and electricity, as again most other  loft11 tenants do.12 For many years I had an  illegal13 space heater, a dangerous commercial  space14 heater, in my loft when the landlord took out  the15 boiler. In addition, I 've had to do my own16 maintenance and I still do. And I've also  been17 able  - - have lived for twenty- five years without18 a resident ial lease and have been subject to19 harassment by the landlord in terms of  frivolous20 lawsuits trying to get out loft tenants .21 And this is very endemic in  the22 loft community.23 So I urge you, first of all , not24 to increase rents for tenants and to  recognize25 the special situation for loft tenants who  have2 
2 helped with their own sweat , equity, creativity3 and personal blood money to revitalize  downtown4 New York and other areas.5 This has been undertaken  - - this6 recognition has been undertaken by the  Board7 every year for the past several years. So I  urge8 you not to reward greedy loft boards who do  no9 maintenance and who force tenants to pay  for10 their own heat , electricity and hot water and11 other maintenance things in their lofts and  do12 not get their full protection of resident ial13 leases.14 Thank you very much.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 (Audience participation.)17 MR. LUBELL:	Sir, what is the18 rent for your loft?19 MR. WILLIAM JORDAN:	My loft20 right now is going  for about  - - it 's close to21 $1300 a month.22 MR. LUBELL:	And how many square23 feet do you have?24 MR. WILLIAM JORDAN:	It 's about25 eighteen hundred square feet. I'm a  photographer2 
2 so I need the space, that I use it for my  art.3 And that 's one reason why I selected that space.4	MR. LUBELL:	Where is it5	located?6	MR. WILLIAM JORDAN:	It 's7	located downtown in Soho.8	MR. LUBELL:	What street is it9	on?10 MR. WILLIAM JORDAN:	It 's on11 Broadway, between Spring and  Broome.12 MR. LUBELL:	Thank you.13 MR. WILLIAM JORDAN:	Can you14 factor in the amount of money that I've put  into15 that?16 MR. LUBELL:	I'm just - -17 MR. WILLIAM JORDAN:	Can you18 amortize that?19 MR. LUBELL:	I'm just asking you20 some questions. You answered the  questions.21 MR. WILLIAM JORDAN:	I'm also22 elaborat ing on my answers.23 MR. LUBELL:	Don't get24 defensive.25 MR. WILLIAM JORDAN:	No. I'm not10 
2	defensive . I 'm being  informat ive to you. Okay?3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.4 MR. WILLIAM JORDAN:	Any other5	questions?6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We appreciate7	the information.

JAMES PEYTON:	My name is10JamesPeyton.	And I'm concerned about  small11A VOICE:	Can't hear you.12MR. JAMES PEYTON:	My name is13JamesPeyton. And I'm concerned about  small14 landlord owners such as myself.15 First of all , there are many16 things that tenants do not know about:  painting,17 tax, water, insurance , which is up since 9/11 a18 great deal , electric.19 And if you call in a  plumber,20 you' re up to say a thousand dollars or five21 hundred dollars at least.22 Also the fifteen percent  tax23 that was taken away under Giuliani should  be24 restored for small landlord owners. It 's25 necessary,  highly necessary.14 
2 When we consider there are  many3 other things like oil , that 's up. We consider4 water, six- and - a- half percent that 's going up.5 There is no reason why  there6 should not be a raise across the board at  least7 for small landlord owners.8 Now, some of you mentioned9 selling your building if you were not able  to10 care for it . That 's not going to bring a change.11	Now, I would like you to look at12 it this way. Let ' s say I'm  living with one of  you13 all . I'm paying you rent. But all of a sudden I 'm14 not able to pay you. And  someone  - - you go  and15 talk to someone about it. And he say, sell  your16 building. I don' t think he' d care for that.17 Many people here are past  - -18 let 's say retired. Do you expect the landlords to19 bear the burden of these people? There' s a better20 way of doing it.21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. JAMES PEYTON:	No. It ' s23 true. Many times	many  - - I 'm sorry. I listened24 to you all.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let's have12

JAMES PEYTON :	Many speakers11 have spoken about age here. I myself am  sixty-12 five years old. I'm not looking for anyone  to13 support me . We live in a democracy  - -14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.16 MR. JAMES PEYTON :	that we17 hope will  consider and will  - -  if the senior18 citizens, such as myself , do what they should do .19 Many senior citizens want to lay the burdens  on20 landlords because some of these people have  money21 and are making  money .22 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	Please wrap23 up .24 MR. JAMES PEYTON :	They do not25 want the government into the business. They  would10 
2 rather lay the burden on the  landlord.3 The landlords cannot  support4 these people. It 's not fair. There' s nothing fair5 about it.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7	MR. JAMES PEYTON:	And I8	appreciate it.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you for10	your testimony.11	(Audience participation. )12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Next .13 MS. VISSER:	Rhoda Lyman,14 followed by Terry Borg.15 Is Rhoda Lyman here?16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Rhoda Lyman?17 Is she here?18 (No response.)19 MS. VISSER:	Howard Levitsky?20 MR. HOWARD LEVITSKY:	My name21 is Howard Levitsky and I'm a  professional22 musician, a member of the American Federation   of23 Musicians,  Local 802, working primarily in24 musical theatre.25 I came to New York City  five12 
2 years ago because it became necessary in order   to3 have some chance of upward mobility in  my4 profession.5 With regard to the rent I pay6 here, I'm one of the very lucky people who   after7 a year or so of subletting found a  rent8 stabilized apartment newly vacated by a  tenant9 who had lived there for many years. So  the10 regulated rent was at the time less than   $900.11 After my first renewal it went up above   $900.12 And thanks to the New York  rent13 regulations I have little cause for  complaint.14 Still one is told that  in15 budgeting one' s living expenses rent should  come16 in at about twenty- five percent of gross income.17 Given my varying  fortunes as a freelance18 musician, my percentage  in 1999 was thirty- two19 percent. I did make it at twenty- five percent  in20 2000 , which was a very good year for me. And it21 went back up to forty percent  in 2001. 2002   is22 looking pretty bad given what 's going on in the23 arts and theatre and so, which I'm sure you   know24 about.25 And, of course, - - well , as a2 
2 mature,  experienced  professional	in the theatre ,3 someone who has the qualifications to work  in4 Broadway theatres and is, in fact , doing so on a5 substitute basis and even being one of the  lucky6 ones who stumbled on to an apartment with  a7 relat ively low regulated rent , I have to have a8 very good year as a freelancer for my rent to  get9 anywhere near twenty- five percent of my income.10 If the rent increases you11 mandate become even higher, as job  opportunities12 in the arts and the theatre continue to drop,  my13 rent to income ratio could easily  skyrocket.14 And if anything happens  to15 further weaken the rent laws, I could easily  be16 forced to leave New York City all  together.17 Many, many workers in the arts18 have much higher rents and much less  livable19 apartments than me even under the guidelines  as20 they now stand.21 Given my struggle to live  within22 my means, think what it must be like for the  many23 who have it much harder than  me.24 I want to pass on to you  some25 common wisdom about life in the theatre. In  order2 
2 to even be considered for work at any high  level3 theatre nationwide, and especially in New  York4 City, you have to move here, you have to have  a5 New York City address.6 But in order to afford to  keep7 your home, you often have to leave for the  work,8 and  if you can sublet , in other words,  take out -9 of - town or touring work. And  that 's pretty10 ironic. And I'm guessing that the lives of  you,11 the members of the Board , do not resemble that12 and I'm hoping you will take a moment to  put13 yourself in our shoes.14 And ,  finally,  as you deliberate,15 I would hope you will consider the dire future  of16 the arts in New York City if this Board, as  well17 as City and State governments continue to  make18 decisions that will ult imately make it impossible19 for musicians,  actors, dancers, directors,20 designers and all of the other arts workers  to21 afford to exist here where we are supposed to  be,22andthen consider the future of the City  without23thearts.24Thank you very much.25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.
2	(Audience participation. )3	MS. VISSER:	Terry Borg,4 followed by Ted Sheridan, followed by  Helen5 Daniels.6	MR. TERRY BORG:	I own a ten-7	family apartment building  in Brooklyn.8 VOICES:	Louder.9 A VOICE:	Talk louder.10 MR. TERRY BORG:	I originally11 bought it as an equity investment without  the12 intention of making a large amount of cash on  a13 monthly basis.14 However, I'm often presented15 with barely even breaking even on a  monthly16 basis.17 I moved to the City about  eight18 years ago . I was in a rent stabilized apartment19 then as I am now. And the increase at the  time20 was  five and  seven percent , which  I thought was21 reasonable at the t ime.22 At this point I have  trouble23 meet ing expenses on a monthly basis. My expenses24 are variable. Even though we had a low cost  of25 fuel last year in relation to the year before,  my10 
1	2692 cost of insurance has risen, my taxes have   risen3 and I have other expenses that are rising .4 Similar to I had a water  main5 break which cost me more than a month' s worth of6 income just on that which was under the  sidewalk7 and I had to fix it right away. I had to go   into8 savings beyond the building' s budget.9 In addit ion, almost half of my10 tenants are under $500 a month. Previously,  the11 so-called poor tax, the $15 a month, made  a12 difference. I wasn' t able to do that last year.13 And I would like to see that brought back,   the14 supplement for apartments under $500 .15 Additionally,  I'm often16 receiving violations	from the City . My trash17 isn't put out correctly . There' s going to be new18 laws about recycling and my superintendent  may19 not be abiding by that and getting  additional20 tickets.21 I've recently gotten tickets22 from the Department of Health for rats  burrowing23 in my rear yard. I personally, upon a warning  of24 that , went back with my exterminator. We25 witnessed absolutely no evidence of  rat2 
2 burrowing. However, I still received a  ticket3 which again is another fine. And that 's another4 concern of mine.5	I've heard the argument raised6	many times today about rent increases not  being7	able to be paid by senior citizens. That would  be8 a very fair argument if there was no such  thing9 as a SCRIE exemption. So I don't understand  the10 basis for that.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 MR. TERRY BORG:	That' s it.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where is14 your building?15 MR. TERRY BORG:	In16 Williamsburg.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank18 you.19 (Audience participation. )20 MS. VISSER:	Ted Sheridan,21 followed by Helen Daniels and Joseph  Capestany.22 MR. TED SHERIDAN:	My name is23 Ted Sheridan. I'm an architect and a  rent24 controlled tenant.25 So I wanted to talk to you  from12 
2 the prospective of a professional and as  a3 tenant.4	As a tenant , I'm lucky I live in5 Stuyvesant Town where my rent is as high  as6 MetLife can get it . It 's almost to the $2000 mark7 which is their goal.8	As an architect , I have to deal9 with buildings  all the time. And  I , in fact , have10 worked for many landlords doing  renovational11 work, bringing buildings up to code  and12 overseeing repairs and construction .13 And although landlords can  make14 the claim with many details and many specifics  -15 things go wrong, they have expenses - I have  to16 say to them it 's a tough business and if you are17 going to be prepared to buy a building and  have18 tenants and run a building, you have to  be19 prepared to accept a lot of hard knocks  because20 it 's serious business owning a building, not only21 maintaining the physical structure, but  it 's22 serious business . You've got people in there and23 those people have lives and those people  depend24 on some stability in their lives.25 So I would say to the  landlords9 
2 that I do appreciate claims that things go  wrong,3 that it 's tough owning a building, but being a4 landlord doesn' t get you away from the risk of5 owning a building, which is a thorny  issue.6 So I would  ask that , in light of7 recent reduct ions in expenses for landlords, that8 there be no rent increase this year. And I  think9 that people like myself , who had to take pay  cuts10this year,and who were lucky enough to have  rent11controlledapartments, are really feeling  it.12In my office, which is a  six-13	person architect 's office, we all took twenty-14five percentpay cuts and we did that so  that15nobody wouldbe fired, nobody would be  forced16out.17 So I'm dealing with less income18 and I'm lucky to have an apartment in  Stuyvesant19 Town because  if I didn' t , I most  surely would20 have to move out of New York  City.21 Thank you.22 (Audience participat ion.)23 MS. VISSER:	Helen Daniels,24 followed by Joseph Capestany, followed by  Sam25 Herzog.17 
2 Helen Daniels?3 MS. HELEN DANIELS:	Good4 evening.5 I'm Helen Daniels. And I'm  here6 this evening representing  the Black Property7 Owners. It 's an organizat ion that has membership8 across the State of New York. Our members are   in9 New York City, they' re in Manhattan, Brooklyn,10 Queens, Brooklyn. We' re upstate. We have members11 who even live out - of - state who have property in12 New York.13 And I'm here this  evening14 because I wish to express concern when I come   to15 these hearings and I hear the issue of  the16 concern that there should not be any  rent17 increase, or in years past they say we should  not18 - - we  should do away with the low rent   subsidy.19 My organization  represents20 tenants and the owners who have buildings in   the21 poorest  communities. Our owners need  increases.22 In order to maintain a  building,23 you must have money coming in to pay for  the24 services that need to be provided. An  owner25 should not have to work a second job to carry  a4 
2 building. A building	is supposed to carry itself ,3 not the other way around.4 Now we are sensitive to  the5 tenants who are in the properties that we  own6 because one of the reasons we went into  this7 business is because we had a concern and  we8 want ed to provide housing.9 But we also recognize that  we10 must provide quality housing. And in order  to11 provide quality housing, one must receive  the12 rent in order to maintain your  building.13 Therefore, it is important  that14 for small owners, as Mr. Peyton spoke to  earlier,15 it is important that we see that there  are16 adjustments made in order to ensure that  the17 services are provided.18 We sympathize in this day  and19 age for people losing their jobs because you  know20 what , many of our owners are facing the same21 thing. If you look in the minority  communities22 where our members live who own our  buildings,23 many of them are married. One spouse has to  work24 a second job in order to support the family  while25 the other spouse is trying to work a job  to2 
2 maintain the building.3 Now we talk about fairness.  That4 is not fair.5	Housing in this City,  across6 this nation, is a business. Even though it 's a7 roof over our head , we still must treat it as a8 business.9 To that end I say an increase  is10 needed in order that we can provide the kind  of11 housing for tenants in the City of New York  that12 they deserve.13 Thank you.14 (Audience participation. )15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 MS. VISSER:	Joseph Capestany,17 followed by Sam Herzog, Gloria  Freedman.18 MR. JOSEPH CAPESTANY:	Good19 afternoon.20 My name is Joseph  Capestany.21 Every year the landlords come  up22 with a scheme that tells residents of New  York23 that they are spending too much money to  maintain24 their buildings so they need to increase  the25 percentage	for rents on a monthly and  yearly6 
2	basis.3	I know for a fact , as well as4 many of us do, this is a fallacy. After  checking5 some of their own total yearly expenditures,  a6 minority of owners experienced an increase   in7 spending. True. That is not the majority.  The8 majority are making some type of profit or  are9 stable enough to run their buildings  with10 affordable rents.11 What about those people who  are12 low- income workers right now? They struggle every13 day to meet their monthly expenses, to pay   their14 rent .15 If the Rent Guidelines Board  is16 allowed to increase the percentages to an17 additional two for one - year and four percent on18 the two-year leases, many of these people  will19 face probable eviction because they cannot  afford20 these rents.21 What happens to our  senior22 citizens who live on an already tight budget   or23 those who are on SSI who do not qualify  for24 SCRIE? These residents cannot afford  any25 increases either.4 
2 As an example, I myself  moved3 into my present  apartment four years ago paying4 $630 a month. Now I'm paying $703. And I  only5 receive $732. I've not been able to do  anything6 other than to pay rent , buy food, and thanks to7 food stamps for that .8 Landlords have a million  stories9 as to their need for  increases.10 Here' s one for me. During the11 time that I've been living in my apartment ,  every12 other month  something breaks,  leaks, ceilings13 fall. I spend quite a large amount of  complaints14 at HPD, the Department of Buildings, as well   as15 court appearances. Yes, this is just my case.   But16 if a study were to be done, it would be  clear17 that with many  landlords their irresponsibilities18 making repairs add to them spending money  by19 having to pay a high rate of legal fees,  which20 they attempt to push off on a  tenant.21 Everyt hing is landlord' s need.22 But what about the tenant 's needs and their right23 to affordable housing?24 If these increases are left25 unchecked , only the people who rent  apartments2 
1	2782 will be those who can afford $2000 and above.  It3 seems that what 's happening now is low- income,4 disabled people at the lower end of the  spectrum5 are slowly being herded into selected areas  which6 I feel is a form of segregation.7 So I stop here because I  could8 be here for days .9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10	Perfect timing.11	Any questions?12 (No response. )13 (Audience part icipation.)14 MS. VISSER:	Sam Herzog,15 followed by Gloria Freedman, followed by  Speaker16 Miller.17 Is Sam Herzog here?18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Herzog19 first . Ms.  Freedman,  one second.12 
20 MR. SAM HERZOG:	Hl'  .I21 Sam Herzog. Good evening,  everybody.
My name is
22 I'm here on behalf of the23 landlords. My father originally arrived in  Lower24 Village, Soho and the surrounding area in  194525 and he started renovating tenement houses,  fixing12 
1	2792 them up ,  installing  bathrooms,  toilets inside3 each and every apartment , putting in radiators,4 investing from his own t ime and money.5	In the '70s when the Arab6 nations imposed an oil embargo, which caused  a7 lot of landlords to abandon their buildings  lock8 stock and barrel, nobody compensated them  for9 that. The government wanted to tax  us.10 My father and a few of  his11 landlord friends started abandoning  apartments,12 actually giving them to the tenants to own  and13 actually by doing that converting them to co- ops14 and condominiums.15 Today my family owns a  few16 properties  in Lower Manhattan, residential17 apartments and commercial  apartments.18 I just wanted to comment that  we19 do have at the moment approximately twenty- five20 rent - stabilized tenants. These tenants are paying21 between $130 to $89 a month on the  commercial22 apartment that would go for $2900 to $1700.  That23 means that the cost of the heating and  the24 utilities to that apartment costs us more  money25 than what they are paying, inevitably making  us6 
2 take the money out of our own pocket , which puts3 the burden on the free market apartments.  Their4 prices have to go up to even out the cost  rate.5	I 've a few comments, one for the6 architect that would have been leaving  Manhattan7 if you wouldn' t be in a rent stabilized apartment8 -  rent controlled  actually. What 's your name?9	MR. TED SHERIDAN:	Ted Sheridan.10 MR. SAM HERZOG:	And this is for11 Ted Sheridan.12 Well , I don't know if he does13 any pro bono work or free work. This is  basically14 for free what he' s gett ing. He' s living off of15 a - - what  I call free eater.16 And the photographer, rent  in17 that area is a lot higher. And I know for a  fact.18 And I don' t really get into that price quoting19 that you're giving. It 's a little too high, the20 rent that you are saying for a little too,  the21 small bit of a space that you're getting for  your22 apartment .23 But all of you are getting  a24 very good deal and you shouldn' t be complaining.25 And just for a five percent10 
2 raise, you should say thank you to your landlord3 that kept your building and your  neighborhood4 decent.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 (Audience participation.)7 MS. GLORIA FREEDMAN:	Dear8 tenants who have arrived here with hope in  their9 hearts and faith in the intelligence of  the10 Guidelines Board.11 You are faced with a very12 interesting  situation in New York where the whole13 City of New York is being destabilized  because14 people have to pay too much rent. They can't  buy15 food , enough food. They can't pay their medical16 expenses, co-payment  at hospital groups,17 prescript ion and non- prescription drugs.18 As you know, the elderly do  have19 more expenses. Your family knows that  too.20 I urge you to think  carefully21 and read the fact that landlords' expenses  have22 gone down. Not only that , you have to recognize23 the fact that , even though the landlords got	•24 plenty of money to heat the buildings, many  of25 our tenants have gotten pneumonia this year as  a8 
2 result of lack of heat. They are not using  their3 money for heat.4 (Audience participation.)5	MS . GLORIA FREEDMAN:	They are  6 using their money  for something else, but  not for7 heat .8 And even though the cost of  oil9 went down, we are not getting enough hot  water,10 we are not getting enough heat .11 I represent 24,000 retired12 people who worked for the City of New York.  Many13 of them are on low pensions, low Social  Security14 because wages were very low at one time and   they15 are suffering more from these rent  increases16 because they didn' t have SCRIE for a while.  Those17 who were eligible signed up and by the time   they18 signed up, the rents were $500 and $600,  which19 was more,  about  fifty percent  of  their monthly 2 O	income.21 So you see that you have to  have22 compassion in your hearts . You have to think23 about the figures. You've listened to  the24 landlords. You've listened to the  tenants.25 But you do have to make a  really21 
2 good judgment on what we deserve. We have  built3 this City. We have fought for this City. We  have4 the retirees who gave service to the City,  and5 yet we are suffering mortally.6 (Audience participation. )7 MS. GLORIA FREEDMAN:	I thank8 you very much for your attent ion.9 (Audience participation.)10 MS. GLORIA FREEDMAN:	I hope11 you will consider what I 'm saying seriously.  The12 whole City is affected economically  because13 peopl e are not buying furniture, clothing, enough14 food because they got to pay these God damn  high15 rents.16 (Audience part icipation. )17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 MS.

2 SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER:	I know3 it 's been a long day and I'm going to turn in a4 copy of my actual formal testimony. My aide  has5	it .6 But I'll be very brief because  I7 know it ' s been a long day. There are a lot  of8 people left to speak. And I appreciate  the9 courtesy of being able to speak briefly. And  let10 me re- extend that by not going on and on and just11 say simply that I think this is a  great12 opportunity for the Rent Guidelines  Board.13 I've been here before. I've14 test ified before. I've been here in years in15 which the costs of operating have gone up  and16 peopl e have come and said we need this and we17 need that .18 But every year there are19 increases on the rents.20 And here you have an  opportunity21 in which costs have gone down. By the Board' s own22 analysis the costs are  down.23 And so at least there is  an24 opportunity in this case to at least not  increase25 the rents, to give peopl e a faith that this6 
2 process really has something to do with  the3 analysis that the Board does.4 So in this case since the Board5 is showing the expenses are down, at least  by6 enacting a zero percent rent increase the  Board7 would be acknowledging that the analysis that   is8 done by staff and the analysis, the  deliberation9 over particular costs to the landlords that  is10 done each year really does factor  in.11 So I hope that you will  take12 this opportunity to enact an increase of  zero13 percent , so no increase whatsoever.14 And that 's the essence of my15 test imony.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any17 questions?18 Mr. Rivera.19 MR. RIVERA:	I want to thank20 you for coming.21 SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER:	Sure. I22 figure if I come as a  Council Member,	I ought to23 come as the Speaker.24 MR. RIVERA:	I'd like your25 comments on the plight of the middle class  and2 
1	2862 what is happening with the middl e class here in3 New York.4	SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER:	Well ,5 you know, as a lot of peopl e are aware, the6 middle class is shrinking in New York City.  We7 have  - -  it' s just a fact that when you look at8 the census numbers and you look at the  overall9 developments of the last ten/f ifteen years, that10 we have a growing upper income level , we have11	growing lower income levels, and the divide12 between  is greater.13 And I certainly think that  this14 system is one of the systems that has at  least15 helped ameliorate that trend. And  strengthening16 it and sending a strong signal of the strength  of17 this system and of the importance of  the18 deliberat ions of this Board can help in that19	process.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.21 Castellano.22 MR. CASTELLANO:	Mr. Speaker,23 thank you for coming.24 And I appreciate your  remarks25 regarding the overall rent  increase.20 
2 What about the inequities in  the3 system? I mean there are peopl e paying $400 a4 month  for a three- bedroom  apartment .5 (Audience participation.)6	MR. CASTELLANO:	We have people7	on this Board8	SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER:	If you9 don' t like the question, I 'm sure you' ll like the10 answer. So11	MR. CASTELLANO:	We have people12 on this Board13 (Audience participation.)14 SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER:	Let him15 ask the question because I got to get back  to16 City Hall. So he can ask the question and I  can17 give the answer and we can bring on the  great18 Borough President of the Borough of President ,19 one of the five finest boroughs in the City  of20 New York.21 (Audience part icipation.)22 SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER:	And the23 largest .24 (Audience participation.)25 MR. CASTELLANO:	Back to my12 
1	2882	question.3 SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER:	Yes.4 MR. CASTELLANO:	What about the5 inequit ies in the system; people are paying some6 ridiculously  low rents?7	SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER:	I would8 just say to you that the inequities in the   system9 aren' t addressed by the overall increase . If the10 purpose here is to deal with inequit ies in the11 system, then the purpose should be examining  the12 inequities in the system.13 If there are inequities,  that14 implies that there are  discrepancies.15 And yet what we  - - you know, my16 testimony was to the overall rent  increase.17 MR. CASTELLANO:	So then could I18 take that as an endorsement  - -19 SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER:	No.20 MR.  CASTELLANO:	- - of this21 Board' s low rent supplement which we have  adopted22numeroustimes23SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER:	No, you24can't.25MR.  CASTELLANO:	- - over the
2 last decade .3 (Audience participation.)4	MR . CASTELLANO:	So then you are5	not  in favor of correcting  inequities  - -6	SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER:	Well , I7	would  say - -  I would take it that you and I  would8 sit down at some point and discuss  the9 inequities . If you were to show me something that10 was an inequity and there was room  towards11	addressing that inequity, then I would consider12 it.13 But if you are asking me  with14 regard to my testimony, why do I say that  there15 should be a zero percent rent increase given  the16 fact that the costs are down by more  than - -   down17 more  than they are up, then - -18 (Audience participat ion.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma' am.20 SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER :	then21 I would say to you that the answer to  that22 question is that this is not how you deal  with2 3	it.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are there any25 other  - -  let me ask sort of a philosophical24 
1	2902 question, the premise of which are some  facts.3 Leaving aside this part icular4 year and the issue as to whether or not  there5 should be a rent increase, and taking some  of6 your comments about the possibility or  perhaps7 the likelihood of a real property increase , I8 mean can we concede that under a certain set  of9 circumstances in certain years a rent increase  is10 justified?11	SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER:	I've12 testif ied in the past in favor of rent increases,13 maybe not what everybody has  - - what  some  people14 sought , more  than other people have  sought for .15 But I think obviously, you know, the purpose  of16 rent stabilization is to stabilize rents. It 's17 not to zero out increases.18 But I think that the  opportunity19 that is given to the Board here in this case  is20 to show that that process really does take  into21 account the merits, et cetera, on a yearly  basis22 and that we really look at the evidence and  we23 try to come up with the most rational  result.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Yes. That 's25 philosophical .12 
2 The follow- up question. We have,3 you know, sort of the interesting public  policy4 dilemma of hearing testimony from two,  certainly5	if you listen to this day' s testimony,6	disadvantaged groups: the owners and the  tenants.7 SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER:	Sure.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Really nobody9 has talked about being advantaged walking  into10 this room. To the extent anybody is  advantaged,11	they stay away from this room.12 And if you take a look at  that13 universe, we sort of have, you know,  very14 sympathetic testimony about low- income people,15 particularly  the elderly who are unable to afford16 rent increases, and we believe it , and we are17 faced with the fact that there is, you know,  a18 Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exempt ion which19 seems to protect those; so if you concede that - 2021 SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER:	It22 protects some of those. Of course, it  requires23 the City to pick up the  tab.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right.25 And that ' s the crux of the21 
12922quest ion.3SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER:	Sure.4CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How do we5 deal with or what is your view about the  issue6 of , which we've heard testimony on from several7 people, about in the case where a rent  increase8 is justified based on objective standards, how  do9 we deal with the fact that owners in some  cases10 are asked , by other people' s testimony, to make11 up the difference, if you will , as opposed to12 larger fixes, which is an example in the Senior13 Citizen Rent  Increase Exemption?14 How would you deal with it  if15 you were up here? Would you grant a rent  increase16 or would you sort of not grant a rent  increase17 and deal more with the fact that there  are18 tenants who have an inability to  pay?19 SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER:	Well ,20 in this case this year I would not grant a  rent21 increase. You know, I think you have to look  at22 it each year. You have to try and examine  what23 the costs are, what the preceding year has  been24 and try to make the best assessment that you  can.25 You know, obviously this is  a5 
2 system in which different people are going to  be3 treated in some senses equally and in some  senses4 differently given their own  condition.5	You know, it 's not as if this is6 a brand new system. And a lot of people who  made7 investments in their properties had  an8 understanding what the rules of the  situation9 were . There are certain of those who have held10 their properties prior to that situation,  but11 there are a lot that haven' t.12 So obviously different people13 come to this microphone and come to this  process14 with different  situations. And all that you can15 do in my opinion is do your best to assess  what16 the overall situation was from the preceding  year17 and make a recommendation for the future  year.18 And in this case I would19 recommend that you recommend a zero  percent20 increase.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good answer.22 Not responsive, but a good  answer.23 Mr. Lubell.24 MR. LUBELL:	Sir, if we can25 demonstrate to you that the costs of owners  have6 
1	2942 increased , the fundamental  cost , the core  index3 of prices has increased justifying a  reasonable4 increase, would you then change your  mind?5	SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER:	Well ,6	it certainly would be at odds with my  current7	MR. LUBELL:	But if we could8 demonstrate to you that the reality is  that9 prices have fundamentally gone up, would  you10 change your mind?11	SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER:	Well , I12 would first suggest that you demonstrate it  to13 your own analysis, and once you have your own14 analysis  done , then I'll review  that.15 MR. LUBELL:	Fine.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any other17 quest ions?18 (No response.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 SPEAKER GIFFORD MILLER :	Thank21 you.22 (Audience part icipation.)23 BORO PRESIDENT MARKOWITZ:24 First off , I speak not only as Borough President25 of Brooklyn, the greatest place in the world  to12 
2 live, but also as a rent stabilized tenant  from3 1968 to 2002. And I speak with you now as  a4 vacancy decontrolled tenant in a building of  a5 rent over $2000 a month on an income of a  Borough6 President .7 So I can tell you that I've  had8 experience in a number of different  income9 categories. And , therefore, my remarks today I10 think really pay particular  attention.11 In my opinion it 's quite simple.12 Owners' costs are down and they are indeed , Mr.13 Lubell .14 (Audience participation. )15 BORO PRESIDENT MARKOWITZ:	And16 owner' s net operating income is up.17 So your proposed increase of  two18 percent for a one-year lease or four percent  for19 a two- year lease goes, quite frankly, in the20 wrong direction. Rents should go  down.21 (Audience participation.)22 BORO PRESIDENT MARKOWITZ:	It 's23 the opinion of many of us that if rents don't  go24 down this year, than, Mr. Chairman,  when.25 Unfortunately, even in years2 
2 when owner operat ing costs were unchanged, as has3 happened three times this last decade, the  Rent4 Guidelines Board approved increases anyway,  as5 you know.6 But maybe this year you will7 finally take note of the dramatic rise in  owners'8 net income as reported to the City  Finance9 Department.10 According to the Department  in11 2000 only fifty- six cents of every dollar of12 owners' income was spent on operations  and13 maintenance. And I'm getting these figures   from14 them and that 's what  I 'm sharing.15 This left forty- four cents of16 each dollar for debt service and profit , up from17 thirty- five cents in 1989.18 And maybe this year you  will19 finally consider the declining ability of  tenants20 to pay the rents previously approved.  According21 to the 1999 New York City Housing and  Vacancy22 Survey inflation adjusted incomes of  rent23 stabilized tenants fell by one half  percentage24 point from '95 to '98.25 In 1970, the average rent2 
2 stabilized household paid twenty- two percent of3 income for rent. In 1999, it paid thirty  percent.4 According to your staff 's analysis, a small rent5 reduction of no more than 1 .75 percent for a one-6 year lease and 3 .5 percent for a two-year lease7 would result in no decline in owner' s net8 operating income.9 (Audience participat ion.)10 BORO PRESIDENT MARKOWITZ:	Now,11 these are not my figures. These are figures  that12 we got .13 I also urge the Board again  to14 say no to the poor tax, the supplementary  rent15 increase of $15 for apartments renting for  $50016 or less. Last year you ended this supplement  but17 now you are being asked to bring it back .18 There never was and still isn't ,19 in my opinion, a remote economic justificat ion20 for owners to receive this extra payment  from21 people that are least able to afford  it.22 (Audience participation .)2 3	BORO PRESIDENT MARKOWITZ:	You24 should also reject out of hand the  proposed25 longevity tax, an additional six percent  rent24 
2 supplement to be paid by tenants who have been  in3 occupancy for at least ten years, that would  be4 paid on top of whatever rent adjustments  you5 approve.6	There is absolutely no7 statistical or economic just ification for such a8 bonus.9	I'm amazed actually, owners  are10 among the most creative and persistent	in coming11 up with clever new ways to raise rents more  than12 the adjustment formulas would allow .13 Indeed ,  if anything, you should14 approve a decrease. Year after year the  Rent15 Guidelines Board has approved rent  increases16 greater than that justif ied by the facts . These17 increases become part of the base and  are18 compounded with each lease renewal.19 I know from recent personal20 experience just how hard it is to find  an21 affordable place to live in New York City. And  I22 make a fairly decent income , not by some of23perhapsyourstandards, it ' s certainly - -24(Laughter.)25BORO PRESIDENT MARKOWITZ:
2	what I consider to be  decent.3	And in 1998, the medium income4	household annual for occupants of rent  stabilized5 housing was about $27,000. I can only begin  to6 imagine how diff icult it is for them. And I have7 to tell you on the side the issue of  affordable8 housing comes across every community in  every9 part of New York City.10 Many tenants already pay  more11 than forty percent , and I know of many that pay12 fifty percent of their income or more on  rents.13 With the national economy14 remaining sluggish and the City' s economy still15 deeply affected by the disaster of 9/11,  this16 year tenants especially need and deserve   relief.17 So I urge you to roll back  rents18 by the 1.75 for one-year  leases,19 (Audience part icipation.)20 BORO  PRESIDENT MARKOWITZ:21 and 3 .5 for two-year leases,22 (Audience participation.)23 BORO  PRESIDENT MARKOWITZ:24 and to say no once and for all to  supplemental25 rent increases like those being  proposed.10 
2 Even with rent regulation  still3 on the books New York City is experiencing  a4 steady decline in the supply of  housing5 affordable to the middle class. It 's a slow6 erosion in affordable housing.  In my opinion this7 is not anything you can do, but Albany must  get8 rid of this luxury decontrol  bill.9 (Audience part icipation .)10 BORO PRESIDENT MARKOWITZ:	I11 know that some of you are for a free market.  And,12 by the way, let me just say - - and I'll end it  on13 this, Marvin,  - - I have to tell you - -14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr . Chairman15 to you, Marty.16 (Laughter.)17 BORO PRESIDENT MARKOWITZ:	Mr .18 Chairman.19 My grandma of blessed  memory20 told me that back in the late '40s  and early	'50s21 the competit ion to get tenants to move into their22buildings wasso aggressive that they were  very23often offereda free month' s - -24CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Yes.25BORO PRESIDENT MARKOWITZ:	- -   a
2 free mont h' s rent or a chandelier and wall - to-3 wall carpeting to entice them to move  in.4	Now, I'm not suggesting that5 that 's going to happen tomorrow. Obviously if we6 had more units available, and obviously if   there7 was greater competit ion in the marketplace,  we8 could then seriously review how rent   adjustments,9 rent laws, can be made where a fairer system   can10 prevail.11 And some day I hope and  pray12 that we are all successful in government  in13 creat ing the housing.14 For now, Mr. Chairman, for now  I15 think the right thing to do is to make  those16 adjustments downward and you are indicating17 (Audience participation.)18 BORO  PRESIDENT MARKOWITZ:19 dispense this law that you are being fair,   fair20 this year.21 Thank you very, very much.22 (Audience part icipation.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Rivera.24 MR. RIVERA:	I would like you to25 comment on this next quest ion because we've been5 
2 told here many times that Manhattan is  very3 different from the other4 VOICES:	Boroughs .5	BORO PRESIDENT MARKOWITZ:	I6 would like to remind you that we' re in the outer7 borough right now . That 's called Manhattan . But8 go ahead.9 MR . RIVERA:	Outer borough.10 And I would like you to comment ,11 even though you have made  a general  comment  - -12 BORO PRESIDENT MARKOWITZ:	Yes.13 MR. RIVERA:	- - about the rents14 in Brooklyn, is there any similarity that you  see15 to those in Manhattan?16 BORO PRESIDENT MARKOWITZ:	There17 is no quest ion that Brooklyn rents are definitely18 the example of Manhattan.  There is no question  in19 every single neighborhood.20 And  it makes  sense , and that is,21 that there is a lack of affordable housing  in22 Brooklyn. There' s just not enough units to house23 our families .24 And when you have that , what we25 are not talking about today is how many  buildings6 
2 that I can take you to and you can see  the3 numbers of different names on those mail boxes,4 you can be assured that many of our apartments  in5 the Borough of Brooklyn are being occupied  by6 more than one family because of their  inability7 to afford the rents .8 (Audience participation. )9 BORO PRESIDENT MARKOWITZ:	All10 I'm saying is that I am not putting  that11 responsibility on you. That 's not your role here .12 That 's for people like me and people a lot more13 important than me to come up with the  creative14 financing which I hope Albany and  Washington15 that 's their responsibility with us and the16 private sector.17 But for now for those  facing18 rent increases on lease renewal , to me the right19 thing to do now is at least send a message  out20 there that we are going to be fair and  put21 tenants on a level playing field. That 's all22we' re asking.23(Audience part icipation.)24CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any other25questions?
2 (No response.).3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	The next5 speaker is Councilmember Domenic Recchia,6 followed by Marc Landis and then  Councilmember7 Michael Nelson.8 COUNCILMAN DOMENIC RECCHIA,  JR.9 Good afternoon.10 My name is Domenic Recchia and  I11 am the Councilman from Brighton Beach,  Coney12 Island , Bensonhurst.13 Make no mistake. A  housing14 emergency exists throughout the five boroughs  and15 the preservation of rent regulations and the  end16 of high rent vacancy decontrol is essential   to17 the City.18 I believe that the two  percent19 and four percent increases for one and  two-year20 lease renewals are unfair and not appropriat e  at21 this time. I'm against any rent  increase.22 According to the 2002  Price23 Index of Operating Costs, landlords of  these24 stabilized apartments  are actually spending  less25 this year than they did last year, 1.6  percent5 
2 less. This is the first time that this  has3 happened since 1969 when the study first  began.4 How can the Rent Guidelines5 Board justify raising the rent two percent  or6 four percent if the operating costs have  fallen?7	Meanwhile, over the last  decade8 rents have consistently gone up faster than  the9 costs.10 The New York City Department  of11 Finance statistics show that the net  operating12 income for rent stabilized buildings is at an  all13 t ime high, meaning that on average landlords in14 2000 spent fifty- six cents of every dollar earned15 on operation and maintenance  expenses and were16 able to keep forty- four cents of every dollar  for17 debt service payments and prof it. This is further18 reason that now is not the time to raise  these19 rents.20 Meanwhile ,  recent statistics21 show that the average person in a rent  stabilized22 apartment is now paying a higher percentage  of23 their salary for rent than ever  before.24 If we continue to raise rent  in25 this City, people are not going to want to  live8 
2 in New York City. People are not going to want  to3 come to this wonderful city to work. They  will4 want to live in other places. And keep on  raising5 rents and peopl e are going to live in other6 places.7 Thank you.8 (Audience participat ion.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Marc Landis.11	MR. MARC LANDIS:	Good12 afternoon.13 My name is Marc Landis and  I'm14 an elected Democratic District  Leader15 representing part C of the 67th Assembly  District16 on the high- rent upper west side of Manhattan.17 I stand before you today  in18 opposition to the decision reached by the  Rent19 Guidelines Board on May 20th in  your20 recommendations, decisions which just don' t21 reflect actual economic conditions faced  by22 landlords and tenants today.23 Clearly,  economic conditions24 here have taken a turn for the worse since  the25 attack on our beloved city on 9/11. Wall  Street12 
1	3072 is rocked by scandals and continues to  reduce3 salaries and positions . Unemployment has4 increased substant ially and continues to increase5 with no end in sight.6 We 're once again reading the7 stories about increasing numbers of  homeless8 families and we still don' t have a public policy9 investment in long- term permanent housing10 solutions .11	Meanwhile, owners of rental12 properties  are selling buildings after conducting13 bidding wars where it seems that the sky's  the14 limit in terms of some of the sales  prices15 available.16 Revenues continue to  increase17 each year as landlords take advantage of  vacancy18 increases and so- called luxury decontrol to build19 up rent rolls.20 In these troubled times, it  is21 clearly unnecessary to provide  for rent22 stabilized rent increases of two percent  for one-23 year and four percent  for two-years. No  increase24 would be more appropriate at this  time.25 Approving your proposed  rent12 
2 increases will disadvantage many of our  most3 vulnerable  neighbors:  seniors,  the  disabled ,4 young families, New York City employees who   have5 sacrificed to serve our City, and others who  are6 trapped by fixed incomes without hope  of7 increasing their incomes.8 New York City still continues  to9 face the nat ion' s worst crisis in affordable10 housing. These condit ions not only affect  tenants11 seeking an affordable place to live, but also   the12 businesses whose employees struggle to live  here,13 and the City which needs us more than ever   to14 retain its tax base.15 We need to find a way to  avoid16 driving the middl e class and regular working17 people out of New York City. Our economic   health18 and the very diversity that is at the heart  of19 our New York City communities depends on   it.20 I implore you to reconsider  the21 May 20th proposals and request that you  reject22 these unjust ified rent increases that will cause23 such harm and such damage to so many of  our24 neighbors.25 Thank you for your attention2 
2 today.3 (Audience participation.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Our next6 speaker is Councilmember Nelson, followed  by7 Lawrence Colodney and Rosalind  Gortz.8	COUNCILMAN MICHAEL NELSON:	I9 left my glasses in the car. So we' ll start with10 that.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Just say if12 you' re for or against.13 COUNCILMAN MICHAEL NELSON:14 Okay. I 'm against  it.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank16 you.17 (Laughter.)18 COUNCILMAN MICHAEL NELSON:	I'll19 be brief .20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.21 COUNCILMAN MICHAEL NELSON:	Mr.22 Chairman, thank you.23 My name is Mike Nelson.  I24 represent the 48th Councilmanic District  in25 Brooklyn. My constituency is composed  of9 
2 approximately  forty- eight percent rental housing3 in private homes and apartment  houses.4 While the owner' s costs have5 decreased this past year, a conservat ive estimate6 puts their prof its at a level of thirty- five7 percent over the past three  years.8 Do they really need another9 increase?10 The onerous twenty percent11 vacancy allowance plus other bonuses  permitted12 under the renewal of the rent law in ' 97 has13 escalated regulated rentals in my district  to14 approximately $750 to $850 per month for a  one-15 bedroom apartment and approximately  $900 to  $125016 per month for a two- bedroom apartment .17 This vacancy allowance has  de18 facto eliminated and deregulated  formerly19 affordable housing. Bringing these rents to  a20 market  level has further influenced unregulated21 rentals in private homes and rented  co-op22 apartments to the same market  level.23 There is now no affordable  place24 to move to. A tenant living in a slum building   or25 one living in a well -kept property are now paying2 
2 identical legal market rents without any  owner3 accountability as to the level of  services4 provided.5 The playing field has been6 leveled for the owners. As the owners are  the7 benef iciaries of this windf all and have been8 amply rewarded , any further increase would be an9 insult and pose only further economic  hardship10 upon tenants.11 I ,  therefore, respectfully12 demand that this Board, with courage,  establish13 and restore some semblance of equity in  the14 landlord - tenant relationship  and vote  for a zero15 increase effect ive October 1, 2002.16 Now, I would like to add  to17 that .18 I know of a number of  landlords19 who are very decent , good peopl e and they respond20 quickly when they are called by my off ice. We21 just have a problem with some  others.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right .23 Any questions?24 Yes. Ms. Holder.25 MS. HOLDER:	Just a quick2 
2question. Thankyou.3Which neighborhoods  are actually4in CouncilmanicDistrict 48?56COUNCILMAN MICHAEL NELSON:	Ihave primarily Midwood and Sheepshead Bay as   far7as apartmentsgo.8CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9COUNCILMAN MICHAEL NELSON:	It 's10certainly nota slum.11Thank you.12(Audience participation. )13CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It 's now14 about five o'clock. We are going to run  for15 another hour. We have about forty speakers   left.16 So let 's just try to be concise, whether you're17 for or against. Be as brief as you  can.18 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Our next19 speaker is Lawrence Colodney,  followed by20 Rosalind Gortz and Mary  McCune.21 MR. LAWRENCE COLODNEY :	Thank22 you for this time to talk.23 I want to thank Mr. Nelson  for24 speaking in our behalf and Marty  Markowitz.25 I don' t want to repeat a lot of14 
1	3132 the same things that everyone said. Of  course,3 tenants want a rollback. The costs are too  high.4	But there is no such thing as  a5 three- bedroom for $400 .6 (Audience participation.)7	MR. LAWRENCE COLODNEY:	And this8 poor tax supplemental that you tagged on to  my9 apartment every two years for the last  three10 years has basically made my rate a twelve  percent11 increase when you add it up.12 My salary did not increase  by13 twelve percent ; the landlord' s costs did not14 increase by twelve percent.15 My landlord inherited all of  his16 buildings from the fathers that had built it  way17 back when when they had tax breaks. They  were18 mult i -millionaires living in far away communities19 enjoying life.20 I finally got my landlord to21 say, hey, we've got such a high rent roll ,   it 's22 time to put in shrubbery around the  building23 where it was when the building was built , a24 videocamera to the cable system which you   should25 require now for the security, new  mailboxes,8 
13142fencing.There should be a graffit i program where3they arerequired to clean graff iti every week.4My guess is that in a city  that5 has employees that still make from $10,000  to6 $30 , 000, who have to live here to service all the7 rich peopl e, we certainly don' t want thirty8 people living in the suburbs in houses to  commute9 in to do that. We want them to be able to  live10 here .11 And how tenants at $30,00012 annual salary can pay the rents that Mr.  Nelson13 just mentioned  in my neighborhood	is crazy. In my14 building the landlord has one bedrooms that  rent15 for $800 and change for an apartment one  hour16 from the central business district of the  city17 that they live in.18 To me a studio with brand  new19 walls, brand new appliances, a microwave  should20 be $500 for a studio, $600 for a one- bedroom and21 $700 for a two-bedroom in any of the  boroughs,22 not including Manhattan.23 I once met someone from this24 recent , for the 9/11 disaster, the City was25 moving him to a three - bedroom under a program5 
1	3152 into Manhattan for $700. He was in the  country3 for a year. You get these housing programs  where4 they build ten percent low rent and you have  to5 be in a lottery in order to move up to it. And  no6 one who has been here, long - life residents, are7 ever going to be able to do that and they  can't8 move up to a $300,000 house in the suburbs.  It9 just doesn' t work.10 And they are making plenty  of11 money. Like they said , they have to spend.12 So let 's roll back the rent and13 require some of these landlords to spend money   on14 their property.15 Thank you.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 (Audience participation.)18 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Rosalind19 Gortz, followed by Mary McCune and  Stephen20 Butl er.21 MS. ROSALIND GORTZ:	I thank you22 for the opportunity to speak today on behalf  of23 middle  class tenants.24 My name is Rosalind Gortz. I  was25 born in New York City, educated here and  employed2 
1	3162 by the New York City School System for  thirty-3 four years. I've educated thousands of  students4 during my long career.5	There are many other hard -6 working middl e- class New Yorkers who, like me,7 find themselves contributing a great part  of8 their salaries to their rents.9 Today, two- and - a-half million10 tenants await with trepidation the decisions  of11 this Rent Guidelines Board , fearing the problems12 of juggling their incomes to pay for the  rent13 increases.14 Whil e you meet yearly to decide15 on rent increases, many of us in the  working16 middle- class population have not received  any17 salary increases since last year, or in  some18 cases in several years. In fact , as you are well19 aware, the September 11th attacks have  added20 considerably to the economic pressures of  the21 middle class.22 This year, 2002 , landlords'23 profits have increased because, number one, fuel24 consumpt ion was at an all - time low, and number25 two, luxury decontrol and MCis have  greatly6 
2 compensated landlords.  Improvements are made,3 contractors' costs are paid, and the rent  remains4 at the same increased level for the tenant  well5 after the improvements have been paid for,  in6 fact , forever.7 So this year the proposed two8 and four percent  increases are hardly9 appropriate . There should be a rollback of rents,10 or at least no increases of any kind for one  and11 two- year leases.12 When the fuel costs were  high,13 tenants received increases. So it is only   fair14 that we get a rollback as fuel costs have  gone15 down .16 A great city survives because  of17 its citizens. The rights of the middle class  must18 be protected	- teachers, nurses, ambulance19 drivers, healt h care workers, police off icers,20 fire fighters, actors, waiters, et cetera,  who21 live in rent regulated apartments . All these22 middle class tenants contribute to making   this23 the great city it is.24 I would like this Board  to25 envision what the City would be like if  protected2 
1	3182 tenants were priced out of their apartments.  If3 rents skyrocketed, who would provide the  services4 for the affluent tenants? Who would  provide5 security and protect ion, healt h services and6 recreation,  including Broadway shows and fancy7 restaurants?8 I trust you will make the9 appropriate response to maintain New York City   as10 an affordable city for the two- and- a - half million11 people whose lives your decision will  greatly12 affect.13 Thank you.14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	The next17 speaker is Mary McCune,  followed by Stephen18 Butler, Sylvia Fields.19 MS. MARY McCUNE:	Hi! My name is20 Mary McCune and I'm an attorney at Bronx  AIDS21 Services Legal Advocacy  Program.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Louder.23 MS. MARY McCUNE:	Can you hear24 me now?25 Okay.2 
2 My name is Mary McCune . I'm a3 staff attorney at the Bronx AIDS Services  Legal4 Advocacy Program. I represent tenants who are  HIV5 positive or are living with AIDS in the  Borough6 of the Bronx in a number of civil  proceedings,7 primarily housing as well as other  issues.8	I can't slow down. I'm from  New9	York.10 Many of my clients are too  ill11 to attend this meet ing and I am here to speak on12 their behalf . Over the past nine years I have13 seen the rents go up and the apartments run  down.14 Virtually every client that comes into my  office15 has repair probl ems.16 A few days ago Jose came to  us17 for help. His rent is $606. His only income  is18 SSI and public assistance, and as a result  pays19 more than half of his income towards  rent.20 There are currently 33721 violations on this building, 104 of them  C22 violations,  the most serious kind.23 Jose has hot water only for  a24 few hours a day despite the fact that HPD  started25 a court case against the landlord in April  for10 
1	3202 his failure to provide adequate heat and  hot3 water to the building. Jose complained for  months4 to his landlord about water leaks in his  bathroom5 ceiling, but the landlord did nothing. As  a6 result , the ceiling collapsed on Jose. His hand7 was injured and several of his fingers  are8 permanently damaged . The landlord still hasn' t9 fixed the ceiling.10 Bridget 's rent is $659. She's11 lucky enough to have a Section 8 subsidy  which12 pays most of her rent . There are only eighty13 violations	in her building, which has  twelve14 units.15 Her apartment needs painting  and16 most of the floor tiles in the living room   and17 bedroom are broken or missing. Bridget 's stove18 doesn' t work. Something is wrong with the pilot19 light , and when Con Ed  came to the  apartment ,20 they tagged it as an emergency  condition.21 There is no smoke detector,  and22 worst of all , the fire escape is broken.23 Bridget has trouble sleeping  at24 night because she is worried that the stove  will25 start a fire and she will be trapped in  her2 
1	3212 apartment. We have been in court with  the3 landlord for the last six months in an effort   to4 get him to do the  repairs.5	Karen' s rent in $550 a month.6 She pays fifty percent of her income toward   the7 rent. Like Bridget , she also had problems with8 her stove. The landlord failed to do  anything9 about it and it blew up in her face burning   her10 so severely that she had to be  hospitalized.11 The landlord still hasn' t fixed12 the stove so Karen has no cooking  facilities.13 Karen is wheelchair bound and lives on the   fifth14 floor of her apartment building. For over a  week15 last month the elevator did not work. When  you16 pressed the button, the doors would open onto   an17 empty elevator shaft.18 She also has problems with  hot19 wat er which is provided only sporadically.20 Frighteningly  enough, these21 tenants' stories are not the exception but   the22 rule. Many of my clients are paying $1100   to23 $1600 a month in rent , and the conditions  in24 their apartments are no better than the ones   I25 have described here.6 
1	3222 Most of my clients pay more  than3 half of their income toward the rent , because4 there simply are no affordable  apartments5	available.6 I urge the Board to consider  the7 conditions that tenants live in as central to  the8 decision of what increases, if any,  landlords9	deserve.10	I've heard a lot today about  the11	expenses landlords face, but I would like to know12 where the money is going because, frankly,   I13 don' t see it going into the buildings.14 As your own reports show that15 landlords'  expenses  are down, and ,  in fact , that16 they are entitled to no rent increases by   your17 own formula, I urge you to implement a zero   rent18 increase this year.19 Thanks.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 (Audience participation.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.23 Castellano.24 MR. CASTELLANO	You're from the25 Bronx?12 
1	3232	MS. MARY McCUNE:	I work in the3	Bronx. I live in Northern  Manhattan.4	MR. CASTELLANO:	Okay. But your5	client base - -6	MS. MARY McCUNE:	My client base7	is in the Bronx.8 MR. CASTELLANO:	In the Bronx.9 And presumably people don' t come10	to you to tell you how great their apartment   is.11	MS. MARY McCUNE:	Well , as I12 said , we represent people  - -13 MR. CASTELLANO:	Healthy people14 don' t walk  in the door, it 's people who  - - unless15 they have a problem .16 MS. MARY McCUNE:	Well , we17 represent people in a variety of  instances18 including doing wills, power of attorneys,  that19 sort of thing. So I'm talking about tenants  that20 don' t - - I'm talking about clients that come   in21 not just because they have a problem with   their22 landlord.23 These are the clients that  come24 in because they have benef its problems. We have25 clients who come in just because they want  to12 
2 plan for who will take care of their child in  the3 event of their incapacity.4 These are clients who are coming5 in for a number of reasons, because they  have6 custody problems with their  children.7 So it ' s not just across- the-8 board housing issues that bring them into  us.9	MR. CASTELLANO:	I understand.10 But the point is you wouldn' t know how many11 violations are on a building if someone walked   in12 to talk about wills. I mean they are coming  in13 with a housing problem.14 MS. MARY McCUNE:	No . They are15 coming in for a will and in the course  of16 conversat ion with them I find out that they have17 a housing problem as well.18 So the presenting	issue that19 they come in with is not necessarily housing,  but20 in the course of talking with them about , for21 example, their will , we are discussing who would22 be the guardian, what the conditions are of  their23 apartment , where the children could live, how24 many bedrooms there are, that sort of  thing.25 MR. CASTELLANO:	How would you10 
2 or the client know how many violations are on   the3 building?4	MS. MARY McCUNE:	Because it 's5	available online.6	MR. CASTELLANO:	Okay. So you7	are looking.8 MS. MARY McCUNE:	Yes.9 (Laughter and applause. )10 MS. MARY McCUNE:	I would11 recommend that the Board do that as well. You   can12 see the number of vacancies as well as  evictions13 that take place.14 MR. CASTELLANO:	Let 's, for the15 sake of argument , say that everything that  you16 are saying about these tenants is one  hundred17percentcorrect .18MS. MARY McCUNE:	Well , for the19sake ofargument , it 's true.20MR. CASTELLANO:	Okay. Fine.21So - - and let 's say you have a22hundredclients. Let 's say you have a hundred.23MS. MARY McCUNE:	I have more24than - -25MR. CASTELLANO:	And they have
2	equally equal horror  stories.3	MS. MARY McCUNE:	Some of them4	have worse.5	MR. CASTELLANO:	There are one6 million rent stabilized apartments in this  City,7 two- and- a- half to three million rent stabilized8 tenants living in those  apartments.9 So because you can cite one10 hundred horror stories or a thousand  horror11 stories12 (Audience participat ion.)13 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Quiet .14 MS. MARY McCUNE:	Repeat the15 last portion. I couldn't hear.16 MR.  CASTELLANO:	Well , my point17 is if you had , let 's say, a thousand  tenants  with18 horror stories, and let 's say they' re all true I19 mean, and everyone of them has a remedy. In  fact ,20 one lawyer on the Board said to me: gee , that 's a21 good case, I 'd like to take it. Okay?22 MS. MARY McCUNE:	Some of them23 have taken that remedy  actually.24 MR. CASTELLANO:	So they have25 remedies elsewhere.6 
2	But because of these one3 thousand horror stories, one million  apartments4 should not get a rent increase?5 (Audience participation.)6	MS. MARY McCUNE:	Well , you are7 talking - -8 (Audience participation.)9	MS. MARY McCUNE:	- - a small10 universe11 (Audience participation.)12 MS. MARY McCUNE:	These are13 representative. These are not , you know, one or14 two peopl e that wandered into my off ice. I see15 hundreds of peopl e in the course of my work in16 the Bronx. These stories are happening  everyday17 in the buildings.18 If you want to get a more19 representative, you can look at the HPD  website20 and you can go and look block by block at  the21 buildings and find out that these figures  are22 representat ive. These are not isolated incidents.23 And I didn' t hear you asking the24 same question of the landlords who are  not25 representative of the vast majority of  landlords .10 
2 (Audience participat ion3 overlapping speaker.)4 MR. CASTELLANO:	I know their5 circumstances because I read the entire report ,6	not just the headlines in the newspaper.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.8	Castellano,  thank you.9	(Audience participat ion.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Just one more11 quest ion from Ms. Holder because we've got a lot12 of people.13 MS. HOLDER:	Okay . I'm trying to14 be brief .15 Based on your experience in your16 line of work, how easily can tenants get  repairs17 made on their apartments?18 MS. MARY McCUNE: I would  say19 it 's almost impossible without a lawyer, and with20 a lawyer it can take anywhere up to a year  or21 longer.22 Wit hout a lawyer it 's virtually23 impossible . With a lawyer it can take as long as24 a year, even very serious violations . I have  one25 tenant that their ceiling collapsed three  times .10 
2	And speaking of economies  of3 scale, the landlord had to replace the  ceiling4 three times and lost about $4,000 in  rent5 abatement s because they didn' t deal with the6 problem when it was a manageable  patchwork.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 Mr. Rivera had a question.9	MS. MARY McCUNE:	Certainly.10 MR. RIVERA:	In your travels11 and experiences  do you know for a fact if  - -  do12 you have any factual cases where, or a  large13 number of cases as a matter of fact or  small14 numbers, whichever you can identify, of tenants15 who could not pay the rents, the regulated   rents,16 and are getting preferential  rent from the17 landlord?18 MS. MARY McCUNE:	There - - I do19 have a certain number of tenants, a  certain20 percentage,	that are getting preferential	rents,21 yes.22 MR. RIVERA:	Do you have an23 idea of what the numbers are or a  percentage?24 MS. MARY McCUNE:	Well, I can25 say that they are probably not  representative.10 
2 But I would say about five percent , five percent3 of the tenants that I'm representing  had4 preferential rents. And the preference , you  know,5 can vary widely. Some of them are paying  $600,6 some of them are paying  $1500 preferential	rent.7 So it depends quite a bit.8 MR. RIVERA:	Thank you.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10	(Audience participation. )11	MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Stephen12 Butler, then Sylvia Fields, then Andrew  Eristoff.13 MR. STEPHEN BUTLER:	My name is14 Stephen Butler. I'm one of Mary' s clients.15 I'm here to speak about  the16 landlords for the fact that I became homeless  not17 by choice and not paying my rent , by the fact18 that my landlord didn' t want to fix my place.19 So I'm here to say to - - I  know20 all landlords are not bad , but they need to check21 in-house  and make  - -  you know, the good landlords22 need to check out the bad ones and maybe you   can23 ask for what you want. So you need to look   into24 that .25 And that 's all I have to say.12 
1	3312 (Audience participation.)3 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	The next4 speaker is Sylvia Fields, followed by  Andrew5 Eristoff and Miriam  Thompson.6 Sylvia Fields?7	MS. SUZETTE GARDNER:	No. My8	name is Suzette Gardner .9	MR. McLAUGHLIN:	No. Sylvia10 Fields .11 MS. SUZETTE GARDNER:	You didn't12 say Suzette Gardner?13 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	No.14 MS. SUZETTE GARDNER:	Okay.
1516 everybody.
MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	Hello,
17 My name is Sylvia Fields.  I'm18 the President of 2940 Ocean Parkway, a  Trump19 building so I want you to  know.20 Now, I	ould like to ask the21 Panel a question. How many people on the  Panel22 live in a rent controlled or rent  stabilized23 apartments?  The truth.24 (Show of hands.)25 MS . SYLVIA FIELDS:	Two.16 
2	Well , the rest of you shouldn' t3 be on the Panel. The rest of you should go  off4 the Panel.5 (Audience participation. )6	MS . SYLVIA FIELDS:	You have to7 be in it to know what is going on in  these8 apartments. They are terribl e. We pay MCis, a9 raise for MCi s that the landlord - - why should we10 pay for the landlord' s capital gains when they11 fix their apartments? We pay rent. I pay  a12 surcharge.13 I live in an apartment where14 they can make as much money as they want and  I15 pay a surcharge. I mean because we were once  a16 Mitchell - Lama. They should take off all of the17 surcharges, not only me, the entire  apartment.18 And now they get apartments,  a19 vacancy, they put in a new kitchen, a  real20 garbage kitchen, and they get $2000 a month  rent21 which before it was $500. And they triple  the22 apartment rent.23 And when we call up and we  find24 out and we ask, we' re always turned down. Why?25 Because my landlord' s name is Trump. That 's why7 
2 they turn down. We can never get anywhere.  We3 find and call the - - not the MCI, where the    rents45	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	DHCR.6	MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	DHCR, right ,  7 thank you.8 So we call them and they don' t9 do a thing. We' re turned down on everything.10 (Audience participation. )11 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	And it 's a12 disgrace because we  - -  I only live on  Social13 Security and my rent is over $1000. And I  get14 $1400 Social Security. Where am I supposed to   get15 the money to buy prescription drugs, to buy   food?16 I'll have to come to one of your homes. I have   no17 money.18 (Audience participation.)19 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	So the moral20 of my story is you should go back in the   rents,21 lower the rents, and look into the  landlords22 because they have plenty of money. My landlord is  2324 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Your landlord25 is dead.24 
1	3342	MS . SYLVIA FIELDS:	What?3 (Audience part icipation.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	He' s dead.5 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	They have6 plenty of money especially  Trump.7 So look at the tenants.8 I didn't hear what he said.  Tell9 me what he said.10 A VOICE:	He said the landlord' s11 dead.12 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	Well, then,13 wait a while. Frank Trump is dead. But  Donald14 Trump don't even want to know the  building.15 But Robert , and there's a cousin16 and you can go down the list who you talk to.17 And they supposedly put  an18 elevator and another thing. And supposed to  give19 an increase for new elevator. They just  patched20 it up. And then we have to give a  raise.21 And now they' re putting a22 generator in and we have no elevators.  They23 pulled the elevators a few  times.24 I could go on and on.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I can tell6 
  2 that.3 (Audience participation.)4 MS. SYLVIA FIELDS:	I can go5 back to the old days. Roll back the rents!  No6 increase!7 (Audience participation.)8 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	The next9 speaker is Andrew Eristoff , followed by Miriam10 Thompson, followed by Judy Siegel , and then11 Robert Weisberg.12 MS. MIRIAM THOMPSON:	My name is13 Miriam Thompson, a rent stabilized tenant   in14 Queens representing the few remaining  rent15 stabilized tenants  in our building.16 I'm going to ask you to do  the17 improbable but not the impossible: reverse  your18 preliminary proposal , be heroes, save our  city,19 roll back or at least a zero increase in 2002- 20	2003 .21 My building was converted to  a22 co-op fifteen years ago. But about forty  percent23 of our apartments remained at rent  stabilized.24 Now most of these apartments are now  market25 rentals because of vacancy decontrol. Few low   and21 
1	3362 moderate income families can afford these  market3 rents.4 In a borough exploding with5 struggling working families, Queens has seen  the6 loss of thousands of rent stabilized  affordable7 housing.8 My children work in New  York9 City. They have a thirteen- month old and live in10 a small studio converted into a one- bedroom,11 $1200 a month.12 Their friends also with a  infant13 moved into a decontrolled apartment for $2500  a14 month. Young families cannot afford to live  in15 New York nor can pensioners, nor can  I.16 Others have told you that17 landlords enjoy MCI increases, tax  breaks,18 hardship  increases, and your own statistics and19 staff show that landlords' operating costs  have20 decl ined , that average net operating income rose21 since 2000.22 Rent Guidelines Board  consistent23 rent increases over the years have more  than24 compensated  landlords' operating expenses. This25 is not true of tenants, half of whom have  incomes2 
2 below $27,000 and hundreds of thousands below   the3 poverty level.4 And let me say something  about5 the small landlord and there are certainly  more6 experts than I that have testified. Every year   I7 come to the Rent Guidelines Board hearings.  I've8 heard their pleas for an  increases.9 First , I never  see the big10 landlords who own most of the stock in the  City.11 And, second, struggling  small12 landlords have an opportunity to apply for13 hardship increases and open their  books.14 And if the application  process15 is too onerous or confusing, then change  the16 procedures, but stop penalizing  the tenants  who17 have no such opportunities. We don't get  tax18 breaks when our rent is  increased.19 The City is in crisis,20 struggling to survive after 9/11. We will not21 survive unless we can assure stabilized  and22 affordable housing. And you have the power to  do23 it.24 You have an obligation under25 legislat ion to protect the public health,  safety2 
2and welfare,to prevent  exactions  of unjust ,3unreasonableand oppressive rents and  rental4agreements.5When you wake up Friday  a.m.6 after your vote tomorrow evening, what will  you7 say to your children, grandchildren and  the8 City' s children?9 You have enormous power to  help10 make this City livable by doing the improbable.   A11 zero increase is both a just political  statement12 and a moral act.13 Thank you.14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	The next16 speaker is Judy Siegel , followed by Robert17 Weisberg  and Christine Stanfield.18 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Judy Siegel ,19 then Robert Weisberg and Christ ine Stanfield.20MS. JUDY SIEGEL:	Look, there' s21somethingcrazyhere .22We are talking about  something23that - -24A VOICE:	Can't hear.25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Louder.
1	3392	MS. JUDY SIEGEL:	Is this on?3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.4 MS. JUDY SIEGEL:	I 'm Judy5 Siegel and I am a small owner and for  thirty6 years I 've been hearing about the plight of the7 small owners, and in all that time not one  thing8 has been done.9 You talk about that the  costs10 went down this year? I have never once had  a11 stabilized increase that equalled my increases   in12 cost that year. Last year my fuel cost  doubled.13 Did my increase double? No.14 But what you are not talking15 about , the eight hundred pound gorilla in the16 living room, is that every year, four years  out17 of five, my real estate tax goes up  eight18 percent . It is now bigger than all my other19 expenses combined .20 And when it gets to be a  lot ,21 eight percent of a lot is a  lot.22 I'm seventy- two. My husband is23 seventy- four. How long are we going to be able to24 cont inue increasingly subsidizing our tenants?25 My tenant has security. I  have5 
2 no security .3 But I told this to some4 politician outside that my real estate tax  goes5 up eight percent a year. He didn' t believe it6 because we came in in 1957 when every time  the7 inspectors came around to give us another  tenant8 violation - and I'm living there still with  my9 tenant , and bel ieve me that house is kept well.10 And  I 'm  listening to the horror11 stories about what happens in the Bronx. Well,  I12 know that there are bad landlords. But do  two13 wrongs make a right?14 I 'm being  squeezed out of my15 lifelong home . We made  it , we saved this16 community . We were the community that stopped17 Robert Moses who was going to drive the  buses18 through the park. We landmarked our  district19 against the City because what the inspector  said20 was these old houses should be torn  down.21 And what did we get for  thanks?22 We get our increased  tax23 assessments for being in an historic district.   So24 they say, oh, so what , you' ll sell your house,25 you' ll make a bundl e.2 
1	3412 No, I won' t make a bundle3 because I'm under two layers of rent  regulat ion4 and you can't sell for that . Besides which I5 would have a capital gains tax which would  wipe6 out any prof it I made.7 And there is no one  time8 lifet ime exemption for selling your home because9 they call it a commercial  property.10 So I am hemmed in. And people11 say, oh, cluck, cluck. But I have got to live  or12 die according to what some poor people - - and my13 heart goes out to them  - - has in the  Bronx.14 But why isn't there a  separate15 category for owner- occupied houses, where I live16 with my tenants and I have got every year,  four17 years out  of  five , eight percent  tax increases?18 Don't the big guys pay real19 estate taxes? Maybe they' re underassessed. Maybe20 they know somebody . Maybe they are paying off21 somebody.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 Thank you, ma' am.24 Any questions?25 (No response.)2 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,3 ma' am. We appreciate it.4 (Audience participation.)5	MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Robert6 Weisberg,  followed by Christine Stanfield,  Robert7 Campbelloff .8	MR. ROBERT WEISBERG:	My name9 is Robert Weisberg. I represent the tenants  at10 145 East 92nd Street.11 We have fairly - -12 A VOICE:	We cannot hear.13 A VOICE:	Louder.14 MR. ROBERT WEISBERG:	We have a15 fairly cordial relationship with our landlord.16 And I'm not going to talk about  ceilings17 collapsing or anything like  that.18 We decided  - - the forty- four19 tenants in our building decided to go back   over20 an eight - year period to determine how much rent21 was being paid eight years ago in our building22 compared to the amount of rent that is being  paid23 today.24 The reason we did this is  that25 over here from your group is the operat ing9 
1	3432 expense side of the business but not the  revenue3 side of the business . What we read about is that4 real estate taxes are going up, and it may  be,5 fuel oil may be going up - I'm not sure . But  we6 do know that you can play with numbers on the7 expense side . That 's knowledgeabl e today because8 of WorldCom.9 But it 's very diff icult to play10 with numbers on the revenue side.11 So let me give you some  real12 figures, Mr . Castellano .13 In 1996 , the rent roll in our14 building  was approximately $600,000.15 In the year 2002 the rent  roll16 is approximately  $1,200 , 000.17 It 's an increase of a hundred18 percent in a very short period of time .19 This indicates that the  rent20 increase in this building has gone up on an21 annualized basis of ten percent .22 It has gone up due to a  series23of factors. Oneof them is the combining of  two24apartments intoone, and the other is decontrol .25Our building  is a good building
2 in a good neighborhood.3 But what I'm asking you  to4 consider is that there is a tremendous  increase5 in the rent roll and why isn't that rent  increase6 provided for in your deliberations as to whether7 or not the cost of apartments should go up by   two8 percent or four percent or no percent?9 So the question that I  would10 like to have answered, and that 's what my group11 has asked me to come here for, is why don' t  you12 consider the rent increase  - -  I'm sorry, the  rent13 revenue side rather than just what appears to   be14 the operating expense  side?15 Can somebody answer that for  me?16 MR. CASTELLANO:	Mr. Chairman,17 can I respond?18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.19 Mr. Castellano can  respond.20 MR. CASTELLANO:	The short21 answer to your question is we do.22 The point  is - - you said 14523 East 92nd Street.24 MR. ROBERT WEISBERG:	Yes.25 MR. CASTELLANO:	You are on the2 
1	3452 most valuabl e dirt in the world. Okay? That is  a3 fact. It 's more valuabl e than Tokyo, it 's more4 valuable than London, it 's more valuable than  any5 other dirt on the planet.  Okay?6	And that 's why rents in core7 Manhattan are at the astronomical heights   that8 they are and they will always  be.9 Now, you want to talk  about10 Crown Heights where Mr. Gittens has his  property?11 You want to talk about the South Bronx? You   want12 to talk about Bushwick or Brownsville?  That 's not13 92nd Street in Manhattan.14 MR. ROBERT WEISBERG:	Mr.15 Castellano, I didn' t come here to be harassed  in16 any way by you.17 (Audience participation. )18 MR. ROBERT WEISBERG:	I asked a19 very simple question. We never hear about  the20 revenue side but we do hear about the   operating21 side.22 Perhaps Mr. Markus, the23 Chairman, can answer the question for me in   a24 reasonable way. I happen to know that Tokyo   is25 more expensive than New York. So don' t try  to7 
2 give me any of that  baloney.3 (Audience participation.)4 MR. CASTELLANO:	I'm sorry.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We as a Board6 will make our statements tomorrow as to what   we7 think and what the issues  are.8	There are many points of view on9 this Board. It takes five votes. Everybody' s  got10 a different reason as to why they reach  any11 particular conclusion.12 Unfortunately,  if it was13 systematic or arithmetic , it would be very  easy.14 It is not that. Everybody has a different  point15 of view as to what factors they take  into16 considerat ion. Legally we are mandated to  take17 into account  five different  factors including18 revenues and expenses. And many people focus   on19 that. Other focus on everything else.20 Ultimat ely, this Board is living21 within a law and there have been many, many22 lawsuits challenging the decisions of this  Board.23 And this Board , as an adjudicatory body, has  been24 upheld each time.25 I can't tell you what 's in9 
1	3472 everybody' s mind. And I can' t tell you at any3 particular moment what is in my mind and why  I'm4 vot ing on a particular area.5 We listen to your test imony. We6 listen to other people' s test imony. We take that7 all into consideration.8 And clearly there have  been9 arguments all along and there have  been10 particular arguments similar to yours on that11 revenue  is underestimated.12 And we appreciate your13 testimony.14 MR. ROBERT WEISBERG:	Thank you.15 (Audience participation. )16 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Christine17 Stanf ield , followed by Robert Campbelloff and18 Dawn Jones.19 MS. CHRISTINE STANFIELD:	Hello!20 My name is Christine  Stanfield21 and, of course, I'm here on behalf of  tenants.22 And I really come here to  demand23 actually a universal rollback of rents to,  you24 know, just a partial payback for all these   years25 of constant rent gouging and obscene prof it that2 
2 has been going on here in New York  City.3 I myself am a member of a  large4 group of people. We are on the Lower East   Side,5 Diaspora. And we are the socially  committed6 peopl e who dug out the Lower East Side in  the7 early	'80s. It was a pile of rubble from  landlord8 arson.9 And we planted gardens and  we10 created a viabl e community that has just turned11 into a arcade of restaurants for the  bourgeoisie.12 Okay.13 So while	and I no longer live14 there. That 's what diaspora means, right? I can't15 afford to live in my community  anymore.16 And I'm really - - so I'm up   in17 Harlem. And I'm really aware of the irony.   I'm18 aware of the irony that I am a displaced   person19 and that my role in the Lower East Side was I   was20 on the front lines of gentrif ication and I21 displaced a whole group, a whol e community,  of22 Puerto Ricans to get in there. And now it's  a23 pretty lily-white neighborhood. And now I'm   in24 Harlem. And I 'm doing the dirty work of  these25 landlords totally. I don' t want to work for  the2 
1	3492 landlords.3 You know, because I've made  a4 vi tal contribution to the City of New York City.5 I'm a high school English teacher for the  Board6 of Educat ion.7 (Audience participat ion.)8	MS. CHRISTINE STANFIELD:	And9 I'm displaced from my community. I should be   able10 to live in my community because I am making  that11	contribution.12 But instead higher and  higher13 rents, a recession, you are cutting back  in14 services. What  are the  - - you know, what  are the15 facts here? You've got 33 , 000 in shelters, 14,00016 are children. And I've got to educate  them.17 Hey, man! And I can't afford  to18 live here?19 I think we've got to roll  back20 the rents for every single   tenant .21 (Audience participation. )2 2MS.

You got to roll back these rents,  sirs.18 (Audience part icipat ion.)19 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	The next20 speaker is Robert Campbelloff , followed by  Dawn21 Jones and then James Jones.22 MR. ROBERT CAMPBELLOFF:	Hello!23 My name is Robert  Campbelloff24 and I am the Housing Coordinator of CIDNY,   the25 Center for Independence of the Disabled in   New2 
2	York .3	CIDNY provides direct services4 and conducts advocacy to promote  independent5 living for people with disabilities . Many of our6 consumers have waited decades to find  affordable ,7 accessible housing .8 For that reason we formed  a9 coalit ion of disability - rights groups, housing10 advocates and consumers to educate and  create11 solutions to this problem .12 I am here today to testify  to13 the overwhelming need for affordable,  accessible14 housing for people with disabilities . Any measure15 that would serve to decrease an already  shrinking16 supply of affordable housing in our  community17 would be beyond a crisis . It would be18 catastrophic.19 Many of us would be priced  out20 of housing and onto the streets, or  into21 institutions and nursing homes. In light of  the22 recent civil rights gains of the American  with23 Disabilit ies Act and Fair Housing Amendments,24 that is unacceptable  and unconscionable.25 Following is an explanation  of4 
2 how proposed rent increases would add fuel to   a3 fire that already burns out of  control.4	The affordable housing crisis  in5 New York City has impacted all low- income6 tenants, and for people with disabilities  the7 need has been severe.8	Furthermore, the problem is9 escalating:  twenty-year  contracts  of project -10 based Section 8 housing have started to expire   as11 the income - to- rent gap widens. This income gap is12 exacerbated  for people with disabilities by  SSI13 that are below the Federal minimum wage,  and14 rising rents due to a market - demand surge.15 According  to HUD, very low-16 income households paying more than sixty  percent17 of income for rent are considered to have   severe18 rent burdens or worst case housing  needs.19 As  a nat ional average , people20 with disabilities must spend sixty- nine to21 seventy percent of their income to afford  a22 modest apartment priced at HUD fair market   rents.23 In New York City, the reality  of24 this statist ic produces outcomes that are much25 more grim. Within this market , accessible,9 
2	affordable housing  is virtually non- existent.3 Ten years after Congress amended4 the Federal Fair Housing laws to include  Section5 504 of the Rehab Act , accessible housing6 construction and retrof itting are still widely7 ignored.8 Of the more than two million9 apartments constructed  since 1990, the Justice10 Department and advocates around the country  have11 surveyed the compliance rate to be less than  five12 percent.13 Concomitantly,  as current crisis14 levels are somewhat relieved by a second wave  of15 Section 8 vouchers and HUD reforms, people  with16 disabilities are still experiencing worst  case17 scenarios. In fact , these scenarios will remain  a18 grim reality unt il a proportionate	share of19 affordable, accessible units is considered  a20 necessary component to the City' s housing21 solutions.22 The Rent Guidelines Board has  a23 responsibility to ensure that rent burdens do  not24 outstrip tenants' ability to pay.  If we  - -25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you3 
2	wrap up , please .3	MR. ROBERT CAMPBELLOFF:	If we4 jeopardize the future stability of low- income5 tenants with disabilit ies, we risk catapulting6 the City to pre- civil rights conditions . The only7 difference is that now we know  better.8 Thank you.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10	(Audience participation .)11	MR . McLAUGHLIN:	The next12 speaker is Dawn Jones, followed by James Jones,13 Suzette Gardner and Beth  Sopko.14 MS. DAWN JONES:	My name is Dawn15 Jones and  I'm Recording  Secretary of  - -16 A VOICE :	We can't hear you .17 MS . DAWN JONES:	- - Lenox18 Terrace Association.19 A VOICE:	Can't hear you.20 A VOICE :	Use the mike.21 MS . DAWN JONES:	All right .22 My name is Dawn Jones . I'm the23 Recording  Secretary of Lenox Terrace Associat ion24 of Concerned Citizens and a Union Delegate of   SSE25 Local 3 71 and I'm a rent stabilized tenant  in12 
2 Harlem.3 And I would like to commend  you4 for adding one person of color on the Board.  But5 that' s not good enough. If we were at The6 Shamburg again,7 (Audience participation.)8 MS. DAWN JONES:	My situation is9 that my rent has gone up from $825.12 to  $858.13 .10 I'm a social worker and I make about $1000 bi -11 weekly and it takes two checks to pay my   rent.12 The rents are going up in  my13 building and neighborhood.	I have diff iculty14 paying my rent by the 5th when it's due, and   my15 neighbors are in the same situation. They   have16 diff iculties paying high rent.17 My rent went up from $400  from18 the previous tenant , according to records19 obtained from DHCR.20 I live paycheck to paycheck  and21 I pay one- third of my income for rent.22 My building has been hit  with23 Major Capital Improvement rent hikes. I   remind24 you that MCis are compounded with lease   renewal25 rent hikes.2 
2 The bad condit ions in my3 apartment are cracks in the bathroom ceiling  and4 window seal. Otherwise, my building  is pretty5 well maintained. Necessary repairs are made  and6 the landlord has requested an MCI for  the7 terraces and they look worse .8 Whether you have one or not ,9 comparing that to a first floor tenant  that10 with an elevator is if they don' t go up and down11 like to the laundry room .12 Other tenants have  complained13 that the workers during the day would  have14 parties on their terraces. I've found  cigarette15 butts on my terrace . And there is a crack that16 was not there before they were  repaired.17 And management	just taped it up18 with tape, the crack that wasn' t there before.19 Finally, rollbacks. I urge  you20 to reject the proposed two and four  percent21 guidelines and vote to roll back rents or  at22 least for no rent increases of any kind for one -23 year and two-year leases .24 There is a waiting list in  my25 complex and management	continues to warehouse our2 
2 apartments. And this does not apply to  new3 tenants in my complex. A one- bedroom now goes for 4	$1,000 and to $1400 a month.5 We are urging for stronger  rent6 laws now. We each have yellow signs in  our7 windows.8	The MCI was given in 1990 for9 the elevators and they are in worse  conditions.10 Tenants in Building 2186 including people  who11 work in the management office have been  stuck,12 and our rents continue to go  up.13 I 'm  a job opportunity specialist14 and I determine eligibility for  welfare15 recipients and I am two checks from  welfare.16 Thank you.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on.19 Are there questions?20 Ms. Holder has a question.21 MS. HOLDER:	I have a quick22 question.23 When people  come  - - new people24 come into your building	- and I tried to get an25 apartment there several years ago and  couldn't9 
1	3582 get in - - but  the new folks that come in,   how3 much are they paying?4	MS. DAWN JONES:	$1100 to $14005 for a one- bedroom.6 (Audience participat ion .)7	MS . HOLDER :	Where exactly are8	you located?9	MS. DAWN JONES:	10 West 135th10 Street between Lenox and Fifth .11 MS.

JAMES JONES:	I thank God24 and three unknown  contributors.25 I offer disclaimers if anyone10 
2	takes my comments out of  context.3	What is an act of God? What  is4 an act of the devil?5 What is premeditated  murder?6 Although this is before my  time,7 the United States did not enter the war in  Europe8 until Japan struck the United States'  interests9 in the south seas.10 It has come to my attention  that11 the Arab countries were the middleman in  the12 American slave trade. The Arab countries did   not13 fire the guns, but they drove the getaway  car,14 the wheelman.15 Former Mayor William  Giuliano16 gave the civilian board of Lower  Manhattan17 something called an MOU empowering this board  to18 prosecute  substant iated police corruption.19 Patrick J. Lynch, police union boss,  successfully20 contest ed the Mayor' s Office.21 Patrick J. Lynch does not22 warrant  substantiated police corruption23 prosecuting.24 We have just heard an25 entrepreneur claim harassment	is strongly4 
2 prosecuted. Ms. Holder quickly claimed  harassment3 as swiftly prosecut ing.4 Where does the truth  enter?5 If anyone has access to the  law6 journal this case was argued March 2002 ,7 Appellate Division encaptioned  Patrick J.  Lynch,8 Police Union Boss against the City of New   York.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,10 sir.11 (Audience participat ion. )12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Suzette14 Gardner, then Beth Sopko, then Herbert  Rock.15 MS. SUZETTE GARDNER:	Yes.16 My name is Suzette Gardner . I'm17 from 236  3 1st Street , Brooklyn, New York .18 The reason why I'm here is  for19 the disabled ; right? When you are disabled ,   you20 get five something or six something. So I  cannot21 see an increase on the rate, on the rents  because22 when you are disabled , you get so much and the23 rent is so high.24 So they' re not thinking about25 your medication,  they're not thinking about10 
2 nothing as more than being greedy and  selfish3 when they raise the rent , not to mention the4 disabl ed and all the working people.5 And where I live too it 's a6 legal place. I don't want to move. And  they've7 been charging the rent and the rent is  illegal .8 So I would like to get some more  information9 about that because they've been turning  off10 lights, gas and water last year, October, and  I11 got pneumonia.12 I stayed in the hospital  for13 three days.14 So I would like to get some  more15 information about that and to find out what  the16 landlord should do in that  case.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We will have18 one of our staff people - - just give us the phone19 number of where you should be  called.20 MS.

I have been a New Yorker for  all9 my life and as has my husband.

13632I want to leave with just  one3word that I'vealways wanted to say. It 's a4Jewish phrase.5CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Herbert Rock.6MR. HERBERT ROCK:	It 's a Jewish7phrase.	(Spokein Yiddish.)	11  How much is enough8enough? 119 (Audience participat ion.)10 MR. HERBERT ROCK:	I moved into11 my bedroom, coming from New York, and I paid   $22512 a month. I would like to show you my rent  receipt13 today, $890. Is that  fair?14 I'm a veteran. I only have  a15 certain income. I have an income - - my union    got16 me out by paying $150 retirement  fund.17 Where am I going to get  the18 money? I thank God I've got children. They  help19 me out once in a while.20 You look around this room at  the21 tenants. And the landlords, they' re laughing at22 you. They say you're going to give us what  we23 want . It 's the truth. I've been here four years24 and it happens all the  time.25 On my building we' re paying so9 
2 much  - - my  landlord has offered  over $100,000 to3 move out , cash, and he rents the apartment for  4	$350,000.5	You' re saying he' s not making a6 profit. They all make money. Nobody ever comes   up7 here  - - and I don' t see anybody,  landlords come8 up and say - - and they say this is how much    it is9 cost ing. Why don' t they come up and say how much10 am I making every year? They don' t tell you  that.11 They only tell you what their cost  is.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where do you13 live, Mr. Rock?14 MR. HERBERT ROCK:	Pardon me?15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where do you16 live?17 A VOICE:	Coney Island.18 MR. HERBERT ROCK:	I live in19 Coney Island.20 I want to also tell you21 something else that bothers me to no  extent.22 That we in Brooklyn, we have  a23 Jewish War Vet erans group. All of us have  fought24 in World War II and most of us are  tenants25 because we unfortunately  came out  - - we couldn' t6 
2 get these great jobs, these good jobs, to  pay3 rent.4 Have some pity on the  tenants.5 They say	(speaking Yiddish. )6	Please, don' t do it again. Give  7 us one year, one year we ask for, to  do8 zero/zero.9 And you will be the  greatest10 board that ever sat on the Rent Control  Board .11 Thank you .12 (Audience participat ion.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr .

HERBERT ROCK:	Yes.19 So that he can rent it for 20	$350 , 000.21 MR.  CASTELLANO:	Well , forget22 that.23 Why did you turn down  $100,000?24 MR. HERBERT ROCK:	Because I25 have no place to go. Where do  you21

I18 couldn't stay here so I came to Coney Island.  And19 I came to Coney Island because the rent  was20 reasonable because my kids can go to the  beach21 and we could afford vacat ions. So we came to22 Coney Island to live.23 And now all of sudden we  come24 here and, bingo, rent goes up every  year.25 Come on, people! Give us a  break11 
2one time.Let 's go one year and say, hey, guys,3maybe thetenants need a break.4MR. CASTELLANO:	I know5somethingabout finance and economics. Take  the6money andrun.7	MR.

1	3682 MR. HERBERT ROCK:	Oh, yeah! I3 take the money. Right? If I take the money,  what4 do I do with it?

You' re right.10	(Audience participation.)11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,12 sir.13 Thank you very much. We14 appreciate it.15 MR. HERBERT ROCK:	Thank you for16 hearing us.17 Thanks so much.18 Tikoff Valentina?  Is she in the19	audience?20 (No response.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Tikoff22 Valentina?23 (No response.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No.25 Christine Quinn.20 
2She's here, right?3Whenever you're ready.4COUNCILMEMBER CHRISTINE QUINN:5Okay. Great.6Hello! My name is  Christine7 Quinn. I'm the Councilmember  representing the  3rd8 Council District in Manhattan  in the neighborhood9 of Greenwich Village,  Chelsea, Hell' s Kitchen,10 Clinton and part of Murray Hill and  Soho.11 I cannot begin to describe12 clearly and with enough impact the effect  that13 the proposed rent hikes will have on  the14 dwindling stock of affordable housing in  my15 district.16 The reality is that the  proposed17 rent hikes continue to erode the small amount   of18 affordable housing in my district and I  believe19 will continue to cause widespread  community20 destabilization by potentially  driving out  long-21 time low and moderate- income residents in my22 communities.23 Once again, as I have for  many24 years, I stand before you expressing my   concern25 over this year's proposed rent increases.  It7 
2 baffles me how the Rent Guidelines Board  can3 cont inue to ignore their mandate of protect ing4 tenants  from receiving unfair  - -5 (Audience participation .)6 COUNCILMEMBER CHRISTINE7 QUINN:	- -  and unreasonable  rent increases.8 (Audience participation .)9 COUNCILMEMBER  CHRISTINE QUINN:10 Last year, this Panel argued that skyrocket ing11 landlord costs justified the need for  additional12 rent increases.13 This assertion in my opinion  was14 weak last year, but this year it is  absolutely15 untenable. The first reason for that is  that16 rents have gone up far more quickly than  landlord17 costs .18 The greatest indication of  this19 is that for the first time, as you well know,  in20 the Rent Guidelines Board thirty- one year21 history, your own Price Index of Operating   Costs22 study clearly shows that landlord costs have   gone23 down 1.6 percent , including a thirty- six   percent24 decrease in the cost of  fuel.25 To propose a two percent10 
2increasefor one-yearleases and a four percent3increasefor two- yearleases, despit e all4evidencein the PIOC,is absolutely absurd.5	Addit ionally, the economic6 repercussions created by September 11th have  made7 a large percentage of rent -paying New Yorkers8 vulnerable  to displacement by rent increases.9 Tens of thousands of New  Yorkers10 have been laid off since 9/11 and more   layoffs11 are on the way.12 According to the Bureau of  New13 York Civil Courts, approximately 26, 000 New14 Yorkers were evicted last year, a  significant15 percentage of whom could not afford their   rents.16 Again, higher numbers are17 expected this year because of post 9/11   impacts.18 Advocat es for the homeless have19 argued that over 33 , 000 New Yorkers overcrowd the20 City shelters each night , and out of that  33 , 000,21 14,000 are children. It would be  extremely22 irresponsible for this body to grant  landlords23 rent increases given these harsh realities   and24 their decreasing costs.25 Lastly, since my time is  running6 
2 out , let me just also speak to the situation with3 SRO hotels which my district actually has some  of4 the few that remain in the  City.5 I think it is incumbent on  this6 Board to make sure that we don't have - - that we7 have a zero rent increase for any of the - - as    it8 relates to SROs.9 Also, I just want to lodge  my10 opposition to both the poor  - - the   reinstatement11 of the poor tax, and the longevity  tax.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 (Audience participat ion.)14 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Councilperson15 Moskowitz,  Eva Moskowitz.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Eva17 Moskowitz?	Is she here?18 COUNCILMEMBER  EVA MOSKOWITZ:19 Yes.20 Good evening.21 My colleague Christine Quinn  has22 spoken very eloquently about the fact  that23 operating costs have gone down and in the last  -24 - this Board is proposing another increase on  top25 of the last few years. We've had a series  of2 
1	3732 increases.3 She has spoken very eloquently4 also about the housing situation, everything  from5 the homeless to low- income to middl e- income.6 I'm going to speak a little bit7 more from the heart. I grew up in a rent -8 regulated apartment. I'm not from a  poor9 background , but  I 'm from a middl e class10 background . And my parents were able to send me11 to college because we lived in a rent - regulated12 apartment.13 It is extremely important  for14 low- income and middl e- class people in New York15 City to have affordable housing and it  is16 increasingly difficult in New York  City,17 particularly	in Manhattan but throughout  the18 City, to afford to live in New  York.19 The middle class and the  low-20 income in this City pay the bulk of the  taxes.21 And from an economic point of view, as well as   a22 moral point of view, we need to keep that  revenue23 base here in New York  City.24 So I urge you to vote for  no25 increases, particularly  at a time when operating2 
1	3742 costs for landlords have  decreased.3 I hope that this Board will  take4 a new tact from the previous Board and offer  all5 due consideration to tenants which they have  not6 done for quite a long time .7 Thank you very much .8 (Audience part icipation .)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you10 Ms. Holder .11	MS. HOLDER:	Which neighborhoods12 comprise your representat ion on Council?13 COUNCILPERSON EVA MOSKOWITZ:	I14 represent the east side of Manhattan from 97th  to15 14th Street. In particular,	I represent16 Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village  which17 have had sort of an onslaught of market- oriented18 rents as well as Waterside, which is Mitchell -19 Lama, as well as numerous rent  regulated20 apartments, you know, spread throughout the  east21 side .22 The east side in generally23 considered a very affluent	I often hear other24 elected officials say, oh, you must not have  any25 rent regulated apartments in your district.  That12 
2 is completely false. The bulk of my  constituency3 actually lives in rent regulated  apartments.4 MS. HOLDER:	And do you have a5 lot of middle- class tenants? And how would you6 def ine that in your district?7 COUNCILMEMBER  EVA MOSKOWITZ:8 You know, it obviously ranges. I have a  great9 number of elderly tenants living on a  fixed10 income who perhaps thirty years ago  were11	considered middle class, but now living on a12 fixed income with rising costs for  prescription13 drugs are living really at the margin. And  it 's14 quite difficult for them to handle these  rent15 increases on a fixed income.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.17 Castellano.18 First of all , Mr. Carmody is one19 of your constituents in Peter Cooper  Village.20 COUNCILPERSON  EVA MOSKOWITZ:21 Absolutely.22 MR. LUBELL:	And so am I.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.24 Castellano  - -  oh! And  so is Mr. Lubell.25 COUNCILPERSON  EVA MOSKOWITZ:12 
2 Well , I hope that you will have a particular3 appreciation of the challenges since you  are4 living in that area.5	MR. CASTELLANO:	And I used to6 live in that district , but I could no longer7 af ford it. So I moved out a long time ago.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead , Mr.9	Castellano.10 MR. CASTELLANO:	I have a11 question, Ms. Moskowitz.12 This district used to be  called13 the Silk Stocking District ; is that correct?14 COUNCILPERSON  EVA MOSKOWITZ:15 That 's correct.16 MR. CASTELLANO:	In the time of17 John Lindsey, the Mayor of New  York.18 COUNCILPERSON  EVA MOSKOWITZ:19 That 's correct.20 MR. CASTELLANO:	I was just21 curious if everybody in this district who  makes22 more than $100, 000 a year, if they voted for the23 other candidate, could you get elected in  that24 district?25 A VOICE:	She would get elected10 
2 anyway .3 COUNCILPERSON  EVA MOSKOWITZ:4 You mean vot ing for my opponent?5	MR. CASTELLANO:	Yes. That 's the6	other candidat e,  the opponent .7	If everybody who made a  $100,0008 or more in that district voted for the other  guy9 in the next election, would you  win?10 COUNCILPERSON  EVA MOSKOWITZ:11	I'm not sure I understand the nature of your12 question.13 MR. CASTELLANO:	A demographic14 political  question .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	The point he16 is trying to make  is if they all voted  - -  that17 they're all rich and , therefore, the rents would18 go up. That 's the point he ' s trying to make .19 MR. CASTELLANO:	No . I20 COUNCILPERSON EVA MOSKOWITZ :21 The fact of the matter is that the district ,22 whil e it' s called the Silk Stocking District and23 includes Fifth Avenue, Park Avenue and  Madison,24 the bulk of the district is middle - income. It is25 not the people making $1 million plus a  year .12 
2	Quite the contrary.3	MR. CASTELLANO:	I didn' t say4 $1 million.	I said $100,000. If they voted  for5 the other person - -6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.7	Castellano,8	COUNCILPERSON EVA MOSKOWITZ:	I9 don' t think it 's appropriate here for - -  I would10 be happy at a later time to discuss my  campaign11 or polit ics, but what we are here to do today,  it12 seems to me, is to discuss rent regulation  and13 the challenges14 (Audience participat ion .)15 COUNCILPERSON  EVA MOSKOWITZ:16 - that - -17 (Audience participation .)18 COUNCILPERSON EVA MOSKOWITZ:	I19 have to say that I resent a little bit the  sort20 of mockery. It 's a terribly serious topic.21 (Audience participation .)22 MR. CASTELLANO:	I'm asking a23 factual question, Ms. Moskowitz. You' re not24 answering  the question.25 Thank you.9 
2 COUNCILPERSON  EVA MOSKOWITZ:	I ' d3 ask for the courtesy, pl ease, of being able to4 respond.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead ,6	ma' am. Yes, ma' am. Go ahead .7	COUNCILPERSON  EVA MOSKOWITZ:8 The issues at stake I trust that the members  of9 this Board take very, very seriously that in  your10 hands are the fates, the lives of real people  who11 have real struggles . And I would hope that you12 would take that responsibility very,  very13 seriously.14 It is a very daunting thing as  a15 tenant to have our fate in your hands. But  that16 is the situation.17 (Audience participation .)18 COUNCILPERSON EVA MOSKOWITZ:	I19 would hope that you take that  responsibility20 very, very seriously .21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let me assure22 you that this Board takes seriously,  including23 Mr . Castellano  - - he' s just trying to make a24 point which is a legitimate part of the  public25 discourse. He' s making it , I think, in a8 
2 roundabout way which is that there are  some3 tenants who may be benefitting from  rent4 regulat ion who under an affordability test , if5	there were such a thing, which there isn't in  the6 rent regulation system,7 (Audience participation.)8	CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	- - might not ,9 you know, be eligible for the rent that they   are10 paying .11	That ' s the only reason he was12 making it in a somewhat roundabout  way.13 We take it very seriously and  we14 appreciate your time in coming to testify  before15 us .16 COUNCILPERSON EVA MOSKOWITZ :17 Thank you very much.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Excuse me.19 Mr. Rivera.20 MR . RIVERA :	Councilwoman21 Moskowitz,  I just want to thank you for coming22 here and to comment on the fact that we haven' t23 had in all the time that I've been here a  voice24 for the middle class .25 And we've had today a  large12 
2 number of people from different boroughs  talking3 about the middle class and their  problems.4 So I just want to thank you  for5 being part of that .6 COUNCILPERSON  EVA MOSKOWITZ:7 Well , it 's a point  that I think can get lost8 because sometimes we sort of think that if  you9 are middle class - I mean there are  obviously10 programs  for the poor, for subsidization, and11 obviously they have important needs and  anyone12 with a social conscience wants to ensure  that13 everybody has housing - but I do think that  this14 issue of affordability, what it means to be  able15 to afford life in New York City is like no  other16 city in the world .17 It is an extremely expensive18 city. And what it means to the middle class  I19 think that whatever dollar you put on that  is20 very different in New York than any other   city.21 The housing, the schooling,  the22 child care, I mean if we had universal pre- K, we23wouldn' thave to spend the money on  childcare.24But manyfamilies do. And so that has to  be25factoredin when you ask a question  of
2 affordability.  It is very diff icult to live in3 New York if you are on a fixed income or if  you4 are elderly or if you are part of a young  family.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay . Thank6 you very much.7 (Audience participation.)8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We are now9 going to take a break and we will come back  at10 7:15 and talk about hotels again. I think we  have11 a limited number. And then we will go back  to12 apartments, or earlier if that 's the case .13 Is Councilmember Jackson here?14 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:15 Good evening, Members of the Board and members  of16 the public that are present this  evening.17 My name is Robert Jackson  and18 I'm a New York City Council Member  representing19 the 7th Cou-ncil District of Manhattan.20 (Audience participation.)21 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:22 My district includes parts of  Morningside23 Heights, West Harlem, Hamilton  Heights,24 Washington Heights and Inwood. Many thousands   of25 my constituents are tenants in buildings that   are9 
2 affected by the decisions that you will  make3 regarding rent increases.4 Let me state for the record  that5 as a representative of over 150 , 000 const ituents,6 I oppose any increase in rents .7 In fact ,8 (Audience participation .)9 COUNCILMEMBER  ROBERT JACKSON:10 -  I believe  that  a rollback  in rents would be11 appropriate.12 (Audience participation .)13 COUNCILMEMBER  ROBERT JACKSON:14 Over the last four years, landlords have  made15 record prof its on resident ial real estate .16 Estimates are as high as forty percent. And ,  for17 the first time in history, your own price  index18 is negative, including a thirty- five percent19 decrease in fuel costs .20 Landlords are also reaping  great21 rewards with Major Capital  Improvements, MCis,22 which increase rents up to twelve percent   for23 each application that the DHCR , the Division of24 Housing and Community Renewal , grants.25 Often, more than one  application2 
2 is made per apartment building and the  tenants3 find their rents being raised significantly  more4 than once in a year. One of my constituents  has5 had her rent go from $650.00 per month to  $8006 per month in the space of eighteen mont hs.7 The truth is that many of  these8 so-called improvements  are done with poor9 materials,  shoddy  workmanship ,  and are10 overpriced , in my opinion. And while  - -11	(Audience participation. )12 COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT JACKSON:13 - the tenants receive little value, they  pay14 great profits to the  landlords.15 For those of my constituents  who16 do not earn a great deal of money, rent   increases17 often force them to choose between paying  rent18 and buying food. In fact , over 26, 000 New Yorkers19 were evicted from their homes last  year.20 Even for those tenants who  are21 earning a wage that allows them to be self -22 sufficient , they are often paying between thirty-23 five and fifty percent of their disposable  income24 on rent.25 You must consider the  economic12 
  2 downturn that has affected many of our  families3 and the devastating effect of September 11,  2001.4 This Board must be  responsible5 to the citizens of this City. My  constituents6 deserve the best possible quality of  life.7 I urge you to roll back  rents8 but at the very least , do not enact any rent9 increases.10 Thank you very much11 (Audience participation .)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you13 very much.14 We will stand in recess  until15 7:15 when we will take up hotels again.  And16 immediately following we will go to  residential17 apartments.18 (Which were all the proceedings19 at the Second Session of the Public  Hearing,20 which concluded at 6:04 o'clock p.m. ) 2122	*	*	*232425

2	P R O C E E D I N G  S34 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Good evening.5 My name is Marvin Markus . I 'm6 Chairman of the Rent Guidelines Board and I  would7 like to call this evening session into session  of8 our public  hearing .9 As indicated on the public10 not ice, we will be talking about our hotel11 tenants, and then we go immediately  to12 residential and loft tenants .13 There are four scheduled  for14 hotel tenants.15 The first speaker is Mildred16 Ortega, followed by Alex Schafran, followed  by17 Kathleen Lyons and Adam  Weinstein.18 MS . VISSER :	Please state your19 name.20 MS . MILDRED ORTEGA :	My name is21 Mildred Ortega. I live at 258 West 97th  Street.22 VOICES:	We can't hear .23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Go ahead.24 MS . MILDRED ORTEGA :	Can you put25 the time back? That 's not fair .6 
1	3952 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Let 's go.3 MS. MILDRED ORTEGA :	Okay . My4 name is Mildred Ortega. I live in 258 West  97th5 Street .6	The owner of my building is7 owner of the best hotel in the City .8 The landlord made contract with9 the City because they know the City have  drug10 dealers, criminal people on the payroll . They use11 them to harass to us .12 We complained to the community .13 We went to the West Side Law Project . They told14 us those people have right to live with us .15 Fine. At Christmastime I16 organized them, no matter what , they are17 criminal , no matter what , they are drug   dealers,18 drug abusers. They have a right to live in  our19 home and get the legal rent . No more waiting the20 days . He wants the drug dealers permanent .21 And we won. We keep the22 permanent	tenants . And it was a lot of peopl e,23 and people fighting all night . We don' t know24 what 's going on . And one of the people coming25 from Hasa	(phonetic) is a good one .7 
2 One of the bad ones and he  stole3 everything. They say that 's not - - I  went4 downstairs. I talk to the security . We need5 security in here .6	And t he guy told me t h i s is no7	(unintelligible) family.8	And the other people help  us,9 the people in the off ice and they are working10 with us now. They are trying to make sure  our11	building is safe for tenants who live in there12 for long time and for people from Hasa . They are13 beautiful people. Unfortunately we get  thirty-14 two people permanent at Christmastime. One  of15 them use drug and doing heroin, they couldn' t16 survive in the building .17 And we are trying to make  sure18 that those  - -  those people no have place  to cook.19 They have  a community bathroom.  They don' t have  -20 - the tenants and the people from the City  they21 have to keep their bathroom by  themselves.22 When you go in the morning  eight23 o'clock, you can find blood, needles for  heroin,24 crap . That ' s what we get over there.25 And this landlord, as I  say,12 
1	3972 increase the rent. If we this time to  organize3 make sure the tenants from the City have  rights4 and we have to prot ect them because they need our5 help more than ever. They are beautiful  people.6 Thank you.7 (Audience participat ion.)8 MS. VISSER:	The next speaker9 is Alex Schafran, followed by Kathleen Lyons  and10 Adam Weinstein .11	MS. ALEX SCHAFRAN:	Good12 evening, Members of the  Board.13 My name is Alex Schafran and  I'm14 an organizer and advocate for the West Side  SRO15 Law Project.16 To start off , I would like to17 comment on a conversation that I had  yesterday18 with Chairman Markus where he expressed  his19 frustration at the Board' s lack of power to20 really effect positive change and the  terrible21 affordable housing crisis that we have here  in22 New York City.23 So to begin I would like  to24 humbly ask the Board to perhaps pass a   resolution25 urging Governor Pataki and Mayor  Michael12 
2 Bloomberg to signif icantly increase funding for3 affordable housing in New York  City.4 (Audience participation. )5	MR. ALEX SCHAFRAN :	It would6 simply be - -7 (Audience participation. )8	MR. ALEX SCHAFRAN:	- -   a9 recommendation from the Board, but a  positive10 signal that something outside of this  room11	desperately needs to be done or else we will just12 be talking and we will just be arguing  about13 small points.14 But I digress.15 We've heard an awful lot of16 numbers here this evening and earlier  this17 morning, and there is one number that hasn' t been18 talked about. Let 's say all things are equal,19 which I clearly don't think that they are,  but20 let 's just say that they are .21 Is the Board going to consider22 the interests of a handful of SRO landlords  over23 the interests of tens of thousands of some of  New24 York' s poorest residents?25 It 's simply a matter of numbers.12 
1	3992 Many of the owners of SRO buildings don' t even3 live in the City . All of the SRO residents4 clearly do . These are people who have lived long5 lives here. Many of them contributed a lot to  the6 City over the years.7 And my question to the Rent8 Guidelines Board is are you going to deny  their9 contribution. It 's simply a matter of numbers.10 The State of New York gives the11 Rent Guidelines Board the duty to act in the  best12 interests of the City of New York and of  the13 people of New York. And if they're simply  looking14 at numbers, who is this decision going to  affect15 more?16 It 's clear that the numbers lie17 in the interests of the tenants. So if  you18 determine that all things are equal , which they19 are not , it is clear that you have to vote for no20 increase knowing this.21 And it 's clear that even if you22 vote for no increase, that you must maintain  the23 provision as a signal to future boards which  it24 must do.25 Thank you.2
