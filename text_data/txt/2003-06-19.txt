23	P R O C E E D I N G  S45	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	My name is6 Marvin Markus. I 'm Chairman of the New York City7 Rent Guidelines Board.8 We are here to make the  final9 decision. This decision is part of a  process10 which began about two months ago where we held  a11 series of public meetings and public  hearings12 where we received a great deal of reports,  a13 great deal of testimony, both two days ago  public14 testimony, and also we received many  written15 much written test imony on various subjects.16 And what we are going to do  is,17 because I think most people in the audience  know,18 we did adopt a guideline, a  preliminary19 guideline. I will read it for the record to  make20 sure that everybody is clear as to what we  are21 going for.22 And then in order of what we  are23 going to be discussing, we will be dealing  with24 rent stabilized apartments first , then the lost25 guidelines and the so-called special  guideline,
2 and then the rent stabilized  hotels.3 Let me read the rent  stabilized4 apartment guideline.5 11   Proposed  Renewal  Adjustments6 for Apartments.7 " Together with  such further8 adjustments as may be authorized by law,  the9 annual adjustment  for renewal leases for10 apartments shall be:11 " For a one -year renewal lease12 commencing on or after October 1, 2003 and on  or13 before September 3 0, 2004, 5 1/2 percent ;14 11  For a two-year renewal lease15 commencing on or after October 1, 2003 and on  or16 before September 30, 2004, 8 1/2  percent.17 " These  two adjustments shall18 also apply to dwelling units in a  structure19 subject to the partial tax exemption  program20 under Section 421a of the Real Property Tax  Law,21 or in a structure subject to Section 423 of  the22 Real Property Tax Law as a Redevelopment  Project.23 11   Proposed Vacancy Allowance	for24 Apart ments ."25 The current proposal is:
2"No vacancy allowance is3permittedexcept as provided by sections 19  and420 of theRent Regulation Reform Act of 1997. "5Let the record reflect that  to 6 the extent that there is an extension in the  near7 term of , well , of the rent law, the Board will be8 voting to amend the words, if the law is  changed,9 to be of 2003 so that there is no quest ion that10 we have the legal authority to pass, either of 11	1997 or of 2003 .12 " Proposed Supplemental13 Adjustment14 "There shall be no supplemental15 adjustment for apartments rent ing below any16 specif ied amount for renewal leases .17 " There  shall be  no equalization18 allowance  for apartments continuously occupied19 for a specif ied period of time for renewal20 leases.21 " Proposed  Addit ional Adjustments22 for Rent Stabilized Apartments	Sublet Under23 Section 2525.6 of the Rent Stabilization   Code24 " In the event of a sublease25 governed by subdivision	(e) of section 2525.6 of
2 the Rent Stabilization Code, the  allowance3 authorized by such subdivision shall be  O4 percent.5 " Proposed  Adjustment s for Lofts6	(Units in the Category of Buildings  Covered by7 Article  7-C of the Multiple Dwelling Law)8 "The Rent Guidelines Board9 proposes the following levels of rent  increase10 above the	'base rent , ' as defined in Section 286 ,11 subdivision 4, of the Multiple Dwelling Law,  for12 units to which these guidelines are applicable   in13 accordance with Article 7- C of the Multiple14 Dwelling Law:15 " For one-year  increase periods16 commencing on or after October 1, 2003 and on  or17 before September 3 0, 2004, 4 percent ;18 " For two-year  increase periods19 commencing on or after October 1, 2003 and on  or20 before September 30, 2004, 7  percent.21 "Vacant Loft Units22 "No Vacancy Allowance is23 permitted under this Order. Therefore, except   as24 otherwise provided  in Section 286, subdivision  6,25 of the Multiple Dwelling Law, the rent charged   toROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 any tenant for a vacancy tenancy commencing on  or3 after October 1, 2003 and on or before  September4 30, 2004 may  not exceed the	'base rent '5 referenced above plus the level of  adjustment6 permitted  above for increase periods.7 " Fractional Terms8 " For the purposes  of these9 guidelines any lease or tenancy for a period  up10 to and including one year shall be deemed a  one-11 year lease or tenancy, and any lease or tenancy12 for a period of over one year and up to  and13 including two years shall be deemed a  two-year14 lease or tenancy.15 "Escalator Clauses16 "Where a lease for a dwelling17 unit in effect on May 31, 1968 or where a   lease18 in effect on June 3 0, 1974 for a dwelling unit19 which became subject to the Rent  Stabilization20 Law of 1969, by virtue of the Emergency  Tenant21 Protection Act of 1974 and Resolution Number   27622 of the New York City Council , contained an23 escalator clause for the increased costs  of24 operation and such clause is still in effect , the25 lawful rent on September 30, 2003 over which  the
2 fair rent under this Order is computed  shall3 include the increased rental , if any, due under4 such clause except those charges which  accrued5 within one year of the commencement of  the6 renewal lease. Moreover, where a lease  contained7 an escalator clause that the owner may  validly8 renew under the Code, unless the owner elects  or9 has elected in writing to delete such  clause,10 eff ective no later than October 1, 2003 from the11 existing lease and all subsequent leases for  such12 dwelling unit , the increased rental , if any,   due13 under such escalator clause shall be  offset14 against the amount of increase authorized  under15 this Order.16 " Special  Adjustments  Under Prior17 Orders18 "All rent adjustments lawfully19 implemented and maintained under  previous20 apartment orders and included in the base rent  in21 effect on September 30 , 2003 shall continue to be22 included in the base rent for the purpose  of23 computing subsequent rents adjusted pursuant  to24 this Order.25 " Proposed  Special Guideline
1	92	"Under Section 26- 513 (b)(1) of3 the New York City Administrative	Code, and4 Sect ion 9(e) of the Emergency Tenant Protection5 Act of 1974, the Rent Guidelines Board  is6 obl igated to promulgate  special guidelines to aid7 the State Division of Housing and  Community8 Renewal in its determination of init ial legal9 regulated rents for housing  accommodations10 previously subject to the City Rent  and11 Rehabilitation Law which are the subject of  a12 tenant  application  for adjustment. "13 See, that 's my plan, to bore14 everybody so that the cameras go  away.15 " The Rent  Guidelines Board16 hereby proposes the following Special  Guidelines:17 " For dwelling units  subject to18 the Rent and Rehabilitation Law on September 3 0,19 2003 , which became vacant after September 30,20 2003 , the  special guideline  shall be  the greater21 of :22 " 50% above  the maximum  base rent23 as it existed or would have existed , or24 " The Fair Market  Rent for25 existing housing as established by the  UnitedROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175

Part7 888, with such Fair Market Rents to be  adjusted8 based upon whether the tenant pays his or her  own9 gas and/or electric charges as part of his or  her10 rent as such gas and/or electric charges  are11 accounted for by the New York City  Housing12 Authority.13 " Such HUD- determined Fair Market14 Rents will be published	in the Federal Register,15 to take effect on October 1, 2003 .16 "Decontrolled Units17 "The permissible increase for18 decontrolled units as referenced in Order  3a19 which become decontrolled after September 3 0,20 2003 , shall be the greater of :21 " 50% above  the maximum base rent22 as it existed or would have existed , or23 "The Fair Market Rent . .

The purpose of these guidelines is  to14 implement the public policy set forth in  Findings15 and Declaration of Emergency of the  Rent16 Stabilization Law of 1969	(Section 26- 501 of the17 New York City Administrat ive Code) and in the18 Legislative Finding contained in the  Emergency19 Tenant Protection Act of 1974	(Chapter 576 of the20 Laws of 1974, Section 4, Subsect ion 2).21 "The Rent Guidelines Board is22 also authorized to promulgate rent guidelines   for23 loft units subject to Section 286 subdivision   724 of the Multiple Dwelling Law. The purpose of  the25 loft guidelines is to implement the public  policy
1	122	set forth in the Legislative Findings of  Article3	7- C of the Multiple Dwell ing Law	(Section 280) II4 The process from hereon in  on5 everything but the hotel where I will read  the6 hotel stabilized guideline before we discuss it ,7 will be to offer amendments, if any, to  the8 proposed guideline. We will vote on  those9 amendments either up or down and then take a  vote10 on the rent stabilized apartment guideline  and11 then the loft guideline and the  special12 guideline.13 So with that I'd be happy to14 open the floor to - - well , let me take a   motion15 on adopting this now and then amendments will  be16 in order so that we have before us something  that17 we can adopt.18 I'll take a motion on the19 existing draft guidelines. That does not  commit20 anybody to vote for it ult imately.21 I'll make the motion.22 Seconded?23 MS. LUSSKIN:	Second.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any25 objection?

PAGAN:	Before I make a10 motion  - - my name is David Pagan. I'm the   tenant11 rep.12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. HOLDER:	And I'm Adriene14 Holder and I'm also a tenant representative  on15 the Rent Guidel ines Board.16 (Audience participation.)17 MR. PAGAN:	Mr. Chairman,18 Fellow Board Members, Tenants and  Owners:19 I see around me a group of20 members that were chosen because they are  smart21 and understand the housing industry in the  City22 of New York.23 On May 5, 2003 , we passed what  I24 consider to one of the largest  preliminary25 increases set by the Board in recent history,  at
1	14 2 least not during my tenure.3 Tonight we either rectify that4 original error or we can make a lame excuse as  to5 the why' s of the increase.6 Terrorism is an act against  a7 group of people or humanity that has an effect  on8 those victimized that could lead to mental  or9 physical destruction, similar to what  we10 witnessed on September 11,  2001.11 A better example is the12 preliminary vote that we held on May 5th, that  if13 enacted would have the same effect on  thousands14 as the destruction of the World Trade Center had 15	on 9/11.16 Maybe I'm being harsh, but  the17 tenants that are in jeopardy of losing  their18 homes can't distinguish between violent or  non-19 violent acts of terrorism. It has the  same20 ef fect , put a scare on the victims with possible21 cost of homes, life and the quality of  their22 l ives .23 Today we can make restitution.24 We are here today to ratify  the25 decision of May 5, 2003 . Let us rethink that act
2 by sharing the pain of the increases between   the3 tenants and owners based on their ability to  pay.4 Let us not continue to  have5 regressive forms of taxation that hit the  least6 able to pay at a higher rate, like the poor  tax7 or the senior citizen tax.8 Let us not ratify that  mistake.9 We are not asking that  the10 owners carry the total burden, but we are  asking11 that the burden be shared, not passed from  one12 group, owners, to the other group , tenants.13 Aft er many years of rent14 increases larger than were called for, I  believe15 this time we could make up for the  past16 overcharges.17 History tells us that the18 largest transfer of wealth was perpetrat ed by us19 through rent increases to  tenants.20 I don' t believe that the tenants21 are better off economically than the  building22 owners, and I don' t believe that you believe that23 either.24 When the night is over,  we25 should go home with a clear conscience that  tellsROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 us that we did the right thing - not because  I'm3 sitting on the right side - without having  second4 thoughts and questioning our  decisions.5 Do you want to be remembered  for6 having taken part in a dubious historic  increase?7 Is that how you want to be8 remembered?9 Your reward tonight should be10 the satisfaction of knowing that what you  are11 about to pass is fair.12 Your conscience will not be13 relieved if what we pass tonight is equal  or14 higher than the increase that was approved on  May15 5th.16 I don't believe that owners are17 going to abandon their buildings. After all , they18 have realized a phenomenal	increase in wealth by19 having these propert ies, not to mention net20 incomes.21 If they have not , then why do  I22 keep getting calls from unknown people trying  to23 buy this type of buildings with worse  incomes24 from the organization that I am  employed.25 As we look to our symbol of2 
2 liberty standing at the gates of this  great3 metropolis, we need to remember that we, in  the4 panel , and the owners are better off because we5 are luckier not because we are smarter or  harder6at work thanthe people that are homeless.7I move that we adopt :8A one percent  for one-year;9Two percent  for two years;10No poor tax;11(Audience participation. )12MR. PAGAN:	And no senior13citizen tax.14Thank you .15(Audience participation.)16CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No what?17MR. PAGAN:	Let me repeat the18last part .19I move that we adopt:20A one percent  for one year;21Two percent  for two years;22No poor tax;23And no senior citizen tax .24(Audience participation.)25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Just so we
2	are clear .3	The current adjustment for,  I4	don' t know what we call it exactly, but the5	additional adjustment that you are saying , you6 are saying  - - basically  you're not making an7 amendment . The only amendment you are making is8 to the 5 1/2 and the 8 1/2 to make those 1 and 2.9 Because the existing guideline10 says no supplemental adjustment and  no11 equalizat ion.12 MR. PAGAN:	Correct.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank14 you.15 Second?16 MS. HOLDER:	I second that17 motion.18 (Audience part icipation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any debate?20 (No response.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I 'll call the22 roll .23 Ms. Adams?24 MS.

2FellowBoardMembers, and particularly my  new3FellowBoardMembers:4In the last several weeks we5 have been thoroughly schooled in this  rent6 guidelines process. We've been furnished with  a7 mountain of reports. We listened to  expert8 testimony and you heard thirteen hours  of9 testimony from tenants and owners this  past10 Tuesday.11 There has been one real12 difference this year. Believe me, after  eighteen13 years the woeful stories by owners and  tenants14 had the same emotional level of despair  that15 they've had in prior years.16 The noteworthy difference in  the17 eighteen years that I've been sitting here  was18 the presence of more owners than I had ever  seen19 before . And that was because of the magnitude of20 the numbers, not the extent  of unemployment	or21 poverty. That was a lot worse in  the early	'90s22 and in the early	'80s when unemployment was23 approximately eleven percent  in 1982.24 But they were here because of25 the incredibly huge and unparalleled increase  in
2 real estate taxes, the largest increase ever,  as3 well as incredible increases in the cost  for4 insurance, fuel costs and the  continued5 escalation of water charges. And it 's clear that6 those increases will continue into next  year.7	This is the first year in my8 memory where we've been giving heat in  May.9 (Audience participation. )10 MR. LUBELL:	This evening11 (Audience participation. )12 MR . LUBELL:	This evening when13 we' re on the verge - -14 (Audience participation. )15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.16 MR. LUBELL:	when we' re on17 the verge of making a choice , you must first ask18 yourself whether the ownership of rent  stabilized19 housing is supposed to be a charitable  pursuit.20 (Audience participation.)21 MR. LUBELL:	And do you really22 believe that if a tenant is poor and can't  afford23 to pay  rent , or if  someone is unemployed	- and24 those are sad events - that the owner of  the25 building in which the tenant lives, as opposed  to
2 any other person, group or entity, is the  tooth3 fairy and must subsidize that tenant 's rent?4 (Audience participation.)5	MR. LUBELL:	Can you really6 believe that some owners should skimp  on7 repairs - some owners would skimp on repairs or8 not pay for real estate taxes, insurance, fuel   or9 labor,10 (Audience participation.)11	MR. LUBELL:	I'm also going to12 ask my tenant13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet. We' re14 going to set a record this  year.15 MR. LUBELL:	I'm also going to16 ask my tenant colleagues to make an effort  to17 control their constituents and I'll do the   same18 with my constituents.19 (Audience participation.)20 MR. LUBELL:	Can you really21 believe that some owners should skimp on  repairs22 or not pay for real estate taxes, insurance,  fuel23 or labor because they can't afford  it?24 They' ll get out of the business25 and you won' t have any housing.
1232(Audience participation.)3MR. LUBELL:	They have no4choice- -5(Audience participation. )6CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sir, quiet7down.8MR. LUBELL:	They have no9choiceorthey'll lose their buildings.10If you don't pay your taxes,  on11 the day after you don' t pay your taxes the date12 that they were due, interest is due at the  rate13 of eighteen percent per  annum.14 Clearly some tenants can't15 afford to pay any increase and , indeed it 's   clear16 that many tenants can't afford to pay the  rent17 they are now paying.18 But on the other hand , there are19 large numbers of tenants that can afford to  pay20 an increase.21 We all know that the median  rent22 income ratio is approximately twenty- eight23percent ,which is well below the  national24standardof thirty percent.25(Audience part icipation.)
1	242 MR. LUBELL:	Now, for years3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet .4 MR. LUBELL:	for years I5 have been hearing the now absurd chant to   owners6 to open their books  - -7 (Audience participation.)8	MR. LUBELL:	- - notwithstanding9 that Income and Expense Statements are  required10 by the New York City Department of  Finance.11	And, indeed, we Members of the12 Board open up our books with annual  financial13 statements as well.14 But if we require Income  and15 Expense Statements from tenants, I'm certain  that16 we would discover that large numbers of them   are17 not poor. I'm not saying that there aren't  poor18 people, but large numbers of tenants are not   poor19 - that 's a fact - well over ninety percent  of   the20 people in the City of New York and many  are21 employed.22 (Audience participation.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.24 MR. LUBELL:	Many tenants are25 wealthier than many of the owners that you saw  -ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
23 (Audience participation.)4 MR. LUBELL :	- - here on5 Tuesday.6 (Audience participation .)7 MR . LUBELL :	But perhaps8 (Audience participation.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sir, you have10 to sit down and you have to stay down.  You11 understand what I mean, sir? Stay down .12 MR . LUBELL:	But , perhaps,13 unfortunately, and I repeat unfortunately,  rents14 were never intended to be established based  on15 the tenant 's ability to pay . That 's unfortunate16 because none of us would probably be here if  that17 were the case.18 (Audience participation .)19 MR. LUBELL:	Doesn' t it seem20 odd to you, and I'm addressing the Members of  the21 Board,  that even public  utilities  - electric ,22 cable TV, telephone companies - are entitled  to23 increases to meet increased  costs?24 (Audience participation.)25 MR . LUBELL:	They are not
2 denied increases because a segment of  the3 affected population is poor or  unemployed.4 No other industry providing5 products or services is asked to reduce  prices.6 No other industry is asked  to7 reduce prices because their consumers  have8 difficulty paying  for them.9 To many ill people drugs are  as10 important  as housing. Yet Lipitor,  Priloset ,11 aspirin and every other drug costs the same  for12 everybody whether you can afford it or  not.13 (Audience participat ion.)14 MR. LUBELL:	It ' s in everyone' s15 best  - - it 's in everyone' s best interest to16 realize , everyone' s best  interest , that when17 someone buys or invests in rent  stabilized18 property, it doesn' t make a difference whether19 that person is rich or of modest means.  They20 should be able to anticipate that the  Rent21 Guidelines Board will grant responsible  increases22 that are commensurate with increased  costs.23 (Audience part icipation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.25 MR . LUBELL:	An investment in
2 real stabilized property should not be reduced  to3 a charitable contribution.4 (Audience participat ion.)5	MR. LUBELL:	And especially  6 and especially a contribution to those  middle7 class and upper middle class and wealthy  tenants8 that don' t need anything.9 If we turn the investment of10 rent stabilized housing into a charity, if  we11 help make that a reality, than this whole  sector12 of housing will go down the  tubes.13 (Audience participat ion.)14 MR. LUBELL:	Hopefully the law15 was not designed for us to contribute to  the16 creation of slums and abandoned buildings that  we17 have in New York.18 (Audience participation.)19 MR. LUBELL:	Let me address an20 issue of real concern, of real concern  for21 tenants as well as owners.22 For those that can't afford to23 pay any rent , and we are all sympathetic  to 24	them - -25	(Audience participation. )ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 MR. LUBELL:	- - for any3 increases 1	for any increases in rent 1   because4 they are poor or unemployed 1	that is a burden to5 be shared by building owners 1	all other tenants 16 co-op and condo owners and everybody else.  Every7 single taxpayer has a responsibility to  help8 those who can't afford it.9 (Audience participation. )10 MR. LUBELL:	It should not be11 the exclusive burden of 2 6 1   0 0 0    owners. That 's12 patently unfair.13 (Audience participation.)14 MR . LUBELL:	Finally 1	let 's not15 forget - - let 's not forget that somehow there   are16 also levelling market  forces that help many poor17 tenants 1	not all of them 1	but many of them.18 For example 1	ten percent of all19 rents are preferential rents. That 's20 approximately 1001  000 apartments.21 And let us also bear in  mind22 that in the past when there have been  reasonable23 and even large increases 1	and there have been24 many years that there have been large increases  -25 for example 1	6 and 9 percent in 1986 1	1988 1	1989 1ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES 1  INC.521 Fifth Avenue 1       New York1        New York 10175

LUBELL:	That argument is7 pure poppycock.8 (Audience participat ion.)9 MR. LUBELL:	My Fellow Board10 Members, you have a choice this evening. You  can11 be rational and take a step to preserve  housing12 in New York City, or you can promote obsolescence13 and abandonment.14 I don't want to ever again  see15 rows of abandoned buildings with cutout  posters16 of flower pots in windows as I did in the  1970s.17 (Audience participation.)18 MR. LUBELL:	I don' t want to19 see burned - out buildings because the owner' s20 value was a burned - out building for the insurance21 proceeds.22 I don't want to see that again.23 (Audience part icipat ion.)24 MR. LUBELL:	Don't contribute25 to it. Vote for a reasonable increase based  on

SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chairman,13 Fellow Board Members:14 Thank you for this  opportunity15 to serve our community.16 Tenants and landlords,17 (Audience participation. )18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Tenants and19 landlords, thank you for your patience during20 this process.21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	We've heard23 testimony, compelling testimony,  from both  sides24 of the aisle. We've had letters,  compelling25 letters,  from bot h landlords and tenants .
2 We've heard compelling  positions3 outlining the unfortunat e consequences of current4 economic times and the pot ential impact on rental5 housing stock.6	It is clear, Mr. Chairman, it 's7 clear that high double- digit rental increases  for8 consecutive years are necessary  to properly make9 up for the - -10 (Audience participation.)11 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - burden that12 the small , middle  and large landlords  have13 suffered - -14 (Audience part icipation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.16 (Audience part icipation.)17 MR. LUBELL:	- - suffered  in the18 light of actual rising property tax costs,  actual19 rising, horrificly  rising insurance costs,  fuel20 costs, with fuel oil still above $30.00 a barrel ,21 rising wat er and sewer costs and labor costs.22 And, yes, small landlords  as23 well  as large landlords  employ - -24 (Audience participation.)25 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - employ New
2 York City residents. And in rent  stabilized3 properties those employed positions need to  be4 maintained.5 Landlords are doing their  jobs.6 They are keeping their people  employed.7 (Audience participat ion.)8	MR. SCHLEIDER:	However, in the9 spirit of the moment we propose a tempered  rate10 of increase and we move that the  following11 guidelines be permitted.12 We are calling for a 9 percent13 increase for one year;14 (Audience participation.)15 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - 12 percent16 for two- year.17 Nine percent and twelve percent.18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there any20 more to the motion in terms of any other parts  of21 the guideline?22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chairman?23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, Mr.24 Schleider.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The historical
1	332 precedent	for this type of rent increase is  well3 founded.4	During the	'70s and during the5 worst economic times we had double - digit one-6 year increases, double- digit two-year increases.7 During the	'80s we had double - digit one-year8 increases, double- digit two-year increases during9 the times, economic hard times that were  worse,10 far worse than what we are experiencing  today.11 There are no further changes  to12 what is being presented tonight :13 One year at nine percent ;14 Two-year,  twelve percent.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.16 Is there a second on that?17 MR.

2	(Audience participation .)3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder4	has a motion.5	MS. HOLDER:	Chair, my Fellow6 Board Members, and most importantly, New  York7 City:8	I think it 's ironic that today9 we' re here on a day we are expecting some kind of10 word from Albany as to whether we're going  to11 have a renewal of the rent laws at all beside  the12 fact that we wanted strengthening amendments  too.13 I think what 's ironic in most14 about all of these things is that , as we talk15 about these issues of affordabil ity and we talk16 about increases or rollbacks, what seems  to17 resonate from the owners' perspective  and what18 they have willingly shared with us is  their19 contempt for rent protections and their  contempt20 for New York City and the kind of housing  market21 that we live in.22 (Audience participation .)23 MS. HOLDER:	We all understand24 that there have been increases. We all  understand25 that New Yorkers are being asked to bail out  thisROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175
2	wonderful City that we live  in.3	But what I think is interest ing4 is that behind it all landlords are now  saying5 they are hurting, which means to me and I  think6 most of you that what we are really  concerned7 about is they are seeing a decrease in the  amount8 of profits they are making . But they're still9 making profits.10 (Audi nce participation .)11	MS . HOLDER:	What they want for12 us to do is to give increases that not  only13 maintains their prof it margin, but also increases14 that help move their units closer  to15 deregulation. That 's what they want to do .16 (Audience participation.)17 MS. HOLDER:	It 's interesting18 to me that businessmen and smart owners and  their19 representatives will look at me and say, and  you20 said this a number of times, what are you  all21 doing for low- income and moderate- income New22 Yorkers. And I tell you t ime and t ime again we23 are doing as much as we can to make things  better24 for the citizens of New York  City.25 The Legal Aid Social , legalROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 services and the tenant organizations - some  of3 them right now in Albany - are doing everyt hing4 that they can with no support from you  all.5 (Audience participation. )6	MS. HOLDER:	We are doing what7 we can to expand SCRIE. We testif ied last week8 about the horrible block grant in Section 8  and9 we are not getting any help on it and we' re10 trying.11 And so what I want to know  is12 what are you doing to make it easier for  the13 landlords that you trot out year after year  who14 are the poorest  suffering landlords.15 (Audience participation.)16 MS. HOLDER:	You' re going to17 tell me that for them to be able to get some  kind18 of hardship increase is difficult and  the19paperworkis complicated.20I saw Joe Strasburg up in Albany21last weekwith his fat cigar. What is he doing  to22make thatprocess easier for - -23(Audience participation.)24MS. HOLDER:	- - the poor25landlord?For all these numbers of members  that
  2 RSA has, for all of their sophisticated  lobbying3 arm, for all the money and membership fees  that4 they have, all they can do is try to get rid  of5 rent regulation? Why don't they build  themselves6 out of it .7 We would not be in the state  of8 emergency if we did not have a lower than  five9 percent  increase - - vacancy  rate. We have a  2.910 percent vacancy rate here in New York City.  Why11 don' t you build 40,000 to 50,000 units that would12 take you out of it? Why hasn' t that happened?13 That would be an effective way to do  it?14 But the irresponsibility that  we15 have coming from the landlord' s lobby, coming16 from their representatives,  and even from some of17 the editorial pages of some of the most respect ed18 papers in this City, that we need to get rid  of19 rent regulation because developers will come  in20 and will save New York and save moderate and  low-21 income renters .22 It is, as my colleague  said , the23 arguments are poppycock. I want to see  the24 developers who are going to develop housing for  25	folks who make $30,000, $40,000 and $50 , 000 a
2 year, those households	- -3 (Audience participation. )4 MS. HOLDER:	- - that make 5	$3 0 , 000, $40 , 000 and $50,000 a year.6 (Audience participation.)7 MS. HOLDER:	Where are they?8 (Audience participation.)9 MS. HOLDER:	We see what 's10 happening  in Boston. Please, please.11 We see what ' s happening in12 Boston. David Chin from The New York  Times13 wrote  - - and he went up there and he wrote   an14 article in the Sunday paper. We all saw it.  That15 has failed. Peregulation in Boston is  failing16 Boston residents. Moderate and low- income17 residents have been pushed out and displaced ,18 homelessness is at an all - time high. And what19 development has come there? Luxury  housing20 development .21 (Audience participation.)22 MS. HOLDER:	Is that what we23 want for New York?24 (Audience participation.)25 MS. HOLDER:	Is that what we' re6 
2	supposed to have here in this  City?3 (Audience participation.)4 MS. HOLDER:	Millionaire5	housing  for millionaires.6	So I would like to issue  a7 challenge. I would like to issue a challenge.  I'd8 like for the RSA to show me the developers  that9 are willing to build this housing. I want  to10 shake their hand.11 (Audience participation.)12 MR.

HOLDER:	And I want to meet19 them and I want them to build the 40,000  and20 60 , 000 and 100,000 units that we need in this21 City, affordable units,  for households making22	$30,000, $40 , 000 and $50,000. Let' s see them. I'm23 tired of the rhetoric.24 (Audience participation .)25 MS. HOLDER:	New housing isn't
2 subject to rent regulation.3 (Audience part icipation.)4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do we have a5	motion? Do you have a motion?6	MS. HOLDER:	Yes, I do have a7	motion.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. You' re9 leading up to a motion.  That 's all I 'm hoping10 for.11 MS. HOLDER:	Okay.12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. HOLDER:	Property ownership14 in New York City is big business and they' re15 making record profits. It 's not a charitable16 enterprise. They buy buildings at a  discount.17 They know that. The rent rolls are collected  when18 they go to the lending institutions to get  those19 mortgages.  They know what they're capable of20 making off of those buildings.21 I don't know why we have to22 cont inue to subsidize their way of life and their23 prof it. It 's preposterous.24 (Audience participat ion.)25 MS. HOLDER:	New Yorkers need a
1	422 break. On top of all the increases - SUNY, all   of3 the increases, all of them being compounded,   the4 mistakes that this Board has made in the past  and5 has allowed to remain being compounded on  the6 backs of New Yorkers, we need some  relief.7	But at the same time we know8	what this is really all  about.9I would like to make a mot ion,10Chair, for:11One- year increases of two12percent ;13And for two-year leases,  three14percent.15(Audience participation.)16CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any other17MR.

Mr. Schleider, on the motion for a  two17 and three. Mr. Schleider.18 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chairman,1920 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, sir.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	the tenant22 reps have constantly put forth that we need  more23 affordable housing. So has the  landlord.24 (Audience participation. )25 MR . SCHLEIDER:	If you come toROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.
  2 the public meet ings, you know that I say that the3 City needs more affordable housing,  more4 moderat e- income housing. It 's the truth. I've5 said it .6 I don' t understand the fuzzy7 math that Ms. Holder perpetrates . It 's simple8 arithmetic . If it takes $250 to $300 a square9 foot just to build an eight hundred square  foot10 apartment , you need an income to support the rent11 just because of the debt service on that ,12 (Audience participation .)13 MR . SCHLEIDER:	without14 maintaining	it on an ongoing basis, without15 repairs, without any of the other  expenses16 (Audience participation .)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.18 MR . SCHLEIDER:	You need to19 have a rent in excess of $1300 a month, which   is20 well above your income level , that you said  21	$3 0 , 000 , $40 ,000 and $50 ,000 .22 So it 's not a challenge to the23 landlords. The challenge is to the math. You  need24 subsidies to create affordable housing in  New25 York City. You just can't put it onto  landlords .ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.
1	462 You just can ' t say, developers,  come in, where3 are you. It 's the math. It 's simple .4 (Audience part icipation .)5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Call the6	question. All right?7 Any more debate?8 MS. HOLDER:	Yes.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead .10	Adriene, go ahead .11	MS. HOLDER :	I think it 's12 interesting, and I 'm glad that Steven agrees with13 me that it actually is the cost of  development.14 And as Michael Shields, who has actually  appeared15 before this Board in the past , has also written,16 it 's also about zoning.17 And I'm glad that you say that .18 And so, again, because we  have19 those issues around our neck when we are  talking20 about the development of housing, that is all  the21 more reason why it is going to take more  than22 just saying , I agree, that folks can come in. Of23 course it 's going to take more than that .24 But I don't see where you all25 are assist ing in that lift , to try to get that  i nROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC .521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
1	472 here. We are trying to get the subsidies in  here.3 What are you going to do to try and help us  do4 that? That 's all I'm trying to make the point5 about.6 (Audience participat ion. )7 MS. HOLDER:	I understand that8 there' s a bunch of landlords that Mr. Lubell9 asserts, ten percent maybe that are  giving10 preferent ial rents. What I think is interesting11 is that they take every increase that we can  give12 them and they try to pass it off on  their13 tenants. And those that they can't pass on  to14 their tenants, they sure do raise the base  rent.15 Why? Because it 's all about moving those16 apartments out of rent regulation which, by  the17 way, is more than about  affordability.18 That 's one of the major things.19 It 's about - - it 's also about rent protect ion to20 allow folks to understand that they can speak  out21 and not feel that at the end of the lease  term22 they can be asked to get out. They can try  to23 organize a tenant association and not think  that24 they are going to be out on the street at the  end25 of their tenure on the lease.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 And I'm glad that you agree  that3 the development costs are high. We all know  that4 to be the case.5 I'm working real hard to try  to6 make a place for all New Yorkers here so we  can7 relish and be great from our  diversity.8 And I just ask that all of  you9 all join us too and let 's not hide behind the10 ruse of just trying to eliminate rent  regulation11	here in the City.12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Since there14 is no more debate, the motion before the  house15 is:16 For a one-year renewal , two17	percent ;18	For a two-year renewal , three19	percent.20 Calling the roll :21 Ms. Adams?22 MS.

Go16 ahead.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	We've heard a18 lot of testimony19 (Audience participat ion.)20 MR. LUBELL:	- - part icularly by21 - - we heard  testimony  as recently  as Tuesday by a22 large number of owners about that second  year.23 And we've also heard  testimony24 about the fact , not only heard, we have figures25 reflecting how high the core index was this  yearROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC .521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 and how high it is anticipated to be next  year.3 So that if we have that4 inducement for everybody to sign a two- year5 lease, then there is a double penalty to  owners.6	My friendly amendment is  to7 change that second year because having it at  only8 7.5 percent does not make  sense.9	(Audience participation. )10	MR. LUBELL:	I'm not happy with1112 (Audience participation .)13 MR. LUBELL:	I'm not happy with14 4.5 and 7.5 percent.15 (Audience participation.)16 MR.

1	532	Yes, Ms. Holder.3	MS. HOLDER:	On Tuesday we did4 sit at Cooper Union through thirteen hours  of5 testimony from landlords and  tenants.6	And it 's important , Chair and my7 colleagues, fellow members, that we send  a8 message to New York City that we heard you  and9 that we see you, tenants, we see you and we  know10 what you go through.11 To approve these types of12 increases will not help the situation here in  New13 York City. It is not fair to tenants this year  to14 have to shoulder the entire burden of bailing  our15 City out. It is not fair for the owners to  pass16 all of their increased costs on to the backs  of17 tenants on top of all the other increases  that18 they have to sustain.19 So I would ask that the public20 members vote against this mot ion. It doesn' t show21 that we see tenants and we understand  what22 they' re going through.23 (Audience part icipation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any more25 debate on this motion?7 
2	Mr. Zelnik .3 MR . ZELNIK:	Ms. Adams.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Adams, go5	ahead. Sorry.6	MS. ADAMS :	This has been a bad7 year for everybody with all the  increases.8 And one of the things that  has9 become very clear to me being a new public  member10 of this Board is that there is no longer a  safety11 net . There are lots of holes in it .12 And I've been very  frustrated13 throughout the year in that we can't solve all  of14 the problems here. We are very restricted  in15 terms of what this Board can do. So part of  my16 time has been sorting out what we can do, what  we17 can't do, who enforces it and why aren't  they18 enforcing it , and on and on.19 But I want to be very brief  in20 consideration of our Chairman, my sister  and21 fellow Board Members.22 But I want to take this23 opportunity to thank those who have  given24 testimony to this Board . It 's been very helpful25 to us. And it's also been very clear that most  of7 
2 the people giving testimony devoted  considerable3 time and care to preparing that test imony. It was4 not all rhetoric. In fact , there was very little5 rhetoric in it.6 I also want to thank those7 people who testified before  us.8	But it has been a hard  year.9 This is a hard vote. 9/11 is just kind of on  top10 of it all.11 But I find it very  interesting12 that there are members of this Board , all of whom13 I respect because of what they bring to  our14 deliberations, to look at what is really  our15 responsibility and what is someone else' s and16 what  else can we affect .17 So for me we are buying a  year18 which nobody knows the answer to. Are we in  a19 recession or not? Are we coming out of it or  not?20 The economists will tell you whatever you want   to21 hear. And the same thing goes for other  people.22 So one of the things I would23 like to think that with this Chairman and  with24 this Board is that we are trying to tease out  the25 truth and solve some problems.
2 We have a very small part  of3 that larger problem to solve, but we are  trying4 to do a very good job with that part that we  do5 have.6 And  that ' s why I think that your7 motion is a good one , Mr. Chair.8 (Audience participation. )9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Zelnik.10 MR. ZELNIK:	I am a public11 member of this Board and have been serving  now12 for two months.13 I must honestly admit that  I14 have been really educated by both sides of  the15 aisle as they say.16 I have really given serious17 thought and so have all the public members,  in18 fact , all the members of the Board have given19 serious consideration to all the issues that  are20 today facing tenants and building  owners.21 I was trying to in my own mind22 come up with an analogy that would make sense   in23 terms of where I think we  are.24 And I'm thinking back to  199125 when we had what was  called  " The Perfect  Storm. "
2 And I think what we are facing in New York  City3 is really a perfect storm in terms of the  housing4 situation.5 In 1991 when we had this perfect6 storm - I think you all probably remember  what7 happened when there were three converging  weather8 systems that hit off the coast of New  England.9 And those weather systems raised waves a  hundred10 feet tall and winds over a hundred and  hundred11 and fifty miles an hour. I think you know  the12 movie where the ANDREA GAIL never came back  with13 its crew of seven or eight people.14 And somehow I think we' re in15 that situation today where I think, in fact ,16 tenants and property owners are sailing on  that17 ANDREA GAIL. So I want to make sure that they  all18 come back to shore.19 I think this is an extremely20 (Audience part icipation.)21 MR. ZELNIK:	- - extremely22 difficult situation for all of  us.23 And my heart goes out to  both24 tenants  - - and  I will  tell you specifically my25 heart goes out for the small property  owners.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2	(Audience participation.)3 MR. ZELNIK:	I am hoping4 (Audience participation. )5	MR.  ZELNIK:	I am hoping that , 6 if not today, that in the future, Mr.  Chairman,7 the Board can address the plight of the  small8 property owners. And I'm talking even  more9 specif ically about the small property owners that10 live in their building, that own their  own11 building, that manage their own  building.12 I think the small property13 owners need to be looked at more carefully to   see14 if there can be a more equitable solut ion.15 (Audience participation. )16 MR. ZELNIK:	On the other hand, 1718 (Audience participation.)19 MR. ZELNIK:	On the other hand ,20 today I received in the mail a brochure from  a21 fairly well -known real estate firm, Massey22 Knakal , wherein that firm - - excuse me , in  that23 brochure they were, in fact , advertising24 buildings with rent stabilized apartments  that25 they were selling for $300 and $400 and $500  aROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2	square foot.3	And I must tell you that in  the4 advertisements that I saw they were indicat ing5 there' s a big upside to these apartments because6 of the number of existing rent  stabilized7 apartments.8 So what I'm also seeing on  the9 other hand are trends in terms of where  people10 are bidding for properties that are consisting  of11 these apartments, and clearly there is  an12 increase in equity there that one has  to13 consider.14 Having said all this, I just15 would like to say at this point that I think  the16 Chairman' s proposal is fair and reasonable17 (Audience participation.)18 MR. ZELNIK:	- - and should be19 passed.20 I am going to vote for it.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 Let me reiterate the motion23 before the floor and the full - - this is - -   we24 are deal ing with apartment hotels  - - rent25 stabilized apartments.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167

I read it  earlier.15 The motion  - - not a mot ion, the16 amendment that was passed , the guideline that was17 passed, excuse me, last time  was:18 Four percent for a one -year19 lease;20 Seven percent  for a two-year21 lease;22 Vacant loft units, no  vacancy23 allowance on the lofts.24 Do I have a motion?25 The Chair will move that we

HOLDER:	Yes.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.11	MS. HOLDER:	Given the fact12 that these loft apartments pay for  their13 services, I think that increases of four  and14 seven percent are much too high and I would  ask15 that this Board would vote against  that.16 MR. PAGAN:	Mr. Chair?17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, Mr.18 Pagan.19 MR. PAGAN:	Lofts happen to be20 a little different than most of the other  units21 in the sense that most of the expenses are  paid22 by the tenants.23 And to that extent I feel  that24 the 4 and 7 is steep since whatever  additional25 expense that should come outside of the shell  isROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 paid by those tenants . They are responsible for3 maintaining and keeping in good order  those4 buildings .5 Thank you .6 (Audience participat ion.)7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I wasn' t8	listening. I 1  m sorry. Go ahead. Say it again.9	MR . PAGAN:	Mr. Chair,10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, I 1  m11 sorry.12 MR. PAGAN :	- - I feel that the13 4 and 7 is steep for lofts for the reason  that14 loft tenants tend to pay most of the  expenses15 associated with that  space.16 And for that reason I feel  that17 it should be reconsidered.18 And I ask the public members  to19 vote against.20 Thank you.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, Mr.22 Lubell .23 MR. LUBELL:	You know, it 1 s24 very clear to anyone reading the newspapers  that25 this small segment of housing referred to  asROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC .521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 lofts are probably the most costly and the  most3 valuable segment of housing that we have in  New4 York City.5 If you look at the prices of6 these lofts, it 's astronomical. You go to7 Tribeca, it ' s a million dollars for the   smallest8 loft.9 And there still is - - an  owner10 still has to, even though he may not give  the11 same kind of services, he still has to pay  for12 real estate taxes, he still has to pay  for13 insurance. And those are significant  costs.14 But also most of these people15 are paying modest sums for very valuable  space.16 (Audience participation. )17 MR . LUBELL:	And I think the18 four percent and seven percent is really  terribly19 inadequate.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay .21 Take a vote? I don' t hear any22 other debate .23 Ms . Adams?24 MS .

2 Starting with the second3 paragraph,	" For dwelling units subject to the4 Rent and Stabilizat ion Law ..., " as well as on the5 decontrolled units, " The permissi ble increase for6 decontrolled units ... , " under that I'd like to7	replace with under  11    (1) 40% above the maximum8 base  rent " and strike  " as it existed or would9 have existed .. .."10	So I want	11  50% above the maximum11	base rent "12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Forty .13 MS. HOLDER:	" 40% .." I'm sorry14 II	..above the maximum base rent , " and I would15 like to strike paragraph	(2) that refers to the16 Fair Market Rent as established by HUD to  be17 eliminated.18 And so I would like, Chair,  the19 mot ion to be completely replaced by my motion20 which would change it to 40% above the   maximum21 base  rent , period.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And what 's23 the import of changing " as it existed or would24 have existed" in your opinion, whether it be 40%  25	or 50%?ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES , INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2MS. HOLDER:	"As it existed or3would haveexisted " would allow for landlords to4count baserent that they weren' t entitled to5because ofviolat ions in calculating the rent .6And I would like to get rid  of7 the Fair Market Rent as established by  HUD8 because I believe that that is the one  that9 actually gets used more and it is a way in  which10 these apartments jump so high that a fair  market11 rent appeal is summarily dismissed by DHCR.  It12 cannot be investigated or  challenged.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay .14 But help me again. I understand15 the second part .16 Explain to me the MBR system  and17 what number gets changed by taking out " as it18 existed or would have existed. " Give me an19 example, a numerical example, so I can  understand20 what I'm accompl ishing by taking that out .21 MS . HOLDER:	Well , the Maximum22 Base Rent	landlords can always take what  they23 feel they are entitled to in an apartment if  an24 apartment remains in violation. But with  this25 calculation, it would allow them to take  thoseROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 increases and  - -  in terms of calculating what3 these rules are.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	But isn't it5 accurate that the Maximum Base Rent is  a6 calculated number and the owner is not  entitled7 to MCR increases up to the MBR if he  has8 violations?9 But the calculation  - - I 'm10 asking this question  - -  the calculation  remains11 the same. It 's a question of whether or not he' s12 entitled to an increase . So by changing  it ,  the13 " as it existed or would have existed, " - -14 (Audience participation. )15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well , explain16 that to me why it 's not. How does that law work17 that this has a material  change?18 MS. HOLDER:	It has a material19 change because20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead . Go21 ahead. Start again.22 MS. HOLDER:	It has a material23 change in that it then establishes that  the24 landlord can go ahead and has assumed  those25 things would be in place and that would be  theROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 MBR.3 If the Maximum Base Rent as4 distinguished from the Maximum Collect ible Rent ,5 which we would actually prefer, but  I mean  it ' s6 the MBR I'm asking remain.7 A VOICE:	On top of MCI .8 MS. HOLDER:	It would prevent9 the Maximum Base Rent as the basis, and be  able10 to be replaced by one that 's not reliable, or the11	way it ought to be that we base these increases12 off of.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you14 accept an amendment to leave it at 50% and  take15 out the  " as exists or would  have existed " and16 leave the Fair Market  Rent .17 Or do you want to vote on  it18 al 1?19 MS . HOLDER:	No. You said would20 that be a friendly amendment? No it wouldn' t be a21 friendly amendment.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.23 I'm asking whether you would24 accept it. The vote is on your  amendment.25 MS . HOLDER:	40% above theROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC .521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 Maximum Base Rent period, and to eliminate  the3 Fair Market Rent for the proposed  guideline.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I understand.5 Okay.6 Any discussion on that?7	MR. LUBELL:	Yes. I don't8	understand it.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell.10 He doesn' t understand it.11 MR. LUBELL:	I don't under-  - -12 we are trying to provide13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You don't14 understand the substance of it or you  don't15 understand why it 's being offered?16 MR. LUBELL:	No. I don't17 understand how it would function because we  are18 trying to offer some guide or guidance to  DHCR19 and this is only one method of computation,  one20 method of computation among  many.21 And  I don't understand what  - -22 I'm not happy with 50% above the Maximum  Base23 Rent as it existed or would have existed  but24 that 's a figure that you can compute.25 But if you say 50% or 40%  aboveROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2 the Maximum Base Rent , then that is not a real3 reasonable figure to give as a guideline to  DHCR4 because then it is nothing. It is  meaningless.5 They may as well just use comparables and  there' s6 going to be one big fight as to what  those7 comparables are.8 And it 's just going to take a9 longer t ime.10 There' s a little more certainty11 by saying what the Maximum Base Rent would be   as12 it existed or would have  existed.13 MS . HOLDER:	In the past ,14 Chair,15 MR. LUBELL:	I don' t understand16 what you are saying.17 MS. HOLDER:	But in the past ,18 it wasn' t until recent years that we added the19 FMR in there.20 And so what I'm saying that  we21 take it out.22 MR. LUBELL:	I'm not talking23 about the Fair Market. I believe that the  Fair24 Market Rent is, as established by HUD, is  a25 reasonable fair rent and a good guide for  DHCR.ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167

LUBELL:	- - something that10 makes sense to me.11 I can understand you saying  I12 don' t want to use that method. But when it  comes13 to Maximum Base Rent , I think there is a total14 misunderstanding	of what you're suggesting.15 MS. HOLDER:	I think that the16 Maximum Base Rent is something that  everyone17 knows what it is for each of these units. And   so18 I'm asking that it would be 40% above the  Maximum19 Base Rent.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.21 So the amendment  needs to be  - -22 the draft guideline has 50% and Fair Market  Rent23 and the amendments make it 40%  and eliminate	" as24 it existed or would have existed , " and  to25 eliminate Fair Market Rent ; right?

The purpose of these guidelines is  to11 implement the public policy set forth in  Findings12 and Declaration of Emergency of the  Rent13 Stabilizat ion Law of 1969	(Section 26- 501 of the14 New York City Administrat ive Code) and in the15 Legislative Finding contained in the  Emergency16 Tenant Protect ion Act of 1974 (Chapter 576 of  the17 Laws of 1974, Section 4, Subsect ion 2)."18 In addition, I would like to19 read the following as to the proviso and  the20 intention of the Board , the Board's intent ion of21 the so- called proviso which has to do with the22 seventy percent I read  earlier.23 " The Board' s intention for the24 meaning of this proviso is that all  dwelling25 units  in the hotel , whether  occupied, vacant ,
2 rented to tourists, transients, contract  clients,3 students or other non- permanent tenants, or to4 permanent rent stabilized tenants, be counted  in5 the denominator of the calculation. The only  type6 of units in the hotel that may be excluded  from7 the denominator are units that are used as  stores8 or for ..." other " . . .similar business purposes9 such as doctor' s off ices. The numerator of the10 calculation is the number of units occupied  by11 permanent rent stabilized or rent controll ed12 tenants.13 " Here  are two examples.14 "One: a hotel has 100 units and15 2 stores. 32 .. " apartments  " ...are rented to16 permanent rent stabilized tenants, 10 are  vacant17 and 58 are rented to transients and tourists.  The18 calculation is as follows, the denominator  is19 100, the numerator is 32. This calculat ion20 results in an occupancy percentage of less  than21 70% under the formula	(32%) and an increase22 cannot be taken for the permanent	stabilized23 tenants.24 "Example two: a hotel has 15025 units, 2 of which are used by a dentist and  a
2 doctor for their businesses, 8 are rented  to3 tourists, 20 are vacant and 120 are occupied  by4 permanent rent stabilized tenants . The5 denominator would be 148 and the numerator  would6 be 120. This calculation results in an  occupancy7 percentage of greater than 70% under the  formula8	(81%). . . " in fact " ...and an increase can be9	taken for the permanent stabilized tenants ."10 Any amendments being offered  to11 that proposed guideline?12 Ms. Holder.13 MS. HOLDER :	Chair, Members of14 the Rent Guidelines Board:15 We had asked having  consulted16 with, and heard the testimony at the hearing   from17 tenants at these hotels, rooming houses,  single18 room occupancy buildings and lodging  houses.19 We are trying to be  reasonable.20 And with their permission David and I are  making21 a motion that the allowable level of  rent22 adjustments be set at 2% and that the  allowable23level of adjustmentsoverthe lawful rent24actually charged andpaidshall be zero percent25if , and we would askthatthe units constitute
2 fewer than 90%.3 (Audience participat ion.)4	MS. HOLDER:	And that is our5 motion to amend those numbers in the  proposed6 guideline for hotel order No. 33 .7 Thank you.8 MR. PAGAN:	I second it.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Second.10 MS. HOLDER:	We are making this11 motion because, again, in consultation and  after12 testimony from those residents, although  these13 two percent increases we think are high,  and14 especially given the fact that these tenants  are15 some of the tenants considered least able  to16 shoulder increases, and they are housing of  the17 last resort here in New York  City.18 (Audience participation.)19 MS. HOLDER:	We would still20 like to urge members to consider voting for  a21 decrease in these amounts . And as again said22 before, it 's a precarious situat ion that these23 tenants find themselves in. On top of  everything24 else that 's happening to them, we think that it25 would be unjust for them to have to sustain  any
2	increases any higher.3 (Audience participation. )4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell.5 MR. LUBELL:	Mr. Chairman and6	Fellow Members:7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You got a8	second on that , right?9	THE REPORTER:	Yes.10	MR. PAGAN:	Yes.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right.12 Mr. Lubell .13 MR. LUBELL:	Chairman, Fellow14 Members of the Board:15 (Audience participat ion.)16 MR. LUBELL:	- - I want to be17 very brief .18 We heard testimony from a  number19 of hotel tenants, none of whom would have had  to20 pay that increase because of the   - -21 (Audience participation. )22 MR. LUBELL:	- - of the 70%23 none of whom I heard would have been paying  that24 increase because of this 70%  proviso.25 Now, a number of us - -ROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2	(Audience part icipat ion. )3		MR. LUBELL:	- - a number of 4	us - -5	(Audience part icipat ion.)6	MR. LUBELL:	- - a number of us7 voted for the proviso including  myself.8 That proviso protects almost9 every tenant that comes before us, that  is10 (Audience participation.)11	MR. LUBELL:	- - susceptible12 that  is susceptible  to - - that  is in a number13 that rents to transient tenants, to other  kinds14 of tenants, and all of them  - - they' ll  never15 pass, they would never pass that 70%  threshold.16 So that  the four percent , which17 applies to a limited number, captures  that18 segment of hotels that we need to retain  that19 does not rent to transients.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.21 Any addit ional	Mr. Schleider.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	At the23 testimony, especially this past Tuesday night ,24 Ms. Holder asked the tenants in these SROs  to25 state the number of units in the building and  howROY ALLEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10175 (212) 840-1167
2	many were still stabilized.3	In no case did that number  come4 above fifty percent that I can  remember.5 (Audience participation .)6	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Exactly.7	So - -8	(Audience participation.)9	MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - the fragile10 tenancies - -11 (Audience participat ion.)12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	the13 advocates would like to protect are  protected.14 They are not getting  zero - -  they are not  getting15 any increase. They're still at theirs .16 (Audience part icipat ion. )17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But to protect18 the hotels that are maintaining	that stabilized19 stock for the City, that are maintaining  these20 affordable rooms, that are maintaining	this type21 of domicile as one step away, it 's very important22 for them to have relief.23 If they are providing at least24 seventy percent of their units for this class  of25 people, they are entitled to their  increase.
2	(Audience participat ion. )3	MR. SCHLEIDER:	And I would4 suggest that we bring the increment up to  at5 least the level of the rent  stabilized6 apartments, the 4.5 percent .7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder.8 MS. HOLDER:	We are trying to9	be reasonable.10 We've spoken to our constituency11 on this. David and I don't feel that they  should12 have to shoulder any increase. We are proposing  a13 two percent increase. We understand the  proviso14 is in place. But we also understand that  there15 are a number of owners - - there are a number   of16 owners who, because of the mixed use of the  units17 in their buildings, are still making quite  a18 prof it , who would still fit into this category.19 We know they' re out there. And20 you all brought us some of those out  there.21 We are trying to be reasonable.22 We are saying two percent. We' re not happy with23 that , but we are trying to reasonable. We are24 trying to get the public members to  understand25 that  it ' s still a reasonable  increase, yet one
2	that does not unjustly burden the tenants  in3	those units.4	And so we would ask for  support5	on a two percent increase on all of these  classes6 of housing and that the proviso read  constitute7 fewer than 90%.8 MR. LUBELL:	I move the9 quest ion.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Move the11	question.12 All right .13 Ms. Adams?14 MS. ADAMS:	I'm sorry.15 CHAIRMAN MAR KUS:	The question16 is to change the numbers to two and make  the17 proviso 90%.18 MS.

But I'm going to leave it  in10 because I haven' t been able to find any11 challenges either way on this  particular12 provision.13 So it 's always good to leave it14 in so that the lawyers can have a good time  here.15 So we will leave it the way  it16 is, but I want to make it clear that at  least17 Corporation Counsel seems to feel that it 's not18 enforceable. But we are not going to worry  about19 that now.20 So 3 .5 percent , 70% on the21 proviso.22 Do I hear a second?23 MS. LUSSKIN:	Second.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Lusskin.25 MS.
