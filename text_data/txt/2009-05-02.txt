2 authorized by such subdivision shall be  blank.3 PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS FOR LOFTS	4 ( UNITS IN THE CATEGORY OF BUILDINGS COVERED BY	5 ARTICLE 7 - C OF THE MULTIPLE DWELLING LAW.)6 The Rent Guidelines Board proposes 7 the following levels of rent increases -- of  rent 8 increase above the " base rent," as defined in 9 Section 286 , subdivision 4 , of the Multiple 10 Dwelling Law, for units to which these  guidelines 11 are applicable in accordance with Article 7 - C of 12 the Multiple Dwelling Law:13 For a one- year increase periods 14 commencing on or after October 1 , 2009 and on  or 15 before September 30 , 2010 :	Blank percent.16 For two- year increases commencing 17 on or after October 1 , 2009 and on  or 18 before September 30 , 2010 : Blank percent.19 VACANT LOFT UNITS - PROPOSAL.20 There shall be blank vacancy 21 allowance.22 FRACTIONAL TERMS - PROPOSAL.23 For the purposes of these 24 guidelines, any lease or tenancy for a period up   to 25 and including one year shall be deemed a  one- year 2 
2 lease or tenancy, and any lease or tenancy for  a3 period of over one year and up to and including  two 4 years shall be deemed a two- year lease or tenancy.5 ESCALATOR CLAUSES - PROPOSAL.6 Where a lease for a dwelling  unit 7 in effect on May 31 , 1968 or where a lease in  is 8 effect on June 30 , 1974 for a dwelling unit  which 9 became subject to the Rent Stabilization Law  of 10 1969 , by virtue of the Emergency Tenant Protection 11 Act of 1974 and Resolution No. 276 of the New   York 12 City Council, contained an escalator clause for  the 13 increased costs of operation and such lease  is 14 still in effect, the lawful rent on September 30 ,15 2008 , over which the fair rent under this Order  is 16 computed, shall include the increased rental,  if 17 any, due under such clause except those  charges 18 which accrued within one year of the  commencement 19 of the renewal lease.20 Moreover, where a lease contained 21 an escalator clause that the owner may  validly 22 renew under the Code, unless the owner elects  or 23 has elected in writing to delete such  clause,24 effective no later than October 1 , 2009 from the 25 existing lease and all subsequent leases for  such 2 
2 dwelling unit, the increased rental, if any,  due 3 under such escalator clause shall be offset  against 4 the amount of increase authorized under this  Order.5 SPECIAL ADJUSTMENTS FOR PRIOR	6 ORDERS - PROPOSAL.7 All rent adjustments lawfully 8 implemented and maintained under previous  apartment 9 orders and included in the base rent in effect  on 10 September 30 , 2009 shall continue to be included in 11 the base rent for the purposes of  computing 12 subsequent rents adjusted pursuant to this  Order.13 PROPOSED SPECIAL GUIDELINE.14 Under Section 26 - 513 ( b)( 1 ) of the 15 New York City Administrative Code, and Section 9 ( e)16 of the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974 ,  the 17 Rent Guidelines Board is obligated to  promulgate 18 special guidelines to aid the State Division  of 19 Housing and Community Renewal in its  determination 20 of initial legal regulated rents for  housing 21 accommodations previously subject to the City  Rent 22 and Rehabilitation Law which are the subject of  a23 tenant application for adjustment.24 The Rent Guidelines Board hereby 25 proposes the following Special Guidelines:2 
2 For dwelling units subject to  the 3 Rent and Rehabilitation Law on September 30 , 2009 ,4 which become vacant after September 30 , 2009 , the 5 special guideline shall be blank.6 DECONTROLLED UNITS- PROPOSAL.	7 The permissible increase for 8 decontrolled units, as referenced in Order 3 a,9 which become decontrolled after September 30 , 2009 ,10 shall be blank.11 CREDITS - PROPOSAL.12 Rentals charged and paid in  excess 13 of the levels of rent increase established by  this 14 Order shall be fully credited against the  next 15 month' s rent.16 STATEMENT OF BASIS AND PURPOSE.17 The Rent Guidelines Board is 18 authorized to promulgate rent guidelines  governing 19 apartment units subject to the Rent  Stabilization 20 Law of 1969 , as amended, and the Emergency Tenant 21 Protection Act of 1974 , as amended.22 The purpose of these guidelines  is 23 to implement the public policy set forth in  the 24 Findings and Declaration of Emergency of the  Rent 25 Stabilization Law of 1969 (§ 26 - 501 of the N. Y. C.2 
2 Administrative Code) and in the  Legislative 3 Findings contained in the Emergency Tenant 4	Protection Act of 1974 ( L. 1974 c. 576 , § 4 [§ 2 ].)5 The Rent Guidelines Board is 6 authorized, is also authorized to promulgate  rent 7 guidelines for loft units subject to Section  286 8 subdivision 7 of the Multiple Dwelling  Law.9 The purpose of the loft  guidelines 10 is to implement the public policy set forth in  the 11 Legislative Findings of Article 7 - C of the Multiple 12 Dwelling Law ( Section 280 .)13 Having read that into the  record,14 I will entertain motions.15 I believe -- who' s going to make a16 motion, Adriene?17 MS. HOLDER:	We pass at this time.18 Chair, the tenant -- as a  tenant 19 member I feel that doing this preliminary  process,20 that I actually would like to leave some time  to 21 talk about what the process should be  moving 22 forward.23 I am concerned that if there  are 24 additional reports or additional witnesses  that 25 need to come before the board during this  public 5 
2 process, that we should have a discussion as  to 3 what that should be.	It seems historically that as 4 we have expert panels, that they are panels  that 5 only are put together by the owner  representatives 6 and the tenants representatives. Yet it seems  that 7 public members may not always be as satisfied  with 8 the information that they' re receiving.9 So I would ask that they  fully10 participate and give some input as to what it  is 11 that they would like to see for the remainder  of 12 this process.13 Having said that, also, the 14 preliminary vote seems to be a process where  owner 15 representatives and tenant representatives are 16 given an opportunity to make a motion, but  the 17 motion is not seriously debated or considered  by 18 this board.	And so my concern being that it  seems19 historically that the proposed preliminary 20 guideline, often times being a range, is  something 21 that' s actually proposed by the Chair.22 And so at this time I' d like to 23 talk about some of the findings that we' ve had, but 24 I don' t have a motion necessarily at this time.	So 25 I pass on this round for a  motion.2 
2 MR. LANGUEDOC:	If I could just 3 make a comment by me.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.5 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I just would 6 like to express, as the other tenant member of  the 7 board, that I have two major concerns about  the 8 board process going forward between now and  the 9 final vote next month based upon the experience  of 10 the board from last year.11 One of the things is that  I12 believe, and I think the evidence is clear,  that 13 the board enacted the vote increases that it  did 14 last year based upon a spike in some of the   costs,15 especially the fuel which was --16 ( Audience participation.)17 MR. LANGUEDOC:	-- projected to 18 go up very high and very shortly after we   voted,19 the cost went way back  down again.	And I' d like 20 the board to look at this seriously and  consider,21 you know, what action we should take in the  light 22 of that very unusual situation, and what it  has 23 been historically in the history of the  board,24 other examples of this and whether there' s anything 25 we could do or should do to correct or   consider,2 
2 you know, how to respond to this, in my   view,3 overreaction.4 And the second -- the second  major 5 concern I have about the board going forward has  to 6 do with the vote last year to have the minimum   rent 7 increased.8 And we have heard --9 ( Audience participation.)10 MR. LANGUEDOC:	We' ve heard some 11 testimony -- in the invited testimony we' ve heard 12 some testimony on both sides a little bit as to   the 13 pros and cons of doing that.	But I do feel that  --14 I do want to say publicly that in my view   the 15 process on which we considered that last year  was 16 very unsatisfactory in that there was -- there  was 17 no discussion by the board.	And there was a memo 18 prepared by staff which was e- mailed to us on  the 19 day of the vote and Adriene and I made a motion   to 20 postpone the final vote, which was  denied.21 And I feel that if there is  any 22 wind of consideration of such a minimum  vote 23 increase this year, which I hope there would  not 24 be, but I suspect there might be, that it   be 25 stated, you know, publicly as soon as possible  and2 
2 discussed so that everyone can have a chance  to 3 hear their views on it  fully.4 ( Audience participation.)5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.7 Schleider, would you like to make a  motion?8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I' d like to 9 comment.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead,11 comment.12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	We' ve been 13 having -- excuse me. We' ve been having meetings 14 since the end of March. And I find that the   tenant 15 members raising objections at this point is a   bit 16 disingenuous and I see it as  obstructionist.17 I move that the preliminary  vote 18 go forward --19 ( Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I think you 21 need to speak louder into the  mike.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I move that the 23 preliminary vote process go forward.	I find the 24 tenant members' comments and objections to what  is 25 a preliminary vote process and procedure, a  bit 2 
2 disingenuous given that they' ve had the opportunity 3 since the end of the March when our cycle  began 4 with meetings to bring up this  point.5 MS. HOLDER:	I think -- but if  I6 might respond.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure. Go 8 ahead.9 MS. HOLDER:	I think -- I  think 10 we have been bringing up  the point.	The problem 11 that I have is with the process, which I think   is 12 extremely flawed.	The problem that I have,  Mr 13 Schleider, is that you and Ms. Cruz actually  have 14 made your viewpoints quite clear and as a   colleague 15 on this board with me and Mr. Languedoc, I   know 16 exactly what your positions are and I  appreciate 17 them.18 I don' t know what the positions19 are of the five public members on  our board.	That 20 has never been too clear.	And I don' t know if it' s21 because the way that the process has been set  up 22 that they don' t feel that they should express 23 perhaps what their views are until the very end  of 24 the process. But it' s unfair. And it doesn' t give 25 the public an opportunity to figure out what it  is 2 
2 that they should do as they try to participate  in 3 the process.4 I think the owner members and  the 5 tenant members --6 ( Audience participation.)7 MS. HOLDER:	-- have always been 8 very clear. The concern that I have is that  there 9 has to be an issue about affordability to  tenants.10 In times when things were good,  --11 ( Audience participation.)12 MS. HOLDER:	-- rents increased.13 And when the economic times have been bad,  the 14 rents have increased -- in fact, in a way that   was 15 quite sharp and marked last year, and in a way   also 16 that waited to the last minute for something  that 17 should have easily been debated -- to the  extent 18 that tenants lost out.	I mean we lost out big  last 19 year.20 There still was not an  opportunity 21 for real debate on a memo that was not  even 22 personally delivered to us, to a memo that  was 23 e- mailed to us.	And we did try to have  discussion.24 What I am asking is that  the 25 process today is going to go forward  as 2 
2 historically it has and there' s going to be 3 probably some kind of a range or something that' s4 supposed to be put out there to afford the  public 5 some opportunity for comment, whatever that  process 6 is.7 But what I' m asking is that we 8 have some time so that we can hear from other   parts 9 of this board. Not the same four members of   the 10 board, two of them representing owners and  two 11 representing tenants who are always vocal  even 12 during expert testimony, even during public 13 testimony, in a very, you know, thoughtful  way.14 I would like to make sure  that 15 there is time and that the public  members 16 understand that I am extremely distraught that  we 17 are not having a fuller debate so that we can   all 18 understand where everyone' s coming from.19 And I would like for the  public 20 members to perhaps themselves decide who they  would 21 like to see at the public hearings and if there   are 22 additional reports that need to be produced so  that 23 we can have a discussion about them beforehand  and 24 not slip it to us towards the end of a   process 25 which may have happened last  year.2 
2 So I' m just talking about this 3 year.	I' m trying to be constructive and I' m trying 4 to represent my constituency, the tenants, who  are 5 constantly --6 ( Audience participation.)7 MS. HOLDER:	-- who are constantly 8 bearing the brunt and shouldering the  difficulties 9 of these economic times. And at what point will  we 10 have a real debate and discussion that involves  all 11 nine of us?12 ( Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Betty Adams.14 Betty.15 MS. ADAMS:	Yeah.	I just wanted 16 to say a couple of  things.17 First to Adriene.	I' m sorry that 18 you' re distraught for the reasons that you gave.19 I think it' s pretty clear what the 20 role of the public members is, and that is  to 21 assure that there is housing, rent  stabilized 22 housing and that it' s at a cost that is  not 23 prohibitive to the owners.24 One of the big problems that  we 25 have, of course, is that there is no way to make   a2 
2 distinction between large owners, that is,  those 3 who own a hundred, a thousand or more units   and 4 those who don' t.	We heard just at the last --  at 5 our last time that the -- there was a woman   who 6 testified before us would was responsible for  six 7 units and she dubbed herself the poorest  landlord 8 in the City and she probably  is.9 There is -- it is very  difficult,10 I find it very difficult to come up with a   solution 11 which addresses her needs because she' s not in a12 position to realize any economies of scale  with 13 those who own a hundred units, a thousand  units,14 several thousand units.15 We have heard accusations, for 16 example, of people who, owners would don' t open 17 their books, but we' ve had -- we' ve heard from 18 owners who do.19 ( Audience participation.)20 MS. ADAMS:	In other words, as a21 public member, it is to weigh what is going on   both 22 in terms of the tenants and the owners and  the 23 excellent research that the staff provides.	And I24 guess as an old researcher I have a   special 25 appreciation for the difficulty that it is to  draw 2 
2 conclusions from numbers, because we know  the 3 shortcomings that the numbers have.	But that is 4 what we have to go with. And we feed into that   what 5 we see as being best.6 So I continue to look forward  to 7 the comments that the tenant members have, that  the 8 owner members have and that other public  members 9 have.10 We are all, I think, very  much 11 aware of the fact that the economy is bad all   over.12 We are also aware that there has been a   serious 13 problem with regard to low- income and moderate 14 income housing in New York.	I think the Chairman' s15 statement last year and the year before, if I' m  not 16 mistaken, --17 ( Audience participation.)18 MS. ADAMS:	-- spoke to that in 19 what we saw as the longer term solution or at   least 20 an approach to coming up with something that  is 21 better than we have to work with  now.22 So that' s basically, Mr. Chairman,23 what I wanted to say. It is a   difficult job.	We 24 are trying to weigh and come out with  something 25 that works in the best interest of the  public.2 
3 MS. HOLDER:	I just have one 4 comment for clarification.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure. Go ahead.6 MS. HOLDER:	So let me just make 7 sure that we' re clear.8 So we see a lot of owners  that 9 come up and they come to us and they tell us   about 10 the hardships that they' re experiencing and they 11 tell us about the bills that they' re incurring.12 We also have tenants that do  the 13 same thing and tell us about lost wages, real  wages 14 and the hardships that they' re encountering keeping 15 up. Yet when the tenants testify, what we' re told 16 is that there needs to be a government solution  to 17 the issues that they have in dealing with  their 18 rent burdens and the issues that they have  dealing 19 with the fact that they are perhaps underpaid  and20 finding that they' re not really allowed livable 21 wages, and in this economy, actually are  losing 22 jobs in record pace.23 I say that there should also be  a24 government response to what it is that' s happening 25 for the owners; that these very same owners,  many 3 
2 of them very sympathetically coming to us  about 3 the burdens that they have, are not going  to 4 benefit from what it is that this board can  do.5 They need something more substantial and  something 6 that actually is going to take a lift from   the 7 government.8 And, again, this board can  talk 9 constructively about what it is that we might  want 10 to support to enable to assist them. But where  we 11 have people who come up and tell us that there   are 12 whole building portfolios where there are  people 13 who are getting -- who are paying a  preferential 14 rent, I don' t see how increasing the legal rent  is 15 going to assist in any process except in  later 16 years actually removing these units from the  rent 17 regulated stock.18 This is not the way to go  about 19 it. And so I would really like to talk  about,20 again, what it is that we can do that' s21 constructive and takes into account what' s22 happening in the economy, and the fact of  the 23 matter that tenants are disproportionately carrying 24 the burden of our economic collapse here in  New 25 York City as renters.2 
3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.4 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Chair, I just 5 have one brief comment.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Cruz.7 Ms. Cruz, go ahead. Go  ahead.8 MS. CRUZ:	To my colleagues,9 Ms. Holder.	I appreciate your position and  your 10 thoughts on the frustration that perhaps we  all 11 face.	But we are constrained in our -- the  scope 12 of our work.	The legislature has delegated a  very 13 limited set of factors that we are obligated by  law 14 to consider. We are not here to fix the ills of   all 15the inequities of society.We can' t.That' s not 16our position.17 ( Audience participation.)18 MS. CRUZ:	And I' m sure that you 19 understand that.	And to the extent that the  staff 20 provides us with economic information that  reflects 21 the realities of what is occurring both in  the 22 operation of properties and as well as  the 23 affordability of housing, those are the  criteria 24 that we have to apply in determining the  correct 25 rent increases for -- that we have to -- that   we 17 

2	have to apply.3
MS. HOLDER:	And again, Ms. Cruz,
4 I always appreciate your comments in terms of  the 5 fact that you' re actually representing your 6 constituency very well. I still have heard only  now 7 from one public member.	And I just wondered 8 through the duration of this process through  the 9 end of June if I will hear from any others   publicly 10 stating what their position is on  this.11 I totally understand what you' re 12 saying, Ms. Cruz, about how we cannot solve all  the 13 economic ills. But we are a part of the problem   as 14 the Rent Guidelines Board. I am one of nine   members 15 who' s contributing to -- to -- by siting here  and 16 not, of course, through my vote, but by  sitting 17 here contributing to the problem of having  these 18 units continue to escalate and  rise.19 And so we can do something  which 20 is to really, really stay the escalation of  these 21 rents because of the increases that will be  voted22 in. That' s all I' m asking.	I don' t think that we 23 can create programs.	We cannot create subsidies.24 We cannot change the rent laws. Many of us act   in 25 our professional lives and in those parts where  we 4 
2 actually get paid, we actually are working  very 3 hard on those issues.	I understand too well what 4 is the mandate of this board.	What I' m saying is 5 that we have been derelict in that mandate when  it 6 comes to tenants. We have never seriously  debated 7 and considered the affordability of what is  going 8 on for tenants. And to the extent that  landlords 9 need some kind of a break, I don' t know that  this 10 board can provide them with the kind of  assistance 11 that they' re asking for.12 And, again, if nothing else, for 13 the duration of this process, if there are  other 14 reports that the Chair or other members of  the 15 board would like to have, I' d like for that 16 discussion to be had now so we know what it is   that 17 we can expect from our very able and  intelligent 18 staff.	And I' d like to know what other types of 19 testimony during the public testimony period  people 20 would like to see.21 Because, again, it seems as if  Mr.22 Schleider, Ms. Cruz, Mr. Languedoc and Ms.  Holder 23 are the ones who are providing for a lot of   that 24 information for the rest of the  board.25 And to the extent that it  would 2 
2 help in the deliberative process and help  public 3 members to feel comfortable about their jobs to  the 4 point where there can express that to the public,  I5 would like for them to let us know what it is   that 6 they need.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I would like 8	to --9 ( Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I would just 11 like to address something.12 You make a statement that 13 individual members of the board or public  members 14 of the board have not voiced their preferences  as 15 to what they want to  hear.16 Let me try to discuss and  indicate 17 the process that we' ve been through thus far and 18 the process that we will  continue.19 We have had testimony, invited 20 testimony from very important individuals, the 21 Deputy Commissioner of HPD who talked about --  to 22 us about their programs, how their programs  address 23 affordability.24 We had the mortgage survey done  by 25 our staff, very well done, but the board  members,9 
2 the public board members felt that they needed  more 3 information and invited -- and we were happy to  see 4 last week two lending officers, senior  lending 5 officers, one from Freddie Mac, one from a  major 6 financial institution, who testified before us  as 7 to what was going on out  there.8 So that the notion that  this 9 board, public members, do not take their  job 10 seriously, do not reach out for all sorts of  people 11 to get information, is not a notion that  I12 subscribe to.13 And I want to make it clear  that 14 this board, myself as Chair, and the public  members 15 and the tenant members and the owner members  are 16 always free to ask for additional  testimony.17 And as to this process that we' re 18 going through, let' s make it clear:	The reason we,19 at least for the last seven years that I' ve  been 20 Chair, have adopted a range is, the City  Council 21 statute, Administrative Code, under which we 22 operate, mandates a process that requires a 30 - day 23 period between promulgation of a  preliminary 24 guideline and a final decision and public  hearings 25 after that 30 - day period which forces us very, very 2 
2 early in the process, we' re here on May 5 th, to 3 make a judgement. We make that judgement on  a4 preliminary basis and we have adopted a range  so 5 that people know that our mind is not made  up.6 While the process is not  perfect,7 I certainly object to the notion that somehow we   --8 we don' t take our jobs seriously and that we don' t9 look at this seriously.10 With that, I' d be happy to 11 entertain any other public members who might  want 12 to make a comment.13 ( Audience participation.)14 MS. ADAMS:	I just want to make 15 one which should be --16 ( Audience participation.)17 MS. ADAMS:	I just want to add  a18 very brief one, Mr. Chairman, just  quickly.19 I just want to remind Adriene  that 20 it was one of the public members, me, who asked  the 21 staff if we could have the Community  Service 22 Society testify.	And they have testified every 23 year after that.24 I have not encountered any 25 resistance to people that I wanted to invite  to 2 
2 testify being here. If there are others who  have,3 I' d like to hear it.	But the suggestion seems kind 4 of out of the question to  me.5 MS. LEVINE:	I' d just like to 6 add.	I think that we' re all a little confused  as 7 to what you think the role of the public  members 8 should be.	The role -- it is only natural  that 9 most of the questions and most of the comments  come 10 from the specific advocates of the people  of 11 specific groups.12 You represent the tenants,13 therefore you' re advocating a specific position.14 The landlord representatives represent the 15 landlords and are equally advocating a  specific 16 position.17 We as the public members, I don' t18 come to this -- I come to this and -- as   unbiased 19 as possible trying to hear  --20 ( Audience participation.)21 MS. LEVINE:	-- the evidence.22 And, in fact, the -- I have never spoken about   any 23 of issues with either of the landlord reps and  have 24 actually only spoken with you and Mr.  Languedoc,25 reaching out to you numerous times to try  and 2 
 2 ascertain what -- how we can help and what we   can 3 do.4 So to indite the public  members 5 for not coming to this with a bias is   in 6 contravention to what our specific role as  public 7 members is supposed to be.8 MS. HOLDER:	But I would disagree.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.10 ( Audience participation.)11 MS. HOLDER:	All I' m saying -- I12 would disagree. All I' m saying is that -- is  that 13 we have nine members of this board. And I   think 14 that there are a lot more voices on this board   who 15 could be asking questions and who might really need 16	--17 MS. LEVINE:	Are you trying to 18 tell me that we don' t ask enough questions ' cause I19 think that I ask too many  questions?20 ( Audience participation.)21 MS. HOLDER:	And, and, and 22 because it' s a public process, to the extent that 23 there is additional information, to the extent  that 24 there are additional questions or concerns,  that 25 those members of the board should feel free to  have 17 
2 a discussion about it.	And I don' t necessarily 3 think that that' s happened every year.	I don' t.4 And it seems to me that to  the 5 extent that we have reached out to other members  --6 I have not said anyone  in specific.	Yes, it' s7 true, many of us have spoken. Many of us have   not,8 and when reached out to, people are not willing  to 9 have a fuller discussion, be it public or  in 10 private on these issues.11 I' m just asking that because so 12 much is at stake that we do that. And if we   all 13 disagree, that' s fine. I disagree with the notion 14 that this is such a full and open, as open   a15 process as it should be given the fact that  there 16 is so much at stake  --17 ( Audience participation.)18 MS. HOLDER:	-- for tenants and 19 owners.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would the 21 process be open if it was a zero  rent increase?	Is 22 that -- I' m not quite sure what you define as  open 23 process.	What leads you to the conclusion that   a24 process that has five members and it takes  five 25 votes, whether it be the  --2 

34	Chair.56	Schleider.7
MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.	Mr.CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead. Mr.MR. SCHLEIDER:	I appreciate 
8 Mr. Holder' s position --9 ( Audience participation.)10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But, again, I11 have to repeat that we' ve had meetings since the 12 end of March and she' s had the opportunity to  raise 13 this point, and as eloquently as she has  tonight,14 but she hasn' t done it in the past.15 Maybe this is the -- maybe  it 16 wasn' t a proper forum. All I can say is we have  a17 process.	We' ve been used to the process. This  is 18 not Ms. Holder' s first year on the board. She 19 understands the process we go for.	And there' s20 been plenty of opportunity for her to voice  her 21 opinion about any defect or any amendment to  the 22 process or any fix to the process that she feels   is 23 necessary.24 Personally I feel that the  public 25 members have reached out to the staff for  a8 
2 significant amount of supplemental information,3 both the testimony that' s been presented during the 4 open meetings.5 MS. HOLDER:	And I just ask 6 that if there' s any additional testimony, if there 7 are any additional reports, that we know about  them 8 ahead of time and we don' t receive them hours 9 before a final vote.10 I would like not to have a  repeat 11 of what happened last year so that there can  be 12 full and open deliberation. I don' t agree that 13 there was last year.14 ( Audience participation.)15 MS. HOLDER:	And had I asked the 16 staff to produce a report -- and I have asked   in 17 previous years for provisos, some which  were 18 introduced the beginning of the period, some  that 19 were introduced towards the end of the process  --20 they were wholesale rejected by this board  because 21 it was not enough time for  open debate.	And I' m22 asking that we not have the same repeat. Because  it 23 seems to be somewhat hypocritical when we  get 24 multi- page reports hours before a final vote.25 So I would just ask  --2 
3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Adriene.4 MS. HOLDER:	I would just ask 5 that if there' s contemplation, if there' s6 contemplation if there is a need for any  additional 7 information, statistics, reports, that we  receive 8 all of them within the period so that there can   be 9 deliberation publicly as well as privately as  a10 board so that we can come to a reasonable  decision 11 this year unlike last year where I did not  feel 12 that that was fairly and properly  done.13 ( Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Adriene.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Ms. Holder, you 16 seemed to have morphed your points into a  diatribe 17 to scold the board for not allowing your  provisos 18 for later. I' m sorry. I don' t agree with that. If 19 you have an issue with the public members and  your 20 take on their participating in this forum or  not,21 that' s one thing, but please don' t meld the 22 concepts.23 ( Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Do we have a25 motion?	Do we have a  motion?3 

23	time.456	motion?789	this.10
MS. HOLDER:	We pass at this CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Pass.Mr. Schleider, do you have  aMR. SCHLEIDER:	Sure.Let' s see if we can get through Thank you, Mr. Chairman.	Thank 
11 you, board members --12 ( Audience participation.)13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- and welcome to 14 the public assembly gathered here.15 This year' s scheduled meetings and16 reports, deliberations, and airing of points  of 17 view, highlight the fact of life that  stress,18 worries, troubles and uncertainty brought about  by 19 the current economic insecurity, affect  most 20 everyone in this great hall and throughout New  York 21 City, both tenants and landlords.22 ( Audience participation.)23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Though the 24 individual circumstances are varied in both type  of 25 depth, nonetheless, living in New York City  has 11 
2 become more of a challenge and providing  safe,3 affordable housing has become more of a  challenge,4 a great deal more challenging.5 We' ve seen the staff reports that 6 illustrate years of falling property  incomes 7 followed by years of rising property incomes. We' ve 8 seen the staff reports showing the meager  property 9 incomes for Brooklyn apartment buildings contrasted 10 with the higher incomes for the luxury building  in 11 the core Manhattan neighborhoods.12 We' ve seen the incomes for 13 properties in the Bronx move down year after  year 14 despite upward property income movement in  other 15 boroughs. Clearly there is no consistent  movement 16 in property income City- wide, let alone 17 year- to- year.18 In fact, the staff reports  show 19 the only consistency is that stabilized  rent 20 increases have roughly mirrored inflation and 21 owners' costs have increased at twice the  rate.22 ( Audience participation.)23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	We' ve seen the 24 staff reports showing that landlords have  steadily 25 improved their property over the past decade,  and 2 
2 all that with property income remaining  virtually 3 flat over the long term, meaning that  repairs,4 renovations and improvements are made with  more 5 expensive dollars as inflation eats into  the 6 purchasing power over time. Yet property  owners,7 the vast majority of landlords demonstrating  pride 8 in their property, make the commitment to  providing 9 safe, clean housing for their tenants. We' ve seen 10 the evidence of this yet still one in  ten 11 properties are distressed, distressed because  the 12 rents don' t cover expenses.13 ( Audience participation.)14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But the current 15 year has shown that all New York City residents  are 16 not immune to economic strains and pains.  The 17 economic -- the economy has reduced income for  all 18 owners through rent collection losses, rent 19 reductions and vacancies. Although larger building 20 incomes may carry the impact from rent loss  from 21 individual tenants for a little while without  much 22 harm, small building owners cannot afford to  carry 23 such a burden. This will hurt all the tenants  in 24 the building if operations cannot be  continued.25 As for the tenants, landlords are 2 
2 sympathetic to the realities the hard- pressed and 3 out- of- work tenants face.4 ( Audience participation.)5 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Landlords are 6 sensitive to the real- world hardships of tenants at 7 risk. Landlords are concerned that tenants with  a8 strong payment history are falling behind in  these 9 times. I' m not speaking of the ten percent or 10 fifteen percent of tenants that cannot meet  their 11 rent in any economic climate.	No one denies that 12 those tenants are perpetually at risk. I' m speaking 13 of those tenants newly vulnerable due to  losing 14 their job.15 All members of this board  have 16 been moved by the testimony concerning  tenants'17 inability to make the rent when unemployment  drains 18 their savings, strains family relations and  makes 19 heavy demands on friendships. No one on this  board 20 is so coldhearted as to dismiss these facts  as 21 irrelevant.22 ( Audience participation.)23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	For the past 24 seven years as a member of this board, I' ve 25 recognized that housing affordability is a  chronic 2 
2 issue for New Yorkers and I' ve called for 3 government to rise to the challenge of  making 4 housing affordable by expanding the safety nets  and 5 legislating new safety nets.6 We had testimony stating that  less 7 than half of those eligible for SCRIE and  DRIE 8 apply. This needs to be corrected by  those 9 advocates and support groups directly concerned 10 with those residents of our City. Clearly,  these 11 programs need to be fully embraced, these  other 12 programs initiated to extend the social safety  nets 13 and doing it as only government can when  motivated 14 by political will.15 However, no one has come forth  in 16 testimony to convince us that those not at  risk,17 those with jobs could not afford to pay their  rent.18 In fact, the overwhelming majority of tenants  can,19 and do pay their rent.20 ( Audience participation.)21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No one likes to 22 pay rent, but that doesn' t mean they can' t.23 A rent stabilized apartment offers 24 protections and stability, maintains the fabric  of 25 neighborhoods and allows long- term tenants the 2 
2 comfort of calling someplace home. I grew up in   a3 stabilized apartment and always thought of it  as 4 home. But a rent stabilized apartment is not  a5 birthright and the opportunity the  rent 6 stabilization laws provide tenants for that 7 long- term stability and protection is not without 8 cost.9 The tenant members do not deny  the 10 costs of operating a rental building have  been 11 rising and to do so would only invite  laughter 12 which might not be a terrible thing in these  trying 13 times. However, the tenant members still hold  onto 14 the thought that owners as a group are making  out 15 well and that no increases are necessary  or 16 warranted. Yet tenants as a group are the  only 17 party in these deliberations that need not  pay 18 their fair share.19 ( Audience participation.)20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I say there is a21 wide range between those two thoughts.	And as a22 board we need to steer away from those rocky  shoals 23 and toward a more realistic attitude that  supposes 24 not all landlords are able to make it  without 25 assistance in meeting rising costs, crimped  cash 2 
2 flows and draining on their savings, and that  most 3 tenants can and should bear their share of  the 4 rising real estate taxes, water and sewer  charges,5 unfunded mandates and prospect of rising  interest 6 rates.7 Without proper and fair rent 8 increases, the landlords are again shouldering  the 9 expense of what is a public  subsidy.10 Some say the landlords don' t need 11 help in shifting the burden for subsidizing  tenants 12 or meeting costs. Respect that the landlords  have 13 been shouldering the cost of providing what  has 14 become an expensive public subsidy program and  help 15 to shift this responsibility back  to 16 government- based social safety nets, back to the 17 government where housing subsidies belong.18 The vast majority of landlords -19 this large number of landlords - own  small 20 buildings, about 40 percent of the regulated  rental 21 housing stock is in buildings of less than  eleven 22 units. The vast majority of landlords have  been 23 suffering operation cost increases for years 24 without a real commensurate increase in  rents.25 These are the gatekeepers of  the 2 
2 exiting affordable housing stock.	These 3 gatekeepers are the private citizens that the  City 4 has inequitably forced to shoulder a public  cost 5 with higher real estate taxes, another  upcoming 6 increase in water and sewer charges and dozens  of 7 administrative fees.8 The tenants must share in  these 9 cost increases.	The rent stabilized apartment,10 again is not a birthright and the obligation  of 11 being a good tenant include paying a rent  that 12 fairly reflects the cost of running safe,  habitable 13 and affordable housing.14 ( Audience participation.)15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The staff report 16 focusing on the rent increase formula noted  that 17 the rise in core expenses was 6 . 5 percent, and that 18 next year' s core increase --19 ( Audience participation.)20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- will be 9 . 121 percent. These suggest that the very high, at  least 22 very high one- and two- year guideline increases 23 will be necessary to protect the viability of  our 24 regulated housing stock. Guideline increases higher 25 than last year.2 
2 However, in keeping with the 3 economic realities and concerns for those newly  at 4 risk tenants and those likely to join their  ranks 5 before the year is out, I propose that the  owner 6 members not seek a rent increase to this  maximum 7 level for the upcoming year' s guideline.8 I propose a tempering of our  usual 9 position and not reaching for double- digit 10 increases, --11 ( Audience participation.)12 MR. SCHLEIDER:	-- as to do so 13 would not be in the spirit of recognizing  the 14 current demands and hardships.15 So I propose that the guideline  be 16 limited to the staff- calculated, CPI- adjusted 17 commensurate increase adjustment of five  percent 18 for a one- year renewal lease and eight percent for 19 a two- year renewal lease; and 20 In keeping with last year' s21 guideline, a minimum rent increase equal to  the 22 greater of $ 45 for a one- year renewal lease and $ 85 23 for a two- year renewal lease apply where a  tenant 24 has been in continuous occupancy for six years  or 25 longer.2 
2 This board must allow landlords to 3 protect New York' s housing and to equitably share 4 the burden.5 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Chair, I second 6 Mr. Schleider' s motion.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You second 8 the motion?9 MS. CRUZ:	Yes.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Second the 11 motion.12 Any discussion?13 MS. HOLDER:	Yes.	I have 14 discussion.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Just to 16 reiterate:	The motion is five percent for  a17 one- year lease, eight percent for a two- year lease,18 $ 45 minimum one- year lease, $ 85 minimum two- year 19 lease, six years going back if you haven' t had  a20 vacancy increase in six years.21 MS. CRUZ:	That' s right.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is that the 23 motion, Mr. Schleider?24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes, Mr. Chair.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.2 

23	motion?456	discussion?789	Adriene.10
And we have a second on  the MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes, we do. CHAIRMAN MARKUS:		Any MS. HOLDER:	Yes.CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead,MS. HOLDER:	I just want to 
11 remind the board that this is the worst  recession 12 since the Great Depression with sharply  higher 13 unemployment.14 Inflation- adjusted wages and 15 incomes are falling for most New York families  and 16 housing costs are placing an enormous burden on  New 17 York City working families.18 Just to reiterate what we' ve 19 already been told and what we' ve already seen from 20 our reports. We' re seeing a tremendous escalation 21 in job loss. We' ve had small landlords and others 22 come to us and telling us that their tenants  are 23 losing their jobs and are unable to pay the  rent.24 Since august of last year the  City 25 has lost over 100 , 000 jobs and the Mayor' s Office 11 
2 projects that the City will lose a total of 294 , 000 3 jobs through the middle of 2010 .4 First- time unemployment claims are 5 soaring and we' re 75 percent greater than the early 6 weeks of this year compared to 2008 .7 At my offices at the Legal  Aid 8 Society in all five boroughs, we have seen  a9 tremendous and dramatic increase in demand  for 10 legal services, especially in areas of  housing,11 employment law, consumer law, and health  law.12 Potential clients coming through 13 our doors are increasingly those displaced  from 14 middle- income jobs who are falling behind in their 15 rent or bills because they have been either  denied 16 unemployment insurance benefits or the  benefits 17 have run out and they' re still without employment.18 Despite these perceptions that 19 folks have here that in New York City the  majority 20 of people losing their jobs are big- time Wall 21 Street bankers, we know and the statistics  show,22 that these job losses are concentrated  within,23 two- thirds of them have occurred in sectors paying 24 low and middle or moderate income wages. So we' ve 25 lost more construction and manufacturing jobs  than 2 
2 bankers on Wall Street.3 And the people coming into  our 4 offices in alarmingly increasing numbers are  more 5 retail and clerical workers, some health and  home 6 aides who have gotten pink slips or have been  told 7 by their agencies that they are not going to   be 8 able to get additional work.9 Two- thirds of those receiving 10 unemployment insurance are blue collar clerical  or 11 service workers. So they are the  secretaries,12 cafeteria and restaurant workers, department store 13 salespersons and car service drivers of the  bankers 14 and professionals that have been laid off by  Wall 15 Street.16 We' re seeing the trickle- down 17 effect and it is impacting this entire City as  we 18 all know too well.19 The number of New York  City 20 residents who are unemployed has jumped by 150 , 000 21 over the past year reaching a total of 330 , 000 in 22 this past March. And the City unemployment rate  is 23 8 . 2 percent up sharply from 4 . 6 percent one year 24 ago, in one year.25 Given the severity of this 2 
 2 recession, it is likely that an additional 10 , 000 3 or more jobs will be lost each month through  the 4 early months of 2010 . At what point are we going  to 5 seriously consider these statistics and  understand 6 that people cannot shoulder these types  of 7 increases being proposed.8 And according to the latest 9 Housing and Vacancy Survey, median household  income 10 for renters in rent stabilized buildings  was 11 $ 36 , 000 in 2007 , slightly more than half of the 12 $ 70 , 000 median income for all earners.13 For renters in pre- 1947 stabilized 14 buildings, real household income fell by 1 . 415 percent between 2004 and 2007 , years representing 16 the heart of the last economic  expansion.17 And for renters in post- 1947 18 stabilized building, inflation adjusted median 19 household income fell by 1 . 6 percent.20 For households in rent controlled 21 apartments, which is a population  increasingly 22 aging and of fixed income, many of them  disabled 23 and elderly, the median income was only $ 24 , 000 in 24 2007 and had fallen by 2 . 4 percent between 2004 and 25	2007 .2 
 2 We have to take all of  these 3 issues and all of these factors into  consideration.4 I don' t know when it is that we are going to  have 5 serious consideration during good times and  bad,6 that the rents are constantly going up.	And I7 would like for this year for us to realize  that 8 they cannot go up at the rate that they' ve  been 9 going despite the fact that I think that this  board 10 way overshot itself last year.11 We have a motion that still  asks 12 for high, high increases when what our  statistics 13 are showing from reports prepared by our  staff,14 show that it just does not seem that it could   be 15 supported.16 What we see is that -- what' s17 significant to me is a change in the overall   Price 18 Index of Operating Costs or PIOC. For this year  it 19 is four percent down considerably from 7 . 8 percent 20	in 2008 .21 Moreover, the PIOC is projected  to 22 increase by only 2 . 2 percent in 2010 as another 23 increase in the property tax component is more  than 24 offset by a further decline in fuel cost that  carry 25 away about three- fifths that of property taxes.21 
2 And finally, what we have  found 3 from our wonderful Income and Expense Study,  is 4 that rent regulated building owners realized  a5 substantial 9 . 3 percent in net operating income in 6 2007 compared to 2006 , the latest period for which 7 this data exists.8 And I dare say that although  costs 9 are going to continue to rise, that when you' re 10 talking about sharing the burden, sharing  the 11 burden does not mean shifting it to  tenants.12 Sharing the burden means --13 ( Audience participation.)14 MS. HOLDER	-- that given these 15 real statistics and the reality of what' s going on 16 in the economy, what' s going on with renters, and 17 what is going on with owners, that this year  this 18 board should not vote in any type of an  increase,19 certainly not vote in any type of a  supplemental 20 increase --21 ( Audience participation.)22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Is that your 23 vote?24 MS. HOLDER:	-- and penalize those 25 long- term tenants who everyone claims to value so 2 
2 much but seems to want to penalize because of  their 3 longevity in buildings as good  tenants.4 And so, yes, I oppose.	Those are 5 my comments opposing the motion that' s before this 6 board at this time.7 ( Audience participation.)8 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Mr. Chairman, I9 have the following comments.10 I think that -- this is my  third 11 year on the board as a  tenant member.	And each 12 year there have been different spreads between  the 13 one- and two- year lease renewals that have been 14 passed by the board. And I don' t know recall  that 15 there' s been any discussion as to the reasoning 16 behind those spreads.17 Certainly from my point of view,  I18 think that the higher the spread the more  incentive 19 there is for tenants to sign a one- year renewal,20 and -- which is probably not advantageous  to 21 tenants.	And I would like that the board   would 22 look this over in the next period between now  and 23 the final vote as to what is an appropriate  spread 24 between a one- and a two- year renewal lease, you 25 know, keeping in mind that, you know, assuming  the 2 
2 higher the spread the more tenants will  sign 3 renewal leases for a one- year.4 Also, the fact that owners will  --5 more owners will get rent increases annually  as 6 opposed to tenants paying a higher amount  right 7 away.	And I think we need to look at the   economic 8 impact of this rather than just what seems to  be 9 fairly arbitrary, at least it' s never been 10 explained publicly to my recollection, how it  is 11 that the board has arrived at a decision as to   the 12 amount of the spread between the one- and  the 13 two- year renewal.14 The second thing I wanted to  say 15 is that I think that, again, as the board did   last 16 year, I think the board has to continue to  think 17 about those tenants who are required to pay  for 18 their own heat or their own -- and/ or their own  hot 19 water and the impact of those expenses and  the 20 impact on the owners' expenses as well, which  I21 assume it means that the owners' expenses  are 22 decreased for those apartments and don' t -- as high 23 of an increase is not  justified.24 Thirdly, and very importantly, I25 think that since there is now a motion for  a2 
2 minimum rent increase on the table, I want to   say 3 that in circulating around the tenant  community 4 over the last, well, the last three years on  the 5 board and the last 28 years as a tenant attorney,   I6 believe that the assessment of that increase is  --7 it' s placing a -- it' s a poor tax. It' s placing a8 high percentage rent increase on those tenants  who 9 can least afford it.10 And I think that the impact --  I11 think the board needs to look at whether it' s  worth 12 it to assess, assess a minimum increase on what  are 13 probably very low, the very lowest of the  low 14 income of New York City as opposed to what  possible 15 benefit there is to owner income. I think that' s16 something that needs to be looked at. If that' s17 going to be on the agenda again for this year,   and 18 I hope that it' s not, but if it is, I think that' s19 something that has to be seriously looked at  and 20 discussed.21 The other thing is that we  have 22 the possibility of this year of thousands of  units 23 possibly coming back under the rent  stabilization 24 program that haven' t been taken off.25 ( Audience participation.)2 
2 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And there needs 3 to be some consideration of what the effect will  be 4 of those units coming back under  rent 5 stabilization, if that' s going to happen. I' m sure 6 that people have already been looking at this.  You 7 know, I have no doubt that on the owner side   people 8 have looked at it big  time.9 And I think it' s something that 10 this board needs to consider.11 Finally, I think that the  board,12 and Adriene alluded to this, but last year we  were 13 told -- every year the board is given the PIOC,  the 14 Price Index of Operating Costs and we' re also given 15 a projection number as to what the  projected 16 increase is for the coming year.	And this last 17 year, if my memory serves me correct, last year  we 18 were told that the projected increase in the  PIOC 19 for this year would be 7 . 8 percent. And then when 20 we were presented with the PIOC about two  weeks 21 ago, we were told that it was, in fact,  four 22 percent.23 So I think the board needs to  look 24 at how much did the board rely on that  projected 25 PIOC of last year when they were setting  the 2 
2 current guideline years of rents and the fact  that 3 it' s virtually half of what was projected.	To me 4 it points toward strong, you know, strong  evidence 5 that the increases last year were excessive  and 6 that that has to be taken into consideration  when 7 the board is setting its increases for this  year,8 otherwise it would result in, you know, in  the 9 escalating process of year upon year of  excessive 10 increases that are compounded.11 Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	But not -- but 13 I assume you' re opposed to this motion?14 ( Audience participation.)15 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Chairman, Mr.16 Chairman.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.18 MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Chairman, I just 19 want to just --20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Cruz, go 21 ahead.22 MS. CRUZ:	-- make a comment --23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.24 MS. CRUZ:	-- to Mr. Languedoc' s25 points, just as to two points in  particular.2 
2 I take serious issue with  his 3 suggestion that this board ought to consider  the 4 possibility of apartments going back into  rent 5 stabilization based on a case that is  currently 6 before the Court of Appeals that will not even  hear 7 arguments until after our deliberative process  is 8 over and may very well reverse the  Appellate 9 Division Order.10 So I believe that that  point 11 should be completely disregarded by this  board.12 And secondly, regarding the 13 minimum rent increase. It seems to me that  the 14 testimony we have thus far heard, and I' m sure  we 15 will hear further testimony that, in fact,  the 16 persons that are impacted by the rent increase  that 17 was enacted last year based on the length of  time 18 that a tenant is in occupancy, and the  minimum 19 rent that that tenant ought to pay, benefits  people 20 that are paying way below market and ought to  have 21 some amount of adjustment to their rents  --22 ( Audience participation.)23 MS. CRUZ:	And the majority of 24 the owners that have these types of tenants  in 25 their buildings are the smaller owners.	So I take 2 
2 issue with the characterization that it is a  poor 3 tax. It is far, far from a poor  tax.4 ( Audience participation.)5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any additional 6 debate?7 ( No response.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Call the 9 question.

I  just 5 wish to say that we' re going to pass on making  a6 motion at this preliminary hearing this year and  we 7 will await the deliberative process.	I' m hoping 8 that it would be a more -- that the process   between 9 now and the final vote will be a better  process 10 than it was last year.11 And I look forward to hearing  what 12 the vote is going to be for this evening and   having 13 a strong debate about it and going forward  from 14 there.15 ( Applause.)16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I find it 19 unfortunate that the tenant members won' t put forth 20 a proposal.	There is nothing in our statute  that 21 requires us to make every apartment affordable  to 22 every tenant nor make every building a function  as 23 a -- as a non- distressed property where expenses 24 exceed rents.25 It is a deliberative process.  It 2 
2 is a process. I just find it unfortunate that   the 3 tenant members are unwilling at this moment  to 4 participate and share their views or share  their 5 motion with the rest of the  board.6 ( Audience participation.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure, Mr.8 Languedoc. Go ahead.9 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I think I' ve 10 said a lot of things this evening about the --   what 11 occurred last year, what my thoughts are on  the 12 process that took place last year, what my  thoughts 13 are on the vote that took place last year, what   my 14 thoughts are on the numbers that were  passed.15 And I also made a lot of  comments 16 with respect to this year and what I think  the 17 board needs to look at going forward. And so  I18 don' t think that I -- I think that I -- it' s  for 19 the tenant community. And since I' m a tenant 20 representative, I think it' s for the tenant 21 community to judge, and the Mayor I suppose,  you 22 know, whether or not I' ve served, you know --23 serving them as their representative.24 I simply don' t -- don' t wish to 25 make a motion right now.2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.3 MS. HOLDER:	Okay. And I would 4 also like to say that I think it has been --  it' s5 been clear since my time on this board in 2002   that 6 I' ve always made my views clear.7 I don' t think that my views could 8 be any more clearer up to this point of the   process 9 and in the seven years that I' ve served on  the 10 board.11 So having said that, again, I  too 12 look forward to how this process is going to   unfold 13 for the rest of our spring.	And I look forward to 14 what other motions are going to be offered by  the 15 public members as well as any owner members, but  I16 pass at this time.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.18 The Chair has a motion: I  move 19 to --20 ( Audience participation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I move to 22 adopt the language of the proposed amendment  on 23 Loft Order 41 as read into the record at  this 24 meeting, and I move to adopt the following  proposed 25 rental adjustments for rent stabilized  apartments 2

Again, this is a  range.3 For a two- year lease commencing on 4 or after October 1 , 2009 and on or before  September 5 30 , 2010 , four to seven- and- a- half or $ 40 to $ 75 6 whichever is greater.7 No vacancy allowance is permitted 8 except as provided by Section 19 and 20 of the   Rent 9 Regulation Reform Act of 1997 .10 A sublet allowance of ten  percent.11 For LOFTS.12 For one- year increase periods 13 commencing on or after October 1 , 2009 and on  or 14 before September 20 , 2010 , two to four- and- a- half 15 percent.16 For a two- year increase periods 17 commencing on or after October 1 , 2009 and on  or 18 before September 30 , 2010 , four to seven- and- a- half 19 percent.20 SPECIAL GUIDELINE.21 For dwelling units subject to  the 22 Rent and Rehabilitation Law on September 30 , 2009 23 which become vacant after September 30 , 2010 , the 24 special guideline should be the greater  of:25 ( 1 ) fifty percent above the 2

2 authorized to promulgate rent guidelines  governing 3 hotel units subject to the Rent Stabilization  Law 4 of 1969 , as amended, and the Emergency Tenant 5 Protection Act of 1974 , as amended.6 The purpose of these guidelines  is 7 to implement the public policy set forth  in 8 Findings and Declaration of Emergency of the  Rent 9 Stabilization Law of 1969 (§ 26 - 501 of the N. Y. C.10 Administrative Code) and in the  Legislative 11 Findings contained in the Emergency Tenant 12	Protection Act of 1974 ( L. 1974 c. 576 , § 4 [§ 2 ].)13 Do we have any motions?14 MS. CRUZ:	I have a motion.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Magda.16 MS. CRUZ:	Based on the price 17 index for all stabilized hotels increasing  by 18 three- and- a- half this year, with the increases in 19 taxes being 14 . 1 percent, even higher than 20 apartments, I move that the increases for  all 21 hotels:	The residential Class A, the  lodging 22 housings, the rooming houses, the Class B  hotels,23 and the SROs be at least three- and- a- half percent.24 And I further request that it  be 25 -- that there be a vacancy allowance of at   least 13 
2 three- and- a- half percent and that the proviso in 3 the pre- existing order be renewed.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Excuse me. You 5 said three- and- a- half and what?6 MS. CRUZ:	Yes.

SCHLEIDER:	At 85 percent.19 MS. CRUZ:	At 85 percent.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any 21 discussion?22 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Well, yeah, I' d23 like to make a comment.	Hello?24 Okay.	Mr. Chair, just to recap.25 We had what I thought was  an 2 
2 excellent presentation by the -- some of the  staff 3 of the SRO Law Project who documented to us   that,4 or indicated to us that they could not identify  one 5 SRO building where there were 85 percent  units 6 occupied by tenants paying the legal rent or  less 7 where there was not some serious indication  of 8 harassment, demands for additional charges,9 improper services and the like, and that  they 10 indicated that there were clients -- that they  were 11 having to devote considerable resources to  defend 12 against illegal rent increases, you know,  contrary 13 to the orders of this  board.14 And in contrast, we heard  once 15 again nothing from owners of SRO buildings.	And I16 feel that until such time as any responsible  owners 17 of SRO buildings come forward to this board and  in 18 a reasonable manner, not just a scattered one  or 19 two as there may have been over a period of   years,20 and that they provide us with any data that we   can 21 seriously look at and consider, that it' s not 22 appropriate for the board to consider any kind  of 23 rent increase for hotel units this  year.24 And I would -- and I' m speaking 25 obviously in opposition to the  motion.2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You said two 5 things, Ron:	First, the testimony from the hotel 6 tenant advocates was a bit shaky  --7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You seconded 8 it.9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I didn' t second 10 it.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You didn' t12 second Ms. --13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	We' re just 14 having conversations now.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I think we 16 can' t have conversations until somebody seconds.17 You don' t have to vote for it.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right. I19 second it then. But we had a conversation  already 20 without a second.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I' m sorry.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So if you needed 23 it seconded, now it' s seconded.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I thought you 25 had seconded it.2 
2MR. SCHLEIDER:Sorry.Thank 3you.4CHAIRMAN MARKUS:I took you for 5granted.I' msorry.6MR. SCHLEIDER:Please don' t.7 They couldn' t identify or they 8 were unwilling to identify those hotels where  the 9 landlords have kept at least 85 percent of  the 10 units occupied by rent stabilized hotel  tenants.11 They didn' t say that it didn' t12 exist.	They said they couldn' t identify it, but 13 they also said that they understand that there  are 14 owners who are playing ball, playing by the  rules,15 good owners. They did say  that.16 Second, and in the packet that  the 17 staff provided to us on the day of that  meeting,18 there was testimony from the hotel owner' s head, as 19 there was last year, that you either missed  it,20 elected not to see it, or just ignored it in   the 21 hope that the rest of this board, which is  taking 22 your word that the testimony wasn' t present, I23 find, again, an unfortunate situation and  an 24 unfortunate action by the tenant  members.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Any 7 

2	more discussion?345	respond.6
Mr. Languedoc.MR. LANGUEDOC:	Well, just to The written statement which was  in 
7 our packet, it was virtually the same  written 8 statement that we have received annually. This  is 9 my third year on this board.	I think it was too 10 vague to form a basis for any conclusion that  a11 rent increase is needed or  warranted.12 I think --13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Look -- I' m14 sorry.15 MR. LANGUEDOC:	The fact that --16 the fact that no representative of the  industry 17 came to testify even though they were invited to  do 18 so and the board set aside time in its agenda   for 19 them to be here and they choose not to come,   I20 think that speaks for itself.21 And I think that the evidence,  the 22 clear evidence is that this is an area of   housing 23 in the City where rent increases, you know,  passed 24 by this board is not going to have any effect,   any 25 positive effect on responsible ownership and  that 7 
2 the best thing for this board to do is to not   --3 not pass any increase.4 It may very well be that the  City 5 Council or the State Legislature or other  bodies 6 need to look at this, this issue with  more 7 seriousness.	I for one was deeply distressed   by 8 the testimony from Mr. Brook and the others  from 9 the SRO Law Project about the kind of  harassment 10 that' s being experienced by these individuals.11 I think this matter is beyond  the 12 jurisdiction of this board. I think that the  only 13 thing that this board can do is to decide what   rent 14 increase should be granted based on what  evidence 15 is before it. And in this case there is no   evidence 16 that any rent increase should be  given.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, Mr.19 Schleider.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Again, I find it 21 distressing that Ron has such a high level  and 22 expectation of testimony that needs to come  before 23 this board before he' ll consider it.24 Second, if he disqualifies 25 testimony because it seems to be a rehashing or  a2 
2 reiteration of prior years and prior years  and 3 prior years' testimony, I think he best look at  the 4 balance of the testimony that we' ve heard this past 5 year.6 Third, no one on this  board 7 condones any illegal activity. We' ve made that 8 clear at the meetings. In fact, when the  testimony 9 came across from the advocates from the tenants  in 10 these hotels, I don' t think there was anybody on 11 the board that disagreed that harassment does  occur 12 and those landlords who are practicing that  are 13 breaking the law.14 Fourth, if there are the 15 responsible owners, if you characterize  thankfully,16 why not have them participate in some cost  coverage 17 for the rising expenses that they' ve suffered over 18 the past few years.19 We are keeping the proviso  in 20 which last year was, the threshold percentage  was 21 increased. We' re keeping that at that level in 22 recognition that there may be only a  few 23 responsible owners who may be able to legally  take 24 advantage of that increase. I think it' s a  valid 25 motion and I expect the board to come positively  to 2 

2	it.34
Thank you, Mr. Chair.CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Ms. Cruz,
5 do you accept an amendment that would change  the 6 three- and- a- half percent or a range of two to 7 four- and- a- half, eliminate the vacancy allowance,8 and stay with the 85 percent  proviso?9 MS. CRUZ:	Yes.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. I so 11 move. We' re in acceptance.12 So now any additional discussion?13 MS. HOLDER:	I just want to 14 reiterate for the record that we all know that  this 15 is the housing of last resort for so many  --16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	This is the 17 what?18 MS. HOLDER:	Housing of last 19 resort for so many people. I just -- this to me   is 20 just one of those things where we' re seeing less 21 and less of these units.22 For those owners who may be  acting 23 responsibly -- and, you know, we may have met  one 24 or two in the last seven years I' ve served on  this 25 board that have shown up.	I' m not saying that they 5 
2 don' t exist. I have only met one or two  that 3 appeared before us -- what we do know is that   many 4 of them are renting those other units at rates  that 5 more than cover their costs.6 And, again, I would just like  for 7 this board to seriously consider what it is  that 8 we' re doing at a time of decreased legal services,9 of decreased tenant organizers and folks who can  go 10 out and educate the community of hotel residents  as 11 to what their rights are and for a group of   people 12 who just by virtue of where they live and  their 13 economic level, which is low and documented  as 14 such, just do not necessarily have the  wherewithal 15 nor can retain the type of assistance that  they 16 need in this economic climate of declining  free 17 civil legal services and tenant organizing, to  be 18 able to ensure that they are no longer harassed  or 19 subject to any type of unlawful  increases.20 And so I just would like for  the 21 board to understand that this is not prudent  at 22 this time to be putting these types of increases  in 23 hotels. I just think it opens up these group  of 24 tenants to further abuse.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair.2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes, sir.3 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Ms. Holder, I4 appreciate your passion for the tenants and to  the 5 advocacy that you promote.	However, I got the 6 feeling from your comment that you' re asking this 7 board to subsidize tenant advocacy positions 8 because they don' t have the funding themselves.9 Needless -- regardless of that,  an 10 85 percent proviso that the owner members  have 11 elected to keep in I think speaks loudly to   the 12 fact that we recognize that this is a   housing 13 situation of last resort. And I' m quite 14 disappointed that you don' t take the spirit of the 15 motion as it' s given.16 We recognize that the responsible 17 owners may only represent a fraction of the  hotel 18 owners, but yet their needs and their rights  need 19 to be respected.20 Thank you.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Motion 22 before the floor is that the allowable level  of 23 rent adjustment over lawful rent actually  charged 24 and paid on September 30 , 2009 shall be:25 1 ) for Residential Class A2 
2 ( apartment) hotels:	Two to four- and- a- half percent.3 2 ) for Lodging houses - two to 4 four- and- a- half percent.5 3 ) for Rooming houses ( Class B6 containing less than 30 units - two to four- and- a7 half percent.8 4 ) for Class B hotels - two to 9 four- and- a- half percent.10 5 ) Single Room Occupancy buildings 11 ( Multiple Dwelling Law section 248 SRO' s) - two to 12 four- and- a- half percent.13 No vacancy allowance, and 14 The hotel provisos shall read:15 Except that the allowable level of 16 rent adjustments over the lawful rent  actually 17 charged and paid on September 30 , 2009 should be 18 zero percent if a permanent, rent stabilized  or 19 rent controlled tenants paying no more than  the 20 legal regulated rent, at the time that any  rent 21 increase in this Order would otherwise  be 22 authorized, constitute few than 85 percent of  all 23 units in a building that are used or occupied,  or 24 intended, arranged or designed to be used  or 25 occupied in whole or in part as the home,  residence 2 
2 or sleeping place of one or	more human beings.3 So that' s the motion.4 I' ll call the roll.5 Ms. Adams.6 MS. ADAMS:	Pass.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Adams 8 passes.9 Ms. Cruz.10 MS.
