Jonathan17 
2 L. Kimmel, Chair, New York City Rent  Guidelines3 Board.4 I now turn -- as has been done  in5 the past, we alternate.	I turn to the owner6 representatives for a proposal.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you, Mr.8 Chairman.9 Thank you to the members of  the10 board and to those citizens attending the  meeting11 tonight.12 First, I' d like to take this13 moment to welcome the newly appointed  public14 members to the board, Tanya Levy- Odom and Carol15 Shine, as well as the newly appointed  tenant16 member, Harvey Epstein.17 I wish them luck and a  long18 productive tenure on this board.19 As background, the findings of  the20 City Council in enacting the Rent Stabilization  Law21 of 1969 and the State Legislature adopting  the22 Emergency Protection Act of 1974 , clearly23 established that fair and generally affordable24 rents are a primary objective of these laws  --25 generally affordable.2 
2 Right now, thousands of affordable3 units are being built in the City with a mix  of4 public and private funding and various re- zoning5 initiatives alone produce more than 3 , 3006 affordable homes.7 ( Audience participation.)8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	These are all9 good things and more affordable housing is  needed.10 Mr. Chairman, I' m not going to use11 my time to go over the points I' ve made in  the12 past, that more affordable housing is needed  just13 to replace the conversion of rent stabilized  rental14 apartments to ownership apartments, and that  the15 pace of conversion will increase as owners  are16 forced to subsidize rising real estate taxes  and17 unfunded public policy mandates;18 I' m not going to spend time19 speaking about that more affordable housing  is20 needed just to replace the rent stabilized  units21 lost to deregulation.22 ( Audience participation.)23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And the pace of24 deregulation will increase as owners struggle  to25 meeting rising insurance costs;2 
2 That more affordable housing is3 needed to shift the growing burden of  preserving4 below- market rent stabilized rents against the5 reality of rapidly escalating fuel oil, water  and6 sewer, electricity, administrative and maintenance7 costs.	And that the cost of operating  affordable8 rent stabilized housing keep going up year  after9 year;10 I' m not going to speak to the11 board' s data showing that operating costs increased12 again.	I' m not going to speak to the fact that  the13 number of distressed properties is  still14 problematic.	Clearly, low interest rates and prior15 rent increases have not been sufficient to  lessen16 the burden;17 I' m not going to use my time to18 speak to the numerous indications that  operating19 expenses are continuing to escalate higher.20 ( Audience participation)21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And I' m not going22 to use my time to speak about legislators  providing23 subsidy programs and passing zoning initiatives  to24 create new neighborhoods without helping those  at25 risk who spent many years in their  old2 
2 neighborhoods where their friends and roots  are.3 But I will speak that we need  more4 programs like SCRIE to provide assistance to  our5 elderly tenants at risk of falling behind in  their6 rent.7 We need more programs like SCRIE8 to finally recognize and provide better  rent9 increase relief to our non- senior citizen disabled10 tenants on fixed incomes.11 The legislators need to expand the12 SCRIE program eligibility by increasing income13 thresholds to include a larger percentage of  our14 at- risk families.15 I' ve said in the past, why not16 expand the SCRIE programs to recognize a  broader17 tenant base to provide relief to more tenants  from18 rent increases.19 I will speak that we need  programs20 to provide rent increase relief.	To preserve the21 rent stabilized housing stock, we need long- term22 government programs, not a wishful, one- shot deal23 at the owners' expense.	Maybe this year the24 elected officials can work towards expanding  SCRIE25 and create workable rent increase exemption2 
2 programs for all eligible tenants in  place.3 I will speak about the  vast4 majority of landlords. This large number  of5 landlords who own small buildings, about 40  percent6 of the regulated rental housing stock is  in7 buildings of less than 11 units.	And they struggle8 to keep their property from  deteriorating;9 I will speak about that these  are10 the gatekeepers of the existing affordable  housing11 stock;12 I will speak that these13 gatekeepers are the private citizens that the  City14 has forced to shoulder a public cost with  higher15 real estate taxes, water and sewer charges  and16 dozens of administrative fees and a  consistent17 stream of unfunded public policy mandates  without18 commensurate rent increases.19 Additionally, unfunded public20 policy mandates put upon the landlords are not  fair21 and need to be addressed.22 I will speak that with your  help23 we can tell the elected officials to think  issues24 through completely and shift responsibilities off25 the landlords;2 
2 I will speak that no board  member3 denies there are tenants one paycheck away  from4 hardship, that there are tenants in desperate  need5 of assistance to merely make  ends meet.	That there6 are tenants who simply cannot afford their  current7 rent let alone any increase.	This is of concern to8 the board but we are powerless to address  it.9 And we' ve heard testimony that10 these tenants are not the poorest of the  poor11 tenants.	We' ve heard testimony that the poorest of12 the poor are in housing of  last resort.	That --13 and that will be addressed by the vote for  hotel14 apartments, but not this vote.15 I speak that not all landlords  are16 in need of a large rent  increase.17 I will speak that there are18 landlords in such dire economic conditions that  a19 mere rent increase will not help  their plight.	But20 I will speak, and I will speak loudly, that  the21 vast majority of landlords need and count on  the22 rent increases passed by this board;23 I will speak, and I will  speak24 loudly, that the vast majority of landlords rely  on25 the rent increases passed by this board to  maintain2 
2 their rental properties for the good of  their3 communities;4 I will speak about how do you  make5 it work so it' s equitable and generally affordable.6 Four out of five tenants can afford to share  the7 burden.8 I will speak that four out of  five9 tenants can pay their fair share.10 I will speak that the board' s data11 doesn' t show the real increase in building12 operating costs.13 I will speak that the board' s data14 underestimates major cost increases and real  estate15 taxes and doesn' t even consider many important16 costs or cost increases.17 I will speak that the landlord' s18 position is worse off than the data  shows.19 And as such, for both apartments20 and lofts, as applicable, the owners members'  move21 for a greater of a 7 percent or $ 70 per  month22 increase on a one- year renewal lease, and the23 greater of an 11 percent or $ 110 per month  increase24 on a two- year renewal lease.25 Furthermore, a vacancy allowance,2 
2 5 percent in addition to whatever other  vacancy3 allowance is allowed under the Real Property  Law.4 Sublet allowance, 10 percent.5 Special adjustments under prior6 Orders are to be continued.7 Special guideline for8 de- controlled units, the greater of 100 percent9 above maximum base rent or the fair market rent  as10 established by HUD, adjusted for whether the  tenant11 pays their own gas and/ or electric charges as part12 of their rent, as such gas and/ or electric charges13 are accounted for by the New York City  Housing14 Authority.15 Thank you, Mr. Chair.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider,17 unfortunately, I was distracted.	Could you please18 repeat your proposal.19 A VOICE:	Repeat the whole thing,20 why don' t you?21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.	My22 pleasure.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	One year.24 MR.

CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	No, I just wantMS. CRUZ:	And then -- and then  IMR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you. CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:		Not the wholeMR. SCHLEIDER:	Aww --( Laughter.)MR. SCHLEIDER:	As such, for both
13 apartments and lofts, as applicable, the  owner14 members move for the greater of a 7 percent or  $ 7015 per month increase on a one- year renewal lease.16 And the greater of an 11 percent or $ 110 per  month17 increase on a two- year renewal lease.18 Vacancy allowance, 5 percent, in19 addition to whatever other vacancy allowance  is20 allowed under the Real Property Law.21 Sublet allowance, 10 percent.22 Special adjustments under prior23 Orders are to be continued.24 Special guidelines for25 de- controlled units, the greater of 100 percent13 
2 amount maximum base rent or the fair market rent  as3 established by HUD, adjusted for whether the  tenant4 pays their own electric and/ or gas charges as part5 of their rent, as such gas and/ or electric charges6 are accounted for by the New York City  Housing7 Authority.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.9 Is there a second?10 MS. CRUZ:	I second.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz12 seconds.13 Is there any discussion?14 ( No response.)15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Call for a16 vote.17 Mr. Cheigh.18 MR. EPSTEIN:	I -- I had my  hand19 up.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Oh, I' m sorry.21 Harvey.22 MR. EPSTEIN:	Thank you, Mr.23 Chair.24 I -- so this is my first year  on25 the Guidelines Board.	But it' s my over 20 years as2 
2 being a tenant advocate in this community in  New3 York City, representing tens of -- probably tens  of4 thousands of individuals.5 And the idea here that four out  of6 five tenants can afford this increase, the  idea7 here that the vast majority of landlords need  this8 increase, really flies in the face of what  reality9 is.10 I have to say that, first of  all,11 most tenants at rent stabilized apartments are,  at12 best, struggling, at most, suffering.13 The reality here is that our  City14 is being taken over as -- as -- Steve, you said   by15 private equity companies who are taking  large16 swaths of lands, large swaths of buildings  and17 trying to centralize their management, centralize18 their function and in return destroying the  quality19 of lives and the lives of all these rent  stabilized20 tenants.21 And the idea that we give them  a22 bonus of giving them 7 percent and 11 percent  on23 top of a vacancy allowance, on top of the   existing24 MCIs they' re trying to collect off the backs of  low25 income tenants all over the City, flies in the  face2 

2	of reality.3
It flies in the face of  everything
4 we believe in.	That this is a fair and  equitable5 process.	That the people who are here, the  people6 who are struggling in New York to try to stay   and7 maintain their lives, can afford this, is  beyond8 the pale.9 The minimum wage - people who  are10 living on minimum wage, more than minimum wage,  can11 barely afford the rents that we  set.12 The average income in rent13 stabilized apartments as we know is $ 38 , 000 .	The14 rents are over $ 1 , 000 .	They' re already paying more15 than 30 percent of their income  towards rent.	The16 idea that they can take this is unfathomable to  me.1718 And I encourage the board to  vote19 no.20 Thank you.21 ( Applause.)22 MR.

EPSTEIN:	Thank you, Chair.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Epstein.24 MR. EPSTEIN:	Thank you very25 much.18 
2 I also want to thank you  for3 welcoming me onto this board this year, as well  as4 my -- the two other public members, Carol  and5 Tanya.	I look forward to working with you  both6 over -- over the next few  years.7 And really on behalf of the  almost8 a million rent stabilized tenants, I want to  thank9 us all for taking our job and setting the  Rent10 Guidelines seriously with a lot of  deliberation.11 I just wanted to spend a  minute12 recapping what we' ve heard over the last few weeks.13 I think first and foremost what  we14 heard is that tenants are suffering.	As their own15 staff reported in the Income and  Affordability16 Study of 2013 , unemployment remains high.17 Evictions are up. Homelessness is at an all- time18 high.	People needing food stamps or SNAPS is  up.19 And real wages are way  down.20 I want to de- bunk the claim that21 most owners are not doing well.	As reported by22 both the RSA and tenant advocates, large  private23 equity companies are coming into New York  and24 purchasing large amounts of housing stock.	They' re25 buying large portfolios and trying to push out  our2 
2 low- income tenants and as well, as pushing out3 small landlords.4 In addition, vacancy decontrols5 has allowed many landlords to make  additional6 profits by renting out those vacant units to --  at7 extremely high rents.8 I also want to remind  everyone9 that mortgage rates remain really low at this  time.10 We heard from well- respected11 advocates telling us the struggle of New  Yorkers:12 Tom Waters;13 Bobby Sackman;14 Greg Joyce;15 Barika Williams;16 All painted a clear picture  of17 tenants no longer able -- being able to afford  any18 more rent increases.	They' re at the end of their19 ropes.	If they lose this housing, they' ll have no20 place to turn.21 Moreover, we were told that there22 are many programs that private landlords, who  are23 struggling, can access, 8 A, 7 A, PLP. They' re24 available to them to start major  capital25 improvements in their buildings that would  not2 
2 increase the rents to the tenants but allow  owners3 to improve the quality of their building. It' s4 really a win- win situation for us all.5 I' m also here to tell you a story6 about people, the real people out there.	Tenants7 are struggling to keep their homes and  survive.8 This board will make -- be making decisions  that9 will affect whether people will choose to pay  their10 rent or have enough food  to eat.	Pay the rent or11 purchase their medication.	Pay their rent or buy12 books for their children.13 This is what we' re talking about14 today.	And when we decide to vote, I' d like to15 keep these families in mind.	I actually do.16 I think of a family of a  former17 client of mine.	She worked hard as a  carpenter.18 Actually, she was one of the first African- American19 carpenters in a union here in New  York City.	She20 raised two kids here in New  York City.	She remains21 in her rent stabilized apartment even though  her22 kids have moved off to go into  college.23 Our rent increases will help her24 determine whether she can stay in her home or  not.25 Let us be humane.	Let us have compassion here.2 
2 Let us balance of the equities of what  the3 landlords need and what the tenants need and let' s4 come to a fair and reasonable  outcome.5 If we think just of  landlords'6 costs and not the human consequences to  tenants,7 then I don' t believe we' ve done our job here.	Our8 job is to look at the overall picture and not   carve9 out a solution for a few New Yorkers or a   few10 landlords.11 And I' d like to make a motion for12 the apartment increases, I' d like zero percent for13 a one- year and zero percent for a two- years.14 I' d like a zero percent sublet15 allowance and a special guidelines allowance of  2016 percent.17 Thank you, Chair.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.19 Epstein.20 Is there a second?21 MR.

But when he starts interjecting the  social6 justice bias and --7 ( Audience participation.)8 MR.

And I would also like  to12 take the time to thank the staff of the  Rent13 Guidelines Board for the work that they have  done14 which brings us to this point  today.15 In addition to that, before I  do16 make a proposal, I' d like to state that I do  look17 forward to the public comments that will  be18 presented to this board on June 13 th because public19 testimony is an integral part of the rent- setting20 process, a part that is taken seriously by me  and21 by all of these board members who share this  table22 with me.23 In addition, you will also find24 that although I am not including in my motion  any25 reference to a fixed dollar or minimum  rent10 
 2 adjustment, I welcome hearing comments on that  in3 public testimony.4 With this in mind, I move to  adopt5 the following language of the proposed  Apartment6 and Loft Order, 45 , as read into the record at  this7 meeting.8 And I move to adopt the  following9 proposed rental adjustments for rent  stabilized10 apartments and lofts:11 For a one- year lease, a range of 12	3 . 25 to 6 . 25 ;13 For a two- year lease, a range of 514 to 9 . 5 percent;15 A sublet allowance of 10  percent;16 No vacancy allowance permitted17 except as provided by Sections 19 and 20 of  the18 Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1997 .19 For lofts:20 For a one- year lease, a range of 21	3 . 25 to 6 . 25 ;22 For two- year leases, a range of 523 to 9 . 5 percent;24 There shall be no vacancy25 allowance proposed;22 
2 The special guideline, 30 percent3 above the maximum base rent, the greater of  304 percent above the maximum base rent or the  fair5 market rent for existing housing as established  by6 the United States Department of Housing and  Urban7 Development for the New York City  primary8 metropolitan statistical area pursuant to  Section9 8 C 1 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 ,10 42 USC, Section 14 . 37 . f. c. 1 and 24 CFR Part 888 , with11 such fair market rents to be adjusted based  upon12 whether the tenant pays his or her own gas  and/ or13 electric charges as part of his or her rent,  as14 such gas and/ or electric charges are accounted for15 the New York City Housing  Authority.16 Such HUD determined fair market17 rents will be published in the federal register  to18 take effect on October 1 , 2013 .19 To summarize in accordance with my20 motion, you are voting on the adjustments I  have21 proposed and the proposed language of the  Order.22 Is there a second to my  motion?23 MS.

13 amendment that I would hope that you would  consider14 is that the board has thought about  the15 supplemental increases and has voted for it  in16 previous hearings before last year and then  voted17 for one last year.18 And I know you are putting on  the19 table that it will be open for discussion,  the20 minimum increases, and the building owners  had21 proposed arguments stating that they feel  that22 because rent increases are not, either because  of23 preferential rents or because building owners  want24 to maximize on the rent they can collect from  the25 lowest -- lowest rented apartments, that they  push13 
2 for supplemental increases.3 One argument that we' ve made to4 dissuade that is to state that this -- these  are5 the lowest income residents who reside in  the6 lowest rent apartments.7 But we also make -- want to  make8 the point that there are a substantial number  of9 properties that have, perhaps, a very  small10 percentage of rent stabilized units in  comparison11 to decontrolled units within the larger  properties.12 So I would hope that the  board13 would consider, you will the consider the  friendly14 amendment that for properties larger than 30  units15 that where 60 percent or more of the units are   not16 -- are not regulated or are not controlled  or17 non- rent stabilized, that for those buildings, that18 they should not receive any  increases.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.20 I reject that also.21 ( Audience participation.)22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	It now23 calls for a vote.24 MR. EPSTEIN:	Chair, I do,25 actually, have another question.2 

23	Epstein.4
CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes, Mr.MR. EPSTEIN:	Yeah, I' m wondering
5 about the idea -- this balance of equities  that6 you' re -- we' re trying to raise here and the issue7 of the -- the need for the owners who  have8 additional expenses versus the issue of  tenant9 affordability.10 And I' m wondering if there are11 scenarios that you' re talking about here where the12 owners who are sufficiently making private  profit13 from the non- regulated units in their building,14 that there was any opportunity, whether  6015 percent' s the number or not, where there would be16 some sense where, like in the situation with  the17 SROs, that there are so many market- rate units in18 that building that the ones that are left are  just19 holding on, there would be any opportunity to  have20 some kind of balance of not having a   substantial21 increase for those units as well as you' re22 proposing as an across- the- board increase?23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	It is something24 that, again, is open to  the testimony.	But I am25 not accepting any changes to my proposal at  this5 

2	point.3
MR. EPSTEIN:	Yeah, I' m not asking
4 for a change.	I' m asking for an answer to a5 question.6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	What was the7 question?8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	The answer,9 basically, is we get the data.	We listen to what10 people what say.11 A VOICE:	You do not listen to12 what the people say.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes, we do.14 Yes, we do.15 A VOICE:	No, you do not.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And we don' t17 come with set minds here.18 MR.

23456	proposal.7
I now open the floor.  I believe, Ms. Cruz -- MS. CRUZ:	Yes.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	-- has aMS. CRUZ:	Chairman, I -- I
8 propose that the rent adjustment over the  lawful9 rent actually charged and paid on September 30 th,10 2013 for the following classes of hotel  units:11 Residential Class A.12 Apartment hotels.13 Lodging houses.14 Rooming houses.15 Class B hotels; and,16 SRO, be 3 percent.17 In addition, I would move for a  1018 percent vacancy allowance as permitted.19CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:Is there a20second?21MR. SCHLEIDER:Second.22CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:Mr. Schleider23seconds.24Is there discussion?25Mr. Cheigh.
2 MR. CHEIGH:	I know last year that3 the building owner representatives themselves had4 introduced provisos regarding what classes of5 buildings may take these increases.	And I hope6 that the building owners would also consider  that7 this year in their suggestions for increases  for8 hotels and SROs.9 MS. CRUZ:	No, I don' t -- I10 don' t --11 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Not at this point.12 MS. CRUZ:	-- consider it for the13 reasons that I don' t think it is good public  policy14 to create different types of housing just based  on15 the fact that they are necessarily located in  a16 building where some rents are higher than  others.17 We are talking based on  the18 regulated units in a building. And if the data  that19 was presented to us justifies increases because  the20 cost of managing and operating those units  warrant21 an increase, then it should be proper to impose  an22 increase for these tenants.23 And to argue, as you do,  that24 those increased costs should be made up by  market25 rents only serves to inflate market  rents2 
2 artificially and I do not subscribe to  that.3 ( Audience participation.)4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.5 Mr. Epstein.6 MR. EPSTEIN:	I just want to7 speak on this issue as  well.8 I -- I mean, we heard  unopposed9 testimony that said that any rent increase for  this10 population means that they' re just going to be out.11 And the idea that we think a hotel operator  who12 still has, you know, 20 SRO units left in  a13 100 - unit or 200 - unit hotel, that the 3 percent14 increases changes the operating costs for  them,15 doesn' t seem to work in my mind.16 It really is the difference17 between them eating or not. And here the  difference18 for the owner is trying to get the tenant out   or19 not.	Not that they need the cost in   operating20 their buildings.	Whether it' s that they' re getting21 $ 10 , 000 a month from the hotel unit or $ 12 , 000 a22 month from a unit or $ 8 , 000 a month from the unit,23 it makes no difference in relationship to  what24 those SRO tenants are paying.25 The 3 percent doesn' t make a2 
2 difference to the owner. It only makes a  difference3 to the tenant.4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.

Is there a proposal from  theMR. CHEIGH:	Yes, Chairman -- CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Cheigh.MR. CHEIGH:	-- Kimmel, I' d like
24 to propose zero percent increases for  hotel25 classifications and that there be no  vacancy24 

2	allowance.3
And I propose this within  the
4 light, you know, within the testimonies that we' ve5 heard throughout the -- from probably our  best6 advocates in the housing side on the SRO  units.7 And I feel that every year we' ve8 heard the same testimonies regarding the  hardship9 of the residents and the market opportunities  for10 the building operators to convert these  into11 hotels.12 And I know that last year that  the13 board voted for zero percent increases across  the14 board without consideration for any kind  of15 percentage provisos because of the difficulties  of16 trying to enforce rent increases even where you  had17 a high threshold of, let' s say, 85 percent, which18 were voted on in the past to try to find   those19 units where -- to justify that 85 percent of  the20 units are, indeed, market rate or no longer --  or21 no longer regulated.22 With those -- with those  hardships23 that the tenants face in just making ends  meet24 along with the hardships of trying to  regulate25 these properties properly, I hope that the  board4 
2 will seriously consider zero percent increases3across theboard.4Thank you.5CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.6Cheigh.7Is there a second?8MR.
