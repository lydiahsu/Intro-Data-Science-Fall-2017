2	P R O C E E D I N G  S34	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good5 evening .6 My name is Marvin Markus and  I'm7 Chairman of the New York City Rent  Guidelines8 Board.9 (Audience participation. )10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I would like11 to welcome you to this, the final meet ing in one12 of a series of public hearings and  public13 meetings  designed to - -14 (Audience participation. )15 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	- - fulfill16 the mandate that the Rent Guidelines Board  has17 pursuant to the Rent Stabilization Law  to18 promulgate  the annual allowable lease adjustment19 for various classes of rent stabilized  property.20 We are going first to the  so-21 called hotel guideline.22 For purposes of the record I  am23 going to read in the proposed guideline that   was24 adopted by the Board as a preliminary  guideline25 back about a month  ago .5 
2 Let me read this to the  Board3 here.4 New York City Rent  Guidelines5 Board.6	Notice  is hereby given7 New York City Rent  Guidelines8 Board.9	Notice is hereby given pursuant10 to the authority vested in the New York City  Rent11 Guidelines Board by the Rent Stabilization Law   of12 1969, as amended, and the Emergency  Tenant13 Protection Act of 1974, as amended , implemented14 by Resolution No. 276 of 1974 of the New  York15 City Council and extended by Chapter 82 of  the16 Laws of 2003 , and in accordance with the17 requirements of Section 1043 of the New York   City18 Charter, that the Rent Guidelines Board  hereby19 proposes the following levels of fair  rent20 increases over lawful rents charged   - -21 (Audience participation. )22 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	- - and paid23 on September 30 , 2004.24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	This order10 
2 shall apply to units in buildings subject to  the3 Hotel Section of the Rent Stabilization  Laws,4 Sect ions 26 - 504(c) and 26- 506 of the New York5 City Administrat ive Code, as amended , or the6 Emergency Tenant Protect ion Act of 1974, Law7 1974, Chapter 576, Subdivision 4, Subsection  8	5(a)(7).9	With respect to any tenant  who10 has no lease or rental agreement , the level of11 rent increase established herein shall  be12 effective as of one year from the date of  the13 tenant 's commencing occupancy, or as of one year14 from the date of the last rent adjustment  charged15 to the tenant , or as of October 1, 2004,16 whichever  is later.17 This anniversary date will  also18 serve as the effective date for all  subsequent19 Rent Guideline Board Hotel Orders, unless  the20 Board shall specif ically provide otherwise in  the21 Order.22 Where a lease or rental23 agreement is in effect , this Order shall govern24 the rent increase applicable on or after October25 1, 2004 upon expiration of such lease or  rental
2 agreement , but in no event prior to one year from3 the commencement date of the expiring  lease,4 unless the parties have contracted to be bound  by5 the effect ive date of this Order.6 Proposed rent guidelines  for7 hotels, rooming houses, single room  occupancy8 buildings and lodging  houses.9 Pursuant to its mandate  to10 promulgate  rent adjustments for hotel units11 subject to the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969,   as12 amended, Section 26 - 510(e) of the New York City13 Administrat ive Code, the Rent Guidelines Board14 hereby proposes the following rent  adjustments:15 The allowable level of  rent16 adjustment over the lawful rent actually  charged17 and paid on September 30, 2004 shall  be:18 Now, to make it clear  to19 everybody, what we did last time was adopt  a20 range. So I'll be reading the range. The  actual21 guideline proposals will be based on  what22 individual Board Members propose and what  is23 adopted .24 So for resident ial Class A25 apartment hotels, zero to two  percent.
2 For lodging houses, zero to  two3 percent.4 For rooming houses, Class B,5 contain less than thirty units, zero to  two6 percent.7	Class B hotels, zero to  two8 percent.9 Single Room Occupancy  buildings,10 subject to the Mult iple Dwelling Law Section 24811 SROs, zero to two percent.12 To the extent that a  guideline13 is adopted above zero, the following shall  apply:14 Except that the allowable  level15 of rent adjustment over the lawful rent  actually16 charged and paid on September 30, 2004 shall  be17 zero if :18 Subclause 1, permanent rent19 stabilized or rent controlled tenants paying  no20 more than the legal regulated rent at the  time21 that any rent increase in this Order  would22 otherwise be authorized, constitute fewer  than23 seventy- five percent of all units in a building24 that  are used  or occupied , or intended , arranged25 or designed to be used or occupied in whol e or  in
2 part as the home, residence or sleeping place  of3 one or more human beings .4	Subsection 2, on any individual5 unit the owner has failed to provide to the  new6 occupant of that unit a copy of the Rights  and7 Duties of Hotel Owners and Tenants , pursuant to8 Section 2522.5 of the Rent Stabilizat ion Code.9 I will in a minute read  an10 explanatory statement to the extent that this  is11	adopted so that it is clear as to what the intent12 is .13 The next section, New  Tenancies.14 No vacancy allowance  is15 permitted under this Order . Therefore, the rents16 charged for tenancies commencing on or after17 October 1, 2004 and on or before September  30,18 2005 may not exceed the levels over  rentals19 charged on September 3 0, 2004 permitted under  the20 applicable  rent adjustment  provided  above .21 Additional charges.22 It is expressly understood  that23 the rents collectible under the terms of  this24 Order are intended to compensat e in full for all25 services provided without extra charge on the12 
2 statutory date for the particular hotel  dwelling3 unit or at the commencement of the tenancy  if4 subsequent thereto. No additional charges may  be5 made to a tenant for such services, however   such6 charges may be called or identif ied.7 Statement of basis and  purpose.8	The Rent Guidelines Board is9 authorized to promulgate  rent guidelines10 governing hotel units subject to the  Rent11 Stabilization Law of 1969, as amended, and  the12 Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974,  as13 amended.14 The purpose of these  guidelines15 is to implement the public policy set forth  in16 Findings and Declaration of Emergency of the  Rent17 Stabilization Law of 1969, Section 26- 501 of the18 New York City Administrative  Code, and in  the19 Legislative  Finding contained in the Emergency20 Tenant Protection Act of 1974, Laws of  1974,21 Chapter 576 , Section 4, Subsection 2.22 Let me read the  explanatory23 statement that applies to the proviso should   the24 proviso be adopted.25 If the permanent	rent stabilized
2 or rent controlled tenants, paying no more  than3 the legal regulated rent at the time that  any4 rent increase in this Order would otherwise  be5 authorized ,  constitute  fewer than  seventy- five6 percent of all the units in the building that   are7 used or occupied or intended, arranged or8 designed to be used or occupied in whole or   in9 part as the home, residence or sleeping place   of10 one or more human beings, then the Board' s11 intention for the meanings of this proviso  is12 that ALL  - in capitals  - dwelling units in   the13 hotel , whether occupied, vacant , or rented to14 tourists, transients,  contract  clients, students15 or other non- permanent	tenants, or to permanent16 rent stabilized tenants, be counted in  the17 denominator of the  calculation.18 The only type of units in  a19hotel that maybe excludedfrom the denominator20are units thatare used asstores or for similar21	business purposes,  such as doctor' s offices.22The numerator of the  calculation23is the numberof units occupied by permanent	rent24stabilized orrent controlled tenants.25And here are two  examples.
1	112 One hotel , the hotel has  1003 units and two stores. Thirty- two units are rented4 to permanent  rent stabilized tenants, ten are5 vacant and fifty- eight are rented to transients6 and tourists.7 The calculation is as  follows:8 The denominator is 100 and  the9 numerator is 32 . This calculation results in an10 occupancy percentage of less than seventy- five11 under the formula, 32 percent , and an increase12 CANNOT  -  all capitals  - be taken for the13 permanent	stabilized tenants.14 Example two . The hotel has 15015 units, two of which are used by a dentist and  a16 doctor for their businesses, eight are rented  to17 tourists, twenty are vacant and 120 are  occupied18 by permanent	rent stabilized tenants.19 The denominator would be 148  and20 the numerator would be 120. This calculat ion21 results in an occupancy percentage of GREATER  -22 all in caps - than 75 percent under the  formula,23 81 percent as a result , and an increase CAN - all24 in caps - be taken for the permanent  stabilized25 tenants.2 
1	122 That is, read into the record ,3 is what is before us.4 I indicate again that the  range5 was zero to two and that' s what we are going  to6 be discussing or any other thing. We will   take7 amendments to any other provisions that the  Board8 would like.9 To the extent you're offering  a10 zero or otherwise, please indicate whether you11 think the proviso is something that you would12 recommend.13 Yes, Liz.14 MS . LUSSKIN:	Thank you, Mr.15 Chairman.16 I realize that it 's somewhat of17 a departure for a public member to make the   first18 motion, but given the irrefutable state  of19 affairs of the residential housing stock, I   think20 we can put	we can cut to the  chase.21 The picture we are seeing,  both22 through the reports we receive and  from23 testimony, is one of unstoppable erosion of   this24 unique housing stock.25 The list of uses which  can2 
2 provide owners a rate of return several  hundred3 times great er than a stabilized tenant 's rent4 include not just privat e uses, such as tourist5 hotels, but also important public uses such  as6 homeless and other social service - based housing.7 The irony I assure you is not lost on  me.8 Not all of the changes  are9 legal , not all are illegal. But they all pay10 significantly more than the purpose for  which11 this housing was intended.12 As the Chairman remarked at  one13 of our earlier hearings this year, this  problem14 may not be beyond fixing, but it is beyond   the15 power of this Board to fix. No mere adjustment   to16 the rents could stem the tide of conversion   and17 no proviso to any adjustment can do so either.18 What we have seen is that we  can19 do unintentional harm to the very  vulnerable,20 ever dwindling population who occupies the21 remaining hotel units .22 We have heard of  numerous23 instances of a landlord who is not  legally24 entitled to a rent increase because of  the25 proviso or otherwise, nonetheless demanding one2 
2 of his tenants, particularly those who are  most3 subject to intimidation, as part of a  general4 pattern of actions designed to get them to  leave5 and make way for a more lucrat ive use.6	I , therefore, propose that we7 adopt a guideline of zero percent for all  hotel8 classes with appropriate  language included to9 preserve the proviso for any future increase,   if10 any.11 (Audience part icipation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there a13 second to that motion?14 MR. ZELNIK:	Second.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Zelnik16 seconds.17 Any debate?18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair?19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Mr.20 Schleider.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The SRO22 inventory in the City is one of the  most23 desperately needed and fragile  accommodations24 that the City can offer.25 The proviso offers  - -7 
3	MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - a formula to4	prot ect the amount of - -5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet .6	MR. SCHLEIDER:	to prot ect7 the amount of tenants  remaining.8 (Audience participat ion.)9	MR . SCHLEIDER:	Without the10 proviso, these landlords wouldn' t be able to11 maintain any sort of semblance of this  housing12 stock .13 (Audience participation. )14 MR. SCHLEIDER :	Without the15 proviso and without a rent  increase,16 (Audience participation.)17 MR . SCHLEIDER:	we are going18 to destroy the fabric of this very  fragile19 housing opportunity for New York City' s most at20 risk .21 (Audience participation. )22 MR . SCHLEIDER :	We put  forth23 that if the landlord lives up to the  provisions24 of the proviso that we have a three  percent25 across  the board  increase .10 
3	MR. SCHLEIDER:	This is4 necessary  to stem the t ide - -5 (Audience participation.)6	MR . SCHLEIDER:	- - of7 conversion.8 Why destroy the  entrepreneurial9 spirit - -10 (Audience participation.)11 MR. SCHLEIDER :	- - that has kept12 this housing stock alive?13 (Audience participat ion .)14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	It 's just going15 to exacerbate the decline of this  inventory.16 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	So - - just to17 be clear - -18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	an20 amendment to a motion must  be adopted	accepted21 by the motion presenter .22 You 're suggesting that the zero23 be three percent. Is that what you're  suggesting?24 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	Three- and - a-25 half percent.7 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Three- and- a-3 half percent .4 (Audience participat ion .)5	MR . SCHLEIDER:	Which is the6 same as last year .7 (Audience participation. )8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms . Lusskin,9	do you accept that  amendment?10 (Audience participation .)11 MS. LUSSKIN :	No, I do not .12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No . Okay .13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Any - - Mr.15 Zelnik .16 MR . ZELNIK :	At the risk of17 prolonging this vote perhaps just a couple  of18 extra minutes, I just want to support this   zero19 increase for the hotels.20 (Audience participation .)21 MR . ZELNIK:	Quite honestly, if22 I thought it was at all realistic to roll  it23 back, I would even suggest that .24 (Audience participation.)25 MR . ZELNIK :	I would just like10 
4 MR. ZELNIK:	I would just like5 to emphasize though the dire straits that many  of6 us on the Board feel about this depleted  housing7 stock, what 's happened to this depleted housing8 stock.9 There are renovations that  are10 being made where people are being displaced  who11 should not be displaced.12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. ZELNIK:	And I must indicate14 that part of the problem, in addition to the   fact15 that tourists are coming in and renting  these16 rooms and resulting in evict ions, other not - for-17 prof it institutions - colleges, dormitories,18 Federal government agencies - are  making,19 producing  incentives for people to convert these20 SROs for other uses where they end up  making21 (Audience participation .)22 MR.  ZELNIK:	- five to ten t imes23 the amount of money.24 (Audience part icipat ion .)25 MR. ZELNIK:	I think it is
4 MR. ZELNIK :	important ,5 number one, that we  support the zero  - -6 (Audience  participation .)7 MR . ZELNIK:	- - increase . 8 And I think it 's very important 9 that City officials take notice of what 's going 10	on and they put a stop to  this.11 (Audience participat ion .)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any13 additional discussion?14 MR . LUBELL:	Yes.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes . Mr .16 Lubell.17 MR. LUBELL:	Just very brief ly.18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet .20 MR . LUBELL:	I fear that we run21 the risk of sending - and we should bear this   in22 mind	- of sending a message that we' re not2 3	interested in this kind of housing, which is  not24 so .25 And by passing a zero  percent
2 increase , are we sending the message that we are3 not interested4 (Audience participation. )5	MR . LUBELL :	- - in this kind of6 housing?7 (Audience participation.)8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Quiet . Quiet ,9	please. Please.10	Go ahead, Mr. Lubell.11	(Audience participation .)12 MR . LUBELL:	That 's all I have.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.14 Let 's just clarify the motion.15 The motion is for:16 A zero percent ;17 And not to include the18 provision, as I understand	it , but with language19 in our explanatory  statement , that  it 's the Board20 intent that if there were to be in future  years21 levels of rent increases above zero, that  the22 Board believes that the proviso is important   in23 that case.24 Obviously this Board can't  bind25 future boards, but that 's the case .
2Is that correct?3MS. LUSSKIN:	Yes.4CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay.5Any additional debate?6(No response.)7CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Call the8question.9Betty Phillips Adams .10MS.

ZELNIK:	In the hopes that18 my vote will send a message to City  officials,19 enthusiastically yes.20 (Audience participation. )21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The Chair22 votes no.2 3	The motion passes, 6-3 .24 (Audience part icipation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We now turn24 
2 our attention to the guideline  affecting3 apartments and lofts.4 Let me read that. It's a  little5 longer than the other one.6 Notice is hereby given  pursuant7 to the authority vest ed in the New York City Rent8 Guidelines Board by the Rent Stabilization Law   of9 1969, as amended, and the Emergency   Tenant10 Protection Action of 1974, as amended,11 implemented by Resolution 176 of 1976 of the New12 York City Council and extended by Chapter 82   of13 the Laws of 2003 , and in accordance with  the14 requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City15 Charter, that the Rent Guidelines Board  hereby16 proposes the following levels of fair  rent17 increases over lawful rents charged and paid   on18 September 30, 2004.19 These rent adjustments  will20 apply to rent stabilized apartments with   leases21 commencing on or after October 1, 2004 and22 through September 30, 2005.23 Rent guidelines for loft  units24 subject to Section 286 , Subdivision 7 of the25 Mult iple Dwelling Law are also included in  this2 
2 Order .3 Proposed Renewal Adjustments  for4 Apart ments.5 Together with such further6 adjustments as may be authorized by law,  the7 annual adjustment	for renewal leases for8 apartments shall be:9 Let me reiterate again that  this10 is a range , that , in fact , the actual number  that11 will be adopted will be an actual number, not   a12 number in the range . I will be reading for13 purposes of public record the range .14 For a one- year renewal lease15 commencing on or after October 1, 2004 and on16 before  September 30 , 2005, 3 percent  to  5.517 percent ;18 For a two-year renewal  lease19 (Audience participation. )20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	For a two-21 year renewal lease commencing on or after October22 1, 2004 and on or before September 30 , 2005, 5 .523 to 7.5 percent .24 (Audience participation. )25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	These two
1	252 adjustments shall also apply to dwelling units   in3 a structure subject to the partial tax  exemption4 program - -5 (Audience participation.)6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	- - under7 Section 421a - -8 (Audience participation.)9 (There was a ten-minute recess10 in the proceedings. )11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	These two12 adjustments shall also apply to dwelling units   in13 a structure subject to the partial tax  exempt ion14 program under Section 421a of the Real  Property15 Tax Law, or in a structure subject to Section   42316 of the Real Property Tax Law as a  Redevelopment17 Project.18 Proposed vacancy allowance  for19 apartments.20 No vacancy allowance  is21 permitted except as provided by Sections 19   and22 20 of the Rent Regulation Reform Act of  1997.23 Proposed supplemental24 adjustment .25 There shall be no  supplemental
1	262 adjustment for apartments renting below  any3 specific amount for renewal  leases.4 Proposed  equalization allowance.5 There shall be no  equalization6 allowance  for apartments  continuously occupied7 for a specif ic period of time for renewal leases.8 Proposed additional adjustment9 for rent stabilized apartments sublet  under10 Section 2525.6 of the Rent Stabilizat ion Code.11 In the event of a sublease12 governed by Subdivision	(e) of Section 2525.6 of13 the Rent Stabilization Code, the  allowance14 authorized by such subdivision shall be  1015 percent.16 Proposed adjustments  for lofts17 (units in the category of buildings covered  by18 Art icle 7- C of the Multiple Dwelling Law).19 The Rent Guidelines Board20 proposes the following levels of rent  increase21 above the  "base rent , 11	as  defined  in Section 286,22 Subdivision 4 of the Multiple Dwelling Law, for23 units to which these guidelines are applicable   in24 accordance with Article 7-C	(sic) of the Multiple25 Dwelling Law:
1	272 For one-year increase periods3 commencing on or after October 1, 2004 and on  or4 before  September 30, 2005 - - again, this is   the5 range proposed	- - 2.5 percent to 5 percent ;6 For two-year increase periods7 commencing on or after October 1, 2004 and on  or8 before September 3 0, 2005, 5 percent to 79 percent.10 Vacant Loft Units.11	No vacancy allowance is12 permitted under this Order. Therefore, except  as13 otherwise provided in Section 286, Subdivision 614 of the Multiple Dwelling Law, the rent charged   to15 any tenant for a vacancy tenancy commencing on   or16 after October 1, 2004 and on or before  September17 3 0, 2005 may not exceed the  "base rent "18 referenced above plus the level of  adjustment19 permitted  above for increase periods.20 Fractional terms.21 For the purpose of these22 guidelines any lease or tenancy for a period  up23 to and including one year shall be deemed a  one-24 year lease or tenancy, and any lease or  tenancy25 for a period of over one year and up to  and12 
2 including two years shall be deemed a two- year3 lease or tenancy.4 Escalator clauses.5 Where a lease for a  dwelling6 unit in effect on May 31, 1968 or where a   lease7 in effect on June 30, 1974 for a dwelling  unit8 which became subject to the Rent  Stabilization9 Law of 1969, by virtue of the Emergency  Tenant10 Protection Act of 1974 and Resolution 276 of  the11 New York City Council , contained an escalator12 clause for the increased costs of operat ion and13 such clause is still in effect , the lawful rent14 on September 3 0, 2004 over which the fair rent15 under this Order is computed shall include  the16 increased rental , if any, due under such clause17 except those charges which accrued within  one18 year of the commencement of the renewal  lease.19 Moreover, where a lease20 contained an escalator clause that the owner  may21 validly renew under the Code, unless the   owner22 elects or has elected in writing to delete   such23 clause, effective no later than October 1,  200424 from the existing lease and all subsequent   leases25 for such dwelling unit , the increased rental , if2

2	(Audience participation .)3	MR. LUBELL:	I listened to your4 abuse just on Tuesday.5 (At 6:20 o'clock p .m . there was6 as recess in the proceedings .)7 (At 6:30 o'clock p.m . the8 proceedings were resumed .)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We are going10 to try to continue .11 Thank you .12 Could the Board Members  return13 to their seats, please.14 Okay. We were in the midst of  a15 motion by Mr. Lubell  - - statement leading to   a16 motion .17 Mr. Lubell.18 MR . LUBELL:	We on the Board19 have a clear mandate to maintain the  economic20 condition of rent stabilized housing .21 But you appear not to be22 listening to the signs of an  accelerating23 deterioration  of housing.24 We do this, and probably25 inadvert ently, because we focus on core Manhattan10 
2 and we don' t heed the needs of the vast majority3 of owners who are small owners and the  vast4 majority of tenants, both small and  big.5	We just can't ignore the fact  of6 an increase in the number of multi - family7 residential tax delinquencies, yes, a  forty- five8 percent increase from June 30, 2002 to June   30,9 2003 . That 's more  than 29,000 tax delinquencies.10 That 's not a small number of11 buildings.	It ' s certainly not  a small number of12 tenants that are affected.13 And they will all be at  risk.14 And with the past two years  of15 real estate tax increases of thirty- one percent	-16 - yes, thirty- one percent	- that number of  tax17 delinquencies is bound to  grow.18 And we can't look at income  as19 we do, and expense data, and ignore that  it20 excludes 100 , 000 plus units in buildings that are21 not required to file, buildings that I'm   sure22 many of you live in.23 And clearly these units  would24 impact the data to result in higher  operating25 ratios and lower net operating  income.
2 And we can't just continue  to3 use audited adjust ed numbers as we have been4 based on a twelve -year old audit just to pret end5 that the housing market	is healthier than it6 really is. It 's healthier for some, but it 's not7 healthier for all.8 (Audience participation.)9 MR. LUBELL:	We can't look at10 commercial income through a distort ed lens.11 Commercial  income is a significant  factor in core12 Manhattan. That 's where fifty percent of the13 residential  buildings have commercial income.14 Outside of Manhattan,  only15 eighteen percent of buildings have  commercial16 income. The buildings outside of Manhattan' s  core17 - and then there are also some isolated areas   in18 the Bronx and Brooklyn - like Riverdale,   Park19 Slope, Brooklyn Heights - well , those areas20 outside are generally much more  economically21 margin than in those better areas or so-called22 better areas.2 3	Let 's not pretend otherwise.24 Let 's not forget also that more25 than fifty percent of our housing predates   1950.
1	4 3  2 And that housing, like our older bridges  and3 tunnels, is part of the fragile infrastructure  of4 this City. Brooklyn Bridge, Manhattan Bridge,  and5 all of those houses that are older, and maybe  a6 hundred years old or even  fifty/sixty/seventy7 years old, we have to maintain  them.8 We can do something about  the9 bridges and tunnels, and even our very old , old10 water system. We can raise taxes. We can  issue11 bonds.12 But we here on the Board  have13 the express responsibility to do something  about14 maintaining	our older housing stock. We  can't15 lower real estate taxes	We can't decrease the16 cost of fuel. We can't persuade the  insurance17 companies to charge less. And we can't  issue18 bonds.19 But we can provide an adequate 2O	increase.21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. LUBELL:	And if we don' t23 hear me out. Hear me  out.24 I 'm very sympathet ic - -25 (Audience participation. )21 
2 MR. LUBELL:	What worries me and3 for eighteen years on this Board is that we  are4 jeopardizing a large number of  economically5 marginal buildings and simply creating  more6 marginal buildings.7	And , yes, that may be a8 euphemism for slums. We can be creating  slums.9 And, finally, as you all know10 and we on the Board know, we can't build  more11 affordable housing. We' d loved to see it.12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. LUBELL:	We don't have that14 power.15 (Audience participation. )16 MR. LUBELL:	A statutory vacancy17 allowance or luxury decontrol just doesn' t do  it18 in Morrisania, Hunts Point , Crown Heights and19 loads of areas where you can't collect  twenty20 percent or even more than ten percent more   for21 rent .22 (Audience participation.)23 MR. LUBELL:	There has to be a24 recognition that our skewed Mickey Mouse  rent25 system, that benefits  - -8 
3	MR. LUBELL:	- - benef its some,4	penalizes others, part icularly young people who5	move in,6	(Audience participation. )7	MR. LUBELL:	this system8 needs some kind of broad  relief.9 And an increase10 (Audience participation.)11	MR. LUBELL:	An increase to12 small, thousands of small owners  commensurate13 with their increased  costs - -14 (Audience participation. )15 MR. LUBELL:	- - is the only way16 to do it.17 Finally,18 (Audience participation .)19 MR. LUBELL:	Listen,  I feel like 20	I'm - -21 (Audience participation.)22 MR . LUBELL :	I feel like I 'm23 talking to a wall when I emphasize that we  can't24 help poor tenants because we can'.t provide them25 with additional income.21 
3	MR. LUBELL:	Or new affordable4 housing.5 (Audience participat ion. )6	MR. LUBELL:	We all know and7 we' re all very sympathetic to those poor tenants,8 many of whom can't afford any  increase.9 (Audience part icipat ion.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.11	(Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.13 MR. LUBELL:	And we also know,14 even though they aren' t here15 (Audience participation.)16 MR. LUBELL:	- - even though they17 aren't here, we also know that there are  a18 greater number of  tenants19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hold on a20 second.21 Ma' am, you behind the pole, sit22 down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit  down.23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. LUBELL:	We all know that25 there are a greater number  - -12 
3	MR. LUBELL:	- - of tenants who4	are not here who would prefer not to pay any  more5	rent , but certainly can afford it.6	(Audience participation.)7	MR. LUBELL :	I tell you now, we8 can affect all of - - we can affect all of them,9 those tenants who aren' t here, those of you who10 did take the time and effort to come here, we  can11	affect all of you if we economically impair more12 buildings	- -13 (Audience participation.)14 MR. LUBELL:	- - in15 neighborhoods throughout  the City.16 (Audience participation.)17 MR. LUBELL :	Let 's not - -18 (Audience participation.)19 MR. LUBELL:	Let 's not on the20 Board  speculate because  of  anecdotes - -21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. LUBELL:	- - because of23 anecdotes we heard on Tuesday and broad- based24 patronizing by individuals who are running   for25 public office or would like to stay in  public
2 office.3 (Audience participation.)4	MR. LUBELL:	Remember that you5 heard from a small number of tenants. And we   all6 heard them very well. And we are concerned  about7 them.8 (Audience participation.)9	MR. LUBELL:	And we heard from a10 smaller number of owners.11 And we can be sympathetic  to12 them as well.13 (Audience participat ion.)14 MR. LUBELL:	But we need to15 we here on the Board need to stick to  the16 economic facts17 (Audience participat ion.)18 MR. LUBELL:	- - of an increase19 in burden, particularly  the past two years.20 (Audience participation. )21 MR. LUBELL:	We owe it - -22 (Audience participation. )2 3	MR. LUBELL:	We owe it to the24 future of the City.25 (Audience part icipation. )
2	MR. LUBELL:	We owe it to you.3 We owe it to you who are  sitting4 there and all tenants.5 (Audience participation. )6	MR. LUBELL:	So we have an7 obligation - -8 (Audience participation.)9	MR. LUBELL:	We have an10 obligation here on the Board to carry out  our11 mandate to maintain the economic condition of   a12 very critical resource,13 (Audience participation.)14 MR. LUBELL:	- - and that is15 housing.16 (Audience participation.)17 MR. LUBELL:	I'm not addressing18 you.19 To the Members of the Board , you20 have a very tough  decision.21 (Audience participation. )2 2	MR. LUBELL:	And you also have a23 grave responsibility.24 So remember that when you  cut25 the baby and vot e.
2	(Audience participat ion. )3 MR . LUBELL:	The motion  - -4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell is5 about to make a motion.6 So quiet .7 (Audience participation.)8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet ,9	please.10 Wait until he makes the  motion,11 then boo. Okay? Wait until the motion is said ,12 then boo. We are going to have a three- minute13 booing session.14 Mr. Lubell.15 MR. LUBELL :	What I'm16 proposing17 (Audience participation. )18 MR. LUBELL:	What I'm proposing19 is a proposal that is dictated by the  numbers.20 It 's purely a proposal that is dictated by the21 numbers.22 (Audience participation.)2 3	MR. LUBELL:	I have no great24 expectation  - -  I can't make  a proposal unless25 people are quiet. Right? They' re your people.  You24

PAGAN:	- - an increase, but3 will be the biggest beneficiari es of any rent4 increase.5 Chances are that the small6 owner, who probably needs the help more  than7 anyone else, will not benefit  from any increase8 since most of them probably have to  give9 preferential  rents because of their location  in10 any case.11 There are some that will12 benef it , but in the vast majority, the ones that13 we need to get the help to, are usually the   ones14 that do not get the help.15 I have to say, in reference  to16 longevity, because that ' s one of the things that17 is coming up and I think everybody is  bringing,18 is that everybody remembers back  in the	1   60s,19 '70s and	'80s when the owners, who had a good20 tenant , tried to do the best to keep them in.21 Now we have good tenants  that22 they're trying to do the best to keep them out  in23 order to improve the rent. I think that 's wrong.24 (Audience participation. )25 MR. PAGAN:	And the reason for3 
2 that is, as we see a turnover, there is  another3 incentive. And it's called a twenty  percent4 vacancy rate. And that really hurts the  tenant5 more sometimes than the rent increases that  the6 Board approves .7 In addit ion to that , once an8 apartment becomes vacant , there' s also Major9 Improvements that are also transferred to  the10 tenant. That also hurts.11	(Audience participation. )12 MR. PAGAN:	So we' re looking13 when you look at some of the increases, we    - -14 most of the increases come from the vacancy  and15 it comes from the MCis.16 (Audience part icipation.)17 MR. PAGAN:	And they hurt. And18 that 's not going to change.19 (Audience participation.)20 MR. PAGAN:	It doesn' t mean that21 the only thing that the tenants and the   owners22 look for, in order to do well , is the rent. Let 's23 face it. The rent is a cash flow that they  have24 that benef its, and the cash flow is even bigger25 because sometimes we forget that there is   a12 
2 depreciation expense that is non- cash. And that3 is not taken into account.4	In addition, one of the things5 that we have  seen in my neighborhood , and  I  speak6 from  experience	- - and I always tell people  to7	look at empirical , the surveys that they do	is8 that the property values have increased  so9 greatly that there are two things  - -10 (Audience participation. )11 MR. PAGAN:	that an owner12 could do. You know, they could go and  mortgage13 and pocket some of that money because they  have14 increase in value, or they could just sell for  a15 wonderful  capital gains, which are only taxable16 fifteen percent  after they  - -17 (Audience participation.)18 MR. PAGAN:	- - after the19 recoupment of depreciation because that still   has20 to be paid.21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. PAGAN :	Now, let 's face it.23 Buildings just don 't become stabilized just24 because we say so. They become stabilized,   new25 buildings, because there was a public  benefit8 
2 that someone takes in order to get that  building3 done, either a J- 51, a 421A or some other4 incentive that reduces their expense. And that 's5 why they become  stabilized.6 The older buildings - and  this7 is what  surprised me  - - people willing  to pay8 more than ten times rental roll for a  building9 that they know the rents are going nowhere.  They10 are taking their own home before they even  start .11 And why should the Board or  any12 other government agency bail them out for a  bad13 business decision.14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. PAGAN:	At the other end of16 the scale we have luxury decontrol. And let ' s17 face it. That 's starting to take a toll.18 When Paul Rodin was here,  say19 from 1977 to the present t ime, 30,000 apartments20 became decontrolled.  3 0 , 000 apartments.21 Now what people forgot to say  is22 in ' 97 there were only a thousand, that most of23 the apartments came out in the last year,  and24 that the next year we are going to see a  bigger25 increase. And that 's not going to change. That 's
2 already part of the law.3 We are going to keep on  losing4 apartments. We are going to be adding very  few.5 (Audience participation .)6 MR. PAGAN:	I suggest today to7 the Board Members to go back and look at  the8 presentations made by the Rent Guidel ines  Board,9 to go back and remember that they brought  in10 something special , their own opinion and their11 own experiences, to take that into  account.12 And also to look at  the13 empirical surveys that they could see, that  no14 one has to tell them when they see  something.15 They saw it. And to take that and to take  that16 into account when we vote today for an  increase.17 So thank you very much, Mr.18 Chairman.19 (Audience part icipation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.21 Additional	debate?22 Ms. Holder, the seconder of  the23 motion.24 MS. HOLDER:	Mr. Schleider, did25 you want to say  something?
2MR. SCHLEIDER :Thank you, Mr.3Chair .4CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Okay . Mr.5Schleider.6MR. SCHLEIDER:Thank you, Mr .7Chair .8	Mr. Pagan, if you can't  collect9	the rent levels10	A VOICE :	Can't hear you .11	MR. SCHLEIDER:	If you can't12 collect the rent levels, then how can  the13 landlord collect the MCI or the  vacancy14 allowance? I don' t know .15 (Audience participat ion .)16 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Second , the17 tenant activists would have you believe that  the18 higher values of real estate make up  for19 operating shortfalls . Wrong.20 (Audience participation .)21 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Value does not  -2223 (Audience participat ion .)24 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Value does not25 equal cash flow to meet rapidly rising  real
2 estate taxes, labor or water or sewer  costs.3 These tenant activists want  the4 landlords to sell to  speculators?5 (Audience participation.)6 MR. SCHLEIDER:	To sell to7 speculators, to cash out and to leave the  tenants8 possibly  facing higher pressure  from increased9 rents? Is that what you want , Mr. Pagan?10 (Audience participation. )11	MR. SCHLEIDER:	I think not12 But without sharing these  costs13 of ownership, the tenant act ivists will force  a14 situation that can only spell disaster for  those15 they struggle to help.16 (Audience participat ion.)17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And a lot has18 been made about the low interest rate  environment19 as a boom to property owners. Maybe yes for   some20 owners; but not all owners could and far  less21 actually did.22 In fact , the recent  Rent23 Guidelines Board mortgage survey, Mr. Pagan -   you24 referred to those meet ings - for apartments and25 buildings recently mortgaged  the median rent  was
2 $969 per month, a rent forty percent well  in3 excess of the citywide $700 per month median  rent4 stabilized rent .5 Clearly owners of the more6 affordable rent stabilized housing did  not7 benefit from this temporary fall in  interest8 rates and they struggle to keep their  property9 from deteriorating.10 The vast majority of  landlords,11 this large number of landlords who own  small12 buildings	- about forty percent of the  regulated13 rental housing stock is buildings of less  than14 eleven units - the vast majority of  landlords15 have been suffering the cost increases of  real16 estate taxes,17 (Audience participation.)18 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - insurance,1920 (Audience participation. )21 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - fuel oil ,22 (Audience participation.)2 3	MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - labor and24 services for years,25 (Audience participation.)
2 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	-  for years3 without a commensurate increase in  rents.4 (Audience part icipation. )5	MR. SCHLEIDER:	These landlords6 are the gatekeepers of the existing  affordable7 housing stock - -8 (Audience participation. )9	MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - and these10 gatekeepers are the private cit izens that the11 City has inequitably forced to shoulder  a12 (Audience part icipation .)13 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - a public cost 1415 (Audience participation .)16 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - with higher17 real estate taxes,18 (Audience participat ion. )19 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - water and20 sewer charges,21 (Audience participat ion.)22 MR.  SCHLEIDER:	- - and dozens of23 administrative	fees.24 (Audience participation. )25 MR. SCHLEIDER :	Tenants must
2 share in these expenses. Zero percent does not   do3 it .4 (Audience participation.)5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder6	would like to debate the  motion.7 Please, quiet.8 Quiet.9 This gentleman in the box,  find10 a seat.11 (Laughter.)12 MS. HOLDER:	Every year - -13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. HOLDER:	Every year I've had 1516 VOICES:	Quiet.17 MS. HOLDER:	I've had the18 experience of watching every year the  Rent19 Guidelines Board approve rent hike after   rent20 hike after rent hike.21 (Audience participation.)22 MS. HOLDER:	It's so bad that23 when we watched the news, when we read   the24 papers, all they said today was there' s going  to25 be a vote on the rent hike, on the rent   hike.16 
2(Audience participation.)3MS. HOLDER:	When is enough4enough?5Every year I ask when is  enough6enough.7We always8(Audience participation .)9MS. HOLDER:	In the past years10the RGBhasjustified - -11(Audience participation.)12MS. HOLDER:	In the past years13the RGBhasjustif ied high permanent hikes in14 rents by citing unusual temporary price   surges15 reflected in the Price Index of Operating  Costs,16 what we call the PIOC.17 Every year that I've  experienced18 this process it 's always some rationale that 's19 tied to the PIOC .20 Yet21 (Audience participation.)22 MS. HOLDER:	- -  in other years23 the Board has authorized rent hikes in spite   of24 the fact that landlords' costs do not rise  at25 all .
2	(Audience participation. )3 MS. HOLDER:	And in 2002 - -4 (Audience participation. )5	MS. HOLDER:	And in 2002 - -6 (Audience participation.)7 MS. HOLDER:	And in 2002, the8 year I was appointed to this Board, we had  rent9 hikes despite the fact that the Price Index  of10 Operating Costs had fallen. It was  negative.11	(Audience participation .)12 MS. HOLDER:	It doesn' t seem to13 matter what the data shows. It seems to  be14 implied in the process that there is always  going15 to be a rent hike.16 And , again,  I ask, when is17 enough enough.18 (Audience participation.)19 MS. HOLDER:	All we hear is20 what this Board cannot do .21 This Board says that we cannot ,22 or I shouldn't say the Board, let me just   state23 what we heard just now, as we hear  the24 representative for the owners, Mr. Lubell ,  saying25 that we can't cure poverty.
2 But what I say is that we  can3 make sure as a Board that we don' t add to4 poverty.5	(Audience participation.)6 MS. HOLDER:	We are a great7 City. And rightly on Tuesday members of  this8 Board asked City and State representatives  where9 they are to help create affordable housing and  to10 strengthen the rent laws.11 (Audience participation .)12 MS. HOLDER:	We asked them. And13 there was a whole roll of them who came  before14 us.15 We had Assemblyman  Steve16 Sanders, we had Assemblymember	Richard Gottf ried17 or their representatives, Senator Liz Kruger,18 Assemblyman  Daniel O'Donald,  Councilmember Gail19 Brewer. It goes on and on and on and on. Even   the20 Speaker of the Council , Gifford Miller, came.21 They all said freeze the rents. And they all   gave22 us examples of the things that they are trying   to23 do.24 (Audience participation.)25 MS. HOLDER:	Trying to do.6 
1	722	But what  is clear - - what is3 clear is that we, the Rent Guidelines Board ,  can4 do something and we are statutorily mandat ed  to5 look at a lot of economic indices, and it is  not6 just prices as opposed  to expenditures.	It 's not7 just prices. We are statutorily mandated to do   a8 lot .9 We ask what the City can do?  We10 should be reminded that we too are the City.  We11 are the Rent Guidelines  Board.12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. HOLDER:	We should look at14 and I trust we have looked at the issues  of15 affordability. We've had hearings on  it.16 We had wonderful  reports from17 our staff on it. We know what it  says.18 Any straightforward analysis  of19 landlord and tenant incomes makes it clear  that20 tenants' wages have gone down in the last  ten21 years while  landlords operating  income has22 increased.23 (Audience participation.)24 MS. HOLDER:	Tenants' incomes25 continue to go down.3 
1	732	(Audience participation.)3	MS. HOLDER:	The unemployment4 rate is a serious, a serious matt er that this5 Board is supposed to look at. We are supposed   to6 be looking at the housing supply as well as  the7 affordable housing  supply.8	When we talk about housing9 that ' s available,  is it truly available  and  is it10 affordable housing that is available to   tenants11 in New York City?12 We are supposed to look at  the13 vacancy rate. This is not a normal market.  We14 have rent laws and they were put in place for   a15 reason. This is not a normal market with  a16 vacancy rate that 's as low as it is here.17 (Audience participation. )18 MS. HOLDER:	We can give you a19 report. We know that the condit ion of the  real20 estate industry is doing very, very well.  People21 are taking money out of securit ies and out of  the22 stock market  to buy these buildings.23 And we are constantly sitting  at24 a Rent Guidelines Board to ensure that they  have25 high levels of profit. I do not want to be a   part9 
4	MS. HOLDER:	We have to be very,5 very clear.6 (Audience participation.)7	MS. HOLDER:	We have to8 understand	- -9 (Audience participation .)10 MS. HOLDER:	I am a rent11 stabilized tenant. I had to sign a two-year  lease12 last year because my J- 51 protection of rent13 stabilization ran out this year.14 My rent went up  astronomically15 every month and I make a livable  wage.16 I can't even begin to imagine,17 and I see it every day with my clients, how  they18 are having a harder and harder time trying to  buy19 medicine  and food and trying to keep  - -20 (Audience participation.)21 MS. HOLDER:	- - their families22 clothed ,23 (Audience participation.)24 MS. HOLDER:	and transporting25 themselves at $2.00 each way on the  bus.8 
4	MS. HOLDER:	How in the world -56	(Audience participation. )7	MS. HOLDER:	How in the world8 we can continue to allow these increases to  be9 compounded upon higher increases upon  higher10 increases when our own data show that when  prices11 go down, there is no readjustment and  the12 landlords are continuing to make a prof it and13 build equity in their buildings that are  not14 (Audience participation.)15 MS. HOLDER:	- - being - -16 (Audience participation. )17 MS. HOLDER:	- - derived by any18 other part of the community.19 (Audience participation. )20 MS. HOLDER:	I stand in support21 of my colleague' s mot ion.22 (Audience participation. )23 MS. HOLDER:	We are the City. We24 need to stay with our responsibility here as  the25 Rent Guidelines Board to look at all of  these8 
4	MS. HOLDER:	And with over a5 mill ion units in this City being affected , well6 over two million people being affected , we need7 to really - -8 (Audience participation.)9	MS. HOLDER:	- - really make sure10 that we are doing the right  thing.11 A rent freeze is the right  thing12 this year.13 (Audience participation. )14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	To reiterate15 the motion:16 The motion is across the  board17 zero;18 Plus an amendment to the  so-19 called Special Guideline that would change the   5020 percent above Maximum Base Rent to 40  percent21 above Maximum Collectible Rent and eliminate   the22 clause associated with the Fair Market  Rent.23 Is that correct , Mr. Pagan?24 MR.

ADAMS:	This is definitely25 a very difficult  job - -14 
1	832	(Audience participation. )3	MS. ADAMS:	- - I think for4 everyone who serves on this  Board.5 (Audience participation.)6	A VOICE:	Speak into the7	microphone .8	MS. ADAMS:	There is no question9 but that there is an affordablity problem   in10 housing. I think that' s a lot of the reason that11 you saw more of our elected officials here   this12 year than last year. It is getting worse,  not13 better.14 One of the frustrations  of15 serving on this Board is that the  legislation16 under which we operate is very narrowly def ined.17 We cannot make a distinction between large   land18 owners and small land  owners.19 (Audience participation.)20 MS. ADAMS:	We know what the21 difference is.22 We also know - -23 (Audience participat ion. )24 MS . ADAMS:	We also know that25 many, or if not most of the tenants who live   in9 
2 rent stabilized apartments  - -3 (Audience participation.)4 MS. ADAMS:	- - which have, in5 fact , gone up every year have not experienced6 increases in their income and they pay more   for7 transportation and milk and all of the  rest.8 (Audience participation.)9 MS. ADAMS:	I'm not even10 speaking of families who have  children.11 By the same token, as a  public12 member, we have a responsibility to the   owners,13 and they have had  increased  costs  - -14 (Audience participation.)15 MS. ADAMS:	- - to operate16 buildings.17 No data - -18 (Audience part icipation.)19 MS. ADAMS:	We spent a good bit20 of time, not only listening to testimony,  but21 looking at all of the research data we could   get22 our hands on. We go around the edges of  the23 problem.24 So it is very frustrating .25 (Audience participation.)2 
2 MS. ADAMS:	And Mr. Pagan is3 right when he says that this is a  difficult4 night. I don' t know if we would say so for  the5 same reasons or not. This job is difficult .6	(Audience participation.)7 MS. ADAMS:	Let me - -8 (Audience participat ion.)9 MS. ADAMS:	- - say because of10 the lateness of the night just to hear  my11 response to a conclusion,  but  - -12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. ADAMS:	- - to give a14 friendly amendment to reduce from 3 .5 to 3 .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The Chair16 does not accept the  amendment.17 (Audience participation.)18 MS. HOLDER:	Mr. Chair, was your19 mot ion seconded?20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Kaufman21 seconded it.22 (Audience part icipat ion.)23 MS. HOLDER:	By whom? I'm sorry.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Kaufman.25 Any additional debat e?10 
2 MS. HOLDER:	Yes.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Ms.4 Holder .5	MS. HOLDER :	Okay.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.7 MS. HOLDER:	Last year we saw8 the highest increases since 1989 at 4.5 and  7.59 percent .10 What it had the effect  of11 because  of the spread  -  I'll make  this quick -12 what it had the effect of because of the   spread13 is that when we look at the average or the  median14 apartment , which we have, our data shows as $70015 a month, what that meant last year because of   the16 spread was so wide , many people went into a one-17 year lease.18 And so folks who had the  median19 rent apartment of $700	but I have some of my20 attorneys  in - -  I mean  in the audience  right now21 and they know that they have yet to see   clients22 come in with $700 apartments.23 But , anyway, what that meant for24 people who had the median apartment rental   rate25 of  $700 ,  is that  last year they felt compelled ,6 
1	872 these working class and low- income people, the3 majority of which live in rent  stabilized4 housing, to go ahead and take the 4.5 percent   and5 their rent went up to $731.50. That 's an increase6 of $378.00 a year, which doesn't mean anything  to7 landlords. It means a whole lot to  tenants.8 (Audience participation.)9 MS. HOLDER:	What I'm saying10 now is that with the proposal that we have   set11 forth at  3 .5 and  6.5 percent , again these folks,12 having only taken a one- year lease, now will  find13 their rent going up to $757.10. That 's an14 increase of $370.50.15 So between last year and  this16 new year they will have an increase of $685.50   a17 year. That is incredible. It is  outrageous.18 (Audience participation.)19 MS. HOLDER:	It is unwarranted.20 (Audience participation.)21 MS. HOLDER:	I would ask that my22 colleagues on the Board would vot e this down.23 This is too high of an increase, especially   with24 this spread , the spread we had last year and the25 spread we have again, is going in to the idea   of2 
2 forcing people into one-year leases which  is3 proving not economical and makes no  economic4 sense for tenants who are trying to make  a5 commitment to landlords, but are trying to  make6 one that is in the best economic interest  of7 their families.8 I hope that this mot ion will9 fail.10 (Audience participation.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell.12 MR. LUBELL:	During the past13 eighteen years that I've been sitting on  this14 Board - -15 (Audience participation.)16 MR. LUBELL:	- - we have had17 we have had higher increases than we had  last18 year.19 But I don' t recall a two-year20 period where we had an increase of real   estate21 taxes in two years in excess of thirty- one22 percent.23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. LUBELL:	I don' t recall25 where insurance costs over a two- year period  have2 
2 gone up fifty- five percent.3 (Audience participation. )4	MR. LUBELL:	Or water charges,5	twelve percent.6	These are unusual times in  that7 there have been unusual  increases.8 (Audience part icipation.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Kaufman,10 go ahead.11 MS. KAUFMAN:	I just wanted to12 take a couple of minutes to speak and echo  some13 of what Ms. Adams says from the perspective of   a14 public member.15 (Audience part icipation. )16 MS. KAUFMAN:	As we all know,17 the Board' s charge and challenge18 (Audience participation.)19 MS.  KAUFMAN:	- - is to enact20 guidelines during periods of housing  shortage21 that provide on the one hand for fair  and22 generally affordable rents for tenants  and23 provide on the other a fair return to  owners.24 This challenge was  exemplified25 during the twelve hours of testimony at  the10 
2 public hearing on Tuesday.3 On Tuesday we heard from  more4 than two hundred people, each either an owner  or5 tenant or representative of one of the two.   With6 the except ion of perhaps five people testifying,7 each advocated for either a rent freeze  or8 rollback or an increase not less than this year   -9 -  last  year's guideline.10 The role of the Board ,  and11 particularly that of the public members,  is  to12 strike a balance.  We are required  - -13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. KAUFMAN:	to give this15 testimony due consideration, the test imony  from16 both sides,17 (Audience participation.)18 MS.  KAUFMAN:	- - and we are19 required to give due consideration to data on the20 real estate industry and the general  economy.21 (Audience participation.)22 MS. KAUFMAN:	Another challenge23 is to reconcile24 (Audience participation.)25 MS.  KAUFMAN:	- - the data with2 
2 the aggregate  - -3 (Audience participation.)4 MS. KAUFMAN:	- - an average of5	building and tenant and general  economic6 information with the often emot ional and dire7 individual situations that both tenants  and8 owners shared with us on  Tuesday.9 (Audience participation. )10 MS. KAUFMAN:	It is an11 unfortunate  reality we face in developing a12 guideline that one size does not fit all. And  yet13 a tenant leader testified that , quote, the virtue14 of the system is its  simplicity.15 This sentiment has been  echoed16 by the owners as well.17 The bottomline	I believe is that18 the City as a whole will prosper only if  rents19 are  fair  and generally affordable	- -20 (Audience part icipation.)21 MS. KAUFMAN:  - - and if buildings22 are able to cover operating expenses and  provide23 a fair return - -24 (Audience participation.)25 MS. KAUFMAN:	- - to owners. It6 
2	is not an either/or  proposition.3	Put differently, tenants need4 well - maintained  buildings  with quality ownership5 only possible with decent returns,  and building	-67 (Audience participation.)8 MS. KAUFMAN:	- - owners need9	tenants - -10 (Audience participation.)11 MS. KAUFMAN:	- - who can afford12 to live in the City and who can maintain  the13 unique quality of our  neighborhoods.14 (Audience participation.)15 MS. KAUFMAN:	For this reason16 the guideline  I support  tonight  - -17 (Audience participation.)18 MS. KAUFMAN:	recognizes that19 owners' costs rose in real terms over the  past20 year - -21 (Audience participation.)22 MS.  KAUFMAN:	- - and it also23 recognizes that many rent stabilized tenants   have24 faced and continue  to face  - -25 (Audience participation.)10 
2 MS.  KAUFMAN:	- - very3 significant pressures  in the current economic4 climate and as a result of the  continuing5 (Audience participation.)6	MS.  KAUFMAN:	- - shortage of7 affordable housing.8 (Audience participation.)9	MR. ZELNIK:	Mr. Chairman?10	Chairman Marcus?11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.12 MR. ZELNIK:	With all due13 respect to your proposal , I, unfortunately  or14 fortunat ely, depending on what side you are  on,15 must speak against the 3 .5 percent  increase.16 (Audience part icipat ion.)17 MR. ZELNIK:	This is not a18 mathemat ical issue. We are hearing numbers  and19 statistics and facts from both sides. But this   is20 not about math. If this were about  mathematical21 formulas and statistics, we could get a   computer22 and plug in numbers and we wouldn' t have to  go23 through this.24 I think this is about  something25 that I'm going to refer to as the  human12 
1	942	dimension, if you will.3 (Audience participation.)4 MR. ZELNIK:	Yes, the RGB should5 be concerned with operat ing expenses and the6 income of the owners, just as we should  be7 concerned with the affordability and the  income8 and expenses of the  tenants.9 (Audience part icipation. )10 MR . ZELNIK:	The Board must be11 concerned with what I refer to as the  human12 dimension.13 The Board14 (Audience part icipation. )15 MR.  ZELNIK:	- - must  factor in16 the impact on the economy. It must factor in  the17 impact of 9/11. It must factor in lack  of18 employment. It must factor in the lack  of19 affordable housing for the poor, low income  and20 the middle class.21 It must  factor in - -22 (Audience participation.)23 MR.  ZELNIK:	- - its24 homelessness.25 It is about the human  dimension.5 
2	(Audience participation.)3	MR. ZELNIK:	From the owners'4 perspective,	there are , in fact , real issues  and5 these are issues that I think must be dealt  with.6 There are, in fact , issues of7 longevity	excuse me  - - longevity, and that8 should be studied and addressed , especially in9 smaller buildings.10 There are issues of  building11 type and there are issues of building size  and12 they should be factored .13 There are issues of  geographic14 location in the core and they should be  factored.15 There are issues of  geographic16 location that should be considered and there   are17 real expenses, such as fuel and water  and18 insurance and real estate tax, and they should  be19 considered.20 But they should be shared  by21 owners and tenants and not just passed on  to22 tenants .23 (Audience participation.)24 MR. ZELNIK:	The RGB, be it25 today or in the future with different boards  or4 
2 different board members, let me coin a  phrase3 from Apple Computer, I think we need to  think4 different. I think we need to start  thinking5 creatively.6 I don' t necessarily - -7 (Audience participat ion.)8	MR.  ZELNIK:	- - think that9 simplicity in terms of problem- solving is a10 virtue just for the sake of  simplicity.11 (Audience participation.)12 MR. ZELNIK:	The last three13 years there has been a major economic  downturn14 for the City, for the residents. There is a  major15 recession. There is a shrinking  economy.16 There a 50,000 person reduction17 in employment. Unemployment	is about eight or18 eight - and- a- half percent and there has been a19 decline - -20 (Audience participat ion. )21 MR.  ZELNIK:	- - in real wages.22 The Rent Guidelines Board  must23 take this into consideration as part of  the24 background.25 (Audience participation. )
2 MR. ZELNIK:	There are3 apartments that are leaving the Mitchell  Lama4 program.5 There' s apartment loss from6 vacancy decontrol .7 There is financial hardship  to8 low- income rent stabilized tenants.9 There is a lack of  affordable10 housing.11 And I think this Rent  Guidelines12 Board has an obligation to send a message to   the13 polit icos who have appeared here, who come  here14 once a year to indicate their support of  no15 increase, but do not do what I think they   should16 do to create more affordable housing .17 And I believe  - -18 (Audience participation.)19 MR . ZELNIK :	some of the20 energy that is being challenged at this  meeting21 from the tenants should also be addressed to   your22 representatives	in the Senate and the Assembly23 and let them know they need to start  doing24 something to support affordable housing in   the25 City .
2 (Audience participat ion.)3 MR. ZELNIK:	Last year, just to4 get into the numbers game, if you will , there5 was, in fact , a 16.9 percent increase, PIOC6 increase.7	This year there is a 6.9  percent8 increase. How can we justify any number close  to9 last year's increase when, in fact , the numbers10 this year are substantially  less?11 For these reasons I must12 respectfully not support this motion of  3 .513 percent.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Lusskin.15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.17 (Audience participation. )18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.19 Quiet.20 (Audience participat ion.)21 MS. LUSSKIN:	If I could get22 started, I'm not going to make a long  statement.23 (Audience participation. )24 MS. LUSSKIN:	There is an issue25 I want to raise.8 
2 First of all , I do want to3 echo - -4 (Audience participation.)5	MS.  LUSSKIN:	- - I want to echo6 the eloquent if not popular statements of  my7 colleagues,8 (Audience participation.)9 MS.  LUSSKIN:	- - Ms. Kaufman and10 Ms. Adams.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Quiet.12 If you don' t keep quiet , you13 won' t hear her.14 A VOICE:	We cannot hear.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	If you kept16 quiet , you might hear her.17 MS. LUSSKIN:	I'm speaking into18 the mike.19 Okay . Is this better?20 VOICES:	Yes.21 MS . LUSSKIN:	Okay.22 I'm not going to make a  long23 statement. I want  to - -  there is an issue I  want24 to raise.25 But before  that , I do want to12 
2 echo, as f	said, the eloquent if not  popular3 statements by my colleagues, Ms. Adams and  Ms.4 Kaufman, about the task before us tonight .5 One of the things that Ms.6 Kaufman brought up is that this is a rough  system7 where we are dealing with a million  apartments.8 And we have been told by both the owners and   the9 tenants that the simplicity of the  system10 outweighs in their minds some of the  potential11 good or bad things we could do if we dice   things12 a little finer.13 But there is one issue that  we14 can't deal with this year, but I would like  to15 understand better for next year, which is  whether16 there is any way that we can attach a proviso   to17 the rent increase to prohibit landlords  with18 severe and multiple violations  from taking19advantage ofthe rent increase.20And  if we can 't legally do that ,21who can?22I think that is an issue we  need23to address.24We  need to understand	- -25(Audience part icipation. )
2 MS. LUSSKIN:	- - the legal3 ramif ications. But if the idea is to preserve the4 housing stock and the money is not going  into5 preserving the housing, then it doesn' t make6 sense.7 (Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 Any additional  discussion?10	Mr. Schleider, did you want  to11	make a statement?12 Yes, he does.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Next year.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.
