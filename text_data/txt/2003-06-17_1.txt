2	P R O C E E D I N G  S34 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We are ready5 to get started now.6	Good morning.7 My name is Marvin Markus,8 Chairman of the Rent Guidelines  Board.9 And I would like to welcome  the10 people in the audience to a public hearing  where11 we will discuss the preliminary guidelines  that12 have been set up at our meeting in  May.13 This will lead ultimately to  a14 meet ing two days from today at approximately  5:3015 at the Customs House in Lower Manhattan  to16 discuss the adoption of the final set  of17 guidelines.18 We've broken up the hearing19 today into different sections. We are going  to20 begin with the hotels. We are going to  alternate21 owners and tenants.22 The first speaker is a  tenant23 speaker, actually listed number two, but  I24 understand there are some transit problems  with25 the 4, 5 and 6. And so we are going to have to  be7 
2 flexible all day I think in terms of people' s3 arrivals .4 First , Anne Cunningham.5 The rules are three minut es and6 you should be able to tell from something that  we7 have in front there. There' s a clock in front8 that tells you when you are running out of  time.9 It also tells you - - it 's set10 for third seconds in terms of telling you with  a11 buzz. It's going to buzz at thirty seconds   so12 that you know what 's going on .13 Anne is one of our regulars.  So14 welcome. Thank you.15 MS . ANNE CUNNINGHAM :	Good16 morning, Chairman Markus, Members of the  Rent17 Guidelines  Board , and all  present.18 It 's too bad we don' t have more19 people here and I think you should take   into20 consideration  the subway condit ions.21 My name is Anne Cunningham.22 Today, as for the past twenty- five years, I  am23 testifying on behalf of SRO and residential   hotel24 tenants.25 The Commander  Hotel , built in2 
2 1928 , is one of the very few remaining Class A3 hotels in existence. Ongoing construction at  The4 Commander has severely changed the building' s5 conf iguration. Eighteen of the two hundred and6 eighty SRO units were demolished without  a7 Cert ificate of Non- Harassment or proper permits8 from governmental agencies.9 The landlord has evicted more10 than half of the rent stabilized tenants in   order11 to deregulate units and is now charging  between12 $1400 and $1550 and $4200 a month for units  that13 had previously ranged from $300 to $500 a mont h.14 See the cover sheet.15 Unfortunat ely, not all the prices are on it.16 It is obvious that a rent17 increase is not warranted for the few  remaining18 rent regulated tenants who are in a category  of19 unemployed , underemployed  and senior citizens20 residing at The Commander- Tempo Hotel.21 One of the Board Members  stated22 during a public meeting that salaries for  SRO23 tenants had risen. This is, and I feel  and24 personally know, this is the misstat ement of  the25 year.2 
2 I work with tenants seven days  a3 week. In SROs and hotels there is a high rate  of4 unemployed tenants. Of course, those tenants  who5 are moving into the new, decontrolled units  do6 have a much higher income. Unfortunately,  that7 Board Member neglected to report or  mention8 profits obtained by hotel  owners.9 The Board is considering10 granting a rent increase to SRO and  residential11 hotel tenants based on test imony of only one12 creditable SRO landlord and a few others who  may13 have fraudulently responded to a  questionnaire14 that was distributed.15 Today, you will be hearing16 honest testimony from those that are the " have17 nots" in society.18 An increase in rent would be  a19 severe injustice to all SRO and hotel tenants.  I20 also urge you to keep the proviso  intact.21 And thank you once again for the22 pleasure of participation.23 Any questions?24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 Any questions?2 
2	Go ahead , Betty .3	MS . ADAMS :	Within our powers as4 they presently are, is there anything else  that5 you can think of that this Board should be  doing6 with regard to SROs?7	MS. ANNE CUNNINGHAM :	Well,8 what  I think  - - and you did ask that during  one9 of the public meet ings .10 I think it 's very, very11 necessary to keep in mind that the older  SRO12 tenants and hotel tenants do not have  any13 protections.14 When I moved into the hotel,  I15 was charged six months City and State tax,  and16 after six months it was given back to me. I  do17 not have a lease . Many of us at my age do not18 have leases . Leases were given out in 1982 or  so19 and, of course, they are never  renewed.20 Another thing that you  could21 take into consideration, there are very  few22 tenants left in this  category, particularly	in23 the Class A hotels . It 's very easy to monitor and24 find out how many tenants are living there, long -25 term tenants.8 
2 I'm concerned about the3 statutory tenants that don' t have any4 protections.5 I'm also concerned about  those6 tenants who now have a preferential  rent. What  is7 happening when there is construction,  the8 landlords move tenants around. I have  told9 tenants don' t leave your room because you lose10 your rights. When they leave their room,  they11 lose their rights and they're moved to  another12 room because then they do get a  preferential13 rent . And that rent is registered as $2100 or14 $1700 even though they may be paying $500  a15 month. They're in a very precarious  position.16 But you must take into17 consideration that they' re very poor people and18 they must keep their homes.19 Thank you.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 The next speaker is  Helen22 Maurizio.23 MS. HELEN MAURIZIO:	Good24 morning, Mr. Markus, Members of the  Guidelines25 Board.2 
2Sorry. Can you hearme?3THE REPORTER:	Yes.Now we can .4MS. HELEN MAURIZIO:Okay.5I thank you for theopportunity6 to address you today on behalf of members of  the7 Associated Hotels and Motels and  the8 Stabilization Division thereof.9 As I mentioned to you in May,  my10 hotel group received no increase last  year,11 proviso or not .12 I appear before you today13 basically to discuss the proviso. I ask  that14 there be an increase with no proviso . While there15 are some properties who can take advantage of  the16 increase, there are those that are unable to  and17 have been unable to for many years. Therefore,  we18 ask that you remove the proviso or at least  alter19 it to enable the SROs to take advantage of  the20 increase.21 May I suggest that we  try22 eliminating the proviso and see what results   can23 be achieved by next year? We believe that  this24 would be a fair way to show these propert ies that25 this Board will make a difference and  are6 
2concernedwith the tenants, SROs, and the need  to3keep themin business.45We believe that the type  ofoffering of a olive branch posture will make  a6differencein a significant group of  business7peopl e whoare now thinking of selling  and/or8abandoningtheir buildings.9Perhaps it would give them  an10incentive,a glimmer of hope, that New York  City11 is still in need of them, recognizes them  and12 their need to make money.13 It would also protect a  number14 of union jobs in this City which, I believe,   are15 sorely needed, resulting in additional City16 revenue, which is something we have to  consider.17 It seems to me that  concerning18 the proviso, it would be a win/win situation   just19 to give it a try and to revisit this issue  again20 next year. There have been so many years with   the21 proviso that I think one year to give them  a22 chance to see what they can do and show us  a23 difference  in the occupancy.24 In closing I appreciat e a fair25 and equitable increase and hope we could open   new11 
2 dialogue regarding the proviso.3 Thank you.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any5 quest ions?6 (No response.)7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Helen, thank8	you.9	MS. HELEN MAURIZIO:	Thank you,10 Mr. Markus.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next12 speaker will be Larry Wood.13 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Good morning,14 Chairman and Members of the Rent  Guidelines15 Board.16 My name is Larry Wood. I work  as17 an organizer at Goddard Riverside  Community18 Center and I worked at the SRO Law Project  for19 eight years.20 I want to thank the Members  for21 their commitment for serving through  this22 process, particularly	for the new Members. Many23 people have become very cynical about this  annual24 Rent Guidelines Board process and really  believe25 the fix is in and it ' s immaterial  coming  down10 
2 here and testifying, and that these  hearings3 really are so much window  dressing.4 But I really believe that 's not5 true. I think Rent Guidelines Boards in the  past6 have shown their independence , have listened to7 testimony that has been brought before them . I8 know you have a lot to balance, what 's a fair and9 reasonable  return, what 's a fair profit , and  how10 do we also try to minimize the hardship on  people11 who are paying fifty/sixty percent of  their12 income to rents that keep going higher and  higher13 every year. So you have a lot to  balance.14 I really urge you to study  the15 submissions that were prepared by the SRO  Law16 Project , listen to the testimony from the tenants17 who come before you . They really do illustrate18 the conditions and practices of this  industry.19 They' re here from dozens of hotels and rooming20 houses and they really represent hundreds  of21 their fellow tenants .22 As you know, looking at the  big23 picture, over three- quarters of the SRO housing24 stock has been lost and converted over the  last25 thirty years. We went from 165,000 units to  less2 
2 than 35, 000 units.3 And my job at the Law Project4 was to help preserve this form of housing.  And5 another organizer, friend of mine, compared it  to6 trying to stop water from flowing in a stream  by7 putting rocks in it. Somehow the wat er always8 finds a way around the  rocks.9 But we think we provide  an10 important service as a little tiny dam. But  we11 need your help to be able to keep those  tenants12 in place.13 Those restrictive provisions  are14 extremely important. To give the increase  without15 the proviso. I think would be a huge mistake. The16 thought that landlords are going to be selling   or17 abandoning their buildings  is ludicrous. There' s18 so many profitable uses for SROs that we  really19 have a de facto vacancy decontrol when we lose   an20 SRO tenant. There' s so many other uses that21 owners can rent these out  to.22 You are going to hear about23 renting out to colleges for dormitory  students,24 the transient rentals, the special need  rentals25 for homeless families or persons with AIDS  that2 
2 the City makes.3 There' s a whol e host of ways4 they can make lots of money on those  rooms5 besides renting to a new stabilized  tenant.6 We really argue the Rent7 Guidelines Board increase is really immaterial   to8 the economics of running these buildings. There' s9 no increase you can give that would serve as an10 incentive to keep these units in the  stabilized11 system. There' s huge profits to be made12 elsewhere.13 I understand the landlords  doing14 that. We've tried to preserve these tenants  and15 keep them in place. And those  restrictive16 provisions are a big  help.17 And you've listened to  tenants18 in the past and I really hope you listen to  them19 this year as well.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Wrap up,21 please.22 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Anyway, those23 restrictive provisions,  again, do help.24 And I guess what I would like  to25 point out about them, the one- size- fits- all2 
2 approach of the Rent Guidelines Board is  very3 difficult. Obviously there' s varying4 circumstances out there. There are  clearly5 buildings where a landlord might be just gett ing6 by and they do need the increase, and there  are7 many buildings out there where the landlord  is8 making an enormous profit. And it 's hard for you9 to micromanage that.10 But you have done that in  the11 case of SROs. If you look at the four  different12 classes of SROs, you do consider  the13 circumstances.	And I would I guess argue  that14 you might  even consider that for apartments15 because there are different circumstances  between16 big buildings and small  buildings.17 So please keep those  restrictive18 provisions	in place.19 I know there are suggestions20 from the Law Project to tighten them up and  to21 make them easier to understand and to enforce   as22 well.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 Thank you.25 Any questions?2 
2Yes, David.3MR. PAGAN:	Just a quick4question.5I don' t know if you heard Ms.6 Maurizio' s testimony a few minutes ago. But could7 you give us an idea what would happen if  that8 proviso was let go?9	MR. LARRY WOOD:	Well , the10 provisos were put there to try to  encourage11 landlords to keep units in the stabilized  system12 and to comply with the law, the DHCR  regulations13 that accompany them.14 If a landlord is not abiding  by15 those provisions, they're really not entitled  to16 the RGB increase partly because it is  a17 reflection that they are making big prof its18 otherwise  - - you'll hear  from tenants  that there19 are many hotels, like the, used to be called  the20 Ben Franklin, the Boardway American, up at   77th21 Street. It was a 500 - unit building with about 40022 rent stabilized tenants when I started in   1987.23 Today we have about forty tenants left in  that24 building. Over 450 units are getting  transient25 rentals.10 
2 There is no way that tht3 landlord is not making a healthy return in  that4 building and squeezing the remaining SRO  tenants5 that would result in their displacement .6 She testified why don't we  take7 away the restrictive provisions and see  what8 happens. I can tell you what happens. Rents  will9 go up for the low- income tenants. And you see10 from the SRO test imony, from the Law Project ,11 over fifty percent of SRO tenants are paying  more12 than fifty percent of their income to live  in13 those units.14 If those rents keep going up,15 they are forced between choosing  between16 prescription drugs and paying the rent and  food.17 And they would end up getting behind in  their18 rent and gett ing evicted and then they become a19 charge of the City with exorbitant  sheltering20 costs.21 So I urge you to keep those22 provisions.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Lubell.24 MR. LUBELL:	The Law Project has25 done a very effective job for the last  fifteen2 
2years.3MR.LARRY WOOD:	Thank you.4MR.LUBELL:	And you have5contributedto it .6Butduring those fifteen years7	or so almost two- thirds of the units have been8lostto the City and large numbers of  buildings9havebeen sold or converted to other  uses.10MR. LARRY WOOD:	Yes.11MR . LUBELL:	That means  - - isn't12thatinconsistent with your statement  earlier13thatthe ownership of these buildings is  very14 profitable?  If so many have been lost over the15 last fifteen years, it doesn' t seem likely that16 it 's been prof itable.17 MR. LARRY WOOD:	The units have18 been lost to the rent stabilizat ion system . A lot19 of those hotels and rooming houses are still  out20 there. They've been converted to other  purposes .21 Some of  them during the	' 70s and22 '80s went co-op or turned into23 MR . LUBELL:	A lot of them have24 been sold and lost and have been converted  or25 just been sold and converted to other  uses,14 
2 convert ed to co-op or condo or converted to some3 other use.4	MR. LARRY WOOD:	Right . More5 prof it  - - just like many  apartment buildings have6 also been converted to other uses besides  rent7 stabilization rents.8 I understand that the landlord' s9 goal is not to run a non- profit business. They' re10 there to make money and they are going to try  to11 maximize it. So I don' t fault them for that.12 But my point is they are  making13 enormous profits through those other uses  of14 those units and we are trying  to preserve	you15 have a responsibility of trying to also  preserve16 affordable housing as well as try to figure  out17 what 's a reasonable return. And I think you  have18 done a commendable job over the years trying   to19 make that balance.  Zero increases were warranted20 some years and those restrictive provisions were21 warranted. And I urge you to do it  again.22 MR. LUBELL:	Just one further23 footnote question.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Footnot e25 question, we can ignore  it?5 
2	MR.  LUBELL:	I think - -3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Go4 ahead.  I 'm  sorry. Go ahead.  I don't want to be5 flippant today. Yes, I do.6 (Laughter.)7 MR. LUBELL:	It 's my8 understanding	that the percentage of  conversions9 to cooperat ive or condominium use for hotels far10 exceeds the percentage of conversions  of11 traditional rental housing; isn't that  correct?12 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Probably.13 MR. LUBELL:	Over the last14 fifteen years.15 MR . LARRY WOOD:	I'd say the16 last  thirty years, since	' 71 that' s probably the17 case.18 MR. LUBELL:	Okay.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank20 you very much.21 MR . LARRY WOOD:	Thank you very22 much.23 The next testifier is Lucy24 Ledesma.25 We 're going , just so people8 
2 know, we are going a combination of when  you3 signed up and what your number was. So if you  got4 here a little later, your number is earlier,  we5 are taking you.6 Lucy, thank you.7 MS. LUCY LEDESMA:	Good morning,8 everybody. Excuse my English.9 THE REPORTER:	You want to bring10 the microphone	a little lower.11	MS. LUCY LEDESMA:	Good12 morning, everybody.13 Excuse my English. I will try  my14 best .15 My name is Lucy Ledesma. I  live16 in an SRO hotel , Henry Hudson, for twenty- one17 years now. As a low- income, disabled woman, most18 of my Social Security check goes to the rent ,19 like most people in the hotel and all over  the20 City too. We are facing homelessness if  there's21 an increase in our rent.22 Times are tough now with23 everything going up, the fare $2.00, more  taxes.24 Please make no increase.25 My present landlord is  Ian12 
2 Schraeger, the former owner of Studio 54,  and3 like all the landlords of the City has  tried4 everything to get me evicted. And when  he5 couldn' t do that , he and his lawyers are  doing6 one of the worst kind of harassment on the  room7 above mine which they keep empty so that they   can8 make all kind of noises twenty- four hours a day,9 pounding,  banging,  dropping heavy  stuff , dragging10 heavy stuff all around the room, jumping  very11 hard  - and that room doesn't have a carpet  - so   I12 can move out.13 No way with the landlord.14 Schraeger is getting away with a lot of  illegal15 stuff like a niteclub in the backyard with  loud16 music coming, the noise of the people  partying.17 And my room is facing the backyard. That  goes18 every night till five a.m.19 So I'm being double  harassment.20 No increase, please. Make a zero increase.  Even21 rollback better.22 Also he' s doing warehousing like23 when a tenant die or is forced out by eviction   or24 is forced out by harassment by the owner,  he25 leaves the room empty vacant on the SRO floor.  No2 
2 increase, please.3 Schraeger and all the  landlords4 of the City don' t deserve no increase with all5 the harassment , decrease of service, no repair.6 All they care about is the guests because   they7 make a huge profit from them. To us, zero.  So8 that 's why they should get zero. Give to us a9 decrease of the rent , to the tenants, to us.10 Be fair now. Don't make us11 homeless. Please.12 Thank you for hearing me.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any16 quest ions?17 (No response.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.19 Deborah Burns.20 MS. DEBORAH BURNS:	Members of21 the Board.22 We hear a lot about budgets   -23 Federal , State and City. Small property owners24 also have budgets to balance. We can't slash  and25 cut services as the Mayor is doing. We can't  post2 
2 notices to our SROs : "We are living in very3 difficult times, therefore, there will be  no4 heat , wat er or electric service to your quarters5 from midnight until six a.m. 116 Last year the Board granted  not7 one penny for SROs. Of ten units in my five- story8 building I have seven SROs which means that  three9 unit s must subsidize the other seven. You do the10 math . It doesn' t encourage landlords to keep11 SROs.12 SROs are the stepchild of  the13 housing market and yet we constantly hear  the14 cries of seniors and the newly- arrived young15 seeking just a single room here in  Manhattan.16 You Members on the Board  that17 were here last year, you should be ashamed  of18 yourselves. Zero increase! How in God' s name did19 you expect us to survive?20 I'm no longer respectful  or21 fearful of this Board . I'm mad and I'm tired of22 coming here and pleading  for my American rights.23 I have the right to break even. I even have  the24 right to make a profit. This Board is taking  away25 my rights . This is not a Communist country . Small2 
2property ownersare not Enron.3The proposed eighteen percent4real estate taxis truly a twenty- six percent5increase as ourassessed values have risen . Water6 rates are higher.7 I have attached a letter from  my8 fuel oil company apologizing for the fifty- two9 percent  increase for heating oil. My oil company10 is more cognizant of the hardship property  owners11 are facing than seemingly the Mayor or  this12 Board.13 Do the right thing. We need  as14 much of an increase for SROs as the  apartments.15 That would at least help a little since  we16 received no relief last year and for two years   in17 a row the Board granted no increases for  SROs.18 Nothing!19 All of my SROs have  stoves,20 refrigerators,  sinks, tables, chairs, chests and21 beds that I furnish. If they did not share  a22 bathroom, they would be considered a  furnished23 studio apartment. It costs more to park a car  in24 my neighborhood  than I receive for some rents.25 Think about the fairness of  this.6 
1282(Audience participation.)3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any4questions?5(No response.)6CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7Councilmember Moskowitz.8COUNCILMEMBER  EVA MOSKOWITZ:9Good morning.10My name is Eva Moskowitz.	I11represent the4th Council District on the East12 Side Manhattan and I chair the Educat ion13 Committee of the New York City  Council.14 I appreciate this opportunity  to15 come before you.16 I'm here to testify against17 increases. We've had a tremendous number  of18 increases. We've had a tremendous number  of19 increases in the last few  years.20 And my district is a kind  of21 interesting district because on the one hand  it22 represents Fifth Avenue, and most people think  of23 it as an incredibly affluent district. It 's24 called the Silk Stocking as I'm sure you  know.25 And yet the majority of my const ituents are12 
1	292 tenants .3 The majority of the concerns  and4 complaints my off ice gets have to do with5 housing.6	I myself grew up middle- class in7 New York City. I grew up in a rent - regulated8 apartment and my parents would not have been  able9 to send me to college, been able to afford  to10 live in New York City without some level of  rent11 protect ion.12 So for me this is a personal13 issue as well as a policy  issue.14 And I mean there' s	there have15 been claims that the Board takes into  account16 market  forces. And yet a few years ago when the17 utility rates went down, the rents still went  up.18 I would urge this Board in this19 time of fiscal crisis to not only consider  the20 morality of imposing yet another increase  on21 tenants who are living in a rather precarious  and22 fragile situation, but I would also urge you  to23 consider the larger issue of the timing  right24 now.25 I grew up in New York during  the7 
2 last fiscal crisis in the 1970s where we  lost3 many of our middl e- income and working families to4 less costly suburban  areas.5 At a time when the transit  fare6 is going up, property taxes are going up, we  need7 middle - income New Yorkers to provide a solid8 foundation, a stable foundation, for life in  New9 York City. And these cont inued rent increases10 have become really unbearable, particularly   for11 seniors living on fixed incomes.12 It 's quite heartbreaking	- I13 would urge any of you to sit in my off ice for  one14 day and hear the stories and the phone calls   I15 get from people who, you know, are spending   all16 of their money on - - their limited income    on17 their rent and their prescription drug  medicine.18 Between those two they have very little  money19 left over to eat . And the situation has gotten20 really quite dire.21 So I urge you to not impose  any22 further rent increases on our tenants this  time23 around.24 I thank you very much.25 (Audience participation.)2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any3 questions?4 (No response.)5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 COUNCILMEMBER  EVA MOSKOWITZ:7 Thank you .8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next9	speaker is Alfred  Scott .10 MR. ALFRED SCOTT:	The11 resolution of conflict without rancor is a goal ,12 an art , a science. Goal , art , science - G-A- S,13 which being II  a gas, 11	as the quip explains, may be14 ut ilized to power, to generate even more energy15 within the environment	in which it operates.16 Political power, volatile as  it17 is, must be handled with great respect and  due18 diligence.19 Cherished , it becomes an energy20 that can only accrue to the benef it of all21 involved.22 Ignored, the product is  class23 warfare and economic strife, which is nectar   to24 the politician and poison to the  people.25 To take into the 21st  century10 
1	322 ancient and unrewarding vestiges of attitude  that3 reflect an irrat ional approach to civil4 resolution is to bypass the opportunity  to5 establish a productive and energy- conserving6 pattern of thinking for America and the  world.7 The only winner here can be  New8 York, which is all of us  together.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 Any questions?11 (No response.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mary Osborne.15 MS. MARY OSBORNE:	Good morning,16 New York City Rent Guidelines  Board.17 My name is Mary Osborne and I  am18 a tenant at 17 West 120th Street , a single room19 in Harlem. I love Harlem and I desire to stay  in20 my community. Harlem is my home and I refuse  to21 be  another victim  of  displacement , gentrification22 and landlord harassment.23 I am a permanent rent - stabilized24 tenant and I have been harassed in the past by  my25 landlord.10 
1	332 My current landlord tried to  run3 me out of my home where I have lived for   thirteen4 years because she want ed to occupy the building.5 Fortunat ely, I was able to remain in my home. But6 that has not stopped my landlord from making  me7 feel insecure and intimidated in my own  home.8 My landlord does not deserve  a9 rent increase based on the harassment that I   have10 suffered. I am a tenant on a fixed income and  my11 single room is affordable to me. I am  fortunate12 to be a single woman and I can survive on  my13 Social Security. But that takes a lot  of14 budget ing.15 I would not be able to afford16 market rents if I were to be displaced out of   my17 single room.18 Many of my Harlem neighbors  are19 being harassed out of their homes by  greedy20 landlords that seek to make a profit out of   our21 only source of shelter. Many of my neighbors   and22 I have gone to Housing Court in order to  demand23 that violations be repaired and provide  required24 services in our building.25 Many of my neighbors in  Harlem2 
2 are the most vulnerable tenants in the City.  We3 are on fixed income and we depend on  affordable4 housing. However, Harlem rents are rising  and5	rooming house tenants are being driven  out.6 Therefore, these landlords don' t need or deserve7 increases.8	I implore you, New York City9 Rent Guidelines Board, to vote zero  percent10 increases. It is the only fair and just thing  to11	do.12 Thank you.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 Elsie Shell. Is she here?16 (No response.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Terry Poe.18 MR. TERRY POE:	Good morning,19 Members of the Board.20 I'm sorry. I really have not  had21 time to prepare remarks for you this morning.22 Everything is a little hectic and  crazy.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I think we24 know what you're going to say, Terry.25 MR. TERRY POE:	Well , would you12 
2 like to ask any questions then, Mr . Markus?3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No.4 MR. TERRY POE:	You probably do5 know what I'm going to say . I'm going to ask  you6 not to permit any rent increases for SRO  tenants7 this year.8 And the reason I want to  do9 that , I think you also have heard me say, is10 well , consists  of a number  of factors .11 One is the fact that ,  despite12 the rise in the Price Index for SRO landlords,  we13 all know that landlords, and especially  SRO14 owners, don't respond to higher nominal prices  by15 spending more money . They, like all rational16 economic actors, tend to economize. And that  sort17 of neutral sounding phrase in this case  means18 they cut back on services . They cut back on19 maintenance  of their buildings.20 And where they can, they  attempt21 to replace existing moderate rent paying  tenants22 with much higher rent paying  tenants.23 And in many cases they  are24 successful even in areas where you would  not25 expect that , such as Central Harlem. The previous2 
2 speaker has just given you some  testimony3 concerning what 's going on in Central Harlem.4 It 's a disaster area right now for low- income and5 moderate- income tenants.6 Gentrification has finally  come7 to Harlem as The New York Times has long  been8 wishing for.9 I would like for you to take10 that into account.11 The other thing I would like  for12 you to take account is the fact that , despit e the13 importance of the proviso, which prohibits  SRO14 owners who are not renting at least  seventy15 percent of their rooms to permanent  rent16 stabilized tenants from taking whatever  guideline17 increases you allow, there are many, many  tenants18 who are not covered by that  proviso.19 There are still many  tenants20 living in SROs which have at least  seventy21 percent permanent tenants who will  not be	who22 will be exempted from the coverage of  the23 proviso. I calculated in an earlier meeting I   had24 with some of the members of the Board,  I25 calculated that there were approximately  three2 
2 thousand in about ten buildings on the Upper  West3 Side .4 I've since done a little  more5 looking and I think the figure is closer to  four6 thousand . There are a couple of buildings farther7 downtown that also fall into this  category.8 Those tenants will not be9 covered by the proviso, in which case I  think10 it 's important to keep their rents affordable as11 well .12 Thank you very much .13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.14 Any questions?15 (No response .)16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,18 Terry .19 MR . TERRY POE:	Okay.20 (Audience part icipation.)21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mike Lewis .22 Is Elsie Shell back in the  room?23 (No response.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mike Lewis.25 MR. MIKE LEWIS:	Good morning .2 
2 I live at the Park Lincoln,3 which is an SRO building on the Upper West  Side.4 And I've lived there for eight years. I  moved5 into this building because it was a place that  I6 could afford. I am a working guy, I work six  days7 a week.8 And the building has been  a9 difficult place to live. The services have  been10 neglect ed. The elevators are out constantly.11 Laundry machines, most of them haven' t worked.12 The security in the building has been a joke.  I13 mean for months there was no lock on the  front14 door so that anyone could just walk in  and15 something that the landlords clearly didn't  care16 about.17 The water goes out of  service.18 Every week they turn it off. Sometimes they  let19 us know ahead of time, sometimes they  don't.20 A rent increase at this t ime is21 just the wrong thing. It 's just not appropriate.22 And I'm already working six  days23 a week just to pay the rent . So I just thought  I24 should come down and represent the building  and25 let you know that this is wrong. I feel  like2 
2 we' re being violated to increase the rent . If3 anything, it should be the other way. We  should4 be compensat ed for what we' re living with in the5 building.6 And that ' s about all I have to7 say.8 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Go10	ahead , Adriene.11	MS . HOLDER:	Where exactly do12 you live?13 MR . MIKE LEWIS:	Park Lincoln,14 166 West 75th Street .15 MS. HOLDER:	West 75th and what?16 MR. MIKE LEWIS:	Amsterdam.17 MS. HOLDER:	And can you tell me18 why you stay? I hear your testimony about  the19 conditions. Why are you  staying?20 MR. MIKE LEWIS:	What 's that?21 MS . HOLDER :	Why do you stay in22 the apartment?23 MR. MIKE LEWIS:	It 's what I24 can afford right now . If I could move out , I25 would. But , you know, since 9/11, my income has12 
2 dropped a lot because I work with tourists.  And3 so our income is down dramatically.  I'm already4 working six days a week. I'm trying to  find5 addit ional work. And the economy being what it6 is, it 's all I can afford right now .7	MS . HOLDER:	Okay.8 And how long have you  been9 there?10 MR. MIKE LEWIS:	Eight years.11	MS. HOLDER:	Okay.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 Thank you .14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Excuse me,16 sir. There' s one more question.17 MR. LUBELL:	What is your rent?18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Another19 quest ion.20 MR. MIKE LEWIS:	It 's $127.5021 per week.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 Has Elsie Shell come back in  the24 room? No?25 (No response.)12 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jose Jorge.3 MR. JOSE JORGE:	Good morning.4 My name is Jose Jorge. I am  a5 hotel SRO tenant. I live in the New World  Hotel6 at 216 West l O O th Street.7 I came here today to testify8 against any rent increase for hotel SRO  tenants.9	The reason is that my landlord10 doesn' t need it and he doesn' t deserve it. My11 building has been or is being converted  into12 apartments from SRO. And those companies  have13 been doing it illegally.14 I called the Department of15 Buildings several times when they started  the16 conversion with the help of the SRO Law  Project.17 But it doesn' t matter at the HPD, called three or18 four t imes, seven times, and keep on doing. He' s19 pulling the low- income peopl e, like myself. I20 living there for thirty- two years. And people21 like myself only get a small Social Security.  I22 live in this place for thirty- two years. And when23 I was working here the salary was $1.00 an  hour.24 That 's what the people used to be who live in25 there where I live now.10 
2 Now my landlord doesn' t want3 those people anymore. He' s converting into luxury4 apartment and he only renting to tourists  and5 students and he has continued harassment to  get6 rid of me and the other tenants .7 Those people who live in  my8 building are very low- income people, some  living9 from the Social Security . And when my landlord10 want to do anything, the only way you can stop   it11 is if you hire a lawyer. The only people who   can12 apply the law to the landlord is a lawyer. But  a13 lawyer costs money. You cannot afford to pay  a14 lawyer.15 And the City and the  State16 agency doesn' t do the job what they are for.17 I would like you don' t increase18 any rent for hotel SRO tenants because we  only19 living there, ten percent. My hotel was  35020 tenants. Now like myself , why you want a rent21 increase? It's going to be tight , difficult.22 We' re only living on Social Security. And  you23 can't be living here with Social  Security24 anymore .25 If you do an increase, it 's2 
1	4 32	going to be very terrible for the people in  SROs.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.4 MR. JOSE JORGE:	I hope that5 you don't increase anything to please  the6 landlord because they' re doing illegal7 conversion, they're making very good  income.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 Any questions?10	(No response.)11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	James Lewis.14 James Lewis. Is he here? Mr.15 Lewis?16 MR. JAMES LEWIS:	Coming.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Coming. Okay.18 MR. JAMES LEWIS:	Good morning.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good morning.20 MR. JAMES LEWIS:	My name is21 James Lewis and I'm Director of Harlem  Operation22 Takeback and also an SRO  tenant.23 With all due respect to  the24 Board , I am directing my comments to the four  new25 Members because we already know what the  other12 
2 five Members and how they are going to  vote.3 So what 's going to happen when4 you make your vot e on Thursday is going to be  the5 difference for people like myself  from getting6 evicted from their  apartments.7 When you look at senior  citizens8 who are barely making it as it is now, and  the9 rent increase is going to be the  difference10 between whether or not they are going to eat  or11 they are going to pay their  rent.12 When you talk about people  in13 hotels and people on fixed incomes, when  you14 increase their rent , again you are talking about15 whether they are going to be able to eat or  pay16 their rent.17 So the alternative to both of18 those scenarios are that people are going to  eat.19 So they are not going to pay their rent  and20 they' re going to get evicted.21 For people who are even paying	-22 - with families who are paying $700 or $800  a23 month rent , the increase is going to be the24 difference between whether or not they are  going25 to be able to take their children out  to2 
2 McDonald' s once a month, and even in more extreme3 cases, again it 's going to be whet her or not -4 that 's a MetroCard	to go to work. That 's food for5 their families.6 We understand that  landlords7 have a right to make money . But I guarantee you8 that ninety- five percent of the landlords in this9 City are making money .10 And if you are talking about  the11 difference between whether someone is going  to12 make a huge amount of money or whether you  are13 going to make people homeless, that 's a question14 you have to ask yourselves and that your  decision15 is going to effectively direct the conditions  of16 how people are going to be  living.17 The City already says there' s18 39,000 homeless people and we can be sure  that19 there' s 50,000. And if you raise these rents, you20 are going to increase those  rolls.21 And  this is not  statistics . This22 is not the rhetoric that you are going to  hear23 from the landlords. This is what 's going to24 happen . Okay?25 I work with about - - I 've been2 
2 at a hundred different buildings, SRO  buildings,3 this year. And I can tell you those are  the4 conditions and those are the things that you  have5 to be worried about when you make your  decision.6 I thank you for your t ime.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 (Audience participation.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any10 questions?11 (No response.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 No questions.14 Robert Sherwood.15 MR. ROBERT SHERWOOD:16 Greetings.17 I echo everything that Anne18 Cunningham has said and what was written in  the19 Gail Gurr	(phonetic) letter and what others  have20 said so far.21 Once again let me remind  you22 that it is wrong to mix big- time and small - time23 landlords and their tenants in the same  setting.24 Also it would be wrong to  make25 an increase under any circumstances  without2 
2 having books open and read. And definitely  we3 must maintain the proviso of seventy  percent4 across the board.5	Now, I am formerly of the  Hotel6 Commander. I say formerly because it 's no longer7 the Hotel Commander. It 's now The Tempo. The word8 "hotel " is dropped.9	Now, as is indicated by  Anne10 Cunningham, I am given this thing up front , to11 the front desk as part of the instructions of  the12 meeting. They are going to be making plenty  of13 money there. Studios are going up for $1450  and14 up, one-bedroom apartments $2125 and up,  two-15 bedroom apartments $2675 and up. Also they  are16 going to have a gourmet restaurant there and  it17 is the presence of that restaurant that  has18 caused the elimination of other SRO  units.19 They are going to be making  lots20 of money in this place with all these  other21 investments and so forth. So whatever they  make,22 they don' t need to have to nickel and dime us as23 SRO people. There is no need for them to make   an24 increase of that because they are going to  be25 making all of this other  money.10 
2 Also we are living in a very  bad3 time because many people are subsisting  on4 recessionary wages, they are not gett ing any more5 overtime, people are unemployed and so forth .  The6 whole situation is very bad , the economy is bad7 and so forth. And this should be figured in as   a8 factor.9	Finally, I want to say this.  I'm10 getting sick and tired of living in the  world' s11 greatest city, the City of New York, when  the12 City of New York continues to be a colony of  the13 landed gantry in Albany.14 Let us work together for  home15 rule now.16 Thank you.17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question,19 sir.20 MS. HOLDER:	I'm sorry, sir.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Adriene22 Holder.23 MS. HOLDER:	Hl•  .I24 Where do you live exactly?25 MR. ROBERT SHERWOOD:	Yeah. At10 
2 the hotel  - - the former Hotel Commander, 240   West3 73rd Street. It is now renamed The Tempo and  they4 have not used the word  " hotel "  in its new name,5 which should be an interest ing situation.6	MS. HOLDER:	How many units are7	in your building?8	MR. ROBERT SHERWOOD:	As I9 understand  it , there used  to be 219 but  it has10 since been reduced to 200. And that the other  1811 units have been demolished and  otherwise12 eliminated  for reservation purposes in the13 accommodation of this new gourmet  restaurant14 which will bring in lots of money by renting  to15 that restaurant people who will pay  the16 establishment of PMG.17 MS. HOLDER:	How many permanent18 SRO tenants are in your building? Do you  know?19 MR. ROBERT SHERWOOD:	I don't20 know offhand , but  it 's quite obvious to me  that21 there has been a signif icant reduction. Right now22 those of us who are still there for over a  number23 of decades are like survivors after  a24 catastrophe. We are survivors there. We  continue25 to be there and so forth .9 
2 But  it 1    s quite obvious to me3 that the number of us has been reduced over  the4 years.5	MS. HOLDER:	What 's the rent for6 new tenants coming into your building? Do  you7 know?8	MR. ROBERT SHERWOOD:	Well, new9 tenants, well , as I say, the studios are going10 for $1450 and up and , of course ,   one-bedroom11 apartments is going $2125 and up ,  two-bedroom12 apartments  $2675 and up.13 And, of course, your  one-bedroom14 and your two- bedroom deals, I understand there15 are other apartments have been abolished  and16 rejoined and reconfigured to make these  setups.17 Now, the one-bedroom and  the18 two-bedroom things, as you notice, already  exceed19 the luxury decontrol situation. That 's another20 thing we have to get rid of . We have to get rid21 of also ERSTAD. We got to be able to  determine22 urban affairs for urban people. Landed  gentry23 must stay out of our city just as we stay out  of24 theirs.25 It is obvious that there has9 
2 been a considerabl e reduction of SRO tenants in3 the building .4	MS . HOLDER:	Do you think the5 proviso would help folks like you in  that6 building?7	MR . ROBERT SHERWOOD :	I would8 definitely think so because it 's quite obvious9 that the number of SRO tenants still there  are10 considerably less than what it used to be,  in11 which case we would fall well below the  seventy12 percent proviso, not including the newer  tenants13 or these new rents and so  forth.14 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you .15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 Thank you, sir.17 MR . ROBERT SHERWOOD:	You' re18 welcome. Thank you .19 (Audience participation .)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Jharna Roy.21 MS. JHARNA ROY:	Good morning.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Bring down23 the mike .24 MS . JHARNA ROY:	Good morning,25 Chairman Markus and the Members of the  Rent8 
2 Guidelines Board.3 My name is Jharna Roy. I'm  a4 permanent resident in On the Ave Hotel which  was5 known as Benjamin Franklin Hotel  earlier.6 In 1997 the owner started7 construction work to convert the SRO hotel into  a8 luxury hotel. I was asked to move twice from  my9 original room. After I moved the second time,  I10 was asked again over and over again to move to   a11 lower floor to facilitate their  construction12 work.13 The construction work on my14 floor went on for about three- and- a-half years.15 Recently it is about to become completed.  During16 the period the central heat ing system was totally17 cut off. In fact , it was cut off since the18 beginning of the construction work in  other19 floors also in 1997.20 The demolition and  construction21 work on the floor left the whole floor open  to22 outside cold air both inside the room, and  the23 floor was always cold even in the cold  seasons.24 Electricity, phone line, TV cables were  randomly25 cut off . Each time I had to call the local phone2 
2 company to fix my line.3 Dust spread inside the room.  The4 floor was full of dust and rubble. Often  walking5 on the floor was dangerous.6 Elevator did not work7 oftentimes . Common kitchens were demolished.8 Except three tenants, all tenants moved out of  my9 floor. Some also dead out of , you know, from10 natural cause. So the floor has only  three11 permanent tenants.12 Electric supply to a few  outlets13 in my room were cut off permanently. Although  I14 was promised that it would be restored , but never15 was restored in three- and- a- half years.16 For last three- and - a- half years17 I could not use the air conditioner because  of18 this cutoff . In my floor except my room all rooms19 have central heating system now. I was told  that20 if I pay  $3000 , they would have provided  the21 system to my room.22 My room has been registered  with23 the DHCR for a legal rent of $2,700 since April ,24 1999. And I have given a  copy.25 Because of all this stress  and2 
2strain, my health conditiondeteriorated.	I3developed additional healthproblems. I could not4cont inue to work in my job.I took voluntary5retirement .6	Even now, in spite of my  request7 to rectify some regular repair issues caused  by8 construction work in my  room, management	does not9 respond any time.10 Thank you.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 MS . JHARNA ROY:	I feel very13 helpless.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 MS . HOLDER:	How many units are16 in your building? Thank you.17 MS. JHARNA ROY:	Right now18 right now I don' t know because all of the19 except three floors all floors have  been20 converted into luxury hotel. So those rooms,   some21 of the rooms are combined, two rooms  combined.22 There were  - -  I heard 400 rooms23 for permanent residents . Now about forty24 permanent  residents are left. The second floor25 and third floor is totally for the  permanent12 
2 residents, and fourth floor has three  permanent3 residents. They were asked to move, they didn' t4 move and I'm one of  them.5 So I do not get any - I get  very6 little service from the them and the rooms have  a7 lot of problems .8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Herb Peckham.11	MR . HERB PECKHAM :	Good12 morning.13 My name is Herbert Peckham.  I14 live on West 14th Street . I've been in Manhattan15 for thirty- nine years off and on, mostly on .16 I want to talk about - - I 'm17 talking for the tenants. I want to talk  about18 costs.19 We say oil prices have gone  up,20 rents go up . Labor costs have gone up, rents must21 go up .22 In fact , is this true?  Just23 before the Iraqi War oil prices spiked and  during24 the Iraqi War. But just after the Iraqi War -  it25 went so quickly - oil prices have plummeted  and12 
1	562 these are the prices for oil per barrel. New  York3 Brent Oil is under $30 a barrel . It 's $27 a4 barrel . There' s going to be a oil glut this5 summer. Iraq is just beginning to pump up  their6 oil output.7 Haliburton and Vice  President8 Cheney are doing fine. By Christmas they will  be9 doing three million barrels a day. So oil  prices10 are going down.11 Don't sell the tenants  short.12 Sell oil short if you want to make some  money13 this summer and this winter.14 Also labor costs, the  unions15 just went into a contract , fine, for the16 superintendents and for the doormen.  But17 landlords use less of these units. If a  price18 goes up , do we buy more, do we buy less, do we19 buy as much? It depends on our budget.  Everyone20 says budgets are tight. So we buy  less.21 Landlords' costs, as far  as22 labor goes, have actually gone down. But yet  we23 are assuming they have gone up. Is there a way  to24 look at labor costs of what these landlords  are25 actually using, actually  paying?2 
1	572 And if oil costs are going  down3 and labor costs are going down, why  the4 assumpt ion that the rent has to go up by a5 certain percentage when, in fact , it 's not true?6	And I was an economist ,7 statistical analyst , and I look at these costs8 very closely. And why go on the rent on false9 assumptions?10 I was also a case worker for  the11	City,  Human Resources  Administration,	" The " Human12 Resources  Administration . And  in the last ,	'97-13 ' 98, when the economy was good , we saw a lot   of14 people end up on the street , they couldn' t pay15 their rent in SROs.16 And , of course,  there are less17 and less SROs available as far as rooming  houses18 go.19 I'm not even talking about20 hotels. Rooming houses are becoming a  dinosaur.21 So we have more and more on the street , not good22 for tourism as Mayor Giuliani once  said.23 And I wonder if we are going  in24 the right direction at all here, if we' re even25 thinking right. I mean we keep thinking the   same12 
1	582	old stereotype way year in and year out , but yet3	some of these things I 've said sort of go against4 the grain of everyday thinking.5 Thank you.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	There is a9	quest ion, sir.10 MS. HOLDER:	Sorry. You' re a11 tenant ; correct?12 MR. HERB PECKHAM:	Yes.13 MS. HOLDER:	Where do you live?14 MR.

2Is Elsie Shell in the room?3(No response. )4CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Elsie has5abandonedus.6Alex Schafron. He' s a regular .7	You won' t miss him .8	MR. ALEX SCHAFRON :	I'm one of9 the season t icketholders Mr. Marcus referred to10 earlier.11	Good morning, Members of the12 Board . Thank you very much.13 Like - - my name is Alex14 Schafron. I'm an organizer with the West Side   SRO15 Law Project and Goddard Riverside  Community16 Center.17 Like my colleague, Mr. Lewis,  I18 think I'm going to address primarily the four  new19 public Members as your votes, as everybody   knows,20 are the swing votes that are going to make  the21 diff erence on Thursday .22 I empathize with the Board23 because like the Board the Law Project is   charged24 with attempting to save affordable housing in   New25 York City and honestly we have not been able   to12 
2 save the majority of SRO housing.3 You've heard a lot about  the4 decline in SRO numbers, from 160,000 to 200, 0005 in the	'50s to the 35,000 that we have today.6	Like I did last year, I'm  going7 to urge the Board to pass a very strongly  worded8 resolution calling on City Hall , calling on9 Albany, and calling on Washington to  preserve10 affordable housing the only way you can  really11 preserve affordable housing, and that is  by12 spending money on building and  preserving13 affordable housing. If that 's what you want to14 do, if you want to protect the stock, which  I15 know that Mr. Markus has urged you all to  do,16 than our government needs to spend money  on17 providing housing for its  people.18 That being said, you are  charged19 with a job and you are holding a very big  stick20 and this is very rough justice. But ,21unfortunately,for the citizens of the City  of22New York, yourstick can mostly do harm and  very23little good.24I appreciate the diff iculties25that a handfulof small owners have. But  every
2 single one of them is guarant eed a profit by DHCR3 and the State of New York. Not a single  tenant4 though is guaranteed a home in the City of  New5 York.6 Sure they are guaranteed a  right7 to spend a night in the jail in the Bronx in  a8 shelter, but they are not guaranteed a home.  Not9 a single one of them, no matter their  hardship10 following 9/11, no matter the hardship  following11 an illness, no matter the hardship of  just12 raising a family in this City, can they go  and13 apply for a hardship.14 So on Thursday when you vote,15 you will be making the difference between  people16 having a home and people becoming homeless.  If17 you approve a four percent  increase for SRO18 tenants, or mind you whatever the 5.5 and  8.519 percent increases you are considering for20 apartment tenants, because I am a  stabilized21 apartment tenant as well , I guarantee you that22 you will be putting people out on the street.  You23 will be making people homeless. You' ll be making24 people sleep in the park. You' ll be making people25 sleep in doorways . You' ll be making people sleep2 
2 under overpasses.3 And that is something that  I4 could never do. And that is something that I  urge5 you strongly to not do.6	No matter what increase that  you7 approve, it will not stem the tide of  the8 destruct ion of SRO housing and the destruction of9 low- income housing.10 But  if you preserve	- - if you11 pass zero increase and a strong proviso for  SRO12 tenants, I guarantee that you will save people' s13 homes and that you will not put people out on  the14 street.15 Thank you.16 (Audience participation. )17 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	What ' s the18 relevance of a proviso if there is a  zero19 increase?20 MR. ALEX SCHAFRON:	Excuse me?21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What 's the22 relevance of a proviso if there is a  zero23 increase?24 MR. ALEX SCHAFRON:	I think25 it 's important to preserve the proviso from years7 
2 past because in the future , if the Board does3 decide on an increase, it's important to send  a4 message to SRO landlords that they will not  be5 rewarded for converting their buildings  into6	hotels.7 So it 's important I think to8 preserve the language because it sends a   strong9	message.10	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank11	you.12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Shashikant14 Patil .15 MR. SHASHIKANT PATIL:	Hi! Good16 morning.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	H ,  I18 MR. SHASHIKANT PATIL:	My name19 is Patil. I live at 1234 Broadway. And  my20 building  is located21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Pull down22 your microphone.23 MR. SHASHIKANT PATIL:	My24 building is located on 31 and  Broadway.25 So the building	- - the main12 
2	floor  is totally  commercial ,  main floor.3	First floor is not rent4 stabilized. So the main floor and first  floor5 landlord having the rate according to his  recent6 lease.7 From second floor up some,  you8 know, apartments are rent stabilized.  Okay?9 Now after I win my court  case,10 my landlord lock me three times. Landlord lock   me11 out three times. Why? Because I kept asking  him12 please give me the copy of the registrat ion. And13 that 's the main reason this landlord lock me out.14 When I came here and I went  to15 the DHCR, landlord never, never  registered16 apartment with the DHCR.  Okay.17 In addit ion to that , the18 landlord, you know, continuously harassing me19 without  stop. Night time sending people  knocking20 at my wall or knocking at my door,  threatening21 me. Using their employees they are  constantly22 harassing me and threatening  me.23 In fact , their two guards told24 me  - - one was whit e and one was black  - and25 management  disciplined white guard but they are4 
2 reluctant to discipline black guard. And  that3 black guard is continuously still harassing  me.4 In fact , that guard,	(unintelligibl e) he stand in5 the hallway and he kill me.6 The same guard, black  guard,7 went  - - you know, bring me  the work,  the boards,8 he stop me. He ask me, you know, I give him  all9 details. He kept asking me my  name.10 Okay. And  in addition  to that ,11 you know, the present manager he' s also harassing12 ladies. He' s following them. One of the ladies13 told me that he went to her apartment asking,   you14 know, what ever repairs should be done. He goes.15 She threw him out and she comes to me and  she16 tells me.17 And they are constantly  talking18 against me to other tenants so other tenants  will19 not contact me and I will not contact  them.20 And I hope you will consider  all21 of these things and I wish you would take,   you22know,bett errole between tenant and  landlord.23CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good. Thank24you.25MR. SHASHIKANT PATIL:	Any

SHASHIKANT PATIL:	Thank9you.10(Audience participation.)11CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sylvia12Zedlar.13MS. SYLVIA ZEDLAR:	Hello!14I was a rent controlled tenant15at 132 West8lst Street for thirty- five years. I16 never had regular rent increases like  most17 tenants do that are rent  controlled.18 I was told by the first landlord19 - -  there were three landlords	to pay  whatever20 they said pay. And I went to the Rent  Control21 Off ice and I said , look, I want my increases. I22 want to be like everyone  else.23 And they said: listen, do  what24 they tell you. You don' t have to have regular25 increases. If they are threatening you or  if16 
2 they' re harassing you, just pay what they ask you3 to pay.4 It so happened that I was  the5 only tenant left in 1970 that was there in  time6 for the rent control. So everybody else that  came7 into the building was under rent  stabilization.8 In 1984, the building changed9 hands, new owners came, they put it down  as10 stabilized. They did not recognize my  rent11 control status. And I continued to  pay.12 I hired a lawyer and  continued13 to pay $150 a month from 1980 to the present  time14 when I was evicted.15 How did the eviction happen?16 I was brought into court  four17 times to be evicted on the basis of rent.  But18 rent was always paid. I had no problem paying   the19 rent . But I was continually harassed. The20 building was - - I was in the building alone    from21 1989. They had no problem getting renters,  but22 they warehoused the building purposely  because23 they had made the building, one half of it , it24 was a townhouse, into a real estate office  and25 they wanted to convert that building at  that2 
2 time .3 I went and complained to the4 Buildings Department and to the HPD. And  they5 said , you know, we can't do much about  that .  Just6 stay there . As long as you're there, everything7 will be fine .8 The result was when they  sold9 the building, the new owner came in and said  I10 don' t want this as an SRO . I don't want tenants.11 And I was continually harassed from 1994 - -   199212 until I was removed.13 And how was I removed? Not  by14 non-payment.	I became a nuisance and they  found15 little things  and  exaggerated. And ,16 unfortunately, my mother became  ill , I was   her17 only child and had to tend to her. As a result , I18 was evicted when I was out of town without  my19 knowledge, without being  served.20 And I did go to court and  I 'm21 still in court. But I think that these kinds  of22 things could never have happened if the laws  had23 been followed. The laws are not  followed.24 There' s such big loopholes . The25 building was already converted initially by  the2 
2 second landlord. She knocked down the walls.  They3 were supposed to have people come in and look  at4 it. They could never come  in.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to6	wrap up.7	MS. SYLVIA ZEDLAR:	I say that8 it 's absolutely imperative that these laws be9 followed. And if they' re not followed , that you10 have a place to go that will take action and  that11 will see to it that buildings that are SROs  are12 not destroyed. Because that 's why they are being13 destroyed , the loopholes and the things that go14 on that are illegal , that are not  caught , or,  you15 know, that are put aside because you don't  have16 the power, don't have the money to  fight.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 (Audience participation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any20 quest ions?21 (No response.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 3	Yvette Garcia.24 MS. YVETTE GARCIA:	Hl'  .I25 My name is Yvette Garcia  from24 
2 Antonio Oliveri Center. That' s a drop- in center3 for women on 257 West  3 0th Street . I've  lived4 there for some time now, for like three  months5 now.6 And I've been told it 's like7 pending that that place will be like  closing8 down. They say like in July. And most of  the9 shelters in the City.10 Now the thing is I lived in  the11 Bronx in the past and I'm trying to get  like12 decent housing. But the workers, they seem  like13 to be like, I don' t know how to put it , like14 procrastinating.15 And I would like like such in  a16 hurry - - I'm nervous - - to get an   apartment17 because I'm afraid that they' re going to put  me18 in one of those God - awful shelters like in19 Brooklyn or in Queens or whatever. And  I20 understand  also they are going to close that21 place also.22 I don' t know exactly where to go23 or what to do. I've been like advocating   for24 myself , going to the Coalition for the Homeless.25 And to me like they haven' t done enough.2 
2 And I've been thinking for  some3 time like moving upstate, Albany or  Schenectady4 or what ever where I could find like reasonable5 rent . I want to live like in a superb housing .6 And I'm speaking for other  women7 that live at the Oliveri Center as well. They  are8 not here with me because, I don't know, are  they9 afraid to talk or they are afraid that they  be10 like pushed out or whatever.11 And I am encouraging people  to12 come to places like this so they can  advocate13 themselves, like to stand up for themselves.  And14 I seem to be like the only  one.15 And for right now I'm still  like16 holding on and being at the Oliveri Center.  That17 place, how could I describe it? It 's small and18 it 's getting crowdier every day. There are new19 faces there. And we sleep on chairs. There is  no20 bed. And it 's very uncomfortable. They have two21 showers. You got to sign your name in the shower22 log, you know, for showers. The bathrooms is  like23 falling apart.24 And I just want to say like  I25 get sick and tired of everything. I just want   to2 
2 like leave everything behind and go.  But3 something tells me that to keep fighting , you4 know, hanging in there.5 Well , - -6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank7	you.8	There's some - - Terry, could  you9 talk to her and see if you can figure out  some10 help.11 (Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	But Marilyn13 Galfin.14 MS. MARILYN GALFIN:	Hello!15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Hi!16 MS. MARILYN GALFIN:	My name is17 Marilyn.	I 've been living in the City for twenty18 years.19 I don' t understand the scope of20 it . Most of you are not even affected by this and21 our lives are in your hands. Okay? I've  been22 living here twenty years. I 'm a single person.23 I'm a freelance performer. You don' t understand.24 This is people and our  lives.25 These gentlemen aren't even9 
2 paying attention. This has no effect on  their3 lives.4 Okay? Some of us are not5 fortunate enough as you. So especially with  9/116 a lot of us have been affected. I'm a  freelance7 performer. There' s not a lot of work.8	Everything has gone up. You' re9 getting us when we' re down. The subway fares are10 going up. Everything is going up when our  incomes11 are not keeping up.12 This is about greed. Okay?  I13 think it 's despicable and deplorable.14 (Audience participation.)15 MS. MARILYN GALFIN:	I went to16 a meeting, a rally. Ninety-year old citizens   in17 the rain, in the rain, fighting for their  rights.18 This is New York City,  the19 greatest city in the world. We have the  highest20 homeless rate.21 It ' s up to you. And this is the22 irony of the whole thing. I don't understand  why23 you have the power and the people don't have  the24 power.25 Okay?9 
2 We are talking about us.  Maybe3 you can' t relate to this. You have homes, you4 have high salaries. To you this is a joke to  some5 of you. Your minds are made up. This is  not6 affecting you.7	I have a choice here. I can  go8 in the streets and be homeless at some point  soon9 with the rents they are getting or I can  leave.10 And a lot of us who are in performing arts  and11 other people  who make  a contribution by doing  - -12 bringing  entertainment  to you - okay?  - we  may13 have to leave. The middle class is being  wiped14 out.15 This needs to stop. Enough  is16 enough. We are talking about people.  People!17 Human beings! Okay?18 I have no idea if you understand19 what it 's like to feel like the next day you20 don't know if you are going to lose your  job.21 What if I tell you right now you're going to   lose22 your job like a lot of people lose their  job?23 You' re not going to have enough money. I don' t24 have enough money for health insurance right  now25 and we want to spend it on another country  right8 
2 now . This is despicable.3 I want to stay in the City.  Why4 do I have to leave? I can't even afford to  pay5 for coffee in my neighborhood . It 's $5.00 . It 's6 insane. It 's insane and out of control.7	You cannot raise anything  right8 now. You have to let us get more income. We  need9 help to keep up with the rising costs. This  is10 not about oil. That 's a lame excuse . This is11 about greed. How much money do people have  to12 make who run this country? This is about  human13 beings . This is about humanity.14 This is about our lives. We  will15 be in the streets or we have to leave . Who do you16 want to live in the City? Just all the rich  who17 can afford it? Is this what the world has  come18 to?19 I want to be able to live  in20 this City. I contribute to the City in  the21 entertainment and joy that I bring to people . I22 don 't want to have to leave. And this is going  on23 all over. Where are we going to run to? It 's24 becoming that no one can afford it  anymore .25 We need no more rent  increases.8 
2	We need nothing to keep us from leaving. We  want3	to stay.4	(Audience part icipation.)5	MS. MARILYN GALFIN:	This is6 our place and the seniors made this place the  way7 it is. How dare you say that they can't even  have8 enough money to feed themselves? This has  to9	stop.10 And I ask you pay attention  to11 the people , and one day this will be knocking on12 your door and maybe you will understand  the13 position that we are in.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have, in17 fact , run out of registered  speakers . Is  there18 anybody in the audience who would like to  speak?19 Come on up. Introduce yourself .20 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	If you've21 registered and not checked in with the  desk22 upstairs, we didn' t get your name up front here.23 So24 MR. JOHN GALLAGHER:	I did both 25	of those things.10 
1	782	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You did both3	of those things?4	MR. JOHN GALLAGHER:	I5	registered and I checked  in.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What is your7	name?8	MR.

BOB GROSSMAN:	Bob Grossman.16 Same thing.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.18 We' ll take you. Just let this19 lady go. We  should have you  - - Mr.  Gallagher, we20 have you on the list but we didn't get   - -21 what ever. It doesn' t make any difference.2 2	Go ahead, ma' am.23 MS. LETASHA WAITERS:	Hi!24 My name is Letasha Wait ers. And25 for the past year I have organized my  community23 
2 in the Central Harlem. The organization  that3 myself and my partner, James Lewis, cofounded,  we4 were forced to come together and to organize  our5 community because of landlords who took  money6 from the Federal government and did  absolutely7 nothing for these properties .8 Now, before we came into  the9 light about  the whole  scandal ,  I myself along10 with several other tenants in my building,  we11 came together and formed our tenant  association.12 During this t ime we got the information that the13 HUD scandal was taking place in our community  and14 we got together and formed what is now  Harlem15 Operation Takeback.16 I just want to let everybody17 know today that if you are increasing the  rents,18 there will be so many homeless children, so  many19 people with disabilities, the elderly. I  mean20 this is just , like the lady just said , it 's21 absolutely absurd.22 How can we promise a nation  that23 we are now tearing down $70 billion to  rebuild24 what we have destroyed , but yet we can' t give25 decent hard -working citizens a place to stay, to2 
2 let them know that , you know, that we are not3 going to increase the  rents.4 That 's all I want to say.5 Thank you .6 (Audience participation .)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mr.8 Gallagher.9 MR. JOHN GALLAGHER:	Good10 morning .11	My name is John Gallagher . I 'm  a12 resident at 123 West 15th Street in  Manhattan .13 I have a little bit of a14 different point of view. I work as an actor and  a15 real estate broker . I make half of my living from16 both of those things . Okay?17 Twenty years ago I was  lucky18 enough to recover from a substance abuse  problem19 so I wound up living right here. When  the20 gentleman said that his SRO room is twelve  by21 eighteen, that would be two in my building  for22 the vast majority of what we  do.23 When I moved into the  building,24 which was a brownstone  from the 1880s, the25 landlords had a thing. They said we' ll give you12 
2 heat and hot wat er, you do the rest. It was  live3 and let live, everybody accept ed it.4 Living there affords me to  do5 the work that I want to do and I'm very  grateful6 for that and I want to make that very  clear.7 At the same t ime to live in the8 City that is arguably the richest society  that9 ever existed on the face of the earth, to  have10 people on fixed incomes, have disabled peopl e,  to11 have old people live on the street is a sin.   And12 I realize that happens in the name of  commerce.13 However, it is a sin.14 I consider myself very lucky.  I15 leave here today, I work eight hours, I  squeeze16 in two auditions and I go to a class and I  do17 community service. So my time is very  full.18 And , again,  I feel very grateful19 for these laws.20 In the late	'90s a woman bought21 my building  for approximat ely $400,000. The rent22 roll in my building  is approximately $9000 a23 mont h. So with a twenty percent downpayment  she24 is not in any financial  jeopardy.25 The building is now on  the2 
2 market for $1.4 million. She bought it  for3 $400, 000 because there were eight rent - controlled4 tenants in there. Now it 's on sale for $1.45 million.6	Now, she feels very cheated.  We7 don' t get supplied goods and services. We clean8 it ourselves. The bricks in the back of  the9 building fell out four years ago. The  neighbor10 had to sue her to put the bricks back in  because11 his building the bricks fell out  too.12 I received a $80 rent  increase13 as a result of that because you fight and  you14 fight and you fight and you fight and you  have15 appeals and finally she won.  Okay?16 There' s constant harassment of17 the tenants. When she first moved in there,  I18 said here' s my rent , I hope to live in peace. And19 she said I'm going to throw you  out.20 We went to court for six  months.21 The SRO Law Project saved our apartments,  saved22 our homes. She had workmen board up a cat under   a23 tenant 's floor and sealed wood over it. The24 tenant had an epileptic  seizure.25 Unfortunately,	she then went and7 
2 applied for a Certificat e of Non- Harassment. If3 we didn' t know the laws, we' d all be homeless.4	Now there are many people in my5 building that are on fixed income, that are  not6 capable of surviving in a better  capacity.7 I want to restate I'm very8 grateful for the rent laws. But I ask for  no9 increase. We take care of the building  ourselves.10 We clean it ourselves, we do everything  ourselves11 and we don' t complain about  it .12 We don' t use the system to try13 to fight back.14 The last thing I want to  say,15 when I first got involved in the rent , I was16 going to join a neighborhood community of  rent17 people. They wouldn' t let me on because I worked18 as a real estate broker. They said that , you19 know, I was the one that made all the  rents.20 Okay? So obviously there  is21 misinformation everywhere.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You sound23 like a perfect candidate for this Board.24 (Laughter.)25 (Audience participation.)5 
2	MS . HOLDER:	I have  a question.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead ,4	Adriene.5	MS. HOLDER:	How many units are6	in the building?7	MR . JOHN GALLAGHER:	I believe8 twenty- one. That 's accurate within one or two,9 yeah .10 MS. HOLDER :	Okay. And are they11 all permanent residents there?12 MR. JOHN GALLAGHER:	Well , no,13 no . There are a lot of transient students that14 are being put in because they know that they' ll15 be gone in' three or four months.16 I'd say there are nine permanent17 residents. What 's happening now because the18 building is for sale is the rooms aren't  being19 re-rented out as they become  available.20 MS . HOLDER:	And how much does a21 new tenant pay?22 MR. JOHN GALLAGHER:	About $70023 for a six by nine room.24 And there are one or two rent -25 controlled tenants for the last twenty  years.8 
2	MS. HOLDER :	Okay . And you said3	14th Street and4	MR . JOHN GALLAGHER :	No . 15th5 Street between Sixth and  Seventh.6 I mean it 's a beautiful7 neighborhood , believe  me . It's a very  fortunate8 place to live.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10	MR . JOHN GALLAGHER:	Thank you .11	(Audience participation. )12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Bob Grossman .13 MR . BOB GROSSMAN:	My name is14 Bob Grossman . I live on the West Side, 80th15 Street , and I 'm a tenant in an SRO hotel . I 've16 been living there for sixteen  years.17 Now, in a way this whol e thing18 strikes me as very funny . You people sit there19 and try to decide what 's the fair thing to do.20 Well , it 's obvious there' s a law21 that says that landlords can claim hardship.  If22 they deserve to get a rent increase, they  will23 get it if they can show it by their books  that24 they deserve  it .25 No landlord has successfully12 
2 done that and only a couple have actually  tried3 to do that. Now think about that ! All these4 landlords claiming that they are not getting  a5 fair increase, they are not gett ing a fair6 return. Let them prove it. Don't accept  their7 word for it. They're not  children.8 (Audience participation.)9 MR . BOB GROSSMAN:	Let them10	prove it. Let them get their books  out.11	Now, the reason they don' t get12 their books out and prove it is because  they13 can't prove it with their books. They are  lying.14 They are making money. They' re making lots of15 money.16 (Audience participation. )17 MR. BOB GROSSMAN:	They just18 don' t know when to stop making money. They want19 more and more. It 's a greed , it 's a sickness that20 these people have. It 's a society. It 's sick21 greed.22 Now look at the other side  of23 it. A society is known, is judged by how well  it24 treats the weak, the poor, the powerless . And25 these are the people living in SROs and  rooming12 
2 houses . They don' t have much of a voice. You've3 heard some of them speak. They're  elderly,4 they're infirm, some of them have all kinds  of5 problems .6 These are the people you  are7 going to put on the street with a rent  increase.8 That 's what you're going to do. Let it be on your9 conscience if that 's what you're going to do if10 you do it. You are going to send more people   on11 the street , to live in the parks and to live  on12 the sidewalks in this great City of New York   with13 all these multimillionaires	running around,14 that 's what you're going to do.15 (Audience participation.)16 MR . BOB GROSSMAN:	Don't kid17 yourselves about legalities and all of  that18 nonsense. You are going to make a choice. Are   you19 going to be a good citizen or are you going to   be20 a rogue, a clown, a  fool?21 Because the society is not  going22 to survive this kind of nonsense very long.  From23 the White House on down we see the same  greed,24 the same nonsense, the same insanity  running25 amuck.2

1982P R O C E E D I N G  S34CHAIRMAN  MARKUS :We have two5 speakers left from this morning because  we6 finished a little early and people expected to  go7 before twelve and they showed up after 11:3 0 but 8	before 12:00.9	So the first speaker will be Mr .10 Robert Eberhard.11 Mr . Eberhard .12 He will be followed by Mr.  Jerry13 Cantor . Is Mr. Cantor here?14 (No response .)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay . Mr.16 Eberhard, go ahead.17 MR. ROBERT EBERHARD :	My SRO is18 a small , four- story, well -maintained walkup with19 thirty- eight air conditioned, neat and renovated,20 furnished rent stabilized rooms on the Upper  East21 Side of Manhattan .22 I don't overcharge my tenants23 and I try to eke a profit out of a business  that24 is increasingly difficult due to  government25 overregulation, a hostile and indifferent  Housing10 
1	992	Court , and ever increasing costs of operation.3	In 1997, the RGB' s former4 Chairman, Edward Hochman, warned that grant ing5 " little, if any, annual increase" to SRO housing6 would punish good faith law- abiding SRO owners,7 " creating a self - fulfilling prophesy . ..forcing8 these	'good' SRO owners to become	'bad' SRO9 owners  simply to survive. "10 That this is exactly what  has11 happened received anecdotal credence  through12 prior testimony suggesting SRO owners  were13 converting rooms to more profitably serve  the14 tourist trade or City shelter needs rather  than15 their traditional clients.16 The RGB is proposing raising  SRO17 rents by only four percent despite its own  Price18 Index of Operating Costs increasing by 16 .919 percent.  Perpetuating a consistent prejudice20 against SRO housing, rent stabilized  apartments21 have been accorded more favorable treatment  with22 rents on one-year leases proposed to increase  by23 5.5 percent with 8.5 percent on two-year  leases.24 As SROs got no increase  last25 year, existing tenants gained a  benefit
2 comparable to the granting of a two- year lease.3 Indeed, over the past ten years,4 while the New York area Consumer Price Index   has5 increased about 27 percent , apartment rents have6 kept pace, increasing at a compounded rate  of7 29.2 percent , though SROs have lagged far behind8 with a compounded rate of increase shy of  13 .79 percent.10 In five of the last ten  years11 the RGB has refused to grant SRO  housing12 accommodations any increase at all . Without a  ten13 percent or greater increase in stabilized  SRO14 rents now, the incentives for maintaining  this15 type of housing will be seriously  undermined.16 100,000 rooms are estimat ed lost17 over the past forty years due largely to  myopic18 City government housing policies.  SRO housing19 serves a critical function in  reducing20 homelessness.21 In 1996, it cost New York  City22 taxpayers $113 ,000 per year to house a patient  in23 a psychiatric ward, $60,000 in a jail cell ,24 $20,000 in a shelter.25 A healthy SRO housing  market
2 relying chiefly on the incentives of the  free3 market is essential to provide the safety  net4 necessary to counter the corrosive effects  of5 homelessness  on the City.6 Thank you.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 Any questions of Mr.  Eberhard?9 (No response.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thanks for11 your patience.12 Thank you. Sorry we had to  keep13 you waiting.14 Jerry Cantor. Is Mr.  Cantor15 here?16 Actually I think he  actually17 said he would be back later. He was on  crutches.18 So we' ll hold him for later.19 Okay.20 Council Member Brewer,  Gale21 Brewer .22 (Audience participation.)23 COUNCILMEMBER GALE BREWER:24 Thank you very much, Chairman Markus, and other25 Members of the Board.10 
2 I am Gale Brewer and I represent3 District #6 which is the Upper West Side and  the4	northern part of Clinton .	And I am proud to5 represent a very large stock of rent - regulated6 apartments in the City of New York,  perhaps7 larger than any other Council   District .8 And the members of my  community,9 the senior, the working class, middle- class10 families rely on the rent remaining affordable  so11 that they may continue to live in our  communities12 and neighborhoods that they call home .13 You know as well as I do  that14 New York City is in a financial crisis . According15 to your report , the City' s economy has shrunk by16 2 .2 percent in 2002, compared to 0 .3 percent in17 I O 1 ,18 The unemployment  rate has19 increased to 7.9 percent last year , up from 6.120 percent  in 2001.21 And as of this March, the  number22 of homeless people staying in our  municipal23 shelters - and I've been a couple of nights  with24 the EAU myself	- was up 16.5 percent from the25 previous year, in addition to there being a  245 
2 percent  increase in the average number of3 families temporarily  sheltered each night.4 New York City - no surprise  to5 anybody in this audience I think - all of us  must6 be sheltered and provided with affordable  housing7 to deal with these issues.8 You've heard to your credit  this9 morning the discussions from tenants and  tenant10 advocate groups, particularly  those who live  in11 Single Room Occupancy buildings and resident ial12 hotels and I echo their sentiment .13 Thanks to Anne Cunningham,  who14 was your first speaker today, who is a  lifetime15 friend of mine, I know that these units  provide16 housing to some of the City' s lowest income17 earners.18 For many of these folks the  SROs19 and hotels are the only alternative to living  on20 the street . Any rent hike, any rent hike, is21 unaffordabl e to these low- income tenants. And ,22 furthermore, a rent increase in this  unique23 housing, many of which exist on the West Side,   is24 not necessary for the income of the  owners.25 These owners derive the bulk  of2 
2 their income from transient guests. I just  want3 to be very specific because I may be one of  the4 few elected officials who really knows this.  With5 Anne I have been in personally the Graystone,   On6 the Avenue, The Lucerne. And there are  sometimes7 fifty or forty tenants or sometimes ten living  in8 these buildings.9	Anne Cunningham knows the name10 of every single one of them. And they are  not11 high- income individuals. But in the lobby, the12 very  fancy lobby at The Belvedere ,  for instance ,13 there are many transients going back and  forth14 paying very high income.15 I haven' t been reckless in my16 household. I know that we charge low and  those17 SRO residential households charge a  fortune,18 sometimes $200 a night. So there is not , I19 believe, a financial crisis for those kinds  of20 housing. And, therefore, a rent increase  would21 not be necessary and would have a dramatic  effect22 on the individual living in those  buildings.23 I also want to talk about  the24 issue of stabilized tenants and the future of  the25 Mitchell - Lama program. I have twenty- one10 
2 Mitchell - Lama developments  in my district , larger3 than any other district in the  City.4	Tonight , last night , Thursday5 night , Wednesday  night , every single night  I go6 to a Mitchell - Lama meet ing . And in many cases7 there are sticky vouchers from HUD  available,8 there are opportunities with the alders. But  in9 the long run stabilization will play a  major10 role. Because even if the tenants who are not  age11 eligible for HUD funding get some kind  of12 landlord assistance, the landlord  assistance13 program will go up based on rents that  you14 decide.15 And so those tenants, whether16 they are eligible to be stabilized or  eligible17 for the landlord program, in the end that  will18 not necessarily be an affordable method  of19 housing unless we have the Rent Guidelines  Board20 issue rents that are affordable to the tenants  in21 these buildings.22 And needless to say, this is  a23 long - standing  opportunity  for affordable housing24 and I also think it 's a crisis, not your crisis,25 but our society' s crisis that we are losing, this5 
2 Mitchell - Lama housing.3 But if you increase  dramatically4 the amount of rent of stabilized  apartments,5 Mitchell - Lama' s will be impacted.6 According to the study that  you7 put out , a full- time worker must earn $19.83 a8 hour or over $41,000 a year to afford a  two-9 bedroom apartment. And for many working  families,10 that income is just not  affordable.11 Boston, I actually spoke  to12 three people in the Mayor' s Office yesterday.13 They are friends of mine. I grew up in Boston.   I14 don't tell anybody in New York. But I grew up  in15 Boston.16 And the issue is that  - -17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you18 wrap up?19 COUNCILMEMBER  GALE BREWER:20 the article in The Times was fairly reliable  that21 the working families of Boston are being  chased22 out to the suburbs where there are very  big23 concerns.24 So the issue of rent  stabilized25 in New York, if we don't have affordable  housing,2 
2	we will follow the way of  Boston.3	And I urge you not to  increase4 dramatically if at all the rents that you  are5 going to be discussing.6 Thank you very much.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 (Audience participation.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any10 questions?11 We have some questions.12 Council Member, we have  some13 questions.14 Go ahead.15 COUNCILMEMBER GALE BREWER:	Hi I16 Betty.10 
17 MS. ADAMS:	Hl' .I18 to see you.
It 's very good
19 COUNCILMEMBER  GALE BREWER:20 Nice to be here.21 MS. ADAMS:	I know that we have22 t ime limits but are there any other things within23 the guidelines that this Board is responsible   for24 that you think would help in  sustaining25 affordable housing?10 
2 COUNCILMEMBER GALE BREWER:3 Well , preservation.	I don' t know that it comes4 under your purview. But in a district like  mine5 we cannot build new housing. We want to  preserve.6 So it's heavily a DHCR lack  of7 enforcement problem and obviously the issue  of8 vacancy decontrol which, again, is more on  the9 State level. But all the issues of  preservation.10 And obviously that 's something11 that isn't exactly in the Rent Guidelines Board ,12 but we need for the Rent Guidelines Board  staff13 and future to think about ways, obviously  rent14 affordability being one of them, that we  can15 preserve the housing we have. We cannot lose   one16 more unit.17 Thank you very much.18 (Audience part icipation.)19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One more20 question. One more question.21 MR. ZELNIK:	I would like to22 just ask you one more  question.23 With respect to the  prior24 speaker, Mr. Eberhard, who presumably  is running25 what you would call a legitimate SRO and has   not2 
2 had increases at all , how do you answer that type3 of building owner?4 COUNCILMEMBER GALE BREWER:	I5 do think that maybe there would be  some6 discussion.  If , in fact , somebody has only  Single7 Room Occupancy, perhaps we could think as  a8 City - and , again, that might be the   City9 Council , thinking about some tax abatement10 issues.11 But where there is an  owner12 like in my district , to be honest with you, I13 don't think we have any like that. They are  all14 transient plus permanent. And in that  situation15 where there is a huge income - I can count   rooms16 and multiply by $200 . And I think that in that17 situation those tenants, for instance, should  not18 get an increase.19 So perhaps we can work as a  City20 to help the individual like the gentleman who   is21 providing  affordable housing for the working22 class.23 MR. ZELNIK:	I think we've had a24 lot - -25 COUNCILMEMBER GALE BREWER :	I2 
2 think there is a difference in the two kinds  of3 buildings.4 MR. ZELNIK:	Right.5 And one of the things that  we're6 trying to do on the Board· is to see how we can7 make that distinction.8 COUNCILMEMBER GALE BREWER:	I9 would be glad to work with you on  that.10 Thank you very much .11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next14 speaker is Council Speaker Gifford  Miller.15 COUNCIL SPEAKER GIFFORD  MILLER:16 Good afternoon, Chairman Markus, Members of  the17 Board.18 I am pleased to have the19 opportunity to say a few words  today.20 I know that this doesn' t come21 directly before the RGB but I think that it  would22 be inappropriate for me to not say, for just   a23 moment	- and I will be brief , I promise,  don' t24 worry. And I actually mean I will be brief . But  I25 think it would be inappropriate with  everything12 
2 that is going on in Albany right now to not  have3 this opportunity before the public and the  press4 to urge the Legislature to act to renew, and  not5 just renew, but to strengthen rent control  and6 rent stabilization laws.7 I know the decision is  coming8 down to the wire as it always  does.9 (Audience participat ion.)10 COUNCIL SPEAKER GIFFORD  MILLER:11 It 's wrong for us to go down to the wire in12 Albany this way. The Speaker of the Council   and13 the Council and the Mayor ought to be  negotiating14 this because this is a City issue. It 's not a15 statewide issue.16 And yet that is not before  you.17 But it should be  resolved.18 (Audience participation.)19 COUNCIL SPEAKER GIFFORD  MILLER:20 And it 's also very, very important that we21 strengthen it and we eliminat e high rent vacancy22 decontrol , which is undermining the system. And  I23 urge the Legislature,  the Senate and the Governor24 and the Assembly, to act as quickly as  possible25 to accomplish that and do it, you know, today or2 
2tomorrow.3But we have to get it  done4within thedeadline.5Today I'm here to say  something6 very simple, which is that with regard to  the7 proposed increases I think that they are to   high.8 And I know that that 's an easy thing to say but9 it 's a hard thing to deal with, these increases.10 Because I think it 's important11 for the Board to consider the reality of  the12 situation for the average tenant whose income   is13 $32,000 a year, who is being stretched  every14 which way, some of which, you know, is part   of15 the City' s fault.16 And yet it falls upon you in17 order to try to preserve affordable housing,   to18 try to preserve working people and  lower- income19 people in this City.20 And given the fact that  actual21 costs have been outpaced by increases  according22 to your studies over the last several years, this23 is a year in which we really have to make  an24 accommodation, where we have to recognize  that25 unfortunately	I'm afraid that these kinds  of6 
2 increases will lead to people losing their  homes,3 people being unable to make ends meet , society4 will bear the ultimate cost , it won' t help the5 housing stock and the City will  suffer.6 And so it 's really just that7 simple. I think it 's too high and I hope you'll8 bring it down.9 And  that was relatively brief ,10 was it not?11 (Audience participation.)12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 Any questions?14 (No response. )15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you16 very much.17 COUNCIL SPEAKER GIFFORD  MILLER:18 Thank you.19 (Audience participation.)20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	James21 Anderson.22 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	I'm here.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.24 We' re going to call names here25 in advance so people know so that they are  ready.2 
2	All right?3	James Anderson, then Maude4	Boltz, then Mary McCune.5	MR . JAMES ANDERSON:	I've been6 speaking twice and nobody of you asked me  any7 quest ions. Now it 's third time speaking . If8 nobody ask me quest ion, I press charge for9 discrimination.10 Yes . I am talking only truth11 because I'm small man, cleaning man, garbage  man.12 I'm not lawyer, professor or politician  to13 understand to lie.14 We have  three point , three step15 against us.16 There is the two World  Trade17 Center, the insurance company rise the price  of18 insurance. First step.19 Mayor and City Council  need20 money, rise the tax.21 Fuel  company cannot  control - -22 the American fuel company together with  Arabic23 Middle  East , they also rise .24 So three step against us . If we25 get three steps, so rent definitely must go  three6 
2 time more. Impossible. A lot of people say  keep3 it safe. Better to no rise, keep down, twenty  to4 thirty percent of the rent is bett er. It is5 possible.6	We know that we live in the7 biggest liberal city, liberal too many.  Liberal8 mean	(unintelligible) last citizen and  capable9 men. They are talking for the people. They  rise10 the tax, they rise the rents, they make  people11 not to retire for what is sixty- five/sixty- seven12 years age. So they are liars. Liberals,  the13 biggest liars.14 Republicans  are close today.15 Close. They're not too different , polit ical16 gangsters, belong to any party, just to  receive17 more money.18 And Mayor of the City,  Giuliani19 receive $198,000 , close to the President. This20 man better because he' s only one dollar. And he' s21 strong to work, do not use a city car  and22 policemen and bodyguard, directly go in  the23 subway. So better than other.24 You become one day some  liberal25 mayor,  like this Fernando Ferrer of Bronx,  you'll7 
1	1162	be much more worse.  Definitely.3	So Governor of Albany, liberal ,4 Cuomo and Carey, they put in big expenses.  The5 apartment houses, community renewal never  exist.6 No one state here started in  1968.7	The housing lawyers, lawyer8 meaning  liar usually, housing lawyers, every9 neighborhood  twenty/thirty blocks,  they represent10 people who make only $26 , 000. They represent one11 another.12 So another boss who  exhausted13 City and State and now become  bankruptcy.14 That is it.15 Any questions, please?16 Pagan and you?17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'll ask you18 a question.19 Where are your buildings,  Mr.20 Anderson?21 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	In Staten22 Island. When Staten Island become an  independent23 city, I'm the first mayor.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Oh! When it25 secedes. Okay.8 
2You got a question. You  can't3sue us now.4MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	What?5CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You can't sue6us now. You gota question.7MR. LUBELL:	I'm going to ask a8question too.9	MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Good.10 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Go ahead , Mr.11 Lubell.12 MR. LUBELL:	I want to make your13 day.14 What was your tax increase  this15 year, sir?16 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Eighty17 percent. When I buy the building, they   increase18 about forty percent. I come in to apply that   I19 will repair, make capital improvement. When   I20 apply, they purposely more because I already   says21 they' re liberal , sick people who stay in the22office, parasit es, educated bums,who just23looking to rise the tax and  thinkit's any24judgment.25CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Okay.
2	MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Pagan.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No, no, no.4	Thank you, Mr. Anderson.5 One vot e, please. Thank you.6 (Audience participation. )7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And also,8 those who called in, you have to make sure  that9 you let the desk upstairs know that you are   here.10 We are going to go by the numbers based on  when11 you called in to register, but we need to  know12 that you are here otherwise we can't call  your13 name.14 Okay.15 Maude Boltz, Mary McCune -  if16 the people could move closer. We are trying  to17 make sure everybody gets a chance to talk  here.18 Maude, go ahead.19 MS. MAUDE BOLTZ:	Okay. Hello,20 Members of the Board.21 I'm going to be brief because22 you all know what has happened with prices   and23 all. You know what' s happened with insurance  and24 you know what' s happened with taxes.25 And one of the Members of  the8 
2 Board stated that the small landlords  represented3 only thirteen percent of the total landlords  of4 the City. I got clarif ication on that and I found5 out that it 's thirty percent or something like6 that ire City small landlords and they  own7 thirteen percent of the units in this  City.8 If that 's a correct number, then9 what we come up with is a kind of an  imbalance.10 In other words, the City is mostly controlled  by11 rich landlords and countered by small , you know,12 low- income tenants.13 So I don' t know how the Board14 comes to a decision as to what is equitable.  It15 seems to me like the small landlord is in  the16 middle of this squeeze, that if a low  increase17 satisfies a rich landlord, certainly the  small18 landlord is going to be the one that 's hurt.19 I myself have struggled  through20 twenty years of running a building and I  was21 paying two mortgages. And I was trashed by  a22 tenant and that cost me upwards to about $18 , 000.23 I'm still paying off $10,000 of that  money.24 So it's not like I've made  some25 kind of glorious profit. And I've also given   up2 
2 my insurance and I've given up my car. So I   sort3 of walk around the room and I hear  tenants4 speaking about how they just bought all  new5furniturefor their apartment or, you know, they6are goingto have to give up their  insurance.78                    You know, I don' t want to seeanybody suffer. But I would like to know,  you9know, just howdo you really know what the10balance is.11 I have a rent controlled  tenant12 whose daughter sold her home in Staten  Island13 that had a swimming pool and moved in with  her.14So I don' t know quite how the15systemisworking. It's still a mystery to  me.16That 's all I have to say.17CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18Any questions?19(No response.)20CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,21Maude.22(Audience participation. )2 3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No boos.24Mary McCune.25And  after that , Anita Thomas.
2	MS. MARY McCUNE:	Hl'  .I3 My name is Mary McCune and I  am4 a staff attorney at the Bronx AIDS Services  Legal5 Advocacy Program. I represent people who are   HIV6 positive or living with AIDS in civil  cases,7 including Housing Court proceedings.  Because many8 of my clients are too ill to attend this  meeting,9 I am here today to speak for  them.10 All tenants need stability  in11 their housing, but my clients need it more  than12 most. They need to have undisrupted access   to13 their health care providers and they need to   live14 near their support  network.15 My clients need to live  in16 apartments that are well maintained  because17 repair problems can have an adverse effect on18 their health. For most of them, their only  income19 is public assistance or SSI. Finding a  decent20 affordable apartment has become more and  more21 difficult. If this Board approves rent  increases22 of 5.5 and 8.5 percent , it will become23 impossible.24 In the ten years I have worked25 in the Bronx I have seen apartment rents  double3 
2 and in some instances triple. At the same  time3 conditions have deteriorated  in the buildings.4	When I bring up repairs in5 court , almost invariably the landlord asks me if6 my client wants to move. It is not only  cheaper7 for the landlord to have the tenant move out  than8 to do the repairs, the landlord also gains  a9 permanent  financial benefit  from tenant turnover10 through large vacancy  increases.11 The problem is that my  clients12 have no place to go.13 A client who came to my off ice14 has had PCP, a form of pneumonia, five times   in15 the past three years due to the landlord' s16 failure to adequately heat her building.  She17 decided to move because she couldn' t get the18 landlord to do the repairs, and after a year  she19 still has not been able to find another  apartment20 that she can afford.21 Another client has no  working22 sink and a collapsed kitchen ceiling. One of  his23 building' s street doors is missing. The24 apartments have no electricity.  The conditions  in25 the building were so bad that the  Administration5 
2 for Children' s Services would not release my3 client 's children to his custody unt il the4 repairs were done.5 Other tenants have started court6 cases against the landlord to no avail.  Because7 he want ed to get his kids back as soon as8 possible, he decided it would be faster to  move9 to a new apartment. He is still looking  after10 four mont hs.11 If the Board approves the12 proposed increases of 5.5 and 8.5 percent,  many13 of my clients will be forced to move. The   shelter14 allowance is capped for those who receive  public15 assistance, and many of my clients are  already16 paying rent at or near the maximum  allowed.17 Those who can will have  to18 relocate away from their support services and   the19 medical providers they rely upon to keep20 themselves healthy. Those who have no place   else21 to go will end up in emergency housing ill  suited22 to accommodat e their needs. Because their health23 is so precarious,  these rent increases are24 literally a matter of life and death for  my25 clients.2 
2 I am shocked that the Board3 should propose such large increases during a  t ime4 of economic recession.5 I am outraged that my  clients6 are already paying more than they can afford   for7 the privilege of living in substandard  and8 dangerous  living conditions.9 And I am incredibly  frustrated10 that year after year this Board rewards  bad11 landlords for failing to maintain their  buildings12 by awarding them rent increases even in  years13 where the Board' s own formula indicates that no14 increase is justif ied.15 This Board has an obligation  to16 look at the economic impact of the  proposed17 increases on the tenants of this  City.18 I ask the Board to  reconsider19 the proposed rent increases of 5.5 and  8.520 percent and to reject them as too  high.21 Thank you.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 (Audience part icipat ion. )24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any25 questions?2 
2(No response. )3CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	There are no4quest ions.5Anita Thomas, please.6MS. ANITA THOMAS:	Good78afternoon.On behalf of the members of  the9Real Estate Board ofNew York, owners, builders,10managers and brokersof high rise residential11property, I urge theRent Guidelines Board to  set12 realistic rent increases which reflect today' s13 substantially  increased costs.14 The proposed increases of  5.515 for a one-year lease and 8.5 for a two-year  lease16 will not cover the increased costs to  operate17 apartment buildings in New York  City,18 particularly	in light of recent trends such  as19 the explosion in the cost of insurance  premiums20 and the huge hike in property  taxes.21 As the RGB' s Price Index of22 Operating Costs indicates, fuel oil  costs23 skyrocketed last winter and , with natural gas24 prices currently going through the roof , fuel25 costs generally continue to  rise.12 
2 More importantly, as the  core3 PIOC indicates, all other costs rose at  an4 historically  unprecedented pace.5 Apartment building owners  have6 seen insurance premiums rise more than  one7 hundred percent , and two and three hundred8 percent increases over the past two years are  not9 uncommon.10 The proposed rent increases11 ignore the extraordinary  increases in insurance12 costs, something owners wouldn' t be able to do.13 Real estate taxes  increased14 sharply due to the largest property tax  increase15 in history, and assessments continue to rise .16 Apartment buildings are seeing an average of a   2217 percent rise in property taxes this  year.18 Facade work continues at  an19 extraordinary pace due to the Building  Department20 requirements of the last few years; lead  paint21 maintenance	is a continuing expense; and mold  has22 become both a maintenance	cost and added23 insurance cost. Security issues are at  the24 forefront of owners' concerns and contribute  to25 rising expenses.2 
2 Taken all together, the outlook3 for the next two years is clear: operating  costs4 are on the rise.5 While many high end units are  at6 market rent and may not be able to collect  the7 full amount of the proposed increases, it  is8 still critical that the RGB increases  reflect9 real cost changes. The reason for this is  simple:10 there are many older buildings with long- term11 tenants at very low regulated rents  where12 rational increases are necessary in order  to13 cover the current high operating costs.  These14 owners require rational rent increases  which15 cover their expenses.16 For all of these reasons,  we17 find the proposed increases fall short . We urge18 the RGB to pass substantially larger  rent19 increases for the coming year.20 Thank you.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22 (Audience participation.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Joseph24 Joshua.25 We want to make sure that2 
2 everybody gets heard here . And if we refrain from3 the booing  and the applausing,  applause  -4 applausing, that 's a new word - and the applause,5 I think we' ll be in much better shape .6 Also let me indicate that  Joseph7 Joshua, Andrew Hoffman, then Mr. Cantor will  go,8 who is from this morning.9 Go ahead.10 MR . JOSEPH JOSHUA:	Yes .11 I'm Joseph Joshua. I live up  in12 Parkchester, near Parkchester, one	a couple of13 the buildings up there .14 THE REPORTER:	Keep the15 microphone up.16 MR. JOSEPH JOSHUA:	Twenty17 percent or thirty percent that these landlords  -18 I call them slumlords - ask you to raise, you  got19 to be out of your mind to give them  this.20 Half of these slumlords,  rich21 landlords, don' t do none of the repairs in the22 house . I have pictures, photographs of many23 disability people  living near Parkchester, no24 more than a half - block, a block away, in25 brownstones, that these landlords don 't do2 
2 nothing.3 And I'm saying for you to  even4 think about here, why don' t you come and live5 where I live and then tell me would you give  them6 a thirty or twenty percent  increase.7 (Audience participat ion.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 Mr. Hoffman, Andrew  Hoffman.10 Let' s go. We' re trying to limit11 the time delay here.12 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	Good13 afternoon.14 My name is Andrew Hoffman and  I15 come here today as the President of the  Community16 Housing  Improvement  Program and an owner/operator17 of rent controlled and stabilized apartments  in18 New York.19 As I testified earlier this  year20 in front of the Rent Guidelines Board , the21 expenses relat ing to the operation of residential22 buildings have increased dramatically. The  Rent23 Guidelines Board Price Index of Operat ing  Costs24 is at an extraordinary high level and, in turn,   I25 call on the Guidelines Board to  take9 
2 extraordinary measures to help property  owners3 recoup some of these massive  increases.4 One of the ways I believe  the5 Guidelines Board could assist owners is in a  very6 simple way, eliminate the incentive given in  the7 past for tenants who enter into two-year  leases.8 We have all heard the  analogy9 that having a rent stabilized apartment is  a10 little like winning the lottery. The signing of  a11 one or two-year lease is one of the  perfect12 examples of the lottery. When the Rent  Guidelines13 Board promulgates  relatively  low guidelines,14 tenants sign two-year  leases.15 According to my records,  over16 sixty-five percent of the tenants in the  past17 year who were offered a one or a two-year  lease18 opted for a two-year lease. Why wouldn' t they? At19 four percent , it was  a bargain.20 Add to that the fact that by  the21 time the tenants were signing the renewal  leases22 last year, it was already October,  the23 handwriting was on the wall for the high  real24 estate taxes and all the other high costs.  The25 tenants knew what they meant , that there would be2 
2 higher increases this year .3 The tenants who opted for two-4 year leases have won the apartment  lottery.5 They' ll completely miss the large increase the6 Rent Guidelines Board must promulgate  this year,7 and next year with the PIOC estimated to be  fifty8 percent of this year's number, it stands  to9 reason that next year' s guidelines could be half10 of what they are this year .11 Again, these rent  stabilized12 tenants have won the apartment  lottery.13 It 's time for the Rent14 Guidelines Board to eliminate  this particularity15 and pass rational guidelines for one -year and16 two-year leases so that every New Yorker in  a17 rent stabilized apartment will pay their   fair18 share.19 Why doesn' t the Rent Guidelines20 Board simply double the figure? I don' t21 understand.22 Under rent stabilization  I'm23 required to offer renewals24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Please, if we2 
2 let all the speakers speak, then everybody in   the3 audience will get a chance to speak. It's  the4 only way it 's going to work.5 Go ahead , Mr. Hoffman.6 Let 's have some decorum here.7 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	If under8 rent stabilization I'm required to offer   renewals9 every year, why is it so important for a  two-10 year lease?11 I've heard the argument  that12 it 's advantageous to the marketplace  to retain13 stability by offering two-year leases, but as   the14 wild spikes in the PIOC these past few years   have15 shown, the difference between one and two- year16 guidelines has just added fuel to the fire  of17 rent skewing, whereby the same apartments  next18 door to each other could rent for  hundreds,19 sometimes thousands of dollars difference  each20 month. It 's only because the luck of picking a21 one or a two- year renewal.22 I understand that this is  a23 novel approach and I believe in the  current24 fiscal environment the Guidelines Board must  be25 innovative. Eliminate  the two- year lease2 
2 preference would certainly be a  start.3 Thank you for your4 consideration.5 (Audience participation.)6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Any7 questions?8 (No response.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Nobody.10 Mr. Cantor. Oh! Sorry. There' s a11 quest ion. Just hold on Mr. Cantor.12 Go ahead. Mr. Lubell.13 MR. LUBELL:	Mr. Hoffman, what14 do you propose that the Guidelines  pass?15 MR. ANDREW HOFFMAN:	Our cost16 last year, as your own figures indicate, were 1717 percent.  I fully understand  the Guidelines Board18 has to do their best in tempering  these19 increases. We certainly need more than a  ten20 percent  increase this year.21 (Audience participation.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 Mr. Cantor.24 Mr. Cantor will be followed  by25 Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum, followed by  Anita10 
2 Romm, followed by Paul Brensilber, followed  by3 Roberta Bernstein.4	Mr. Cantor.5	MR. JERRY CANTOR:	Could I have6	no cameras, sir, please.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Can you have8	no cameras?9	MR. JERRY CANTOR:	Please.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I can't stop11 the press.12 MR. JERRY CANTOR:	Okay.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I can only14 ask them to edit you out.  Okay?15 MR. JERRY CANTOR:	Well , okay.16 I just wanted that measure of  privacy.17 By the way, I just want ed to18 make a point that I was here at 11:33 ,19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.20 MR. JERRY CANTOR:	- - and I was21 told that you would be here to hear testimony  to22 noon. I saw a very kind Mr. Markus in the hall.   I23 wish somebody could have allowed me to speak   that24 half hour rather than have to go somewhere  and25 come back.10 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	I 'm sorry.3 Go ahead.4 (Audience participation.)5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Mr . Cantor,6	go ahead. Just ignore the  crowd.7 MR . JERRY CANTOR:	Yeah.8 My manner, Mr. Markus and9 everyone else, is one of mannered  civility.10 You' ll probably hear a lot of yells and shrieks11 and babble and whatnot and I ask the crowd  to12 give me my respect . I'm on your side out there.13 Just let me do it the way I want to do it .14 Now, I would ask you for  an15 accommodation if for no one else , for me, or  for16 the body of them. Why? Because  - - by the way,   I17 came down here from a three- flight walkup . And I18 got - - okay .19 Give me the respect , all right?20 Now, I had the misfortune  of21 going to something like public testimony for   the22 airwaving rights for the Broadway producers.  And,23 gee, it 's a good thing I had my hankie along24 because Stephen Sonnheim was down there  crying25 about how he' s not making enough money. And9 
2 what' s his name , that had  II   The Producers, 11	Lee3 Bernstein.4	You know, from royalties alone,5 it 's just the same bed of guys, scoundrels, that6 come along, like the Asian longhorn beetle  every7 year. I got to get here how I can. Or it's  like8 the West Nile Virus or something that is a  pest ,9 which is this.10 Because I feel that any  facts11 that they are bringing along are padded. The  rent12 increase is not well founded. I don' t trust where13 they get their figures from. You have to see  the14 more professional people from West Side SRO   for15 that. I believe their  figures.16 And that' s where I'm coming from17 when I come down here today to talk to  you .18 I'm a friend of my landlord.  I19 like him, he likes me. But when it comes  to20 business, I'm not going to let the wool be   pulled21 from under me or, you know, over my eyes,  the22 carpet from under me.23 And I hope you'll take it  to24 heart that I need to be an actor and just  get25 along, you know, the way I do and want to,  my5 
2 quality of citizenship  .3 Thank you.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you. We5 appreciate it . Thanks for your pati ence .6 (Audience participat ion .)7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Public8 Advocate  Gotbaum .9 PUBLIC ADVOCATE BETSY  GOTBAUM:10 Thank you, Mr . Chairman, for allowing me to11 testify here today .12 New York City has long been  a13 leader in providing  affordable housing.14 Affordable housing created a New York with  great15 diversity , our finest asset .16 Today, however, all signs  point17 to a housing crisis in New York City .18 Housing is the number one  issue19 in calls that my off ice receives almost daily,20 and in the end the problems always boil down  to21 money and affordable living  conditions.22 There are thousands of  homeless23 in streets and shelters and the numbers  are24 rising .25 200 , 000 people are on the list8 
2 for 176,000 units of public  housing.3 The wait for a Section 8  voucher4 is over one year.5 A New Yorker earning the  minimum6 wage must work 154 hours a week to afford a  two-7 bedroom unit at the area' s fair market rent.8	The fate of rent control  and9 rent regulation hangs in the balance today.  As10 market rents rise and landlords continue to   take11 advantage of luxury decontrol and  vacancy12 decontrol , the City' s stock of affordable housing13 is rapidly decreasing.14 Tenants at every income  level15 are under attack, and if we do not act to prot ect16 them today, we will drive more and more  New17 Yorkers into our streets, our shelters and out   of18 our City.19 These high increases will  also20bring manystabilized apartments close to  $2,00021month, thedecontrol threshold that  many22	landlords are hoping for . These apartments will23then belost from rent stabilization  forever.24The Rent Guidelines Board  was25createdto strike a balance between landlords  and
2 tenants by keeping housing both affordable  for3 tenants and profitable  for landlords. Yet4 historically, the Rent Guidelines Board has  given5 more weight and credibility to the plight  and6 profit margins of landlords rather than to  the7 plight and living costs of our  tenants.8 Never has the Rent  Guidelines9 Board declared a rent decrease, nor has it  ever10 declared a rent freeze.11 Often, high fuel costs have  led12 this Board to increase rents at a very  high13 percentage. Moreover, even last year when  the14 Price Index of Operating Costs decreased,  the15 Rent Guidelines Board raised the rents by  two16 percent for a one-year lease and four percent   for17 two-year leases.18 I ask that this Board  consider19 other factors including the stock of  affordable20 housing and owner income and  profits.21 I am also very supportive of  the22 City Council having a voice in the selection of  a23 Board Member.24 (Audience participation.)25 PUBLIC ADVOCATE BETSY  GOTBAUM:2 
2 I implore you to preserve affordable  housing3 throughout the City by controlling  rent4 increases. These proposed  increases are5 exorbitant , unjust  and unfair.6 And I urge you to do the  right7 thing and end the affordable housing crisis  in8 this our great City.9 Thank you.10 (Audience participation.)11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 Any questions?13 (No response.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 Anita Romm, the poet laureate  of16 the Rent Guidelines Board.17 MS. ANITA ROMM:	Good18 afternoon.19 My name is Anita Romm. I am  the20 songwriter for Metropolitan  Council on Housing.21 And I have gone to all of your meetings this  year22 and read all of your reports.23 On the surface it looks like  an24 increase might be warranted, but think of all  the25 years when landlords got higher increases  than2 
2 they deserved.3 Last year when a rollback or  at4 least a freeze was called for, you gave  landlords5 two percent and four percent , more than they6 deserved.7 Also the supply of rent8 regulated housing has seen a humongous decline  in9 recent years. And , incidentally, a little bird10 told me that in Westchester the Rent  Guidelines11 Board only granted a one percent/two  percent12 increase even though they' re working with a13 situation just as bad as  ours.14 Now, I wonder do you really  read15 the reports? I am much too ladylike to  suggest16 what I think some of you might be doing  with17 those reports.18 (Laughter.)19 MS. ANITA ROMM:	Do you really20 want a society with massive homelessness  and21 perhaps people forced into camps with  "Arbeit22 Macht Frei II   on the front gate?23 On June 19th, you will be  voting24 on the rent guidelines. June 19th is the  50th25 anniversary of the martyrdom of Julius and  Ethel.2 
2 Please don't make martyrs out of New York  City3 tenants.4 Laissez faire mon derriere .5 (Audience participation.)6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next7 speakers that are being called now are  Paul8 Brensil ber, Roberta Bernstein, then State Senator9 Karl Kruger and Brooklyn Borough President  Marty10 Markowitz.11 (Audience participation.)12 Paul Brensilber . Mr. Brensilber?13 Is he here?14 (No response.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Is he here?16 (No response.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Roberta18 Bernstein .19 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Good20 afternoon, Chairman Markus, other Members of  the21 Board , welcome, especially Steven Schleider . And,22 congratulat ions, I don' t know how you do it year23 after year, Mr. Lubell .24 I'm Roberta Bernstein. I'm25 President of SPONY, the Small Property Owners  of7 
2 New York. My members typically own the  walkup3 buildings which are greatly impacted by  the4 guidelines that you will be passing this week.  We5 have over a thousand members and we are part  of6 working folk just like our  tenants.7	Like most of our tenants, we  go8 to work every day. Like our tenants, we  get9 discouraged when the price of goods,  public10 transportation,  housing,  car insurance, gas,11 electric, et cetera increases. But as  costs12 increase to supply these commodities  and13 services, the increase is passed to the  consumer .14 Like our tenants, we want  our15 dollars to go as far as possibl e. But we find16 that stretching our housing dollar is  getting17 more and more difficult.18 We are desperately unhappy  that19 on top of our assessment increases, we had  real20 estate taxes increased by eighteen percent  this21 year alone.22 Many owners have seen  insurance23 premiums go up two times within the last  two24 years. And fuel consumption, this past wint er,25 aside from the fuel costs, rose thirty  percent.8 
2 If we could roll back the3 tremendous increases this year in  taxes,4 insurance, fuel oil and water charges,  we5 wouldn' t be asking for a ten to fifteen percent6 increase on the one and two-year lease. That 's7 the minimum that we need to cover our  increases.8 Now, tenants fight us, and  I9 understand, in opposing rent increases. But  we10 can't fight those who instituted the  monumental11 increases in real estate taxes, et cetera.   In12 fact , the legislators who speak before you today13 are the first ones that voted for our  tax14 increase.15 You know, a lot of small  owners16 don' t make a lot of money. If they see $5 , 000 a17 year profit it 's a lot.18 The tax increase that we19 sustained eats up a lot of that profit. A lot  of20 owners have to have that second job just to  make21 ends meet.22 You know, we make the  system23 work. We provide our tenants with a service   and24 the cost to provide the service has  increased25 tremendously. As in every other aspect of  our2 
2 economy, the costs must be passed to the  ultimate3 consumer, in this case the  tenants.4	Now, our needy tenants do have  a5 safety net . Seniors have the SCRIE program and6 Section 8 has started issuing vouchers again   for7 low- income people.8	We have no such safety net.  If9 we cannot meet our expenses, we lose  our10 investments, we lose our properties. And , yes,11 many of us live in our buildings and we' ll  lose12 our homes too.13 Now, there are regulated14 apartments for sure for which these guidelines15 will have no impact. They're at market  rents16 already. But the guidelines you pass this week17 will impact on most apartments in New York  and18 they will have a critical impact on the  survival19 of the small owner.20 Help us to keep our  buildings.21 Help us to continue to supply the  essential22 service we provide best , that is supplying  safe23 and affordable housing in New York  City.24 Thank you .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 
2Any questions?3(No response.)4CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Is Mr.5Brensilber here?6(No response.)7CHAIRMAN MARKUS:Okay.8State Senator KarlKruger.9STATE SENATOR KARLKRUGER:10 Good afternoon, Chairman Markus,  ladies and11 gentlemen of the Board.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.13 STATE SENATOR KARL KRUGER:14 Last night in my hotel room in Albany I  was15 watching a film on the history channel. And   it16 spoke about vaudeville being  dead.17 Well , in coming here  I realized18 that vaudeville is not dead. It's alive and   it's19 breathing and it 's right here at Cooper Union.20 And why we talk about this  as21 vaudeville is because we talk about this as   a22 low- key chorus, a low- key chorus that has sat in23 the background	for X number of years and  they24 talk about the plight of the tenant and the  need25 of the landlord.10 
2 Yet at the same time, year  after3 year, this Board with reckless disregard of  the4 facts, has moved forward with an agenda,  an5 agenda that says that the tenant can drop  dead6 and the landlord has to  survive.7 (Audience participation. )8 STATE SENATOR KARL KRUGER:9 From time in memorial we talk about the need  for10 affordable housing in the City of New York.  We11 talk about the need of the  tenant.12 Yet at the same time when  we13 show flat costs for the landlord, the  tenants'14 increase goes up two percent.15 This year people are hiding16 behind the fact that there have been  exorbitant17 real estate tax increases and there have  been18 increases in operating costs. Well , the fact of19 the matter is at the end of the day the  tenant20 suffers the same burdens when they have to  pay21 taxes.22 (Audience participation.)23 STATE SENATOR KARL KRUGER:	The24 tenants suffer the same burden when people  cook25 the books and they suffer an illegal  fare2 
2 increase.3 The tenants suffer the same  as4 they are laid off from their jobs and from  their5	employment.6	(Audience participation.)7	STATE SENATOR KARL KRUGER:	So8 today is the day of reckoning. Today we have  to9 decide whether or not the tenant survives or  the10 landlord prevails.11 And today is the day, Mr.12 Chairman and Members of the Board, where you  can13 make history. Where a rate increase is  proposed14 and spoken of and adjusted, set that it will  be15 5.5 percent even before the hearings, that  that16 is not vaudeville, that 's a kangaroo court and17 that 's what we' re facing today.18 (Audience participation.)19 STATE SENATOR KARL KRUGER:	So20 now more than ever before, as we've pulled  off21 the shroud of mystery, as we move forward with   an22 agenda, as we talk about trying to save  middle-23 income families in New York today, then today  is24 the day when your Committee can say that  this25 Panel has heard the voices of the tenants for  the8 
2 first time.3 And rather than talking  about4 flat, rather than talking about reductions,  today5 we are pleading	for the same. The same should  be6 at least , at least the minimum that we get out  of7 today. But rather we walk away with a sense  of8 trepidation, a sense of disrepair, a sense  of9 urgency, but yet without a sense of commitment  on10 your part that you move forward with an  agenda11 that says tenants  first.12 Thank you.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right ,15 Marty. Let 's see if you can top that.16 Come on, Marty.17 BROOKLYN BORO PRES.  MARKOWITZ:18 Let me propose something very novel . How about19 implementing a regulation that tenants pay  rents20 at the end of the month rather than at  the21 beginning of the month?22 (Audience participation.)23 BROOKLYN BORO PRES.  MARKOWITZ:24 Only in housing do we pay in anticipation of   what25 service we' re going to get as opposed to every2 
1	1502 other service where you pay after you've gotten3 the service. How about something like that  to4 consider.5	Anyway, let me say good6 afternoon.7 For almost all of my adult  life8 I have fought for affordable and safe and  decent9 housing, which is an issue that affects  everyone10 in most every neighborhood	in New York City.11	New York City, and especially12 Brooklyn, as you know, has a severe  housing13 crisis with housing conditions that  are14 deplorable and unsustainable	for so many of our15 residents.16 (Audience participation.)17 BROOKLYN BORO PRES.  MARKOWITZ:18 Available  resources for developing  and preserving19 affordable  housing  are  insufficient.  Therefore ,20 we need to develop more housing opportunities   and21 find better and more creative ways to  maintain22 and improve what we already  have.23 More than fifty percent of  New24 York City renters are paying over thirty  percent25 of their income on  rent.
