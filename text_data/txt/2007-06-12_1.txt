2	P R O C E E D I N G S34	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Good morning .5 My name is Marvin Markus.	I'd like6 to welcome everybody here to one in a series of7 meetings and hearings designed to fulfill the8 statutory mandate of the New York City Rent9 Guidelines Board to promulgate the allowable lease10 adjustments for rent stabilized apartment houses,11 hotel stabilized apartments and loft stabilized12 apartments for leases that are entered into13 between October 1, 2007 and September 30, 2008.14 This is the public hearing, one of15 two public hearings.	We will have another one16 next week in Queens.17 And in terms of announcements,  there18 really aren't any.	Just in terms of the - - as I19 said, there will be another public hearing.	It20 will be June 19th, 4 to 10 p.m . at LaGuardia21 Community College .	You can call the office,22 212-385- 2934 to preregister.23 The final vote of the Guidelines24 Board is scheduled right here at Cooper Union on25 Tuesday, the 26th of June at 5:30.5 
2 In addition, there's some research3 memos from the staff in your folders .	That's for4 the Board members.5 We're going to have this public6	hearing.	I think most of you here know the rules.7 I have a list here of pre-registered.	Those of8 you who came in and registered today will be9 called in order of your number.	So if people come10 in later who are pre-registered, we're going to11 call it in the order of that number.12 We will be alternating tenant13 speakers and then owners speakers.14 The first speaker is Anita Romm.15 And the speaking requirement, not16 requirement, the speaking time will be three17 minutes and you'll be able to see different  colors18 there as we go ahead.19 MS. ANITA ROMM:	Good morning.20 My name is Anita Romm.	I'm the21 songwriter for Metropolitan Council on Housing.22 I'm a rent stabilized tenant in a23 building which as gone co-op recently.24 I'm a retired Social Studies teacher25 who has extensively studied the State and Federal7 
1	142 Constitutions and I found nothing that indicates3 anything about landlords being  automatically4 entitled to rent increases.	In fact, you have5 given landlords such enormous increases over the6 past several decades that it is about time you7 grant a rent freeze.8 When rents are increased to the9 point where people have to spend most of their10 income on rent, they will have less to spend on11 goods and services causing businesses to fail and12 many people will lose their jobs and homes  leading13 to an increase in crime and disease which will14 effect all of us.15 Families will be broken up and16 children will languish in orphanages on a diet of17 gruel.	Affordable apartments have been18 disappearing.	Real wages have been going down and19 my husband is the Medicare doughnut hole.20 Many people in the Simon Senior21 Center are so squeezed financially that their only22 nutrition is the $1.50 lunch and some are in such23 dire straights that the management allows them to24 give a bit less.	If you really care about saving25 our fair City and our civilization, we need a rent2 
1	152 freeze now .3 Laissez-faire, mon derriere.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,5 Anita.6 (Applause.)7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker8	is -- I asked Mr. Jones.	We 1 re alternating.9	MR. JAMES JONES:	Oh, you're10	alternating?11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We 1 re alternating12 owner rep.13 Mr. Siconolfi;14 Then Mr. Jones;15 Then Daniel Edmonds.16 Patrick Siconolfi.	Here he comes.17 So it will be:18 Mr. Siconolfi;19 Mr. Jones.	Hold on a second.20 Mr. James Jones;21 Daniel Edmonds; and22 Then Jeanette Doal, D-o-a-1.23 Go ahead, Mr. Siconolfi.24 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI :	Good25 morning.12 
2 I'm Pat Siconolfi, Executive3 Director of the Community Housing Improvement4 Program or CHIP.	CHIP is an association of small5 and medium owners of residential property.6 CHIP is concerned that the proposed7 guidelines do not reflect the economic reality of8 owning property in New York.9	It has been the practice of the10 Board to issue a Price Index of Operating Costs11 and then to retreat significantly from such12 numbers to set the guidelines.	This guarantees13 that the rents will not keep pace with the actual14 cost of operating buildings.15 Specifically the Board's PIOCs for16 the four years, 2003 through 2007, show an actual17 increase in costs to operating property of forty18 two and a half percent.	The guidelines compounded19 during that same period totaled 15.9 percent.20 This is a staggering mismatch.	Accordingly, the21 guideline's increase had compensated owners for22 only about one-third of the cost increases over23 the period.24 There's a practical and measurable25 impact on housing as a result.	We took a look at10 
2 the Housing and Vacancy survey numbers and we took3 an average building as defined in the housing and4 vacancy survey and found that the average cost to5 - - average income in such a building was $411,000.6	The details are in my written testimony.	And7	that the average -- so that average income is 8	$411,000 .9	The average expenses for that10 building are $422,000.	There's a shortage11 described in the Housing and Vacancy survey of12 $11,000 to run the typical rent stabilized13 building.14 So dispassionate data scientifically15 gathered, gathered by the government, that data16 determines that the average rent stabilized17 building loses money.	And this is something that18 I would invite you - and we're certainly willing19 to engage in a dialogue with you - to explore in20 terms of your guideline study.21 And for these two reasons, the22 inadequacy of the guideline compared to the PIOC23 and the objective data that shows that the average24 rent stabilized building loses money, we ask you25 to set it back to economic reality and set a10 
2 guideline that's consistent with the actual PIOC.3 Thank you .4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 Question.6	MS . ADAMS:	Yes.7	Of the groups that you're involved8 in, what is the average size of the rent9 stabilized building or the average number of units10 that they own?11 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI :	Well, our12 group owns mostly, you know, we're smaller and13 medium size owners.	And many of our members have14 one building or two buildings and they have 25 to15 40 units .16 In the belt curve, a much larger17 group has about 50 to 100 units.	And what we can18 see from the Housing and Vacancy Survey is that19 the average building has 42 units.	So - - and20 that's well within my group's representation.21 That's who we represent.22 MS. ADAMS:	Okay.	Thank you.23 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI :	Sure.24 MR. SCHLEIDER :	Mr. Chair?25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Go ahead,8 
1	192	Mr. Schleider.3	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you, Patrick,4	for your testimony.5 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Sure.6 MR . SCHLEIDER:	So you've described7 a small to medium sized rent stabilized building8 as 25 to 40 units.	And your constituency9 generally has one, maybe two or three buildings.10 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Right.11 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Do they operate12 these buildings hands-on?	Another words, do they13 take on the role of superintendent, do they take14 on the role of property manager themselves or they15 hire out these services?16 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Well, most17 of them are hands-on managers and they run these18 buildings themselves with a small family19 typically.	I mean they don't act as the super,20 but they certainly act as the manager of the21 building, yes.22 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And when you say23 they lose money, are they taking salaries for24 these positions or are these buildings just barely25 holding on?7 
 2 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	You know,3 the practice is varied.	You're in a situation4 where you're scrambling .	The - - and, again, I5 think what all we need to do is rely on the6 objective data.7 That Housing and Vacancy Survey said8 that it costs $422,000 to run the average building9 and it defines that average building.	This is10 real data, but that that average building  brings11 in less money so that the average stabilized12 building is running at a deficit.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right .	I think14 you had a figure of what, about $411,000 as the15 MR . PATRICK SICONOLFI:	$411,000 in 16	and $422,000 out.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right. So on a18 42-unit building average collections are just a19 little over $800 a month.20 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	$796 is the21 actual number out of HVS .22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So this would be23 considered to be highly affordable, for the most24 part, in New York City.25 MR . PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Right.17 
2	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you.3	MS. CRUZ:	Mr. Chairman, may I ask4	a question?5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Go ahead.6 MS. CRUZ:	When you7 A VOICE:	That's way beyond three8	minutes .9	MS . CRUZ:	When you --10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The questions11 break the three minutes.	Always did .12 Go ahead.13 MS. CRUZ:	When you indicated that14 these buildings, the average building is bringing 15	in $411,000 - - $411,000 a year - -16 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Right.17 MS. CRUZ:	- - in income, does that18 include deregulated apartments as well as rent19 stabilized apartments?20 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	This is21 this raw data is based on the stabilized22 apartments in the -- in the average building23 described in the Housing and Vacancy Survey.24 Now, it is true that in certain25 instances owners would be able to rely on16 
2 additional income if there's a destabilized	a3 deregulated apartment .4 But the thing that's important to5 realize is that for the great majority of6 buildings, particularly in the outer boroughs,7 that doesn't happen or it doesn't happen to a8 degree that you can reverse the trend that I'm9 speaking about here.10 And, in fact, your own data from11 your surveys where you talk about -- where you12 survey buildings in your surveys as opposed to the13 HVS, shows that the majority of stabilized14 buildings, particularly in the outer boroughs,15 cannot rely on that kind of - - that kind of income16 from deregulated apartments .17 And I think you know both18 anecdotally and from hard data that most of the19 deregulated buildings are in Manhattan.20 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.22 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.23 I'm sorry.	Go ahead.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 MS . HOLDER:	No, I have a2 
1	232	question. I'm sorry.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	She does .4	Adriene.5	MS. HOLDER:	So your testimony is6 that the majority of buildings are actually losing7 money and they're running at a deficit?8 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	My9 testimony is drawing on the data that's in the10 Housing and Vacancy Survey that the average rent11 stabilized building loses money.12 MS. HOLDER:	And so what happens13 to that building?14 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI :	It loses15 money .16 MS. HOLDER:	But you're saying17 part of that calculation is not including the18 deregulated units in the buildings?19 MR . PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Right.20 Because the majority of those buildings, according21 to your data, don't have deregulated apartments .22 MS . HOLDER:	And you're saying23 this is data from?24 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	The25 Housing Vacancy Survey, 2005 .10 
1	242 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We will look at3 the testimony and the staff is going to take a4 look and see whether or not we agree .5 MR. PATRICK SICONOLFI:	Okay .	Thank6 you.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .8 Mr. Jones;9 Followed by Mr. Edmonds;10	Followed by Jeanette Doal;11	Followed by Larry Wood.12 Go ahead, Mr . Jones .13 MR. JAMES JONES:	I trust, Mr .14 Chairman, that you can find Columbia University's15 main campus.	Wadley Court is four blocks east of16 Columbia University, main campus.17 Jones would like to point out to the18 Mayor's Board that our boiler 4 and 6 oil, blowed19 up one Sunday evening.	The boiler explosions20 elevated Wadley Court triangularly, diagonally,21 diagonally.	This individual's response, I don't22 work on Sundays, including his employees .	As a23 matter of fact, it was profoundly unclear what24 days this individual and his employees did work .25 Whenever there occurred the insidious, many12 
1	.,-Ir	A-ci.m ,'(l ; t'tr"tor
t..r-.25
2 frequent foul-ups, seven administrative charged3 sabotage, unquote, with the plumbing  system,4 including the sewer pipe system, north wing.5 Constant and repeated searches for6 this individual and his employees could not  locate7 either.	They were experiencing insidious sabotage8 absenteeism.	The luminary officer in the white9 hat stood in Jones' guest room.	The luminary10 officer in the white hat spoke .	Jones, if the11 sewer system fouls up again, flood six floors12 down, sabotage insidious.13 Call a plumber, do not call the14 luminary officer in the white hat as the building15 is not on fire.16 Corporation Counsel and theirs'-' ('(\.'('I\!.!..("'17 summa to Jones did not use the word landlord.18 Corporation Counsel used the word individual.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, Mr.20 Jones.21 (Applause.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The next speaker23 is Mr. Edmonds;24 Followed by Jeanette Doal;25 Followed by Larry Wood;2 
1	262	Followed by Mickey Gensler.3	MR. DANIEL EDMONDS :	Hello . My4 name's Daniel Edmonds.5 My wife and I own a six- family in6 Queens that we are - -7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Get closer to8 the mike, please.9	MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	We own a10 six-family in Queens.	We do the maintenance and11 live in the apartment building ourselves.12 Our expenses have increased greatly13 since we brought the building in 2004.14 From '04 to '05 our water bill went15 up three percent.	From  '05 to '06 our water bill16 went up another nine percent.	From '06 to '07 our17 water bill went up another 21 percent for a total18 of 33 percent since '04.19 Between '05 and '06 our electricity20 costs increased 44 percent.	Between '04 and '0721 our building insurance costs have increased ten22 percent.	Since '04, '05 we've gotten a23 significant number of Sanitation violations .24 They send out cops more often every year.	They've25 gone from none in '04 to $627 - - $625 worth of10 
2 tickets in '06.3 And the - - without being able to4 raise the rent, we will not be able to run the5 business of the building.	It's failing at this6 moment.7 Thank you.8	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair?9	MS. ADAMS:	Mr. Chair?10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes.11 MS. ADAMS:	Would you repeat the12 number of units in that building.13 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	Six.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Six.15 MS. ADAMS:	And do you own any16 other buildings?17 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	No, I do not.18 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.19 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	And we live in20 one of the units of the six so we're renting out21 five.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And what's been23 the term of the tenancy?	Have those people been24 there a long time or are they new tenants?25 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	All of the10 
2	tenants have been there longer than we  have.3	Well, no.	We have one tenant that's been there4 one year and the other tenants have been there5 five years.	They were there previous to our6 buying the building.7 MS. WRIGHT :	Do you have any8 deregulated apartments?9 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	No.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where did you11 say the building is again?12 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	It's in Queens.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Where in14 Queens?15 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	Ridgewood.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ridgewood. Okay.17 Mr. Schleider.18 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Edmonds, thank19 you for your testimony.20 So you went into this venture21 thinking that you're going to have the American22 dream by owning property?23	MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	Of course,24 yes.25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	If you can't hold24 
2	onto your building, what are you going to do?3	MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	Sell it .4	MR . SCHLEIDER:	Now, would you say5 its worth more or less now than it was when you6 bought it or about the same?7 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	Well, the City8 keeps raising our property values	our taxes9	and they do it wrong every year.	They estimate10 our income from the apartments wrong every year.11 And we have to register our rents12 every year with the Department of Housing and13 Community Rule -- Renewal.	They - - we register14 them with the City and when they figure our15 property taxes, they don't even look at their own16 data.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right.	No, I18 understand .19 So your taxes are going up and20 generally unfairly.	Your utilities expenses are21 going up.	Your cost of operating the building22 from an administration point of view has gone up.23 MR . DANIEL EDMONDS:	Yes .24 MR . SCHLEIDER:	You can't afford25 not to live in your building.10 
2 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	No, of course,3 not.	No.4	MR. SCHLEIDER:	And you're coming5	out of pocket to maintain your property.6	MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	Every month,7 yes.	And going into debt about so far we have8 borrowed about $20,000 each year to make - -9	there's been a lot of repairs on the apartment10 building also .11 We had to do lot a work on the12 furnace, on the water heaters, in each individual13 units.	The expenses far outweigh the amount14 that's coming in currently.15 And we approach this from a long16 term standpoint that here in 15, 20 years  things17 would be fine .	But with the increasing cost and18 the water bills, the property taxes,  electricity,19 gas and all that, we may not make it.20 MR. SCHLEIDER :	I understand.21 And what would you say would be a22 reasonable rate of increase for your tenants?23 MR . DANIEL EDMONDS:	Well - -24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I'm not saying25 ideal .	I said reasonable.10 
2	MR . DANIEL EDMONDS:	I don't know3 what - - I haven't sat down to make an exact4 calculation of what I would have to have to cover5 my expenses.	But certainly I would think I would6 need to increase them by at least ten percent,7 fifteen percent, something like that - -8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Okay.9 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS :	to cover10 the outlay that I'm putting out .11 (Audience participation.)12 MS . ADAMS:	Question.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes .14 MS. ADAMS:	What's an estimated15 household income in your building?16 MR. SCHLEIDER :	For the tenants?17 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	Of the18 tenants?19 MS . ADAMS :	Uh-hum.20 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	I don't know.21 MS. ADAMS:	Okay.22	MR . DANIEL EDMONDS:	I don't know.23	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead, Leslie.24 MS. WRIGHT:	Are you able to25 collect the legal rents for the apartments, for24 
2	each apartment at present?3	MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	Are we able4	to?5	MS . WRIGHT :	Do you collect the6 legal rents for each apartment at present?7 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	No .	Not every8 apartment is not getting the maximum rent9 registered with the DCHR	DHCR.10 MS. WRIGHT :	And why is that?11 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	It is very12 advantageous to have a tenant that does not13 destroy the property and is a good neighbor.	So14 if you have a tenant like that - - we've have good15 tenants.	We've had bad tenants.	We try and keep16 the good tenants .	We've had to evict, you know,17 one set of people that weren 't paying the rent.18 MS. WRIGHT:	And out the five19 units that you do have rented, how many are you20 actually able to collect the maximum legal rent21 from?22 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	We've got two23 that we're at that.24 One of them currently at this point25 is vacant so about half of the tenants are paying6 
2	the maximum registered, you know, at the3	MS. WRIGHT:	The maximum legal4 rent.5 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	Yes .6	MS. WRIGHT:	So just for the sake7 of argument, if you were granted this increase8 that you 're saying that would help you, you9 wouldn't be able to collect it anyway from what10 you saying from the tenants that you currently11 have, most of whom are good neighbors and good12 tenants; is that correct?13 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	Well, we've14 increased everybody's rent every lease.	It's just15 the amount that we do.16 We currently have a tenant that has17 a lease coming up that we are going to increase to18 the maximum rent because they're not a good19 neighbor.	They do not take care of the property.20 They break windows.	They ruin ceilings when they21 put in air conditioners.	They pile garbage in the22 hall and the other tenants complaint about it.23 And when their lease comes up during '07, '08, we24 are going increase it to the maximum amount.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So they are a7 
2	preferential now and you're going to increase it3 to --4 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	They are5	currently, yes.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	- - the maximum.7	Okay.8 MS . CRUZ:	Mr. Chairman.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Go ahead.10 MS. CRUZ:	Just a quick question .11 So to make up the shortfall and your12 inability to collect the maximum legal rents of13 some of your tenants, in essence you're14 subsidizing your tenant's housing expenses; is15 that correct?16 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	Yes,17 basically.18 MR. SCHLEIDER :	What a good19 landlord.20 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	Pardon me?21 MR . SCHLEIDER:	What a good22 landlord. That's very nice.23 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	Well, you24 know, once again, we approach this from the long25 term.	The longer a tenants stays the more10 
2 profitable the apartment is whether you 're getting3 the maximum legal rent or not because you have4 less expenses.	I mean it's common sense.5	MR. SCHLEIDER:	If they're good6	tenants.7	MR . DANIEL EDMONDS:	If they're good8	tenants, correct, yes.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Another10	question.11	MS. LEVINE:	Do you spend full12 time working on this building or do you have other13 employment?14 MR. DANIEL EDMONDS:	No.	I have a15 - - well, my wife and I - - somebody is there all16 the time generally working on some aspect of the17 building whether it's sweeping out in front to18 avoid Sanitation tickets or painting an apartment19 that's vacant or, you know, supervising the20 plumber when he's doing the boiler repairs or21 whatever.	There's generally somebody there.22 I frequently have to take on other23 employment.	You know, I do construction work24 myself and I have to have a job most of the time25 to be able to make our payments for, you know,12 
2	building insurance and various sundry things .3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank you4 very much.5 (Applause. )6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Jeanette Doal;7 Followed by Larry Wood;8 Followed by Mickey Gensler; and9	Then Richard Steiger.10 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	Good morning.11 I prepared testimony.12 I've been a tenant in my stabilized13 apartment in Manhattan since August of '97.	I14 recently signed a renewal lease for one year for15 an increase of 4.25 percent because I could not16 afford the two-year renewal at an increase of 7.2517 percent .18 Since I've been in my apartment19 there's been no rent stabilization, only20 significant increases from my initial rent of  $88021 by a DHCR Rent Reduction order, to the current22 $1,077 over the past four years.23 The DHCR Rent Reduction order24 evolved from a rent overcharge complaint, an25 action my physician/scientist boss who just10 
2 happened to be an attorney and who just happened3 to have been raised in New York City educated at4 Columbia University who knew the rent laws and5 informed me.6 And we brought the action and over7 time we succeeded .	The landlord defrauded me8 initially by omitting the fact that my apartment9 was rent stabilized.	And the prior tenant had10 paid just $500 a month, yet she demanded $1,85011 per month from me.12 The landlord rented several rent13 stabilized apartments, open market bed and14 breakfast, short-term housing units, omitting rent15 riders and charging triple, triple quadruple, the16 legal rent.17 The new landlord hoards after18 vacancy apartments, combining apartments,19 transforming previously uninhabitable apartments20 to habitable apartments yet continues to omit21 information on the legal rent to new tenants.22 A separate point.23 He is a service, according to DHCR,24 according to the State, and should impose no25 further increase in rent.2 
2 My recommendation for the Rent3 Guidelines Board is to undue the damage of the4 last four years and rather than a zero percent5 increase, apply a minus 26.75 decrease for a6 two-year renewal lease and a minus 15 percent7 decrease for a one-year renewal lease.8 (Applause.)9	MR. LANGUEDOC:	Mr. Chairman?10 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Ms. Doal. Ms.11 Doal, there's a question.12 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Hi.13 Could you please explain again.	You14 said that - - I'm trying to understand.15 When you moved into the apartment,16 there was a Rent Reduction order already in17 effect?18 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	When I moved19 into the apartment, I didn't know I was in a rent20 stabilized apartment.21 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay.22 MS . JEANETTE DOAL:	The landlord23 charged me $1,850 per month.	They thought it was24 an open market housing.25 MR . LANGUEDOC:	Okay .	When did10 
2	you find out3	MS . JEANETTE DOAL:	What I was4 saying was my boss, the person that I worked with5 on a daily basis - -6	MR. LANGUEDOC:	Right.7	MS. JEANETTE DOAL :	I work in8 medicine.	He's a physician scientist .	He also9 happens to be an attorney and we got to talking.10 He saw the apartment.	He said, look, call the11 state, find out . This looks like a rent stabilized12 apartment.13 MR. LANGUEDOC:	So when did you14 find out that it was a rent stabilized apartment,15 how long after you moved in?16 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	I found about a17 year later.	I moved in August of 1 97.	I found18 out in approximately July/August of 1   98.19 The complaint was filed in August of20 '98, the Rent Reduction order in April of '99.21 The landlord presented false evidence that there22 were apartment improvements because she was trying23 to get, you know, less of an overcharge.24 And the	well, to make a long25 story very short, the Commissioner awarded treble8 
2 damages and on overcharge - -3 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And what was the4 amount --5	MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	- - and my rent6 was reduced.	The landlord appealed, hired two law7 firms.	She appealed. The Supreme Court decided, I8 think in '02, that the overcharge and treble9 damages would stay.10 MR. LANGUEDOC:	So what was the11 amount that was eventually decided that was your12 legal rent at the time that you --13 MS . JEANETTE DOAL:	It was $880.14 However, I was unable to sort out all the15 deception and the fraud as far as the apartment16 improvements .	They were alleged as improvements17 and they were false.18 For instance, I recently had new19 windows in my apartment.	And the person who put20 the windows in told me that the windows had an21 inscription of 85 and the landlord presented - - or22 stated through her attorney, that the windows were23	95.24 So then I'm paying - - you know, I25 was paying for new windows for a number of years24 
2	when they didn't exist .3	MR. LANGUEDOC:	And how many units4	are in your building, approximately?5	MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	Seventeen units6 when I moved in.	However, in '03 the landlord7 sold her building for six million and the new8 owners -- what was your question?9	MR. LANGUEDOC:	How many units10 were in the building, 17 at the time?11 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	Pardon me. The12 new owners combined two apartments on the bottom13 floor.	And now that's deregulated for $2,500 to14 $3,000, $2,500 to $3,000 per month.	And they also15 combined two apartments on the third floor that's16 renting beyond two grand.17 MS. ADAMS:	So there's fifteen18 apartments now.19 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	So fifteen.20 MS . HOLDER:	And of the apartments21 -- I'm sorry.	Of the fifteen apartments, how  many22 are deregulated, two or?23 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	Well, there24 were 17 apartments so from the four that were25 combined into the two I mean there were - - there10 
2 are now - - you know what, I don't know the answer3 to that.	I know that there are two deregulated.4 I don't know how many others are deregulated.5	MS. HOLDER:	Right.	Okay.6 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay.7 MS. ADAMS:	How many other people8 in the building have had similar problems that9 you're aware of?	Are you aware of anybody else in10 the building?11	MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	I am aware that12 there are problems.	And I would say probably13 it could be - - it could be every tenant.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Could be.15 Can I ask a question?16 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	It could be17 every tenant.	However, who I know personally and18 who are personally going through the struggle, I19 would say maybe half a dozen.20 MS. LEVINE:	Where is the21 building?22 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	The building's23 Manhattan, Upper West Side.24 MS. LEVINE:	And did you have to25 pay your legal fees?12 
2 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	I paid my legal3 fees.4 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Question, please.5	MR. MCLAUGHLIN :	Mr. Schleider.6 MS. CRUZ:	I just have a quick7 question.8 Is it fair to say that you - - once9 you alerted the state of the claim that you had of10 overcharge, that you were able to recover  your11 overcharges that the landlord was penalized by12 having to pay treble damages and your rent was, in13 fact , reduced.	So once you14 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	No.	That's not15 fair to say that.	Because the rent was reduced to16 $880 .	The prior tenant was paying oh, about 4517 somewhere between $450 and $500.18 The landlord, when she submitted her19 documentation in which she fought my overcharge20 complaint, she made false allegations of apartment21 improvements through her attorney.	Now, I22 couldn't defend it . I mean I was more naive than I23 am at this point and I didn't successfully fight24 that.25 I had an open door to fight that in6 
2 at the Supreme Court level, but it became quite3 an expense to me.	So I am still living in an4 apartment where I am paying for apartment5 improvements that don't exist.	So that is not6 fair.	But every time I pay my rent I'm paying7 probably a third more than I should be paying.8 MS. CRUZ:	But you had the9 opportunity to prove your claim and you were10 unable to.	That is just my point, that you had11 the opportunity and that the state responded to12 your complaint and that the state, in fact,13 penalized the landlord for any wrongdoing that was14 proven .15 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	No.	What the16 state should have done - - this is fraud and there17 were false affidavits before the state.	The18 Attorney General is aware of it.	They didn 't go19 after her, but had they, there are criminal and20 civil offenses.21 The criminal offenses were not22 addressed.	The civil offenses partially were23 addressed.	The landlord - - and as you well know24 that when you file an overcharge complaint, if the25 landlord reduces the rent, then there are no2 
2 treble damages.	But instead of her reducing the3 rent and coming clean, she lied.	She didn't4 reduce the rent.5 And so the Commissioner felt that6 because of this that the overcharge and the treble7 - - she didn't - - treble damages were not8 warranted.	And that was upheld by the Supreme9 Court Judge.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Just a quick11 question for you.12 The rent that you originally13 contracted to pay for that apartment was how much?14 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	$1,850.15 MR . SCHLEIDER:	All right.16 According to -- and that was ten years ago?	You17 said August '97.18 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	Approximately.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	August '97 is almost20 ten years ago, right or a little bit more .21 Standard ratios for affordability22 would state that ten years ago you were making in23 excess of $90,000 in order to be able to afford24 that apartment.25 Right now you're paying $1,077 which2 
2 means somebody making about $46,000 would be able3 to afford that apartment.4 Does that bother you that you are5 able to afford to move out of that apartment and6 let somebody else come in who is making half of7 what you were making ten years ago?8 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	I can't afford9 to move out of the apartment.	Ido well to make10 my rent each month.11	MS. HOLDER:	Ithink that's an12 interesting question.	Iguess	Iguess what I13 think what my colleague is trying to suggest is14 that perhaps we should go to means testing.	I15 mean it would be interesting to think that maybe16 on the landlord side that we could open the books17 and for those landlords who are actually making a18 sizable profit, then perhaps what we should do is19 we should say they're not entitled to an increase.20 We can go to - -21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	As soon as tenants22 are willing to move out of apartments they can23 certainly well afford to make room for --24 (Applause.)25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	- - those tenants12 
1	472 who may not be able to afford such nice apartments3 on the Upper West Side.4 MS . HOLDER:	And, you know, and5 that's a very -- you know, it's a very interesting6 point that you bring up, Steve.7 But I appreciate your testimony8 today and I appreciate you giving us a personal9 account of exactly how you've had to live and what10 you've had to do in the past ten years.11 I think it was fortuitous that you12 were so fortunate to have a friend who was also13 your boss who was able to identify for you that14 perhaps you were actually being subjected to an15 overcharge.16 I know there are hundreds of17 thousands of people who are being subjected to an18 overcharge and just don't have a clue about that .19 They don't have the information nor do they have20 the means.21 I think it's also great that you22 were able to afford some legal counsel to assist23 you. Not everybody can do that.24 I think it's interesting when we25 talk about means testing, it's something that, you2 
2 know, you can't have it both ways.	If we want to3 talk about those kind of issues and about4 affordability in that sense and what it is  that5 people can bear as landlords -- I mean as tenants,6 then we need to talk about it on a landlord side7 too. We can't have it both ways.8 There are going to be some landlords9 or people who represent landlord groups who are10 going to be testifying before us either today or11 next week in Queens who easily know that their12 members are multimillionaires.	And we can easily13 say that they're not entitled to any type of14 adjustment and don't they feel guilty taking such15 increases on their buildings.16 (Applause.)17 MS. HOLDER:	But you're going to18 tell me that I shouldn't make that argument. So19 it's an investment that they make.	And I'm very20 glad that you're still living on the Upper West21 Side and you were able to get your rent properly22 adjusted to what is seemingly the legal rent.	But23 as you fear, it still might not be truly the legal24 rent.25 MS . JEANETTE DOAL:	The only thing2 
2 - - the only thing I'd like to say is I'd like to3 see Governor Spitzer and Attorney General Cuomo4 take a look at reviewing what landlords in this5 City have done to destroy rent controlled and rent6 stabilized housing.7 And I think - -8 (Audience participation. )9 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, we had great10 testimony.11 MS. JEANETTE DOAL:	-- many of you12 landlords would be in prison.13 (Audience participation.)14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That's nice.15 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Our next speaker16 is Larry Wood;17 Followed by Mickey Gensler; and then18 Daniel Andrejcuk.19 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Good morning.20 I guess I always start with thanking21 the members of the Rent Guidelines Board for a22 largely thankless task.23 And I really hope you do deliberate24 this year, particularly the public members,25 because I know there are different options out2 
2 there.	The proviso is another thing which would3 require some thinking outside the box and I hope4 there's a real true deliberation because I think5 we have a opportunity to, you know, do something6 besides the one-size- fits-all .7 And I guess so important I feel it's8 worth repeating, inherent in the mission in the9 core policy of the Rent Guidelines Board is10 predicated on a notion that there's a housing11 crisis and an emergency.	And the work is to12 prevent speculative, unwarranted and abnormal13 increases in rents and that conditions exist14 because there's an acute shortage of dwelling15 units that create a special hardship on persons16 and families occupying rental units.17 And just part of the little18 discussion that was just going on, it's not the19 individual rents paid by tenants or any particular20 tenant . There are tenants that could afford to21 pay for the space they're occupying.	It's the22 rate of return on the building .	That's what we23 have to be looking at and maintaining, you know,24 what is a good rate of return, what's reasonable,25 what's going to keep that landlord in business and2 
2 give him a fair return versus the hardship that so3 many people clearly experience.4 While some tenants could afford to5 pay more if it was warranted, so many more - and6 you have all the data - are paying obscene7 percentages of their income to hang on in8 neighborhoods throughout the City.	And you really9 have to struggle to strike the right balance10 there.11 Again, I want to highlight that and12 hope you can listen from the testimony that comes13 from the SRO tenants today. They're all folded in.14 I was really fascinated by the report that the15 Rent Guidelines Board was able (indicating) to do.16 It was the memo you got on June 4th.	It was the17 analysis of the hotel, SRO rooming housing18 registration data.	I hope something similar can19 be done for the apartment buildings .	Some of the20 stuff in here was very interesting I thought.21 The thing that was a little bit of22 concern to me was the total number of units.23 They have it a little under 16,000 units.	Most24 studies, HPD and others have done in terms of25 looking at CO's in which buildings are considered2 
2 rooming houses and hotels, would suggest the3 number is closer to 45,000 to 50,000 .4 So if it's only 16,000 units that5 are actually registered, we're missing over half6 the units out there . So we need to do something to7 look into that discrepancy.8 But that plays up one of our9	provisos we've had for years is that hotels are10 not registered with DHCR as required. So that11 might account for some of those missing buildings.12 Again, those other uses that the13 hotel and rooming houses are put to, the transient14 rentals, the college rentals and also to the15 special needs tenants, those are all ways that16 landlords get themselves an adequate rate of17 return and Iwould argue that SROs do not warrant18 an increase.19 My time is up?	Any questions?20 MS. ADAMS:	We do deliberate every21 year.22 VOICES:	We can't hear you. Can you23 use the mike?24 MS . ADAMS:	One of the things that25 I'm interested in, you said - - you made reference10 
2 early on to one-size-fits-all.	And that's one of3 the dilemmas that we deal with every year because4 the way the legislation is written you can't make5 one rate for small property owners and another for6 large, and we know that economies of scale and all7 of that are different for them .8 So I would welcome any9	recommendation you have as to how you can do this10 under existing legislation without the11 one-size-fits-all.12 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Well, it's curious13 in terms of SROs .	The provisos aside, the14 provisos aside, they have been subdivided by size15 and the C of O's.16 MS. ADAMS :	Ishould have been17 clear .	Iwas talking regular rental units.18 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Well, Idon't - - I19 don't - - I haven't seen anything in the20 legislation that would preclude you from dividing21 apartments, 200 units or more, buildings built a22 certain year.	Imean you did it for SROs.23 There's five different categories of SRO's:24 Rooming houses less than 30 units, Class B hotels,25 Class A hotels.10 
2 So there's nothing in the3 legislation that prevents you doing it for hotels4 and rooming houses.	I'd like to see where there's5 a reference in the law that says you cannot do  it6 for the apartment buildings.7 I think further, the issues of the8 provisos, I think there's going to be dueling9 memos out there.	I know there's a Corp. Counsel10 memo that suggests that you don't have the11 authority to do this.	I've seen other analysis12 and suggestions.	You do have the authority to do13 that.	And I think you're going to have to14 part of the deliberation is what authority do you15 or don't you have in this regard.16 And I would think if there's a17 dispute and it needs to be litigated, let it be18 litigated.	There's been many times where the RGB19 has passed orders in the past that have been20 challenged by tenants or challenged by landlords21 and the Court has upheld it one way or the  other.22 So if there's - - if it's ambiguous,23 if you're not sure whether it's the code24 enforcement proviso, if there's rent impairing25 violations, if it's the proviso around deregulated2 
2 units and litigate it if necessary and get the3 Courts to weigh in if that's what you have to do.4 But I think it's a tool that you5 really should explore because it really would6 allow you to grant an increase where it's7 warranted.	There are certainly landlords out8 there that need an increase because of their9 expenses.	But there are plenty of landlords,10 large landlords who are making a great rate of11 return if they're making extreme profits. And you12 have an opportunity to subdivide that universe13 somewhat by the size of the building, perhaps by14 the borough .15 Certainly the average rents in16 Manhattan are a lot higher than other parts of the17 City.	I think more analysis needs to be done so18 you can really have a true informed debate of how19 many units are there, 50 percent or more20 deregulated, 20 percent or more deregulated .21 That data is available from DHCR.22 The research done by the Rent Guidelines Board23 with the data they got from DHCR for the hotels,24 was very helpful because it gives us a sense how25 many buildings.2 
2 It says here of the buildings  that3 have at least one deregulated unit the average  is4 over 40 percent.	My universe of these SROs I5 deal with are primarily Clinton and the Upper  West6 Side .	So I was kind of shocked to see that there7 are SROs that are 100 percent rent regulated8 according to this data.9	I don't know where they exist . I10 don't know if the Law Project can point out any11 current buildings that are totally rent  regulated12 and are not rented out to any other purposes. But13 this data seems to indicate that there are some .14 I'm just surprised . I'm not familiar --15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well , would that16 argue for a guidelines increase for those units17 that are 100 percent in the business?18 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Well, we talked19 about that.	Where is the good landlord, the good20 SRO landlord.	To the degree that this data21 suggests they exist, they should probably get an22 increase.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I don't know if24 they're good, but they seem to exist.25 MR. LARRY WOOD:	They seem to10 
2 exist.	Whether or not they're good, you're3 right, that's a debatable point .	But if they're4 in the business and they're just renting to rent5 regulated tenants and they're not getting  their6 rental income from these other transient rentals7 and the like, they probably are warranted an8 increase in some instances.9	MS. HOLDER:	Is there any way,10 Chair, that we cant find out where those 10011 percent buildings are?12 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Well, there's a13 breakdown, you know, the charts.	I'm just amazed.14 By neighborhood, by zip code, the breakdown - -15 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	It's in the memo.16 MR . LARRY WOOD:	- - between the17 number of units --18 MS . HOLDER:	The address?19 MR . MCLAUGHLIN:	Oh, you want the20 addresses from buildings?21 MS. HOLDER:	Yes, of 100 percent .22 Is there any way we can - -23 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	I mean we could24 give you - - we could give you25 MS . HOLDER:	Is that something10 
2	that the Department of Finance would have?3	MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	Well, we have the4 addresses, but we could give you the breakdown of5 where they are in the City, yes.	But to give the6 addresses, those are registered with the DHCR.7 I'm not sure if we can give out individual8 addresses or not.	I'd have to check that, but we9 could certainly say how many are say in this10 community district or something along those lines.11	MR. LARRY WOOD:	I think it would12 be critical if you could do such analysis with the13 apartment data that you can get from DHCR.	A lot14 of the stuff you get back from DHCR was currently15 not programmed.	They needed some software to sort16 out, some of the questions  you asked.	But if the17 data, if provided to the RGB over the next year,18 you can do such analysis and find out is all the19 regulation just on the Upper West Side, does it20 exist throughout the City in different pockets.21 We need to get a handle on it so we22 know if you're going to do provisos, who's it23 going to effect, is it two percent of the24 buildings, is it 50 percent of the buildings.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, we do have12 
2 that by borough, the numbers are done and by --3 MR. MCLAUGHLIN:	We did a memo4 last year that did all that.	We can re-circulate5 that to the Board.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And you know,7 as you might expect with the $2,000 it's - - the8 units it's predominately Manhattan, predominately9	core Manhattan, et cetera, et cetera, because the10 market in many parts of the City don't reach11 $2,000 for an apartment.12 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Not yet, but it13 seems to be changing.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Not yet.	I agree15 I mean, it keeps changing.16 MS. CRUZ:	Question?17 (Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank19 you.20 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Thank you .21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.	Sorry.22 MS. CRUZ:	If I understand you23 correctly, you want --24 A VOICE:	Speak into the mike,25 please.10 
2 MS . CRUZ:	If I understand you3 correctly --4 A VOICE:	Speak into the mike.5 MS. MCLAUGHLIN:	She is. Give her a6 chance.7 MS. CRUZ:	- - you would like the8 Board to look at the income levels of different9 buildings .10 What is your position on us taking a11 look at the income levels of different tenants12 around the City?13 MR. LARRY WOOD :	Sure.14 If you're going to open the books15 for landlords and you want to means test the16 increase, I think it's got to go both ways.17 Certainly there's a means test of tenants when it18 comes to high rent deregulation.19 If the unit approaches $2,000, then20 a landlord can ask you are making X or whatever.21 I think it's $175,000 or more. So there is a means22 testing in effect around deregulation.23 I don't know if we have a problem24 with it.	I mean me and my wife we're in an25 apartment on the Upper West Side.	We never come2 
2 close to six figures.	You know, if my rent ever3 gets to $2,000, I'm not worried about disclosing4 my income.	It's not an issue for me. I'm a5 organizer.	My wife's a message therapist. We're6 not making big bucks to live on the Upper West7 Side, but it's my home for 26 years or actually8 getting near 30 years.	I moved in in '78.9	And, you know, two-thirds of my10 building is deregulated now.	There's only four11 tenants -- four units that are twelve which are12 still regulated.	Since '97, eight units have been13 deregulated.	I'm paying $900.	My same14 apartment's renting out for $4,000 currently15 which - -16 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you for your17 answer.18 MR . LARRY WOOD:	- - exceeds my19 annual income for sure.20 MS . HOLDER:	Getting back to the21 SROs and the rooming houses, can you talk about22 some of the buildings that you actually did work23 with and the conditions of those buildings and how24 it is that the tenants are living and what25 actually, you know, you see that's going on.10 
2 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Sure.3 Well, you'll be hearing from some of4 the tenants and they can tell you personal stories5 and the like.6 Many of the buildings have actually7 been upgraded because of the tourist trade and the8 rentals.	So on the Upper West Side many hotels in9 the 70's, I think of the Bellclaire, what used to10 be called the Ben Franklin, which is now on the11 avenue.12 A lot of these buildings are quite13 luxurious from the outside and tourists come and14 pay big dollars to live in them.15 Typically the rent regulated16 tenant's room is un- renovated and could be a17 little more run down.	Rooming housings run the18 gambit.	There are a lot of rooming houses at19 Chelsea and Harlem.20 In those instances, there's a lot of21 displacement pressure.	The certificates of22 non-harassment applications are sky high. A lot of23 those buildings are being purchased and converted24 sometimes back to single or two-family residences25 which they may have been built as a single-family2 
2 residence and then converted into the rooming3 house in the 20's and 30's.	So it runs the4 gambit.5	I'm not -- I'm less familiar with6 the SROs outside of Manhattan. But not as many  of7 the bad, dingy, horrible places that they were8 once were but it does run the gambit. You still9	have some of the old school buildings that exist10 or buildings are being used for primarily homeless11 families or Division of Aid Services placements.12 They can be a little on the edge.13 MS. HOLDER:	And you had said that14 looking at the numbers that what was listed was15 the 17,000 units, but you think it's more like 16	45,000 to 50,000.17 What would you just think that this18 discrepancy is based upon?19 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Two things:	That20 the buildings are not being registered as required21 would be one issue.22 There could be a misclas sification23 for the rooming houses.	They might not be listed24 as an SRO necessarily where the landlord's filling25 out the form.17 
2 I just know the number seems low .3 It's a little under 16,000 units in total when4 they say rooming houses, hotels.	And I know the5 figure that HPD puts out is closer to 45,000 so it6 looks like we're missing over half to two-thirds7 of the stock potentially.8 I don't know in terms of the SROs.9 There's been many SROs that have been acquired by10 nonprofits and that for me is a good preservation11 tool because it keeps them affordable to folks.12 Like the Times Square is now the13 Common Ground.	The Martinique, the Prince George,14 the Holland.	These are all hotels that worked in15 the past and have been acquired by nonprofits.16 So I don't know if they're part of17 the total.	I think there's something around18 20,000 units of SRO housing which is now run by19 nonprofits supporting housing and they're great20 programs and they'd be helpful in preserving the21 stock unlike anything else we've tried .22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, Mr.23 Wood.24 MR. LARRY WOOD:	Thank you.25 MS . HOLDER:	Thank you.2 
1	652	(Applause.)3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mickey Gensler;4 After that Mr. Steiger; and5	Then Mr. Daniel Andrejcuk.6	MR. MICKEY GENSLER:	When we had a7 cold winter, the landlords cried they need money8 for the extra oil for their boilers.	Now that we9 have had a very mild winter, tenants should get a10 rebate taken off their compounded  MBR.11 The Mayor and the Rent Guideline12 Board should take full responsibility for the13 renters who could not afford to buy who bought and14 finally had to move away. They were frightened out15 of their wits by the exorbitant rent increases and16 fear being evicted.17 Mayor Bloomberg and the Rent18 Guidelines Board legacy will be that they drove19 the poor and middle class workforce out of the20 City and decimated senior citizens who depend on21 Social Security and their rent increase.22 If they have their way, the only23 people who will be able to live here will be the24 Wall Street group, sports and entertainment25 people, elected officials, professionals, the real7 
2 estate industry and the Rent Guideline  Board .3 (Audience participation.)4 MR . MICKEY GENSLER:	The New York5 City Rent Guidelines Board has never failed to6 give landlords an increase .	Its real name is the7 Rent Increase Board.8 Thank you.9 (Audience participation.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Richard Steiger.11	MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	Good morning.12 My name is Richard Steiger.13 Decisions made by the Rent14 Guidelines Board have tremendous ramifications15 and not just for rent stabilized and  controlled16 tenants, but for the vitality and continued17 viability of New York City itself.18 In February 2007, family19 homelessness in New York City reached modern20 record day levels, 9,287 homeless families,21 according to the Coalition for the Homeless.22 Last year the total number of homeless New Yorkers23 in shelters increased by 11.1 percent.	Sharply24 escalating rents are a major contributing factor25 to this surge in homelessness.12 
2	Two out of every five New York City3	households earn $32,000 or less - two out of five.4 In that group are:	Police Officers, Fire5 Fighters, home health aids, nursing aids, child6 care workers, teachers, nurses .	All of these7 people and countless others not mentioned, are8 vital to the lifeblood of New York City.9 The number of apartments affordable10 to households earning about $32,000 a year or 8011 percent of the median household income in the City12 dropped by 205,000 units between 2002 and 2005,13 according to a report by New York University .14 I was recently thinking about a15 young Police Officer in the Academy  earning16 $25,100 a year trying to find an affordable17 apartment. Indeed, the Police Department cannot18 meet its recruitment goals.19 If potential Police Officers and20 Firefighters cannot afford to live in New York21 City, they will leave for more affordable22 locations and we all will be poorer and less23 secure for it.24 (Applause.)25 MR. RICHARD STEIGER :	The decisions4 
2 made by the RGB have dire consequences.	We New3 Yorkers must do everything in our power to keep4 New York City vital, safe, secure and affordable.5 Or uniform services were there for us in our time6 of greatest need and I hope the RGB will be  there7 for them and millions of other moderate income  and8 poor New Yorkers.9 This year, please, please strike a10 blow for affordability and vote a zero increase11 for one and two-year leases.12 Thank you.13 (Applause.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 MS. HOLDER :	I have a question.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.17 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you for your18 testimony.	Thanks for coming in this morning.19 MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	You're20 welcome.21 MS. HOLDER:	Do you live in New York22 City?23 MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	Yes. I am a24 rent stabilized tenant in Stuyvesant Town.25 MS . HOLDER:	Okay.	And how long2 
2	have you been there?3	MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	I've been4	there for 19 years .5	MS. HOLDER:	All right.	Thank6 you.	I appreciate your time .7 MR. RICHARD STEIGER:	Thank you.8	(Applause.)9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 Mr. Andrejcuk;11 Then Trina Semorile; and12 Then Naomi Avigdor.13 Mr . Andrejcuk.14 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK :	So that will15 mean I will use my helper . And my eye is good.16 Just only some lights I have to use them.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.18 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	My name is19 Daniel Andrejcuk.20 I will quote some statement from21 report that we receiving from Rent Stabilization22 Association.	And I think I will not be smarter to23 add more things that's already written by Mr. Joel24 Slassberg .25 Just like him, I've very surprised9 
2 that why Rent Guidelines Board made decision to3 increase rent between two and four only.	I4 believe this is a big and tragic mistake.5	Everywhere going increases.	In the6 place where we working we asked for increase.7 Everywhere is increase.	And people sitting, they8 screaming.	I mean tenants, they see rent free and9 they expect that landlord will buy them lunch and10 give them ticket to go to movie.11 The problem, homeless - - I used to12 work for a few years as a SRO in outreach program13 in Brooklyn, in Manhattan and in Greenpoint.	And14 I was one of the people that helped to create15 outreach program for alcoholic, drug abuse.16 And 95 percent of homeless is people17 by alcoholism and drugs.	They stop working, they18 stop paying rent.	Who will keep them in the19 apartment.	They were destroying apartment.	They20 were urinate and doing much more on the floor.21 They were living like animals, many of them.22 They have been evicted and then23 people cry, oh, homeless.	Ninety-five percent of24 this homeless, that they choice.	From this people25 I'm proud that we get the three persons back to6 
2 the work.	They became normal people.	They allow3 to be shower, dress and we teach them to get4 skillful to work.	And now we encourage them to5 teach the other homeless to leave this homeless6 life and became normal people.7 But let's go to other business of8 rent increase .9 I see now cost of living it's10 raising constantly.	I give you one simple thing11 what landlord facing.	You go to Home Depot.	I12 was shocked. I went to the Home Depot to buy a13 small pipe, five feet long, half- inch tubing14 copper .	It cost $12 for five feet.	What can you15 do if you have 30 or 50 or 100 feet?16 Everything goes up .	Oil, I just17 get quote for oil company which delivers.	It's18 actually they charge for oil number 2, $2.87 and19 number 4 oil, $1.91.	And we see that rent is -- I20 mean, sorry.	The oil price is increasing.	That's21 enough to go near the gas station we see how much22 cost.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to wrap24 up.25 MR . DANIEL ANDREJCUK :	We go2 
2 everywhere to buy milk.	We pay more money.	So3 why you penalize landlords not getting increase.4 I believe that this year rent should be at least5 for fix and a half percent for one-year renewal6 and nine point half for two-years lease  renewal.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	And9 additional to that I'm asking - -10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to wrap11 up, Mr. Andrejcuk.12 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	Excuse me,13 but the people were talking much more.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No, no.	Only in15 response to questions.16 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I have a question.17 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	And I18 believe also we should ask for supplement increase19 for all rent below $800.	Should be on one-year20rent increase$35 and for two-year increase $50.21CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.22Did you have a question, Mr.23Schleider?24MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.25Mr . Andrejcuk, thank you for your
2	testimony.3	The costs are going up.	There's no4 real debate about that.	You were kind enough to5 give us your rate of increase . And you did touch6 on I guess a longevity type of increase or7 extremely low rent increase.8 What do you think about the future9 of rent stabilized buildings?	Do you think that10 it's viable?	Do you think that it's a good thing11 socially?	Do you think that allowing tenants an12 unfettered right to lease renewal has done a good13 amount to stabilize the City and really set it14 apart but is there a cost for that?	Can you talk15 to those?16 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	I think it's17 a - - for the some extent is good that there is18 sort of control because some landlord they little19 bit, I would say more than greedy.	And but in20 general landlords they have common sense.	We need21 tenants and tenant need us.22 But if it's low rent, how can you23 maintain building?	It's impossible to maintain.24 Wintertime, I'm still paying oil for wintertime.25 I was given credit.	They just stop delivery.	I4 
2 had no money to buy for oil. And I try to do3 everything when I use my private savings to give4 -- it pay for the oil.5 Now I'm recouping slowly to pay the6 oil. But coming next winter, problem. The biggest7 problem in the building, in most building it's8 vandalism of the people. I don't understand why.9 Let's say in my building I have about 80 percent10 they own kind all programs.	And this people11 sitting home they not working.	They distraction.12 They're destroying apartments.13 And Itold them many times why don't14 you go to school to learn English . Why don 't you15 go to learn some skills. I was working if I need16 18, 20 hours a day, seven days a week and I'm17 still working always seven days a week. And I say18 why don 't you do?	Oh, you	and they laughing.19 And they don't do anything to20 elevate themselves on a higher stage to make more21 money.	In New York is possibility to work two22 jobs and work seven days a week.	If you need23 there is future.	You can save money. They could24 -- I'm telling them you could buy co-op. You could25 buy condo.2 
2 And I'm proud that few of them they3 did and they telling me Mr. Daniel, thanks to you4 we became millionaire because we were listening to5 you.	We brought property.	So that's the way to6 go to invest.7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.	Thank you.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thanks.9	MS. WRIGHT:	I have a question.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Ms . Wright.11 MS. WRIGHT:	Thanks for your12 testimony.13 Would you repeat how many units you14 own, please.15 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	Excuse me?16 MS. WRIGHT:	How many units are in17 your building, how many apartments?18 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	Twenty-nine.19 MS. WRIGHT :	And of those 29, are20 they all rent regulated?21 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	Yes.22 MS. WRIGHT:	And out of those 29,23 how many apartments do you collect the maximum24 legal rent?25 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	Everything10 
2 is - - I collect whatever is - - whatever I can3 collect.	Nothing -- I can't collect more than  I4 can.5	MS. WRIGHT:	Do you collect the6 maximum legal rent for each apartment or do you7 get preferential rent?8	MR . DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	I have to9 constantly take them to Court for payment.	Right10 now I have seven people in Court.	Cost a lot of11 money because they simply not paying rent for no12 reason.13 MS. WRIGHT :	I'm not asking14 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	They have15 money to spend16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No. But under the17 law, sir, under the law, there's a maximum legal18 rent and you can ask people to pay a  preferential19 rent because the market is below the maximum legal20 rent .21 Are you charging everybody the22 maximum legal rent?23 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	Maximum24 rent.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay .9 
2	MS. WRIGHT:	Thank you.3	MS. ADAMS :	How long have you4	owned the building?5	MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	Excuse me?6	MS. ADAMS:	How long have you owned7	the building?8	MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK :	It's year9	and a half.10	MS . ADAMS:	A year and a half?11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And where is the12 building ?13 MR . DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	It's14 Manhattan.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Manhattan .16 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	In17 Washington Heights.18 MS. ADAMS:	Do you own other19 buildings - -20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Washington21 Heights, okay.22 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	Difficult23 neighborhood, tough neighborhood.	But I did24 mistake.	What can I do .25 MS. ADAMS :	Did you own other12 
2 buildings with rent stabilized apartments prior to3 the year and a half with this one?4	MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK :	Yes, I did.5 And if I didn't own, I used to work for big6 companies so I learn as being manager for super7 and then manager and so I know this industry.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank9	you.10 MR. DANIEL ANDREJCUK:	Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Trina Semorile;12 Followed by Naomi Avigdor;13 Followed by Faith Steinberg.14 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	My name is15 Trina Semorile.	I'm a resident of Hell's Kitchen16 and have been since 1991.17 As I'm among the first testifying, I18 want to remind this Board of their obligation to19 actually investigate the claims being made by20 landlords when they assert insufficient profit21 and/or actual loss, to demand excessive rent22 increases and attempt legitimize lack of repair of23 maintenance of buildings.24 At a minimum, this requires asking25 anyone making this claim whether they have applied10 
2 for a hardship increase and open their accounts3 for review.4 So far this morning no one has done5 that.6 Landlords are claiming increased7 fuel costs.	This also requires inquiry and8 evaluation.	Although heat is required in New York9 from October through May 31st, landlords, as many10 here will testify, ignore this obligation ensuring11 that actual fuel expenditures remain either steady12 or lower .13 This was the hottest year on record14 since weather records have been kept and any claim15 of cost increase is mitigated by the lack of16 necessity for heat until late in the season and17 then a early warming in the spring.18 Further, there is no action by19 landlords to properly control cost through20 maintenance and adjustments leaving tenants either21 freezing or if the boiler is going full blast,22 opening the windows because the apartments are23 overheated.24 The most recent claim of increased25 water fraud costs arriving fortuitously, just as2 
1	802 rent evaluation time occurs, is another area in3 which landlords and their employees refuse to4 conserve while blaming tenants.5 I have clocked the super of my6 building running an open hose from 30 minutes to7 an hour and a half on both the sidewalk and to8 wash his personal vehicle .	Complaints are9 ignored.10 Landlords have a duty to shoulder11 some of the cost of maintenance, not nearly pass12 these on including taxes to tenants while they13 reap windfall profits .	The real estate industry14 in New York City appears to be the only one which15 demands a right to ever increasing profits, but16 never losses as part of fluctuating economics .17 This year's most outrageous landlord18 effort, however, is the attempt to demand a19 longevity increase by claiming loss through lesser20 profits .	This represents unbridled greed and is21 most naked, not to mention the willingness to run22 down the conditions of living through creating23 tenancy as presumed temporary with financial24 punishment for outstaying landlord welcome.	In25 fact, landlords benefit from long term tenants2 
2 through increased stability both of individual3 buildings and community .4 This represents pursuit of short5 term profit at the expense of everything and6 everyone else.	Stable residents are the7 foundation and framework of neighborhoods in the8 City.	And since profiteering is the sole concern9 of landlords, I remind all that this is also a10 direct impact on long term value.11 I just have a couple more things12 today, but I'll shorten it .13 The recommended increases are not14 only unreasonable but also add undo hardship for15 the disabled.	The disabled remain third class16 citizens without parity with SCRIE, and receive a17 far lower ceiling than is granted to the elderly18 retired who are allowed a maximum of $26,000.19 We are allowed only $17,580 or less,20 a difference of $8,420 and this is impossible21 because most of us have much lower incomes than22 those who are retired because they worked longer23 before they were retiring and having a set income .24 I'm very concerned about the problem25 of Michael Bloomberg's plan New York City which in2 
2 my opinion represents a real estate industry3 supported land grab best described as Robert Moses4 on steroids.	Its seeks mass license to wipe out5 entire neighborhoods without resident recourse and6 nowhere else to go.7 As Robert Karro, Pulitzer Prize8 winning biographer of Moses has said, any9 evaluation of power must look at and consider the10 consequences of its use and abuse on the11 powerless.12 New York continues to have the13 highest rate of homelessness since the Great14 Depression. And those of us who still have homes15 face hunger because we're paying the landlord's16 rent in lieu of eating and that includes childhood17 hunger.18 Surprise me.	Follow the law and19 spirit indeed and act to stop rent increases which20 are unwarranted and unneeded.	Landlords do not21 have a shriven right to unbridled greed and22 soaring profits disconnected from actual costs and23 complete lack of --24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Question?2 
1	832 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.3 (Applause .)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Languedoc .5 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Could you just tell6	us, are you a rent stabilized tenant7 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	Yes, I am.8 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And how many units9	are in the building where you10 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	There are 2211 units in my building, although the building is12 registered as having 24 units .13 MR. LANGUEDOC:	But there are14 actually 22 .15 And16 MS . TRINA SEMORILE:	There 1 s17 actually 22 .	And I would like to say also, I18 skipped this part in the maintenance issue,  that19 I1 ve been asking for the street door lock to be20 repaired since March.21 One of my upstairs neighbors has22 been asking for six months - -23 MR. LANGUEDOC:	I'm sorry . You24 asked for what to repaired?25 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	The lock on10 
1	842	the front door .3	MR. LANGUEDOC:	Oh, going in the4	building?5	MS. TRINA SEMORILE :	We have	a6	street door and a lobby door.7	MR. LANGUEDOC:	The street door8	lock.9	MS . TRINA SEMORILE:	The street door10 does not lock properly.	I've been asking since11 March for repair. I sent a letter every month with12 my rent.13 One of my upstairs neighbors --14 MR. LANGUEDOC:	What's wrong with15 it?16 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	It doesn't17 lock .18 MR . LANGUEDOC:	So anyone can just19 come in?20 MS . TRINA SEMORILE :	Anyone can21 just come in. And for the last week and a half22 the lobby door wasn't locking, but they  fixed23 that .24 MR. LANGUEDOC:	How long did you25 say it's been broken?10 
2 MS . TRINA SEMORILE:	Since March.3 My upstairs neighbor has been asking for six4 months to have the leak in his apartment repaired,5 which is bringing down the ceiling in his6	downstairs neighbor's apartment and he has, to7	date, been ignored.8	MR. LANGUEDOC:	No.	I just wanted9 to ask because you started off talking in general10 about problems with heat or inadequate heat or too11 much heat, that people - - what about what's been12 your own experience.13 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	My own14 experience is that the landlord turns the heat on15 either in late October or early November.16 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Right .17 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	I looked18 quickly for the date of the last -- last year's19 heat turn-on but didn't find it because I was in a20 rush to get here.21 But the year before I think he22 turned it on October 20th and I think it went in23 early November of 2006 and it was turned off in24 some time in late April.25 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And was - -9 
2 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	And when the3 heat is on, it is on.	I have to open the windows4 which means that I have a freezing draft running5 on the floor and my head is sweating because they6 will not maintain the boiler.7 The super of my building has8 illegally, for years, been living in Brooklyn. I9 live in Hell's Kitchen.	And as of about five10 months ago he's apparently subletting his11 apartment.	Not one family member is even still12 living there which was the case for some years.13 And the landlord also refused to act on that . And14 the super had somebody illegally living in a15 storeroom for over a year doing his work for him,16 which the landlord also ignored until relatively17 recently.18 MR. LANGUEDOC:	So you attribute19 the excessive heat to problems with the boiler; is20 that what you 're saying?21 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	Well, no.22 There's nobody there to adjust the boiler. The23 super doesn't live in the building. It doesn't24 effect him.	What does he care?25 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay.2 
2 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	And then the3 landlords - - and this is not just my landlord,  who4 I would point out owns buildings all over New York5 City.	That would be Nesor Associates . I always6 love to mention by name.7 They do not8	MS. ADAMS:	What was the name9	again?10 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	It 's not that11 they don't necessarily maintain12 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Say the name again.13 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	- - the boilers,14 it's that they don't monitor them.	And I15 understand that old boilers need to be babied. But16 that's why we have a super. If the super's never17 there, the problem is not resolved.18 MS. ADAMS:	Would you repeat the19 name of the landlord.20 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	Nesor, 11 N 11   as21 in Nancy, E, 11 SII      as in Sam, o-r.22 MS. HOLDER:	So of the 22 units in23 the building, do you know if they're all rent24 regulated?25 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	No .	Some of10 
2 them have gone to market rate.	I don't know what3 the actual rents are of those market rate tenants4 because the tenants haven't discussed the  rent5 since we almost went on a rent strike about ten6 years ago to get the prostitution and drug7 problems out of the building.8	MS . HOLDER:	And how long have you9	been in your building?10 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	I've been11 there since 1991.	I moved into my neighborhood12 when it was junkies.	I went through the13 prostitution, drugs and crack epidemics .	I14 worked, along with my neighbors in my building and15 my neighbors in my community, to help address some16 of those problems and our thanks is that we're17 being shoved into the street while apartments are18 being rented for $2,500, $3,000, $3,500 that  are19 slum tenement apartments.20 Landlords are throwing up drywall21 and calling them one bedrooms.	Every time I call22 the Buildings Department because the building next23 door does illegal construction, they don't bother24 to come out for three, four, five weeks. And then25 they write a report saying there was no evidence10 
2 that any work was being done.	Hello.3 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Is your landlord4 trying to displace any of the residents in the5 building?6	MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	The landlord7 tries to displace tenants by aversion to8 addressing any problems.9	MR. LANGUEDOC:	Well, that I10 understand.11 MS . TRINA SEMORILE:	I personally12 get subjected to constant harassment and it's been13 going on for years.	As you're relatively new, but14 older Rent Guidelines Board members have heard me15 testify every year.16 It took my nine years and it took a17 Supreme Court case, which I had to argue pro se18 because I'm poor, to get him to do disability19 accommodations when my apartment burned down and20 he had to rebuild the apartment.21 He could have done on it on the22 insurance money that covered the rebuilding, but23 he wanted to punish me.	So he refused to do it24 and then claimed financial hardship.	It took me25 nine years. No tenant and certainly no disabled10 
2 tenant should have to spend nine years being3 subjected to abuse and harassment and difficulties4 that are physically painful for lack of5 accommodation because the landlords refuse to do6 what they're required to do and then they turn7 around to get rent increases.8 My landlord has gotten rent9 increases every year.	And just like a former10 tenant testified, I couldn't afford a two-year11 rent lease this year which means that over the12 long term my rent will be higher than it otherwise13 would be.14 And I'm still just barely hanging15 on. I'm now paying almost 50 percent of my rent16 and it will be over 50 percent by the next lease.17 MS. HOLDER:	Your income- to- rent.18 MS . TRINA SEMORILE:	Pardon me?19 MR. LANGUEDOC:	You're paying20 about 50 percent of your income.21 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	Yes.	Just a22 percent and a half or so below the 50 percent and23 I'll kick over it .24 And HUD guidelines says that no one25 should be paying more than 30 percent in their2 
2 rent and most New Yorkers are paying more than3 that.4 I would also like to say in regard5 to some of the earlier testimony that this tap6 dance of talking about means testing is the worst7 kind of economics, Neo-con manipulation of8 statistics - -9 (Audience participation. )10 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	-- that I have11 ever had the sorry experience to hear suggested.12 Its purpose is to hide from people who are13 killing, literally killing other people and14 putting them in the street homeless, to not have15 to feel that situation or see the blood on their16 hands .17 It is an outrage.	How dare any of18 you suggest that statistical means testing is the19 basis on which anybody should or deserve to have a20 place to live and one that is decent.	How dare21 any of you suggest that the neighborhood we live22 in is too good for us.23 I have lived in neighborhoods all24 over New York City that were slums when I moved in25 and got pushed out of.	Everyone has the right to2 
2 a decent place to live. All of us .3 (Audience participation.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 Any additional questions?6 (No response.)7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8	Naomi Avigdor.9	MS. HOLDER:	I'm sorry.	I had - -10 I'm sorry. I had one more question.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. One more12 question.13 MS. HOLDER :	I'm sorry.14 Thank you so much for coming .15 You had described the conditions16 with the lock and you also described your neighbor17 who has the leak.18 Is there any other description of19 the building or your particular unit that you can20 offer to the Board?21 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	Oh, sure.22 Let's talk about Sanitation, my23 personal favorite.24 My apartment is next to the garbage25 area. It's chronically filthy.	I can't get the10 
2 landlord to hose out the garbage cans. I can't get3 him to sanitize them or to actually anymore clean4 the sidewalks - although I have repeatedly5 requested that the landlord use a bucket and a6 scrub brush to clean the sidewalk and then rinse7 it to conserve water.8 When it happens at all, they stand9 there holding a hose.	We have a sewer grate right10 in front of the building so whoever happens to be11 cleaning, shoves the garbage down the sewer grate,12 which I've also complained about because there13 are, as you know, no filters on the sewers and it14 goes right into the ocean.15 Recycling continues to be illegally16 dumped despite years of complaining. The super, if17 he happens to be around and Sanitation tickets the18 buildings, throws screaming tantrums accusing me19 of having called, whether I did or not. So garbage20 is a constant problem.21 We have a very small garbage area.22 The number of people, I must say, in the building23 has doubled or slightly more than doubled since  I24 moved in because nobody can afford to live there25 as a single person.2 
2 And if I am shoved out of that3 apartment by every increasing rents, which I will4 be relatively soon if DRIE is not increased or5 something is not done to control the rents, I am6 going to be living in a cardboard box because7 there is no place for me to go.8 And quite frankly, I'll be happy to9 set my cardboard box up in front of the Rent10 Guidelines Board because you will have contributed11 quite extensively to that having happened.12 And I want to remind everyone here13 that becoming homeless is one of the most14 traumatic circumstances that can happen to anyone.15 And I know because I was made homeless when my16 apartment burned down.	And I had to sleep on17 floors and friend's apartments when it was being18 rebuilt and the landlord was dawdling on doing it.19 And it's unconscionable that anyone20 should be put through repeated homelessness.	And21 this is particularly at issue with the -- with the22 Bloomberg Administration's system of ever23 "decreasing" rents for putting people in - -24 homeless people in apartments than "decreasing"25 their rent until they can't afford it anymore and2 
2 then they're back into being homeless again.3 And I also want to remind everyone4 here that I don't appreciate the pleas for the5 desperate situation of Firefighters and Police6 Officers who are some of the best paid City7 employees in New York.	What about librarians?8 What about school teachers, you know, the women of9 this City?	The majority of Police Officers are10 99 percent men and 95 percent white .	I don't know11 what the ratio is in the Fire Department, but  it's12 also pretty high male and white.13 What about women who are the primary14 renters in New York City because we can't afford15 to buy homes or apartments.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 (Applause.)18 MS. HOLDER :	Thank you.19 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	Thank you for20 the extra time .21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Naomi Avigdor;22 Followed by Faith Steinberg.23 Hold on one second.24 Followed by James Anderson;25 Followed by Robert Sherwood.2 
1	962	Go ahead.3	MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Hi.4 I own one building on the Upper West5 Side on 85th6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Get closer to the7 mike.8 MS . NAOMI AVIGDOR:	I'm sorry.9 I own one building on the Upper West10 Side on 85th Street, 85th Street, and it's an SRO .11 And I have 16 units, 13 of them are12 regulated.	Half of my	most of my tenants pay13 $500 and $400 for rent per month.14 Now, if you think this is adequate,15 you're wrong. It's way too low.	If you give me a16 20 percent rent increase, it will only be $100 a17 month.18 I lose money on this building19 everyday.	I take the garbage out myself.	I clean20 the hallway by myself.21 My property tax went up and I cannot22 afford to pay it.	I went to the Tax Commissioner23 to get a discount on my taxes , on my property tax24 and they wanted proof that my rents are so low25 because it's unbelievable the rents in Manhattan4 
1	972 are $400 and $500 a month.3 If somebody cannot afford -- if4 somebody cannot afford to pay the rent on their5 apartment and they are poor, or let me say it6 differently.	If somebody does not have enough7 money for food, then you would not expect the8 supermarket to give them food for half price. You9 would give them some assistance so they can go to10 the supermarket and pay full price.11 The same thing should happen with12 the rents. If somebody cannot afford reasonable13 rent, then they should be assisted and not expect14 me personally to assist them in their financial15 situation.16 So even if you double the rent to17 whatever HUD   says, HUD   has a table that says what18 is a reasonable rent for certain size apartments,19 certain size apartment, even if you raise the rent20 to that level, if somebody cannot pay that, you21 can assist them, but you cannot expect me22 personally to assist them from my own income.23 MS. ADAMS:	Question.24 I'm sorry, were you finished?25 The building that you mentioned on2 

2	85th Street .345 occupancy?
MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Yes .MS. ADAMS :	That 's single room
6 MS . NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Yes .	I have no7 transient tenants .	Everybody lives there for 408 years.	Why would they leave if they pay $400 and9 $500 in rent.	Nobody leaves.	There's no 2010 percent up.11 MS . ADAMS:	And this is for one12 room.13 MS . NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Yes.14 MS. ADAMS:	And how many units are15 in the building?16 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Sixteen.17 Thirteen are regulated .18 MS. ADAMS :	And they're all19 regulated as20 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Thirteen are21 regulated.22 MS. ADAMS:	Thirteen are23 regulated.24 And now long have you owned the25 building?8 
2	MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Personally as3 an individual, one year, but as in different ways,4 three years.5 MS. ADAMS:	As what?6 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Three years.7 MS. ADAMS:	Three years as what?8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	As the owner.9	MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	As limited10 liability and then as an individual.11 MS. ADAMS:	I see.12 Do you own other buildings in the13 City?14 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	No. I do not15 own another building.	This is my only building. I16 lose money every month and I expect you to raise17 the rent on my building.18 (Audience participation.)19 MS. ADAMS:	And you're charging20 $500 -- am I understanding21 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	This is the22 legal rent for these apartments because these23 people live there for 40 years.	They never left .24 There was never adequate increases to go up to the25 market level.10 
2	MS. ADAMS:	But I'm correct in3 understanding that they pay on average $500 a4 month for one room?5 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR :	Not on6 average .	I have a person that pays - - I have7 people that pay more because I have three free8 market apartments and I have one person that pays9 preferential rent.10 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.11	MR. LANGUEDOC:	So how many - - I'm12 sorry.	How many --13 MS. HOLDER:	Where 's your14 building?15 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR :	On 85th Street.16 MR. LANGUEDOC:	How many total17 units and how many of them are rent regulated?18 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	I have 1619 units.20 MR . LANGUEDOC:	Sixteen units.21 MS . NAOMI AVIGDOR:	And thirteen22 are regulated, thirteen regulated, three free23 market .24 My property tax is $30,000 a year.25 MR . LANGUEDOC :	And the thirteen12 
2	regulated --3		MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	My heat bill is 4	$15,000 a year.5	MR. LANGUEDOC:	And the thirteen6	regulated units are all SRO units?7	MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	No, not all.8	Some of them are not.9	MR. LANGUEDOC:	How many are SROs10 and how many are regular apartments?11 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	I would say half12 and half.13 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay.14 MS . NAOMI AVIGDOR:	I would say15 eight and eight, something like that.16 MS. HOLDER:	Eight and eight?17 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Eight and eight,18 yes .19 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay.	But that20 doesn't quite add up.21 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	The building22 itself is an SRO.23	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Or eight out of24 sixteen, eight and eight.25 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	About eight and24 
2	eight.3	MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay. There's4	eight apartments and eight SRO units.5 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Yes.6 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And 13 - - of the7 13 that are regulated, how many of those are8 apartments and how many of those are SRO units, if9	you know?10 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Take three out11 of the apartment.	So I would say five and eight,12 eight SROs and three - -13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And five14 apartments.15 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Yeah.16 MR. LANGUEDOC:	So the three17 unregulated units are all apartments.18 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Yes.19 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Okay. And they're20 unregulated because of what reason?21 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Because people22 left.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No. Because they24 went over $2,000 on vacancy?	There's a reason.25 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	I'm sorry?10 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It became3 unregulated for a reason.	Is it because they went4 over $2,000 on vacancy?5	MS . NAOMI AVIGDOR :	Yes, they did.6 But I do not rent them for that much money because7 they are not worth that much money.	So even8 though it's market rate, the free market, they are 9	below $2,000.10 MS. ADAMS:	I'm sorry. What did you11 say?12 MS . HOLDER:	What do you rent them13 for? What do you rent them for?14 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	What I'm saying15 is16 MS. HOLDER:	She deregulated the17 apartments but she rents them at a lower rate.18 MS . NAOMI AVIGDOR:	The legal rent19 when they deregulated it was $2,100 or  something20 like that, but I rent it for less.21 MS. ADAMS :	Why?22 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR :	Because it's23 not worth that much.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	She can't get25 the amount.10 
2	MS . ADAMS:	I see.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay .	Any4	additional --5	MS. HOLDER:	And of the five6 apartments, what are they renting at, the7 regulated apartments?8	MS . NAOMI AVIGDOR:	$527, $623.9 Well, three are deregulated, okay.	But out of the10 other apartments I have a $527 elderly woman that11 lived there for 40 years. I have a couple that run12 a business in one of the apartments. They pay13 $620.	I think that's all the apartments .14 Everything else is15 MR. LANGUEDOC:	But you said that16 some -- you have a couple of tenants that have17 been there for a very long time?18 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Very long time,19 yes.20 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And do any of them21 have the Senior Citizen Rent Increase exception ?22 MS . NAOMI AVIGDOR:	I guess they23 make too much money.	I mean - -24 MR. LANGUEDOC:	So no. The answer25 is no.9 
2	MS . NAOMI AVIGDOR:	- - the increase3 on $600, you know, even if you give them ten4 percent increase on $600, how much would it be?5 MS. ADAMS:	Sixty dollars .6 MS . HOLDER:	So you apply - -7	MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	You know.8	MS. HOLDER :	You apply the9 increases on the apartments that the Rent10 Guidelines Board passes each year?11 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	I'm sorry?12 MS. HOLDER:	Do you apply the13 increases that the Rent Guidelines Board passes14 each year on the apartments?15 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Yes , I do.16MS. HOLDER:Andso with the SROs,17whatarethey renting for?18 MS . NAOMI AVIGDOR:	One is $39819 which is the lowest one in of the buildings.	One20 is $570.	One is $550, you know, in that range.21 MS . HOLDER:	So what's your22 monthly rent roll?23 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR :	I'm sorry?24 MS. HOLDER :	Your monthly rent roll25 for the building.18 
2	MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR :	I don't know.	I3 don't want to think about it.	It's very low.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay .5 MS. HOLDER:	And how long have you6 owned the apartment?7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The building .8 MS. HOLDER:	Your building.9	MS . NAOMI AVIGDOR:	I've owned the10 building in different ways three years.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Three years.12 MS. HOLDER:	Three years?13 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	And I cannot14 get the hardship because you need a three year15 whatever.16 MS. HOLDER:	I'm sorry?17 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	I cannot go and18 apply for the hardship increase because I don't19 own it as an individual for three years and that's20 a requirement .21 MS. HOLDER:	And do you live in22 the building?23	MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	No, I do not.24 MS. HOLDER:	So you bought the25 building three years ago and it's Manhattan.24 
2 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Excuse me?3 MS. HOLDER:	You bought the4 building three years ago in Manhattan on 85th5 Street.6	MS . NAOMI AVIGDOR:	Yes .7	MS. HOLDER :	Okay.	Thank you.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.	Thank9	you.10 Faith - -11 MS. NAOMI AVIGDOR:	So please12 increase the rent by as much as you can.	The more13 the better .14 (Audience participation .)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	As much as we16 can.17 Faith Steinberg.18 Hold on a second.19 Mr . Anderson next;20 Mr . Sherwood after that; and21 Mary McCune.22 Go ahead.23 MS . FAITH STEINBERG:	Good morning.24 Housing is a basic necessity of25 life.	Several years ago I and housing advocates10 
2 were lobbying in Albany and we were in Joseph3 Bruno's office.	Of course, Bruno would not dare4 to give us an audience to us peasants and his aide5 spoke to us.6 The aide commented, there' s nothing7 wrong with profit.	When I responded that we're8 not talking about profit, we're talking about9 greed and gouging, his response to this was to10 rise from his chair and say, well, I've got to go.11 Greed is what's driving landlords.12 Their voracious appetites totally disregard the13 human consequences.	This Board, by giving - - by14 giving landlord exorbitant rent increases15 throughout the years and decontrolling rental16 above $2,000 is not only complicit, but it is also17 exacerbating the problem of decreasing affordable18 housing .19 Housing is a basic necessity of20 life.21 The lack of any caring for people,22 the middle class, the poor, the homeless, is mind23 boggling to me. The homeless numbers have24 increased by 11,000 in recent years. The landlords25 talk about the rising costs. By the way, they get2 
2 rent deductions for this, tax deductions for these3 expenses which they never talk about.	But I would4 suggest that most of this wining is just that.5 After 9/11 many businesses suffered6 but the landlords kept breaking it in except for7 Downtown.	The tenants have also risen and they8 have no recourse.	Further, in the last five years9 income for the working poor in New York City has10 decreased.	And it's disgraceful that our public11 servants, such as Firemen and Policemen, among12 others whose salaries are disgraceful, cannot live13 in the City where they work.14 I see a building boom in the City15 and the billboards : Luxury condominiums.	If the16 developer and landlord vultures had their way,17 they would fell Central Park and put up luxury18 condominiums.19 (Audience participati on .)20 MS . FAITH STEINBERG:	Housing is a21 basic necessity of life.	Our so-called liberal22 Mayor Bloomberg brags of having rehabbed23 affordable housing.	But with the great loss of24 affordable housing, which is his responsibility,25 it's a wash .	He has done zilch .	He chooses this2 
2	Board, which is doing its best to dismantle rent3	regulation.	I'm a native New Yorker and I love4 this city, but you are helping to ruin it.	I5 would like to see the public members of this Board6 be truly for the public.	After all - -7	(Audience participation.)8	MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	the9	majority of the public are tenants.	How about10 giving the tenants a break this year or have you11 lost your all your humanity.12 May I remind you once again, housing13 is a basic necessity of life.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	Thank you.16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have a20question.21MS . HOLDER:	I have a question.22CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have a23question.24MS. HOLDER:	Thank you for your25testimony.
1	1112	Where do you live?3	MS . FAITH STEINBERG:	I live on the4 Upper West Side.5 MS. HOLDER:	And are you a rent6 regulated tenant?7 MS . FAITH STEINBERG:	I'm sorry?8	MS. HOLDER:	Are you a rent9	regulated tenant?10 MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	Rent11 stabilized.	I've lived there for 34 years.12 MS . HOLDER:	Thirty-four years?13 MS. FAITH STEINBERG :	And I'm also14 - - I get SCRIE as well.	Thank goodness for SCRIE .15 And my landlord owns about six16 brownstones which he bought in the 50's and he is17 now a millionaire.	And he is still not happy.18 He has gradually been - - been converting them to19 off rent stabilization.	He's been, you know,20 ripping out the walls and taking them - -  making21 the rent over $2,000 and I don't know how much22 he's --23 I live in a building with nine24 tenants .	So far two have been -- have been25 destabilized as well as other - - in his other10 
2 buildings as well.	He's gradually destabilizing3 apartments.4	MS. HOLDER:	And what are the5	conditions like in your building?6 MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	I'm sorry?7 MS . HOLDER:	The conditions in your8	buildings, are they --9	MS. FAITH STEINBERG:	I don't hear10 you.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Conditions in12 the building.13 MS. HOLDER:	Do you have good14 conditions?	Is your apartment - -15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is it well16 maintained, poorly maintained?17 MS . HOLDER:	Are repairs needed in18 your building? How is it maintained? Do you need19 any repairs or do any of your neighbors need any20 repairs?21 MS . FAITH STEINBERG:	No.	I have22 to say our building is kept up fairly well.	He23 does everything on the cheap and so it has to be24 done time and again, but he keeps it clean.	And25 he does repairs that have to be redone.	But he10 
2	does try to keep it up, but not well.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	On the cheap is4 the best compliment a tenant has paid an owner5 since I've been Chairman so.6	MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.8 Mr. Anderson.9	(Applause.)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Followed by Mr.11 Sherwood; and12 Ms. McCune.13 You can pick it up.14 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	Yes.15 I'm here to bring facts, evidence16 and proof and to talk truth, whole truth and17 nothing but truth, because I'm not politician,18 legislator or lawyer who represent tenant to19 understand to lie.20 You know the expenses go up all the21 time.	Not necessary nobody to lie.	After22 tragedy, much more we pay for insurance, much23 more, or whatever they want to charge.24 Tax can never coming down.	We never25 see.	One time Bush before, four, five, six years,10 
2 as the Congress, congress don 't care.	Congress3 go on vacancy, travel oversea, or rise them4 salary. They don 't have time to decide nothing5 about tax.6 And in Albany, in Albany they busy7 now to fight against the Governor and these two8 bums. One of them Joe Bruno present landlord. He9 don't care, he's bum.	And another Sheldon Silver,10 they don't care definitely.11 And if they're here, I do appreciate12 to kick it in one this bum and another hitting one13 hitting another, because they cannot defeat the14 Governor.	They cannot take care for tenant and15 landlords, just wait to receive big salary and to16 retire then die.17 So I appreciate that everybody18 talking truth because I see that they mention19 homeless.	We have in the shelter 35,000 homeless .20 Before been only 3,000.	So coming about 32,000 of21 the street . We don't have homeless in the street.22 Why people lie?23 And many of the shelter been here24 and declare they do not make anymore affordable25 house . They don't care, political gangsters. They2 
2 just receive money and enjoy the way to die or to3 lost the election and that will be forever.4 And this morning I hear two people5 who declare nothing expensive, zero rent.	So they6 are Ms . Zero and Mr. Zero, negative zero .	And7 they present like citizen who lie, who make8 damage, who sublet the apartment.9 If they present lost citizen, they10 are lost lawyers, lawyer liars.	It cannot be all11 right.	But anyway, let's continue this way every12 year until everybody die.	Nothing else cannot13 change it.	But I think a gangster cannot do14 nothing about fuel oil all the time go up .15 Sometime stay a little down. That's really16 forever.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, Mr.18 Anderson. Thank you.19 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	You never ask20 me question.	You discriminate me.21 (Laughter.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	No questions .23 MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	That's not24 nice.	That mean that I talking truth and you pled25 guilty.2 
1	1162	(Audience participation.)3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Anderson,4	thank you .5	MR. JAMES ANDERSON:	No question.6 Was it not too hard.	Have a nice day and nice7 life.8 (Audience participation.)9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Bye-bye.10	Robert Sherwood;11	Mary McCune;12 Followed by Mr . Freund.13 MR. ROBERT SHERWOOD:	According to14 Neighbors and Tenants organization, Mr. Markus was15 supposed to replaced, therefore he doesn't belong16 here . He should recuse himself from any further17 proceedings here.18 Remember the proviso.	As I said19 many times before, big time operations and small20 time operations should be handled separately.	The21 illegal conversion to terrorist trade should be22 strongly factored in.23 I'm from the Temple Hotel, 240 West24 73rd Street and it has been substantially25 converted for this use.12 
2 There's been all sorts of3 investigations and articles, et cetera. The4 issuance of building permits to this end should5 also be investigated.	The whole City government6 should be investigated.7 There's a lie that New York City is8 the greatest city on earth.	That's a bullshit9	lie. Why?	Because we are a colony of Albany,10 being held hostage with by the State of New York.11 We need a strong bipartisan delegation of the City12 of New York to work for and fight for Home Rule.13 And the first of order of business is to repeal14 Urstadt and get rid of vacancy decontrol.15 (Audience participation.)16 MR. ROBERT SHERWOOD:	Finally,17 SROs, single room occupancy units are not full and18 complete homes.	Therefore we should not pay full19 and complete rents.	We need a rollback.	Let20 there be liberty and justice for all as it says in21 the Pledge.22 Thank you.23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, Mr.25 Sherwood.10 
2	(Applause .)3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mary McCune;4 Followed by Mr. Freund;5 Followed by Mr. Zhen or Ms. Zen,  I'm6 not sure which, Chinatown Tenants Union.7 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	Hi.8 My name is Mary McCune and I'm the9 Community Law Fellow from the Columbia University10 Legal Services for New York West Harlem Community11 Advocacy Partnership. And I'm also a rent12 stabilized tenant.13 I represent primarily long term14 residents of West Harlem who are at risk of15 eviction . I	give special priority to the elderly16 and the disabled .17 In West Harlem, as in so many New18 York City neighborhoods, long-term residents  are19 finding themselves displaced as a result of rents20 at a time when most tenant's incomes remain fixed21 or have actually decreased in real terms.22 An increasing number of my clients23 pay 40 percent or more of their income towards24 rent and are at risk of homelessness as a result.25 At the same time their rents are5 
2 increasing most of the services they receive are3 decreasing.	Many landlords have imposed a4 two-tier system in their buildings.	When a new5 tenant paying a high rent has a repair problem, it6 is fixed right away, while long term tenants with7 low rents wait months for repairs, if the repairs8 are made at all.9 These long term tenants watch as10 vacant apartments are completely renovated within11 a few weeks time while they struggle for years12 with constant water leaks and collapsing  ceilings.13 It is unjust that tenants in14 buildings with multi, longstanding violations15 should have to pay renewal lease increases.	And16 for this reason I ask the Board to consider the17 proviso which would bar owners from collecting18 these increases in buildings with more than five19 hazardous violations should you find it within20 your authority to do so.21 (Applause .)22 MS . MARY MCCUNE:	This would not23 only encourage owners to meet their legal24 obligation, but could also help to preserve25 affordable housing which we so desperately need.2 
2 Many tenants, worn out by years of3 poor conditions, leave their apartments enabling4 the landlord to get vacancy increases of 18 to 205 percent, plus one-fortieth of the cost of6 improvements done in the apartment after it7 becomes vacant.8 Many of these so called improvements9 are simply routine maintenance deferred for so10 many years that what could have been repaired, if11 the landlord acted promptly, now must be replaced.12 Every vacancy lease and every rent increase brings13 rent stabilized apartments closer to becoming14 deregulated.15 Although a two percent to four16 percent rent increase may not seem like much to17 you, when coupled with other rent increases18 available to the landlord such as vacancy19 increases, the one-fortieth individual apartment20 improvement increases, MCI increases, as well as21 surcharges for washing machines and air22 conditioners, it can quickly make an apartment23 unaffordable.24 As I am sure this Board is aware,25 New York City is facing a housing crisis. Everyday2 
2 the pool of affordable housing shrinks as more and3 more rent stabilized apartment become deregulated4 and as buildings opt out of the Mitchell-Lama5 program .6 When you make your final decision on7 Rent Guidelines for next year, I ask you to8 consider not only the effect that it will have on9 individuals, but also the effect it will have  on10 affordable housing.11 In the current housing crisis, even12 a two percent or four-percent increase is too much13 and therefore I'm asking the Board to vote a  zero14 percent increase for the coming guidelines period.15 Thank you.16 (Applause .)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 MS . HOLDER:	I have a question. I19 have a question.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have a21 question.22 MS. HOLDER:	Thank for you coming23 to testify this morning.	I really appreciate it.24 Do you have any opinion about what25 this Board has been doing in the last few years2 
2 with having one or two-year increases, actually3 have this three-point spread and do you have  any4 opinion about that?5	MS . MARY MCCUNE:	I - - I don't6 think it's a good idea.	I think it's really -- I7 think it limits tenant turnout .	I think they hear8 the lower number and they think oh, that sounds9 more reasonable or they feel like they're getting10 a good deal if they get the lower number even11 though if you just said two percent, they'd say I12 can't even afford two percent when you make two to13 four.14 I understand why you might do that.15 I might be difficult to agree on the specific16 number, but I don't really think it -- I think it17 does a disservice to landlords and tenants18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I think you19 misunderstood the question.20 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	Oh, maybe I did.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The question is,22 the two-year lease gap - -23 MS. HOLDER:	The spread.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	- - between a one25 and two-year lease - -6 
2 MS . MARY MCCUNE:	Oh, I'm sorry.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	- - not the - -4	MS. MARY MCCUNE:	I misunderstood.5	MS. HOLDER :	The spread between a6	one and two-year.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I'm trying to8	help you out here.9	MS. MARY MCCUNE:	Thank you.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I know you're11 going to agree with our position so I figured I'd12 clarify the question.13 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	I'm sure, yes .14 So you're asking about the15 MS. HOLDER:	The Chair is always16 looking out for me.17 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	You know, I18 haven't really given much thought to it but it19 doesn't really make sense to me.20 I think you've heard from a lot of21 the tenants here today that they're basically22 being forced into taking the one-year lease23 because they can't afford the two-year lease.	So24 I think it does a disservice to many tenants.25 If you were - - it doesn't really10 
2 deal with the reality.	Like for many tenants, it3 would be more cost effective to opt for the tier4 but they can't pay that money up front and so they5 end up choosing the one-year lease.6 And I think landlords like the7 one-year lease because they have more chance of8 turnover which increases their revenues.	So I can9 understand why landlords want that, but I don't10 think it 's very helpful to tenants.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have another12 question on the other side.13 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	Okay. Sure .14 MS. CRUZ:	Hi, Ms . McCune.15 Could you tell me exactly what you16 do at - - is the program that you work for at17 Columbia University, is that affiliated with the18 law school?	I just am not clear exactly what is19 your position.20 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	Yes.	It's very21 unclear .	The title's a little confusing.22 I actually am a staff attorney at23 Harlem Legal Services and I'm the Project Attorney24 for this particular project.25 We get a grant through Legal12 
2 Services for New York City which is from  Columbia3 which helps to fund the work that  I do.	But I4 don't work for Columbia in any sense .5 So I'm doing what most Legal6 Services staff attorneys do, I represent tenants7 in court.	But I have a particular catchment area8 and my own priorities based on the project and9 sort of what Columbia wanted to see from this10 grant.11 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.12 I just have a few follow-up13 questions; is that okay?14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.15 MS. CRUZ:	You indicated that you16 mainly represent elderly tenants in the Upper17 Manhattan area?18 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	I basically - - I19 live in Upper Manhattan, but I work representing20 tenants in West Harlem and I give priority to long21 term residents who tend generally to be elderly.22 But some of them are not .	Some of them have just23 lived in the community since they were infants so24 they might be 20 or 30 years old.25 So within my project I give priority2 
2 -- the main goal or focus behind my project is3 preserve affordable housing.4 And one of the ways to do that is to5 keep long term residents in their apartments and6 keep them affordable .	So I give priority to7 vulnerable populations which include the elderly8 and disabled within that long term resident9 priority .10 MS. CRUZ:	As well as low income11 individuals right?12 MS . MARY MCCUNE:	Yes.	They have13 to be low income to be eligible; though there  are14 many people that could use my services that aren't15 eligible unfortunately.16 MS. CRUZ:	As to your elderly17 clients, do you feel that the SCRIE program does18 not assist to protect them against rent increases?19 MS. MARY MCCUNE :	Well, a lot of20 people aren 't eligible for SCRIE.	A lot of people21 don't know about it.	Sometimes it can be22 difficult because tenants may have a preferential23 rent and SCRIE will approve it at the higher rate,24 the legal maximum rent .	So they're not really25 getting any benefits from the program if you2 
2	understand how that works.3	So say the rent is	they're4 getting a preferential rent of $500, but the5 actual registered rent may be $750 so SCRIE will6 only pick up rent increases after $750 so they7 don't get any assistance from that.8 Often what happens is some - - it9 does provide a very real benefit for a certain10 number of my clients and they rely on it heavily11 and it's a very good program.12 I have a lot of tenants also that13 are in a sort of an odd situation because  there's14 a Rent Reduction order in the building because the15 landlord failed to maintain the services and so16 they can't even apply for SCRIE because on paper17 their rent is lower than the actual lease rent18 would be so they have to sort of wait until the19 Rent Reduction order is lifted.20 MS. CRUZ:	Right.	But during the21 time that the Rent Reduction order is effect - -22 MS . MARY MCCUNE:	The rent is lower23 so.24 MS. CRUZ:	- - the rent is lower25 and it's also frozen.4 
1	1282 Even if we were to pass a rent3 increase, this particular property owner would not4 get a rent increase.5 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	But one of the6 issues is they keep getting renewal leases which7 keep increasing the rents and so it gets a little8 confusing to figure out at the end like what the9 actual rent would be and where SCRIE will pick it10 up.11 So some of them don't bother to12 apply for SCRIE because the reduced rent that13 they're paying is affordable to them and then14 suddenly their rent goes from $200 to $400, but15 they haven't made the application with the interim16 renewal leases because they didn 't have to pay it17 and then it's prospective only.	So that does sort18 of hurt a lot of my clients even though they19 benefit from a rent reduction for a number of20 years.21 MS. CRUZ:	And my last question22 relates to your comment about building conditions23 that, if I understand you correctly, you're24 advocating to deny property owners that have25 certain violations in their buildings from rent2 
2 increases .3 But in your practice when you bring4 HPD proceedings or other legal proceedings to5 force property owners to correct defective6 conditions, how -- are you saying that is not7 sufficient to remedy the problems?
8 9	that. 10
MS. MARY MCCUNE:	Yes, I would sayI've spent over a year in Court on
11 an HP action and trying to get owners to do12 repairs.	I've had similar experiences in13 non-payments.	Sometimes the owners just don't14 respond.	There can be multiple violations placed15 on the build ings.	There could be orders of16 contempt.	They can get civil penalties for17 contempt assessed against them and they still18 don't do the repairs.	So no, it's not really19 sufficient.20 I think it actually - - I know -- I21 have this experience in my own building actually22 where we had a lot of problems and we have a Rent23 Reduction order for the last, I think three years24 now.	And once we got the Rent Reduction order,25 the landlord did a bunch of the repairs when they11 
2 wouldn't do them when people were bringing3 individual HP actions.4 So and we kept getting additional5 violations so that's why it's ongoing.	They've6 actually fixed all the things that were in the7 original order but there was a subsequent order8 placed.9	MS. CRUZ:	Right.10 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	So I'd say no,11 it's not sufficient.	And you also have to12 understand that most tenants don't have attorneys.13 And if it takes me a year sometimes to get repairs14 done for a tenant, you could imagine what it's15 like for someone who's unrepresented and even for16 them to find their way in Court and know that they17 can do an HP action is highly unusual.	But it's18 not	all the people aren't getting the help that19 they need.20 MS. CRUZ:	But they can also file21 a complaint with DHCR and then possibly get a Rend22 Reduction order.	So there are various mechanisms23 that a tenant that is aggrieved can find some type24 of relief so that -- to add another layer.25 Somehow it seems a bit redundant, don't you think?10 
1	1312 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	Well, I don't3 think so because most tenants aren't really aware4 of DHCR and how it works.	And even when you file5 the Rent Reduction complaints, it's actually a6 very long and tedious process, as I know from my7 own personal experience.8 There's also a lot of problems with9 DHCR.	The inspectors come out months after you10 file it.	So if it's a condition that may be sort11 of sporadic, like, for example, in our building we12 had a problem with the elevator.	We had a lot of13 elderly and disabled tenants in our building and14 actually several of them died and I'm convinced it15 was because the elevator was out so often .16 But every time the inspector would17 come, you know, the elevator would be working for18 a few hours and that would always be the time that19 they would come.	So it took us, I think over a20 year to actually get the reduction for that21 condition.22 So it's - - all of these things are23 helpful but none of them are guaranteed to really24 give tenants the relief that they need.	I think25 owners, it's a little different for them, because2 
2 they tend to have more access to legal advice and3 are more familiar with the system.4 But given the number of tenants that5 really need the relief and the very few agencies6 or organizations that are available to assist7 them.	The great thing about doing it through you8 is that you can send a notice that every tenant9 gets a lease in theory.	And if the notice comes10 with the lease and they know that they can apply11 to have their rent guidelines increase not imposed12 on them if there's rent - - sorry, repair problems13 in the building, then every tenant will have that14 notice.15 Nobody - - DHCR doesn't send a notice16 to every tenant saying oh, by the way, if you 're17 landlord's not doing repairs, you can file this18 nifty Failure to Maintain Services complaint . And19 neither does Housing Court or HP give information20 to every individual tenant. So that's one thing21 that is different about lease information is in22 theory to get to every tenant that's living in an23 apartment that's regulated .24 MS. CRUZ:	But owners are required25 to attach a rent stabilization rider to leases2 
2 that would inform tenants of their rights to file3 complaints at DHCR.4	MS . MARY MCCUNE:	I don't know if5	you 've every looked at those riders.6	MS. CRUZ:	I certainly have . I7	certainly have .8	MS. MARY MCCUNE:	I think most9 tenants know they're in English only .	There's a10 lot of problems with that .	But most people don't11 read through them.12 And you're right, they should.13 People should but when you 're signing a lease14 that's only with your - - you know, your initial15 lease you get.	And then if you don't have16 additional problems with the apartment, you may17 not be looking at that years later wondering what18 you could do about it .19 So I understand your point and it's20 well taken that tenants do have other remedies21 available to them.	But I also think you have to22 look at the other side as one of the reasons to do23 this is to get landlords to comply with our own24 legal obligation s.	So it's not just about helping25 tenants, but it's also about encouraging owners9 
2 and giving them an additional incentive to do what3 they should be under the law.4 In theory we shouldn 't even have to5 do any of us. No one should have file an HP6 complaint.	No one should have to file a Failure7 to Maintain Services complaint because they should8 get those services automatically.9	(Applau se.)10 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	But the reality11 is that that doesn't -- that does happen in some12 buildings that are good buildings, but in a lot of13 buildings that doesn't happen as it should.14 MS. CRUZ:	Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Schleider,16 did you have a question?17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.19 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thanks for20 testifying.21 You said West Harlem .	Is like22 Morningside Heights, Hamilton Heights?23 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	Most of where --24 I'm usually	that's where most of my tenants are25 now because of what's happening in Hamilton10 
2 Heights and sort of the increase in gentrification3 pressures that most of my tenants are coming from4 the Hamilton Heights area.5	MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay. That's6	community district7	MS . MARY MCCUNE:	But I do from8	llOth to 155th on the West side.9	MR. SCHLEIDER :	That's right in10 there.	So that's community district #309.	I11 don't know if you're familiar with that.12 MS. MARY MCCUNE :	Community district 13	#9, yes --14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, 309 is the15 official.16 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	is my17 catchment area.18 MR. SCHLEIDER :	This is put out by19 the Furman Center of NYU.20 Your area has relatively high rates21 of tax delinquency.	And the share of housing22 units with serious code violations has been23 increasing steadily since 2002.24 But also - and maybe you can25 reconcile this for me - foreclosure rates are14 
2 consistently twice as high as the borough-wide3 average.	And Community District #309 had the4 fewest certificates of occupancy issued in 2005,5 2005 ranking it in the City near the bottom of the6 City's neighborhoods for residential construction,7 the construction itself.8 We have a median monthly rent there9 about $880 a month which gives you the median10 income for affordability, about the $32,00011 average household income, as you said before. So12 we have a high rate of distressed properties yet13 we still have a high rate of tax delinquencies and14 foreclosure activity.15 Now, can you reconcile this? I mean16 from what I'm hearing from your statement, and17 please correct me if I'm wrong, is that the18 landlords are pocketing money and just going on19 there way .	But it seems that the data tells us20 that the landlords are not able to keep up with21 maintainin g their properties.	They can't pay22 their taxes. They can't pay their mortgages. And23 because of the economics of this community24 district - which happens to be one of densest25 populated community districts - and also --2 
2 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	Sure.3 MR . SCHLEIDER:	one of the most4 economically and socially diverse districts in the5 City, we're not seeing the influx of new6 residential construction. 7		So --8	MS . MARY MCCUNE:	Well, I'm not an9	expert on all of those areas .	But I will say --10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I'm just talking11 about your area.12 MS. MARY MCCUNE :	Yes. No -- well,13 you know, I'm a lawyer, I go to court. I don't14 know all of these things about real  estate15 development.16 But basically there's a couple of17 different things going on in the community that I18 think might -- from my experience.19 One thing you have to understand is20 that when I'm testifying and talking about the21 tenants that come to my office, so these  are22 tenants that generally are at the buildings that23 are having problems.24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No, I understand.25 MS . MARY MCCUNE:	I don't know that10 
2 they're representative of all the buildings.3 I don't think - - what I have seen4 personally is I've seen a lot of people with no5 experience in real estate coming in and saying6 this is a hot market, I'm going to buy, buying at7 very high price and then not being at all  familiar8 with the rent regulation and how that works and9 then coming in and finding out that they really10 can 1 t afford to pay their mortgage.	And they do11 sort of walk away. They don't do the repairs. I12 had someone brought in handcuffs to court because13 they basically were walking away from the14 building.15 I guess if they sold the building,16 they could probably make a fair amount of money17 and sold it to someone that was knowledgeable and18 had the experience and expertise to turn that19 building around.20 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Maybe, maybe21 MS. MARY MCCUNE :	But some of it is22 - - yeah, I mean some of the properties - - I'm sure23 there are some buildings that have a very high24 percentage of long-term residents that are  paying25 lower rents.	But I do see more and more2 
2 apartments being deregulated.	So I'm assuming3 that with someone that's savvy, that that might4 sort of balance it out and make it more affordable5 for someone.6 But their properties that I have7 seen in distress, generally speaking, are people8 that had no real estate experience, overpaid for9 the building, are sort of being penny-wise,10 pound- foolish.	They're doing short term repairs .11 I don't know what other people are doing but those12 are building I'm seeing.13 MR. SCHLEIDER:	You've been working14 - - you've been seeing this what, over the past15 year or so?16 MS. MARY MCCUNE :	I've worked -- I17 think this is my start of my third year on this18 project.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Your third year.20 All right, so this is data as of 2005 so it  goes21 back further.22 MS . MARY MCCUNE:	2005. It's a few23 years ago.24 MR. SCHLEIDER :	So it's just25 exacerbated more now.	But so how would you then2 
2 reconcile this going from 2002 to 2005.	Highest3 rate of foreclosures, highest rate of tax4 delinquencies?	So it's a systematic problem for5 this --6 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	Well, I think7 I'm trying to explain that the individual owners8 that I know who haven't been paying their taxes9 and are being foreclosed are people that just10 speculated, didn't investigate the property11 properly before they bought it, went in not12 understanding rent regulations so they overpaid.13 They got mortgages that were -- because they14 weren 't savvy I guess they think they didn 't get15 very favorable terms.16 So those are the landlords that I'm17 seeing. I don't know about other landlords. I18 don't know about the landlords that are good and19 are doing a good job as much because their tenants20 don't come to complain to me.	But all I can say,21 I can give an example. I mean it's all anecdotal.22 But I had this - - there are four23 buildings --24 MR. SCHLEIDER:	I think you25 answered the question.	You reconciled as best as2 
1	1412 you could.3 Thank you.4	MS. HOLDER:	I mean and as someone5 who actually lives, you know, close by in  Harlem,6 you know, anecdotally I can also say that I've7 seen a lot of people and I know personally people8 who have had speculation and bought up a number of9 the SROs and other buildings there and did not10 really understand the business that they were11 getting into.12 And it's an unfair, you know, it's13 very not only unfair to the tenants, but it's14 unfortunate also for a lot of those people.	But15 that's the reality of what people coming in not16 really doing their due diligence and not getting17 good advice and getting into that kind of18 business, and, you know, bad business choices.19 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	Exactly.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That's • cause22 people think rent stabilized properties are a23 panacea .24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	They are.	They25 are.5 
1	1422 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right. They are3 not .4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 MS. MARY MCCUNE:	Thanks.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Appreciate it.7 (Applause.)8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Freund;9	Followed by Zhiquin Zen of the10 Chinatown Tenants Union;11 Followed by Council Member Domenic12 Recchia.13 MR. JACK FREUND:	Thank you, Mr.14 Chairman, members of the Board.	I thank you .15 I appreciate the opportunity to16 testify on behalf of the members of the Rent17 Stabilization Association who own or manage the18 majority of the one million rent stabilized19 apartments in New York City.20 We ask the Rent Guidelines Board21 this year to recognize that building operating22 costs have skyrocketed dramatically in recent23 years.	In order to preserve the City's24 substantial stock of affordable housing, it is25 critical that the RGB provide rent increases10 
2 commensurate with the increase in operating costs .3 No one can deny that over the past4 few years the cost of heating oil has tripled,5 real estate taxes have increased precipitously and6 insurance costs have doubled .7 Overall building operating costs8 have increased by more than 50 percent in this9 decade.	Rent increases authorized by this Board10 have covered less than half of those increased11 costs and costs will continue to rise12 substantially.13 Water and sewer rates are increasing14 in double digits for the foreseeable future and15 electric rates are also projected to increase in16 double digits.17 As a result of inadequate Rent18 Guideline increases, the Board has clear evidence19 that the profitability of affordable housing20 outside core Manhattan is declining. Increasingly21 owners are forced to choose between equally22 important maintenance and improvement projects.23 Even worse, they must decide whether to try and24 maintain their affordable rental properties or25 sell to those who will need to maximize rental2 
2 income and minimize building operating costs .3 This year's 5 .1 increase in4 operating costs is very substantial and requires5 significant Rent Guidelines increases. And because6 the Price Index is lower this year than last, it7 provides an opportunity to compensate for the8 inadequacy of recent Rent Guidelines increases.9 The Board should also incorporate10 into this year's guidelines, some of the projected11 eight and a half percent increase in costs12 anticipated for next year.13 The RGB has evidence that vacancy14 increases in the deregulation of apartments have a15 negligible effect on rental properties outside16 core Manhattan.	We have only to look at the half17 million apartments still renting for less than18 $850 per month in 2005 with more entering the19 system everyday, to recognize that stabilized20 housing remains broadly affordable.21 The only way that the bulk of this22 City's affordable housing can be preserved is by23 recognizing that stabilized rents must be24 increased in line with increased building25 operating costs.2 
2 Thank you for your attention and we3 hope that this year will be a catchup year in4 terms of the guidelines.5 As you've heard from other owners,6 especially what we're going to be asking you this7 year to do is look at this concept of a8	supplemental increase for these apartments that9 are at very low rents and not able to sustain10 themselves.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, Mr .12 Freund.13 MS. CRUZ:	I have a question for14 Mr. Freund.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Go ahead.16 MS. CRUZ:	You've heard a lot of17 discussion on -- by this Board about the notion of18 affordability.	Could you tell us what19 considerations you think the Board should give to20 concerns about affordability.21 MR . JACK FREUND:	Sure.22 Affordability I think is a complex23 issue.	It is of concern to many people in many24 different ways.	But I fear that it is - - it25 should not be a concern of this Board in terms of9 
2 these deliberations.3 I mean clearly there is an4 affordability problem among low income people,5 people who have incomes that are too low to6 compete in the private market in any way and that7 is clearly a government responsibility .	There is8 clearly nothing that this Board can do about9	affordability for those minority, for a small	a10 large, but minority section of the population in11 New York City.12 On the other hand, there is some13 concerns in workforce housing.	There's some14 concern that the middle class no longer can afford15 housing in New York City.	Again, that is not a16 concern of this Board .	It is not the purpose of17 rent stabilization to be an affordable housing18 program.	Rent stabilization is not a housing19 assistance program.	It doesn't guarantee that20 every tenant will have an affordable rental21 apartment and everybody corning into New York22 looking for an apartment will be able to find an23 affordable rental apartment.24 That, again, is a goal for25 government to achieve. If government thinks that10 
2 middle class workforce housing should be3 subsidized, then they ought to subsidize and4 produce that housing as they are.5 The government is now producing6 housing ranging for people with incomes at 507 percent of the area median, up to 200 percent of8 the median.	They are producing housing with9 initial rents of $1,200 and $1,600 a month. They10 call that affordable housing.11 Some people on this Board would say12 if that was a rent stabilized apartment, that13 would not be affordable. So it's a very fungible14 notion.	But any attempt by this Board, I'm15 afraid, to take this notion for affordability into16 consideration is only going to penalize owners .17 This Board and the Rent18 stabilization Law was not established to create19 affordability.	In the words of the statute, it20 was created to prevent exorbitant and excessive21 rent increases.22 I want to suggest to you that any23 rent increase that you enact that is based on a24 Price Index, the increase in operating costs, is25 by definition not exorbitant or excessive . It is a2 
2 necessary rent increase.3 (Audience participation.)4 MR. JACK FREUND:	It is an5 increase in rent that's necessary to maintain the6 affordable housing that we have, again, that stock7 of housing where half the apartments or more than8 500,000 rent stabilized apartments in the City9 rent for less than $850 a month which, as Mr.10 Schleider pointed out, is affordable. The median11 rent is exactly affordable to the median income of12 the stabilized tenant.	So there is no lack of13 affordability .	And I would suggest to you that14 your goal is to make sure that we maintain the15 affordable housing that we have.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair?18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	An additional19 question?20 Thank you, Mr. Freund.21 Mr. Schleider, you have a question?22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes. Thank you.23 Thank you, Mr. Freund for24 testifying.25 A lot has been bandied about on the2 
1	14 92 numerous discussions and meetings that we have3 about what extent this Board should consider4 vacancies and other income sources and an offset5 to required guideline increases.6 Do you think that the approach that7 the Board has taken sufficiently addresses that,8 overstates the issue, understates the issue?9	MR. JACK FREUND:	I think	thank10 you for that question, Mr. Schleider.11 I think that the Board's emphasis on12 vacancy and the availability of vacancy increases13 and decontrol, I think blows up a problem which is14 really a minor element of housing economics in15 this City.16 We know, for instance, that  among17 the decontrolled universe there are, A, not that18 many of them, and that according to the RGB data,19 84 percent of those are in Manhattan.	So you've20 got a small number of units.	And I believe in the21 last year it was just under 10,000 units that22 became deregulated, all in Manhattan.	That is a23 tiny fraction of the overall housing market.24 As for vacancies and the25 significance of vacancy increases, I think that is10 
1	1502 also overrated.	You know, the Board used to - -3 the staff used to calculate it to its  commensurate4 adjustments - a 20 percent or an 18 percent rate5 assuming that all owners when they get a vacancy,6 could get the statutory vacancy allowance.7 When we asked the staff to look  at8 that a couple of years ago, it turned out that9 owners were not getting 18 and 20 percent.	They10 were getting 9.8 percent on average and that's two11 years ago.12 And I would suggest to you that that13 9.8 average is very different in Manhattan than in14 the other outer boroughs.	I don't think - - I15 think you're getting higher than 9.8 percent in16 Manhattan, but you're not getting anywhere near17 9.8 percent vacancy increases in the outer18 boroughs where you have the low rents where you19 can use those increases. But we're not getting20 them .21 So I would ask the Board to stop22 focusing on sort of the exceptional cases, the23 decontrolled cases and the minority cases where24 you can get vacancy increases, and focus instead25 on the long-term tenants, the existing rents, the2 
1	1512 rents, 500,000 rents under $850 which are not3 sufficient to maintain rental housing in an era4 when taxes keep going up, fuel keeps going up,5 insurance keeps going up, water and sewer keeps6 going up and every other cost of rental housing7 keeps going up.8 Your responsibility is to help9 owners keep that housing in the marketplace.10 MS. CRUZ:	What's your suggestion11 for an appropriate guideline for the upcoming12 year, Mr. Freund?13 MR. JACK FREUND:	Well, it's14 actually a difficult question this year because15 the momentum -- on the one hand you have what the16 staff suggests to you as commensurate rent17 increases, that is increases that owners need just18 to meet increased operating cost.	And those19 increases range as high as five-and-three-quarters20 and nine-and-three quarters for one and two-year21 leases.22 We would be tempted to say that's23 what you need.	And I believe that is what you24 need if you believe, once you factor out those25 vacancy increases, which I think are overly2 
1	1522 exaggerated.	So we would say that, yes, you need3 that.4 And as I indicated earlier, we think5 that it's high time that a supplemental adjustment6 come back under consideration by this Board.	With7 average operating costs hovering around $600 a8 month you just can't maintain apartments for less9 than that.10 And I think you're taking a risk11 when you're assuming that owners are somehow going12 to be able to raise other apartments to market or13 collect vacancy increases to subsidize those low14 rents apartments .15 So we would definitely ask you to16 take a look at the low rent adjustment and to17 forebear on any inclination you have to drop the18 guidelines this year in the face of a slightly19 lower Price Index.20 Let me remind you that the 5.121 percent increase in prices is still twice the22 increase in the CPI. So the pressure on owner's23 operating costs are much higher than the overall24 rate of inflation.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you, Mr.2 
2	Freund.3 MS. ADAMS:	I have a question.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One more5	question .6	MS. ADAMS:	Would you share with7 the Board where most of the units that you're8 involved with are located versus the boroughs,9 what's in Manhattan, what's outside and then10 what's the average size of those units.11	MR . JACK FREUND:	Most of our12 membership is based outside of Manhattan. Our13 membership actually reflects the stabilized14 housing stock as a whole, which means that15 two-thirds of it is outside the Manhattan core.16 And on average our owners own - - the17 average size of the building is a 20 to 30-unit18 building.	That's the range of the buildings19 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.20 MR. JACK FREUND:	- - which also21 kind of reflects the average size building.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank  you, Mr.23 Freund.24 MR. JACK FREUND :	Thank you.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Zhiquin Zhen.12 
2 (Applause.)3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Followed by4 Council Member Recchia;5 Followed by Bin Liang.6 MS. ZHIQUIN ZHEN:	(Through7 interpreter.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	It's going to be9 translated.10 MS. ZHIQUIN ZHEN:	Hi.	My name is11 Zhiquin Zhen.12 I've been living at 61 Delancy13 Street for over 20 years.	A new landlord bought14 my building and the building next door a few years15 ago and since then our living conditions have16 gotten worse.17 The landlord never makes repairs and18 very often we experience no heat and hot water as19 well as leaky pipes.	Almost all of the pipes in20 all of the apartment bathrooms are leaking . Due to21 the water damage the ceilings are rotted through22 and collapse at least once a year.23 Every time the ceiling collapses,24 the landlord never takes immediate action. We have25 to keep calling him and then he'll say he'll come2 
1	1552 tomorrow and when tomorrow comes, no one shows up.3 It always takes a long time before any repairs are4 made.5 During the winter the landlord6 purposely turns off heat and hot water on7 weekends.	And then there are rats and rodents8 everywhere. The purpose is to displace us because9 then he renovates one-bedroom - - one-bedroom10 apartments into two-bedroom apartments, and11 two-bedroom apartments into three-bedroom12 apartments.13 Now a lot of tenants have been14 kicked out .	In fact, more than half of the --15 more than half of the apartments are no longer16 rent stabilized .	This is my experience . All the17 tenants who live at 55 or 61 Delancy Street face18 the same bad housing conditions, as well as many19 other tenants in New York City.20 We pay our rent every month. It's21 not that we don't want to pay a rent increase or22 that we don't want to pay rent, but it is unfair23 for us to pay rent increases when our services24 have actually gone down.25 Thank you.2 
1	1562	(Applause .)3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Question.5 MS. ADAMS:	Question.6 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Question?7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.8 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you for9 testifying.10 In your opinion is the reason why it11 takes so long for the landlord to make the  repairs12 that the landlord doesn't have money to make the13 repairs or some other reason?14 MR. ZHIQUIN ZHEN:	So it's not the15 landlord doesn't have any money because we know16 that he actually own buildings up in Harlem and17 then decided to buy in Chinatown.	And so we know18 that he has a lot of - - he owns a lot of buildings19 and a lot of money and that it's just that he20 doesn't want to make the repairs.21 MR. LANGUEDOC:	What, in your22 opinion, would be the reason why the landlord does23 not want to make repairs if, in fact, he has the24 money to make the repairs?25 MR. ZHIQUIN ZHEN:	So his tactic6 
1	1572 has been that since he bought the building he's3 been evicting the tenants.	And one of the ways4 that he does that is by not providing services.5 And so when he doesn't provide services and make6 the repairs, then the tenants, they get frustrated7 and it's easier for them to leave. And so then8 it's in his interest to do that.9 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And could I just10 say that your the first person that's come before11 us today who was not speaking English. I'd just12 like to ask you this question.13 Do you feel that there are14 sufficient sources of information for rent15 stabilized tenants who do not speak English as16 their primary language?17 MR . ZHIQUIN ZHEN:	So in terms of18 her experience it's very, very difficult to find19 out information when you don't speak English. And20 the landlord actually prays on that. And so like21 things like going to court and getting documents22 from the landlord, it's extra hard to try to23 figure what it is that the landlord is trying to24 do .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 
2	MS . ADAMS:	I have one question.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Betty.4 MS. ADAMS:	How long has she been5	in the country, in this country?6	MR. ZHIQUIN ZHEN:	She's been here7	fore 25 years.8 MS. ADAMS:	Thank you.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10	Council Member Recchia.11	(Applause. )12 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	Good13 afternoon.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How you doing?15 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	All right.16 Today I'm here to ask the Board not17 to raise the rent for my constituents .18 I represent19 (Applause. )20 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	I represent21 -- you know, I represent a large senior22 population.	And there comes a point in time where23 we have to say enough's enough and we have to take24 a break to give them an opportunity.25 When seniors have to start to decide12 
2 whether to pay their rent or to eat, right, or to3 buy their prescriptions, it's a sad day. And if we4 keep on raising the rents, the middle class are5 going to move out of the City.6 Now, when I stand here and I hear7 the landlords talk about their expenses keep8 rising and keep on growing and I say to myself9 then come forward, open up your books and let us10 see exactly what you're talking about.11 (Audience participation.)12 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	And that13 -- you know, that doesn't happen.	And what's14 happening even more and more what people -- I hear15 no one talk about is that more landlords are going16 to submetering.	The rents are going down a little17 bit but their bills are going up.	They have an18 additional bill, the seniors to pay, because of19 submetering that more landlords are going to.	So20 the next time they'll probably try to submeter the21 water bill . Who knows what 's going to happen next.22 So I'm asking not to raise the23 rents, not to go up and to give us a break in New24 York City so the middle class, they do not move25 out.2 
2 Thank you very much.3 (Applause .)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 MR. SCHLEIDER :	Question, please.6 (Audience participation.)7 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Council Member?8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have some9	questions.10 MR . SCHLEIDER :	Hi .	Thanks for the11 passionate testimony.	It was great.12 Which district do you represent?13 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	Coney14 Island, Brighton Beach.15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	The old country .16 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	That's17 right.18 MR. SCHLEIDER :	The past couple of19 years in my -- when I make my presentations to the20 Board and to the public, I called for increases in21 DRIE and SCRIE, right.22 Has the Council really addressed all23 this?24 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA :	Well,25 since this new Council came into being we10 
2 increased SCRIE, we have increased it.	It's gone3 up every year, okay.	And this year4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And for DRIE?5 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	- - the6 Speaker, Christine Quinn, took it one step further7 and we've gone up to Albany try to get a renter's8 rebate to try to help this -- you know, for9 renters.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Yes.	That's11 something else we've also called for.12 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	So we are13 working hard on that.	So we are doing something,14 the City Council, moving forward. We're not just15 sitting back.	We're just not coming here and say16 we want, demanding, demanding, demanding. We're17 coming here and saying listen, we're trying   to18 help out also.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Well, excuse me,20 that's all I heard and that's why I brought up21 these follow-up questions for you.22 How much more do you envision this23 new Council, as you phrased it, doing to24 supplement tenant's incomes?	Because really what25 we're hearing is it's an affordability issue . So2 
2 what are you doing to help those tenants most at3 risk, the, what is it, 40 percent of those rent4 stabilized tenants who are under that - -5 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	We're6 trying, okay, to pass legislation to number one,7 to help those that are in dire need, okay, to get8 subsidized in some program.	We' re going up for9 the renter's rebate . And also with the increase10 in SCRIE.11 But also what has to happen here,12 there has to come a point in time to let13 everything catch up that they do not have a rent14 hike, okay.	Because the SCRIE is going up and it15 goes up gradually over the next few years .	But16 there comes a point in time if we stop raising the17 rents, then your seniors will be able to have a18 better life.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So you're still a20 proponent of pushing the subsidy onto the landlord21 until the Council gets its act together .22 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	No, no,23 no, no.24 (Audience participation.)25 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	No .2 
2 We're not pushing - - we're not pushing it onto the3 landlord.	Because you know why?4 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Why?5 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	The equity6 of your property is going up.	We don't talk about7 that.8 MR. SCHLEIDER:	But you can't --9 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	Some day10 you're going to have a payday.	Some day that11 building you bought for $500,000 is going to be12 worth $2 million.	What about that payday? How13 much are you going to give back to the seniors?14 (Audience participation.)15 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	What are16 you going to do for the City?	You're going to17 walk away with $1.5 million .	That's what you're18 going to do.	Are you going to give it back to the19 hungry and the poor?20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	So what I'm21 hearing, all right, is that you're waiting for22 some landlord's future or prospective payday to do23 your work? I'm confused.24 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	No, no,25 no.10 
2 I'm doing the work right now.3 Because we came forward and increased SCRIE, okay.4 What work are you doing to help these tenants?5 Why do landlords get away with rundown buildings?6 You just heard this poor lady7 testify how she has all these leaks and problems8 in her building and the landlord refuses to help.9 What are you doing about that? How many times have10 you come down on those landlords that have hurt11 people?	Answer that question.12 (Audience participati on.)13 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	What did14 you do to come down on landlords that gives you a15 bad name?	Listen, there are many good landlords16 in the City.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for18 that.19 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	Don't get20 me wrong for that.	But what are you doing about21 the ones that are not helping out?22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Nobody on this23 Board condones illegal activities .	Unless you put24 teeth into this --25 (Audience participation.)2 
2 MR. SCHLEIDER:	mechanism that3 the City has in place to deal with it, again, it4 goes back to the Council .5 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	Well, you6 know what, you can throw it back to the Council7 all you want but there comes a point time in life8 when a landlord has to look at him or herself and9 say could I live my life like this knowing that I10 am hurting people; that ceilings in kitchens are11 falling on top of people and that they have to12 live in conditions that are unbearable.	That's13 what they have to look at.14 And you know what, we're doing15 everything in the City Council that we could16 possibly do and we're doing more.	We're not17 sitting back.	We're going up to Albany to try to18 get this renter's rebate.19 (Audience participation.)20 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	But there21 also comes a point in time - -22 MR . SCHLEIDER:	We suggest that you23 increase the amount.24 MR . LANGUEDOC:	Question.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Ron, go2 
2	ahead.3	MR. LANGUEDOC:	Hello, sir.4 You mentioned submetering and I'm a5 little bit aware of what's going on in your6 district in terms of submetering.7 Could you just talk a little bit8 more about that.	What effect - - what is9 submetering and what effect is it having on your10 constituents.11 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	The effect12 that it's having is now the tenants have an13 additional bill, okay?	They have this additional14 bill that they never had before, okay. And many15 seniors -- okay - - can't afford to pay this extra16 bill.	So what happens, they pay late.	Now they17 get late fees and they pay late.	They get18 additional late fees. Then before you know it19 they're going to turn off the electricity.20 They're going to turn it off.21 I mean this is - - what are we going22 to do about this? I mean submetering, it went23 through.	The seniors are living with it but it 1 s24 an extra bill .	It's something they never had to25 worry about because it was included in their rent.4 
2 And then let's talk about the air3 conditioners.	Nobody brought up the air4 conditioners, that if you have an air conditioner5 -- all right - - you have to pay more. You got to6 pay more to remove it, pay more to move it in, pay7 more to fix it and it gets complicated.8 And then the issue becomes of the9	common areas.	Who's paying for that and is that10 being correctly adjusted in this whole situation.11 So it's an additional bill that, you12 know, my senior citizens in my district never had13 to pay and now they do.14 MR . LANGUEDOC:	Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.16 MS. HOLDER:	I actually had a17 question.	I'm sorry.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure .19 MS . HOLDER:	Thank you for20 coming.	I really appreciate it .	I know how busy21 you all are.	I'd like to make a plug for our22 money.23 The Legal Aid Society would like to24 make sure that - - and Legal Services, please keep25 our money in the budget.10 
2 But thank you so much for  coming.3 Are you a rent regulated tenant or4 do you own?5 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	I own.6	MS. HOLDER:	You own?7 And how long have you lived in New8 York.9	COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	My whole10 life.11 MS. HOLDER:	Have you lived in12 your district or near your district?13 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	Yes. My14 whole life.15 MS. HOLDER:	What have you seen has16 been the trends and changes with the problems that17 rent regulated tenants face in your district in18 Coney Island?19 COUNCIL MEMBER RECCHIA:	Well, we20 have a large problem with landlords not fixing the21 apartments and rundown apartments, rundown22 buildings especially during the winter months.23 You know, let's face it, a lot of24 landlords they like to play with the hot water.25 You know, you make the hot water very - - during10 
2 the winter you make the hot water very hot so they3 use less hot water and they put more cold water on4 it . You know then what happens, people get5 burned.	That happens a lot .	You know, that's an6 old deal that these landlords play with. You know,7 they play with the boilers, they make it8 You know, I can go down the list of9 stories like that on what has happened . And we 1 re10 constantly out there.	I have someone in my11 office, a former Deputy Commissioner, just to work12 on housing problems because we have very large13 housing in my district, all kinds of housing.14 And the majority of my constituent15 work is dealing with housing, dealing the16 landlords and trying to get them to do the right17 thing.	Now, some of them are very good.	Some of18 them are not . I'm not saying every landlord is19 not, okay . But there comes a point in time when20 we have to say let's give everyone a time out for21 one year and then go forward from there.22 Thank you very much.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .24 MS .

My3 tenants live with bad conditions in Chinatown and4 they don't get the repairs that they need in their5 apartments.6 For example, we talked about heat7 and hot water and leaky - - water leaking from the8 piper earlier. But then there's also issues  of9 landlords turning off gas on purpose for months  at10 a time in order to try to evict their tenants.11 So going back to the water damage, a12 lot of the times the water damage comes from the13 top floors down to, let's say it's a six floor14 apartment, down to the fifth, fourth, third,15 second, first and it goes down to people's16 bedrooms onto their dressers, onto the  clothes17 that they wear, onto their beds and bed sheets.18 Many of the buildings have rat and19 rodent problems and they climb onto the bed and20 their -- we have seen cases where children are21 bitten and that a lot of tenants live in bad22 conditions.	But the landlords they'll only come23 on time to collect rent and not to do anything24 else. And they charge tenants for keys, for25 changing locks, for every little thing that they2 
1	1722 can.3 The gentrification that's happening4 in our community is exacerbating .	So, for5 example, on Essex Street we went into one building6 where it was all Chinese tenants before and now7 there's only 45 tenants that are Chinese.	When8 people are displaced, they have nowhere else to go9 except to live in other more overcrowded10 conditions or they have to move to the outer11 boroughs or out of state.	And this is very - - it12 has a huge impact on children and old people.13 In Chinatown Tenants Union we are14 against gentrification and we don't want our15 community to be displaced and so we're also asking16 that you guys do not increase rents.17 Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .19 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Question.20 MS. ADAMS:	Question.21 MR . LANGUEDOC:	Question.22 Could you describe what you mean23 about tenants being charged for keys.24 MR . SCHLEIDER:	You lose a key,25 you get charged.2 
1	1732	MR. LANGUEDOC:	What keys?3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Keys?4	MR. LANGUEDOC:	She mentioned that5 tenants are being charged for keys and I'd just6 like for her to describe what she means by that.7	MS . BIN LIANG:	So in the8 situations that we're talking about, a landlord9 charged $50 to get a key when they changed the10 locks in the building. And then there are other11 situations where a lot of the buildings in12 Chinatown are old tenement buildings and the13 wiring is old and they'll pass those costs onto14 the tenants when they - - when they make15 adjustments to the wiring	and anything else as16 well.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Like an MCI18 increase?19 MS. ADAMS:	Did you say $50?20 MS . BIN LIANG:	Yes, $50.21 MS . HOLDER:	Do you have anymore22 questions?	Okay .23 When you talk about some of the24 being gentrified out, are you saying that the25 apartments are going to people at much higher8 
2	rates, the rent, the monthly rent?3	MS. BIN LIANG:	So yes. We're4 seeing that tenants who pay us - - they pay rent5 for being in the apartment for many years. And6 then when they've been evicted, the new tenants7 that come in usually pay -- the apartments are8 usually deregulated and they pay over $2,000 .9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.12 Appreciate it.13 (Applause.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Roberta15 Bernstein;16 Janet Ziff; and17 Then we're going to take a break.18 We're going to take a break at two.19 So Roberta Bernstein;20 Janet Ziff; and21 Rafael Gomez Luna.22 That's the order.23 Roberta.24 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Thank you.25 Good afternoon, Chairman Markus and10 
2 other members of the Board.3 I'm Roberta Bernstein, President of4 the Small Property Owners of New York.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Roberta, you've6 got to talk louder .7 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	I'm Roberta8 Bernstein, President of the Small Property Owners9 of New York.10 We have over 1,000 members and I11 believe that they are darn good members who offer12 good service to their tenants and do care about13 their buildings . Many of us live in our14 buildings.15 It is not to our best interest to16 under or overheat water.	By the way, I learned a17 lot. I had no idea I could save money by18 overheating water. I learned something.19 There is something else that was20 said which may be confusing.	When a tenant gets a21 SCRIE, his rent is frozen. It doesn't matter what22 increase or deduction he gets.	His rent is23 leveled. He pays no more.24 You're not going to see many owners25 here today because they really don't think that2 
2 what they say will have any impact on your3 decision.4 We've had a 5.1 increase in5 operating costs this year.	It looks like it's6 going to eight-and-a-half.	You know, when you7 take an average of your projected guidelines of8 three-and-a-quarter and 7.75, that's9	five-and-a-half percent . We really need that for10 a one-year increase and nothing less.11 Now, there's no reason why we should12 continue to shoulder the bulk of increased13 operating costs and tenants should pay their fair14 share. If you are going to base your decision on15 what tenants can afford, you're only looking at16 half the picture .17 We can't absorb more operating costs18 without cutting back on some type of service and19 maintenance.	Now, we're not looking for a20 windfall and a windfall 50 years from now of $221 million does not make a difference today.	We're22 looking for the opposite.	We're trying to keep23 our buildings and keep afloat.24 Now, the last ten years the25 guidelines that have been passed have been10 
2 approximately half of what the PIOC has been. Can3 tenants afford an increase?	It seems that they4 can especially when the average rent stabilized5 tenant's burden is 25 percent of his income, and6 long term tenants is 22.3.	The national average7	is 29.8.8	Needy tenants and pecunious tenants,9 senior citizens, have a bunch of programs they can10 rely on.	You do them a favor if you could just11 produce a list of all the places they can go for12 relief and hand it to them should they  complain.13 Another thing that should not impact14 on your decision is preferential rents. While some15 owners don't collect legal rents, plenty of others16 in the outer boroughs are not getting it and  your17 increases are critical.18 We are therefore, asking for the19 following guidelines:20 A one-year at five-and-a-half;21 A two-year at 9.5; and22 A rent adjustment of six percent for23 all rents under $600.24 Thank you very much.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 
2	MS . ADAMS:	I have a question.3	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair? If you4	don't mind.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes. Go ahead,6 Mr. Schleider .7 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Thank you,8 Roberta for your testimony.	Roberta?9	MS. ADAMS:	I have a question.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question. A11 couple of questions.12 Mr. Schleider and then Ms. Adams.13 Go ahead, Mr. Schleider.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	In your15 organization, what's the typical sized building16 that your constituency --17 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	About18 twelve units.19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	About twelve20 units.21 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	That would22 be the average.23 MR. SCHLEIDER:	Right.24 Do you feel that -- I mean you're25 pretty well familiar, I see, with the staff10 
2 reports and the data.3 Do you feel that this 12-unit4 building size is adequately reflected or5 represented in these numbers or is there something6 particular about the smaller sized buildings that7 is more, or let's say more expensive to run?8	MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Yes, I9	think so.10 I think that when you have a larger11 building, you have a staff.	That makes things12 pretty easy.	You 've got a janitor who cleans .13 You've got a handyman.	For we smaller owners who14 live in our buildings, which I do, I have to go15 out and I have to look for a roofer, an16 electrician and they like the bigger jobs, quite17 frankly.18 And we pay more for the smaller job19 because they're not geared.	They'd rather have a20 larger - - a larger job that they can make more21 money than a smaller job and so they have22 increased their increases.	That's not reflected.23 Also their gas has increased.	Just24 getting to the job we are charged for that . They25 are giving us surcharges on top of their visit and10 
2 their call and, of course, the materials and3 labor.4	MR. SCHLEIDER:	And because you're5 a small owner, you're not getting the same type of6 credit arrangements that large owners are getting7 so you're - -8	MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	This is so9	true.10 MR. SCHLEIDER:	- - COD, so you11 have to have the money on hand.12 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Money on13 hand.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	All right. And that15 could be expensive if you have to borrow that16 money.17 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Yes.	I'm a18 pretty good owner. I mean you can look me up.19 You'll find no violations.	You know, I run a20 tight ship .21 And I got to tell you, things are22 getting pretty, pretty bad.	Fuel, just name it .23 We just had a main coming into the building,  an24 electric main burn up.	We don't know if it was25 the snow, salt.	And Con Ed just ran a temporary10 
2 line to my building.	We didn't expect this. I'm3 looking at a $7,000 bill just to maintain4 electric.	They have a shunt over the sidewalk. I5 don't know what to do.6 And I'm a smaller owner. I don't7 have a reserve.	I basically live from month to8 month. I personally, you know, just take minimal9 to suit my own living costs.	My tenants -- my10 door is open.	I'm friendly with them all. I think11 that small owners are a breed apart.12 You know, was I offered a lot for my13 buildings? Yes, just recently, I must tell you, I14 was shocked. My husband would love me to retire15 and get out and sell.	But you know what, I love16 what I do. I love New York. I want to stay. That17 money means nothing to me.	I am a part of my18 community every bit as much as my tenants.	I want19 to be here. I want to perform a service which I20 and other small owners do. We really do. We're the21 backbone of our communities.22 MR. SCHLEIDER:	We applaud you for23 that.24 MS . HOLDER:	I have a question.25 MS. ADAMS:	Question.2 
2 MS. HOLDER:	I have - - I'm sorry.	I3 have a question.4 (Applause .)5 MS. ADAMS:	Excuse me.6 Earlier - - well, first off, where7 are you in New York?	Where are you located?8 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Just below9 Harlem.	106th Street - - 96th Street . I'm sorry,10 that area.11 MS. ADAMS :	And how large - - how12 many units in your building?13 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	I have 40.14 I have four small buildings .15 MS. ADAMS:	Okay. And one last16 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Four ten-unit17 buildings?18 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Yes.19 MS . ADAMS :	And one last question.20 You mentioned in your testimony that21 22 percent of people -- that there was some group22 of people who were spending 22 percent of their23 income on housing .	I didn't get it all.	Who are24 they?25 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Oh, yes.2 
2 That would be the long-term, rent3 stabilized tenant is spending 22.5 percent of4 their income on rent which is way below the5 national average .6	MS. ADAMS:	Right. And that's what7 they're spending in your buildings or where is8 this happening?9	MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Oh, gee, I10 don't know.	I don't know.11 I try to -- you know, I try to keep12 -- I don't give a high increase. I try and keep my13 rents - - I want to keep my tenants in place. If14 they're good -- and I'm not your typical owner in15 the sense that I have no rents that are over16 $2,000. I have no rents that are over $1,500, in17 fact.	So I don't do any kind of income18 verification other than if they can pass the19 initial application for the apartments. So I20 really could not answer your question.21 Do my tenants pay that? I think22 they're probably paying that or less.23 MS . ADAMS:	Okay. Where did this24 figure come from?25 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN :	The PIOC.10 
2	The Housing and Vacancy survey.3	MS. ADAMS:	Okay.	Thank you.4	MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	In fact, I5 think Dr. Robert Salzman, who is the consultant6 that's been hired by this Board7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	RSA.	No, not8 this Board, by RSA.9 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	I'm sorry.10 RSA 1  s Board.	Has studied it.	I've looked at it .11 I've studied it .	He's analyzed it and we glean12 those data, those figures from the data from the13 Housing and Vacancy survey .14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank you.15 MS. HOLDER:	Okay. I have a16 question.	I'm sorry.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Sure.18 MS. HOLDER:	So what is the19 definition of a small building owner like for you20 or for you21 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Oh, somebody22 like me who lives and works on the building, who23 doesn't have outside management who maybe owns one24 building or inherited one building from  the25 parents.10 
2 But the difference is we 1 re there.3 We're a face.	We 1  re not somebody out there they4 mail to a post office box or have to make a phone5 call. We are a physical presence in the6 neighborhood.	We care.	We own maybe - - I would7 be considered large/small owner with four little8 buildings.  They're all walk-ups.9	MS. HOLDER :	I mean is there just,10 in terms of your definition or for your11 organization, is there like a unit number that we12 can use - -13 MS. ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Well, you14 know it 1  s a funny thing . We don 1 t really have a15 cutoff.	If somebody - - I mean the state's16 definition is 50 or fewer. So if somebody has 5117 units, you know, when you count up the little18 buildings, we're not going to say you can't be a19 member.20 One of our owners actually owns one21 building with 120 units but that's all. The22 grandfather built the building.	He lives in it .23 He manages it . That's a small owner. So we have24 like a definition with a little flexibility.25 MS . HOLDER:	Okay.	Thank you.10 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3 MS . ROBERTA BERNSTEIN:	Thank you .4 (Applause.)5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Janet Ziff;6 Rafael Gomez Luna;7 Regina Shanley;8	Let me indicate it pays to sign up.9 So these are the people that signed up . We' re up10 to speaker -- Janet Ziff is speaker 19.	We have11 at this point no additional owners, but I'm sure12 they will be coming.13 So we're doing 19, 20 and 21 so it14 does pay to sign up because we're taking the order15 of sign up .16 Janet Ziff .17 MS. JANET ZIFF:	Thank you for18 letting me speak.19 You have an awesome responsibility20 in determining the fate of over a million21 households.	And I wish I could be a fly on the22 wall when you deliberate because quite frankly, to23 us it 1 s -- your decisions seems arbitrary and24 capricious.	We hear the median income of renters25 is $32,000 a year and yet landlords earn an9 
2	average of 35 percent in profits.3	For example, landlords claim fuel is4 a major expense and tenants such as myself get5 only half a percent differential in the rent6 increase when we pay our own fuel. I only ask for7 fairness.8 (Applause. )9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 On that, we'll ask the staff to do11 the analysis we do every year on the question of12 fuel, you know, whatever the tenant pays their own13 fuel.	So we can take a look at that before we14 make our final decision.15 Rafael Gomez Luna.	Mr. Luna, are16 you here?17 MR. RAFAEL GOMEZ LUNA :	Yes.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Followed by Regina19 Shanley;20 Followed by Adele Bender.21 MR. RAFAEL GOMEZ LUNA:	Hello,22 everyone.23 My name is Rafael Gomez Luna. I'm a24 housing advocate for Northern Manhattan.	And I25 was here last year for the forums that we had . And10 
2 it was kind of sad to see the last day we really3 got a point that we were not behaving in a civic4 way, in a way that we wouldn't like our kids to5 behave in the future by making so much noise, by6 disrespecting one another. And it was kind of sad7 and I feel apologetic for that.8 I've been doing housing activism and9 organizing tenants associations in Northern10 Manhattan for over a year. And I can say that I'm11 a little new at this.	It's not like I am an12 expert. So I decided to study where the problem13 was coming from. And I started going to different14 housing forums and Downtown and different15 universities to understand where the problem was16 coming from .17 And what I understood is that the18 economic boon in New York City right now is real19 estate.	And the administration is pushing to make20 New York City "the city" of the planet. And that's21 all great.22 But we an assisted community which23 has been here for 20 or 30 years going through the24 hard times when New York was neglected, when New25 York was the pits.	And they went through all2 
2 that. They didn't have repairs. They didn't have3 good schools, they didn't have this and that. And4 now that New York is coming up, now that New York5 is becoming what it's supposed to be, we are being6 pushing out.7 And then coming over here is like8 seeing the administration pinpointing, you know,9 putting a provider, which is the land owner, a10 person that got into business in order to make11 money, which is the American way and Iunderstand12 that. You become a landlord and you want to make a13 profit and Iunderstand that 100 percent all of14 it.15 But the administration have to16 provide the developers, the landlords with the17 circumstance so they can make money, but at the18 same time you have to provide safety for the life19 of the people who live in New York City.20 I think that coming here and21 fighting one another is -- we not really doing22 anything. You know, the administration, starting23 at the government, at the state level and  City24 level, has to provide the circumstance for us to25 be happy and to keep New York, you know, like the2 
1	1902 beginning of the American dream.	And I hope you3 know, that they do something about it.4 Thank you very much.5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Question.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Question.8	MR. LANGUEDOC:	Hello, sir.	Thank9	you for your testimony.	I appreciate it.10 I'd just like to ask you,  there's11 been some suggestion by some people who have12 testified today that the Board should  consider13 adopting some kind of, I guess a supplemental14 increase for tenants whose rents are relatively15 lower than others.	Like I think one person used a16 figure of $800.17 I guess the way it would work is if18 your rent is below $800, when you get a renewal19 lease, your rent would go up by some amount. I20 think someone said $50.21 I was wondering, what do you think22 about that and what effect do you think it would23 have on the people that you work with in Northern24 Manhattan?25 MR. RAFAEL GOMEZ LUNA:	Well, most10 
1	1912 of the people work in organizing tenant3 associations, they happen to be elderly people who4 live on fixed incomes.	So any little help that5 they can get, especially now with the medications6 going up and it's like they have to stop eating in7 order to pay another bill. Any little help that8 they can get is important.9 But is it going to fix the problem?10 Because the problem is not only them. Even, you11 know, young kids who just graduated from college,12 they have to move like three or four in one13 apartment because they cannot afford to pay the14 rent.15 People who graduated from college16 ten years ago and have some experience, they got17 roommates and I don't think that's the American18 dream. You know, I wouldn 't like to graduate from19 college and work for ten years and have to have a20 roommate . That is not ideal.21 So we really - - the government has22 to make the study, design and implement a plan23 that can really create solutions because that is24 the purpose of government - collecting taxes and25 making sure that we all can function and have a2 
1	1922 hope.	Because once we lose hope, the rich and the3 poor and everybody is going to get screwed, with4 due all respect . Because once you lose hope, you5 lose decency, and just crime would skyrocket .6 So any help is good. But the most7 important thing is to fix the problem .8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair?10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Yes . Mr.11 Schleider.12 MR. SCHLEIDER :	Thank you for your13 testimony.	Thank you for what you're doing.14 But I have a question .	Are you a15 housing advocate or a tenant advocate?	I mean16 and I ask this for a reason.17 MR . RAFAEL GOMEZ LUNA:	I would say18 I'm a people's advocate .19 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That's fine .20 MR. RAFAEL GOMEZ LUNA:	Because I21 don't have anything against a - - I wish I could be22 a landlord one day because I am a painter.23 Wouldn' t it be nice to live in a house where I24 have another house that would pay my bills .25 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That would be10 
1	19 32	terrific.3	MR. RAFAEL GOMEZ LUNA:	So I don't4 have nothing against, you know, money-making. It's5 just that we have to compromise .	We have to make6 things work for both parties. That's the only way .7	MR. SCHLEIDER:	Which is great.8 Now, do you think if there was an9 increase in the housing supply, that would relieve10 some of the pressure on pricing?	On some of these11 seminars that you've gone to, has anything  like12 that come up?13	MR. RAFAEL GOMEZ LUNA:	Well, it14 definitely would help but it creates a little15 problem .	What about - - it's like the people will16 be displaced.17 MR. SCHLEIDER:	No, no, no, no .18 Not necessarily.	Not necessarily. I19 don't know if you've seen this, but this is a20 report by (indicating) the Borough President's21 office, Scott Stringer where he identified vacant22 lots, underutilized properties, vacant properties23 to help supplement the housing supply.	Maybe, you24 know, you can take something like this maybe work25 with the Borough President's office and try to14 
2 lend some advocacy that way too. But that might be3 helpful.4	MR. RAFAEL GOMEZ LUNA:	Well, if5 the City decides to build affordable housing, it6 would really alleviate the problem .	The thing is7 that remember that we're living in a housing boom 8	so - -9	MR. SCHLEIDER:	No, Iunderstand10 that.11 MR. RAFAEL GOMEZ LUNA:	- - they not12 building affordable housing . They're building13 condos with a 20 percent affordable housing which14 starts at - -15 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That's not16 entirely true.17 But this goes beyond what the18 Bloomberg Administration has proposed so maybe you19 want to take a look at it .20 MR. RAFAEL GOMEZ LUNA:	I have to21 look into it.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .23 MR . RAFAEL GOMEZ LUNA:	Thank you.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 MR. LANGUEDOC:	Thank you, sir.10 
2	(Applause .)3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Regina Shanley;4 Followed by Adele Bender;5 Followed by Allen Weinstein.6	MS. HOLDER:	For the record we'd7 like to just state as tenant members that we're8 both housing and tenant advocates.9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What?10 MS. HOLDER:	For the record - - I11 said for the record we'd like to just state that12 we're not only tenant advocates, we're housing13 advocates too.	We advocate for housing.14 MR. SCHLEIDER:	That's fine.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And for the16 record, Mr. Schleider and Ms. Cruz would like to17 state that they're not only owner reps, but18 they're also housing reps.19 MS. HOLDER:	Right. So that's great.20 MR. SCHLEIDER:	And I have a21 record to prove it.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	So everybody23 agrees .24 MS. REGINA SHANLEY:	Good25 afternoon.10 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The only3 troublemakers are the public members .4 Excuse me . Go ahead. Sorry, Regina .5 Go ahead.6 MS. REGINA SHANLEY:	Good7 afternoon.8	My name is Regina Shanley.	I'm a9 rent stabilized tenant who lives in Sunnyside,10 Woodside, Long Island City where they all blur in11 Queens .12 MS. ADAMS:	You live where, I'm13 sorry?14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Sunnyside.15 MS. REGINA SHANLEY:	Woodside,16 Sunnyside, Long Island City. They sort of blur17 together in that part of Queens.18 After a recent preliminary meeting19 of this Board, a landlord overheard my talking20 about too high rents and said to me I should just21 leave New York. I was born in New York City and22 where my parents and grandparents and I don't want23 to leave my home .  As I thought about his comment,24 I realized the many differences between me as a25 tenant and landlords in general.9 
2 For one, I will open my books to3 you, my expenses and my income.	My income is $7104 a month on Social Security Disability.	My rent,5 of course, is my biggest expense, $520, which is6 73.24 percent approximately of my income.	This7 rent is, with the help of DRIE, the Disability8 Rent Increase Exemption and which only took effect9 this month.	My last gas and electric bill was $5910 and change. My last phone bill was about $30.11 After these are paid I have about12 $100 for clothing, shoes, transportation, laundry,13 toothpaste, deodorant, necessities whose prices14 add up quickly. I do receive food stamps so I can15 eat.16 The landlord doesn't open his books.17 He just complains year after year, for as long as18 I can remember, that he can't continue losing19 money because of the minorly (phonetic) rent20 increases ordered by the Board .21 I represent tens of thousands of22 tenants, senior citizens, fixed incomes -- on23 fixed incomes, young people with first jobs, young24 Police Officers, librarian, et cetera, couples25 wishing to start a family.2 
2 All are being hurt by escalating3 rents . The landlord represents other landlords,4 many of whom also appear every year complaining5 about their difficulties making any profit on6 their buildings because the Board votes for such7 low rent increase.8	Who makes more sense?	Tenants needs9 a home . It is essential . Housing is not a luxury.10 Tenant testimony is based on real fears of losing11 their homes . Landlords own a building or12 buildings.	Many of them come to the Rent13 Guidelines Board year after year with the same14 complaint that they can't keep up with the15 expenses involved in owning a building when the16 rent increases are so small.17 Tenants needing a home have no18 recourse.	They pay increased rents sometimes19 instead of buying medicine or nutritional food.20 Landlords can sell their buildings or their21 building or buildings.22 In business, a company that loses23 money is eliminated.	Not in the landlord24 business.	They cry about losses for years but do25 nothing.	Landlords could, but don't open their9 
2 books.	Maybe they don't want the Board and the3 public to know how much profit they actually make.4 I hope the members of this Board open their ears5 and eyes and realize that tenants really are6 hurting.7 Vote for zero, zero rent increase.8	Thank you.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 (Applause.)11	MR.

1	2002 You know, among the very burning3 issues in this City, if not the country, are4 health and housing.	And I have to tell you the5 housing situation, unless you have an income of6 over $200,00 or $300,000, is in very, very bad7 health.8 Any so-called affordable housing9 that the average person, working person or a10 senior, not all who can qualify for SCRIE or DRIE,11 are really, really hurting, and that rental, that12 type of affordable rental is disappearing.	There13 are Mitchell-L ama buyouts. There are the a lot of14 co-opers, a lot of co-ops, a lot of condos, and as15 I say, affordable rents that average people can16 afford to pay is fast disappearing.17 There is nothing to replace it. And18 if your rents keeps going up, where do you go from19 there?	There are no other places to go. I get20 when I go and make a presentation at a senior21 center, and if I say I'm going to speak on22 housing, right away they all are running up to me23 and saying, do you have something for me, I'm24 desperate.
