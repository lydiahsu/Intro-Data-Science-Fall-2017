2	P R O C E E D I N    G S 3 4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Good morning 5 everyone.	I’ d like to get started .	I apologize 6 for the delay.	We ’ re trying to get the sound 7 system set up here .8 I’ d like to welcome you to this 9 public hearing of the New York City  Rent 10 Guidelines Board.11 My name is Jonathan Kimmel ,12 Chairman.13 This is the second of two  public 14 hearings for comments regarding the  proposed 15 guidelines adopted by this board on May  3 rd.	The 16 final vote on the adjustments to rent  stabilized 17 renewal leases will be held here in the Great   Hall 18 at Cooper Union, 7 East 7 th Street , on Monday,19 June 27 th.	It ’ s a week from today starting at 20	5 : 30 .21 To my board members, drafts  of 22 the hotel and apartment explanatory statements  are 23 in your folders. And we’ d like your comments  or 24 suggested additions to the staff no later  than 25 June 24 th.21 
2 Before we begin our hearing,3 which we anticipate will be a long one , I’ d  like 4 to just review some of the speaking rules  today.5 We have a  countdown clock.	We ’ re 6 going to ask that speakers try to keep   their 7 comments to the allotted three  minutes .	When 8 there’ s 30 seconds left, you will hear a  beep.9 Try to bring your comments to a   close.10 We have over 100 speakers 11 registered today so this will  go on.	Any 12 questions from the board will not count  towards 13 your allotted time , but we are going to ask  that 14 you try to stay within your  three minutes.	If I15 do interrupt you, it is not to be rude , it is   to 16 try and stay on  schedule.17 In order to get started  today,18 we ’ re going to change some of the order because 19 we do have two elected officials who I ’ d like 20 to start with, the first, Congressman  Jerrold 21 Nadler .22 ( Applause. )23 CONGRESSMAN NADLER :	Thank you 24 for the opportunity to speak at this  public 25 hearing.2 
2 I’ m here today to represent my 3 constituents in the 8 th Congressional District in 4 Brooklyn and Manhattan . This district is composed 5 largely of tenants who already allocate too a   high 6 percentage of their incomes towards the payment  of 7 rent.	A great many of them reside in  rent 8 stabilized apartments and, as such , rent 9 stabilization is a vitally important issue .10 On May 3 rd , the board proposed 11 increases for rent stabilized apartments of 3 to   512 and- three- quarter percent for one- year lease 13 renewals, 6 to 9 percent for two- year renewals  and 14 the fuel adjustment surcharge of one percent  for 15 fuel oil buildings .	I ’ m very dismayed by these 16 proposals.17 The board in its final vote  next 18 Monday must not enact these exorbitant  increases.19 The guidelines the RGB has proposed  are 20 significantly higher than last year’ s increases of 21 2 and- a- quarter and 4 and- a- half percent for one 22 and two years.23 Even if the increases ultimately 24 approved are at the low end of the   proposed 25 ranges , that they will still be too high and  they 2 
2 would have bad consequences for the more than  one 3 million low and middle income rent  stabilized 4 residents of New York City who already face   a5 crisis of affordability and cost of  living 6 increases.7 The 2011 Income and Affordability 8 Study reports that New York City’ s economy 9 remained fairly stable during 2010 .	We must be 10 realistic about what this means for the  majority 11 of New York residents.	Though 2010 brought the 12 creation of 14 , 000 new jobs, other evidence shows 13 that most New Yorkers have yet to feel   these 14 benefits.	The fact is that many New Yorkers  are 15 still struggling to make ends meet .16 The unemployment rate rose for 17 the third consecutive year and the number of   food 18 stamps and cash assistance recipients  have 19 increased.20 These excessive rent increases 21 that have been proposed come at the worst  possible 22 time and are certain to be an overwhelming  burden 23 for the tenants.24 Building owners claim that rising 25 operating costs necessitate the proposed  rent 2 
2 increases.	But the year 2011 Price Index  of 3 Operating Costs reports that the cost to  operate 4 and maintain rent stabilized apartments  increased 5 6 . 1 percent from last year , due mostly to increase 6 in fuel costs for which you’ ve proposed a  separate 7 increase.8 However, excluding fuel costs,9 other components of the PIOC saw only  modest 10 increases or even decreases.	Real estate taxes 11 rose only three and- a- half percent , which is the 12 lowest increase since 2008 and insurance  costs 13 actually decreased .	While there were small 14 increases in operating costs for landowners,  their 15 profits far outweighed expenses.	A more accurate 16 reflection of the revenue costs and the  revenues 17 and costs of rent stabilized properties are  found 18 in the owners net operating income .19 The 2011 Income and Expense  Study 20 reports that the NOI of landowners increased – -21 increased 5 . 8 percent, according to the most 22 recent data available, while expenses rose only . 123 percent, one- tenth of one percent.24 Since 1990 , landlords net 25 operating income has increased 16 . 3 percent after 2 
2 adjustment for inflation, indicating that 3 landowners income historically outpaces operating 4 costs.5 Considering the still fragile 6 cost of the national and local economies, it  is 7 unacceptable that the Rent Guidelines Board  has 8 proposed these exorbitant rent increases that  far 9 exceed the income in that –- operating  costs.10 I strongly oppose these  increases 11 which are just too high for the low and   moderate 12 income residents who live in rent  regulated 13 apartments .	Many of these tenants , who continue 14 to struggle through the worst economy we  have 15 since the Great Depression , simply do not have  the 16 means to comply with these increases.	If these 17 rates are allowed, you will see a great number   of 18 tenants driven out of their apartments and  likely 19 out of New York  City.20 In the end , protecting tenants in 21 rent regulated apartments benefits everyone.22 Without a safe and affordable home , it ’ s much 23 harder to find a job, keep kids in school   and 24 remain healthy .	Rent stabilized housing allows 25 for diversity of experience, background,  culture 2 
2 and income that adds to the richness of our   City.3 I urge the board to heed  the 4 figures presented in its own studies and  other 5 independent reports which clearly indicate  that 6 the proposed rent increases are not  warranted.7 I hope you will reconsider  them 8 and that the new increases will come in below   the 9 minimum level that you –- of the ranges that   you 10 propose as would be indicated by your own   studies.11 I thank you for  your 12 consideration.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,14 Congressman.15 Are there question ?16 ( No response.)17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	None.18 Thank you for taking the  time.19 CONGRESSMAN NADLER :	Thank you.20 ( Applause. )21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	City Council 22 Speaker, Christine Quinn.23 ( Applause. )24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I do know that 25 the Speaker has –- is on a very tight   schedule 2 
2 today with things going on in Albany, so she   has 3 already advised me that if she needs to run   out,4 that she will be leaving staff people here for   any 5 issues to be brought back to  her.6 So thank you.7 SPEAKER QUINN:	Thank you , very 8 much.	I really appreciate that.9 Thank you for giving me  the 10 opportunity to speak and testify here today  and 11 thank you for being so accommodating about  my 12 schedule.13 I believe now, as I have for   the 14 past three years, that while our economy  is 15 suffering and low- income residents are bearing the 16 worst of the effects, we should do what we can   to 17 minimize any cost increases to working  families.18 For the last two years , my calls 19 for the rent – - a rent freeze have not  been 20 implemented.21 As the economy has  barely 22 improved, this year, I believe , we need as  small 23 an increase as possible.	In fact, it is  my 24 opinion that a one percent increase is the   most 25 our tenants can bear.2 
2 But not only is a one  percent 3 increase the most renters can afford, I   also 4 believe it ’ s fair for owners.	Even in a bad 5 economy building owners have been doing  quite 6 well.	Net operating income, the amount of  money 7 received by owners after expenses, by reports,  has 8 gone up consistently.9 As reports indicate, it’ s10 increased by 5 . 8 percent in 2009 and has averaged 11 a 7 . 4 percent increase over the last four years.12 In fact, net operating income in 2009 was $ 362  per 13 unit in rent stabilized buildings. This means  the 14 average building of 45 units will have $ 194 , 000 15 available after paying operating costs , this,16 while the average household has seen their  income 17 decrease three percent since 2005 .18 Now, clearly, I understand that 19 many owners have smaller buildings , but data shows 20 that there is consistent progress financially  in 21 those buildings as well.	The average rent 22 regulated building owner spends 63 cents of  every 23 dollar on revenue –- of revenue, excuse me ,  on 24 operating costs.	This means 37 percent of  their 25 revenue is available for profit, financing  or 2 

2	re - investments .3
Buildings with less than 11 
4 units, spend slightly more , 65 cents of every 5 dollar on operating costs, with 35  percent 6 available after that.7 But beyond the many income  and 8 expense measures, there’ s a specific measure 9 designed to help us figure out an  appropriate 10 increase – - or the Rent Guidelines Board to  figure 11 out an appropriate increase.12 Each year the Rent  Guidelines 13 Board staff puts together a commensurate  rent 14 adjustment .	This adjustment is the amount  needed 15 for owners to maintain their current net  operating 16 income .	In the past, particularly between  2000 17 and 2008 , the Rent Guidelines Board passed 18 increases in line with  this measure.	But in the 19 last two years , the board has passed increases 20 well above this measure.21 To come back to an increase  in 22 line with the average CRA over the last   three 23 years, the board should pass, as I said, no   more 24 than a one percent  increase.25 And I thank you for all  for 4 
2 giving me the opportunity to testify today .3 ( Applause. )4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,5 Speaker Quinn.6 Are there question from board 7 members?8 MS . HOLDER :	Have a question .9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Holder.10 MS . HOLDER :	Speaker Quinn, it’ s11 always a pleasure.12 Thank you so much.	I know how 13 busy you are and I appreciate you taking the   time 14 to testify today.15 When you look at the  increases 16 that have been taken, and especially in light  of 17 our loss in Casado -- and I appreciate   your 18 leadership with tenants in the City -- what is   it 19 that you’ re seeing in terms of affordability with 20 tenants and what’ s coming to your attention in 21 terms of how tenants are  fairing?22 SPEAKER QUINN:	Well, what we’ re 23 seeing consistently - and we would be happy   at 24 some point to share this data with folks on   the 25 Rent Guidelines Board staff, because we now  track 2 
2 all of the constituent e- mails , calls, whatever,3 our district offices get - topping the  chart,4 significantly, is housing and the number of  calls 5 our staff –- our staffs in all 51 offices   are 6 getting about tenants who are fearing eviction ,7 threatened with evictions, can ’ t find affordable 8 housing, the top call we get out of any call   we 9 get in all of our offices is, how do I    find 10 affordable housing .	So we ’ re seeing those numbers 11 just go up and up and  up.12 And we ’ re hearing, because in 13 addition to the marriage and rent votes in  Albany,14 this is also the week where we will come to   an 15 agreement on the City’ s budget .	And we’ re also 16 hearing clear reports on that process from  folks 17 who represent tenants in court or do advocacy  or 18 tenant organizing, that their dockets, so  to 19 speak, are just more packed than they have  ever 20 been.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Adams.22 MS . ADAMS:	Welcome.	It’ s always 23 good to see you.24 SPEAKER QUINN:	Thank you, Ms.25 Adams.2 
2 MS . ADAMS:	I was hoping that  you 3 would be able to share with us some things   that 4 have been underway , probably in the last year  by 5 the –- your colleagues , with having to do  more 6 with those departments that have  responsibility 7 for the housing conditions that people live in .8 Complaints about not enough heat, not enough  this,9 not about the other -- and there are a number   of 10 tenants in rent stabilized housing where that  is 11 the case and they’ re not getting the kind  of 12 response that they want.13 SPEAKER QUINN:	Yeah, I mean,14 this past year the Mayor and I , in response to  a15 particular challenge that a lot of rent  stabilized 16 tenants are having , you know, we’ ve all heard a17 great deal of conversation about foreclosures  as 18 it relates to one and two- family homes , which is 19 appropriate, but not as much nationally about  as 20 it relates to multi- unit buildings .21 And we have a phenomenon in  New 22 York, maybe as many as 200 , 000 units that are in 23 rental buildings, vast , vast majority of those 24 rent protected buildings where they were  bought 25 with loans that should never have  been given.	The 2 
2 owners who bought them , probably with the 3 expectation of flipping them, walked away  from 4 them.	The banks now own them.	They’ ve fallen 5 into terrible states of disrepair.6 In some, as a case in the   Bronx,7 we were able to work out a new purchase   that 8 really has the buildings headed towards a   much 9 sounder future .	But in an effort to try to get   to 10 these buildings early before things are really ,11 you know, past a terrible point, within HPD  we 12 created a new unit or a subunit called   the 13 Proactive Prevention Unit.	And they are working 14 with the Department of Finance and banks and  other 15 places to identify buildings before they are  past 16 the point of no return , so to speak, so they  can 17 intervene earlier.18 Because what we found when  we 19 were dealing with the Millbank portfolio in  the 20 Bronx, is the tenants there were kind of so   --21 given up, they weren’ t calling 311 . Because what 22 we didn’ t understand was, as bad as  those 23 buildings were , why weren’ t they falling under the 24 Safe Housing Law, which gives the 200  worst 25 buildings in the City by Code violation,  extra 2 
2 inspections, extra attention, a program that  was 3 –- has worked quite well and we were able   to 4 develop with input from tenants and from the  RSA 5 and others . It ’ s because the tenants were just not 6 calling.	They had kind of given  up.7 So we knew we had to go out   and 8 that has been successful in helping us  identify 9 these portfolios earlier on.	And then , also,10 giving us an opportunity to do some organizing  to 11 try to get better owners to do the   buying.12 MS . ADAMS:	Thank you.13 SPEAKER QUINN:	You’ re welcome.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Steve, you’ re 15 up .16 MR . SCHLEIDER:	I ’ m sorry .17 Steve Schleider.18 SPEAKER QUINN:	Good morning.19 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Always nice to 20 see you.21 SPEAKER QUINN:	Nice to see you.22 MR . SCHLEIDER:	( Inaudible.)23 SPEAKER QUINN:	They’ ve cut you 24 off.25 MR . SCHLEIDER:	All ready .2 
2 ( Laughter. )3 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Twenty- two 4 minutes into the meeting, I’ m done .5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	No, on cue.6 SPEAKER QUINN:	I didn’ t say 7 anything.	I’ m just saying .8 MR . SCHLEIDER:	I know.	I know.9 ( Laughter. )10 MR . SCHLEIDER:	I understand that 11 the City budget isn’ t completed as yet and for  the 12 past few years there’ s been difficulty trying to 13 balance the budget because the source  revenues 14 have not really kept up with  the expenses.	And 15 federal stimulus money is not  –-16 SPEAKER QUINN:	Correct.17 MR . SCHLEIDER:	It’ s a more 18 difficult process now.	But there are two  taxes 19 based on the sale of property, mortgage  recording 20 and real property transfer tax collapse, so  we 21 really don ’ t have that to look on with the –-  fill 22 in sort of the gap .23 There’ s a notable exception for 24 the property tax rules , the property tax, real 25 estate property tax, commercial rent tax,  which 2 
2 has tabled commercial rent tax right now, but  as 3 you see revenues increasing with this  upcoming 4 budget so that we can have –- and you can   leave 5 one property taxes ?6 SPEAKER QUINN:	You know, one of 7 the problems with the way –- and I don ’ t have  to 8 tell you this, the City’ s property tax  is 9 structured is you, you know, we’ re in down  –-10 we ’ re still right in a down market now , but the 11 way it lags in , you’ re paying –- your kind of 12 implemented, so to speak, assessments from  when 13 times were better when times were bad –- in   times 14 now that are bad, so it’ s kind of the ultimate ,15 you know, kick in the tookas, quite  frankly,16 because things aren’ t good and there’ s this lag in 17 the system .18 So it’ s –- and on top of  that,19 the way the system is structured, which needs  to 20 be dealt with, as complicated as that’ s going  to 21 be is, it doesn’ t –- it always seems that  your 22 actual bill is going up even if the rate has   held 23 constant.	And even in the one –- a few   years 24 where we’ ve taken the rent down, you really don’ t25 necessarily see that same thing in the  bill.2 
2 Now that said, rent –- I’ m sorry,3 revenue projection are not strong enough to put  us 4 in a position where we can contemplate taking   down 5 the property tax rate this year.	Some have 6 suggested we raise it, which is something I   would 7 not consider, but they ’ re not at a point where we 8 could think about taking it down.	Usually at this 9 point in the process, the Council’ s revenue 10 forecasters do their own forecast.11 Usually at this point in  the 12 process, not because our forecasters are  better,13 though they are, but because we have more  data .14 We have a different forecast than the  Mayor,15 usually ones that sees more  revenues.16 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Um- hum.17 SPEAKER QUINN:	Not really .	I18 mean, ours is, you know, maybe slightly up   from 19 the Mayor’ s and the Mayor’ s from prelim to exec,20 was about 160 or $ 200 million up, which in  the 21 scheme of things, is just about  flat.22 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Right .23 SPEAKER QUINN:	So this won’ t be 24 the year for that.25 That said, I want to  mention 2 
2 something which is not exactly on point for   your 3 buildings, but I do think is a step in the   right 4 direction.	There was quite an uproar this  year 5 around co- ops and condos and the mishandling of 6 their assessment by the Department of  Finance,7 which I think has finally gotten the Department  of 8 Finance to recognize we need to move towards  real 9 reform of property tax more across the  board.10 They’ re willing to work on that and we need  to 11 make sure we get all of the voices at the table   in 12 that process.13 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Fine.14 Now, just a follow - up question on 15 something that you mentioned.	You –- you cited 16 the 2011 Income and Affordability Study in  your 17 presentation.	In there there was something  about 18 the National Low Income Housing Coalition  and 19 their studies have determined whether rents  are 20 affordable to the lowest wage  earners.21 And their 2011 study was  released 22 at the time that this came out , but the one  that 23 was released in October of 2010 , the community 24 services letter released the unheard third  of 25 2010 , and this goes to the lowest income,  the 2 
2 poor, making less than 100 percent of the   poverty 3 line, another one- third who are near poor, earning 4 100 –– 200 percent of the poverty line and   the 5 last third who earn moderate income, which  make 6 200 percent of the poverty  line.7 The federal income poverty line 8 in 2010 was $ 14 , 570 for a family of two. $ 18 , 310 9 for a family of three, and $ 22 , 050 for a family of 10 four.11 When asked about the top  problems 12 facing the City, employment and finances were  the 13 top responses, with 52 percent of the poor   and 14 near poor and 47 percent of moderate income,  34 15 percent of higher income households citing  these 16 two issues as their top  worries.17 Affordable housing was ranked as 18 the top issue facing the City for six percent   of 19 the poor and near poor .	Five percent of the 20 moderate income group, and seven percent of  the 21 higher income households.	All slight drops from 22 the previous year.23 When asked which government 24 benefits would help their family get ahead  the 25 most, 12 percent of the poor, 10 percent of   the 2 
2 near poor and 5 percent of moderate  income 3 households , cited housing assistance.4 This was the fourth most  popular 5 response with lower taxes, health insurance  and 6 job training ranking higher across all  income 7 groups .8 So I appreciate the fact  that 9 your office gets a significant number of  phone 10 calls, but our documentation here, not to  diminish 11 the importance of housing affordability  --12 SPEAKER QUINN:	What year was 13 that, sir?14 MR . SCHLEIDER:	I ’ m sorry ?15 SPEAKER QUINN:	What year was 16 that done in, I’ m sorry.	I just - -17 MR . SCHLEIDER:	That was 18 released in October of  2010 .	The survey was 19 conducted last summer.	All right.20 So –21 SPEAKER QUINN:	I mean , just to 22 –- just to –- I don’ t mean to interrupt,  but 23 Adriene asked me a question.	The fact is what  the 24 fact is.	The facts are what the facts are  in 25 that, but the fact is, and we’ re happy to  share 2 

2	the data – - 34	question to you.5
MR . SCHLEIDER:	No, here’ s my SPEAKER QUINN:	But Council 
6 step, that is what people call it, e- mail  and 7 write us about .8 MR . SCHLEIDER:	I understand.9 And I’ m not taking away the fact that  –-10 SPEAKER QUINN:	Okay.11 MR . SCHLEIDER:	– - you are 12 getting this number of phone calls about  housing.13 But what would your office –- what would  the 14 Council be doing about the three most  popular 15 responses, called concerns –-16 SPEAKER QUINN:	Right .17 MR . SCHLEIDER:	– - rather than 18 call them popular responses –-19 SPEAKER QUINN:	Sure.20 MR . SCHLEIDER:	– - let’ s call 21 them concerns.22 MS . SPEAKER:	And just – - there 23 were economy, job training –-24 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Lower taxes,25 health insurance and job training.	Because it ’ s6 
2not so much –-3SPEAKER QUINN:Right .	Well,4let me –-5MR . SCHLEIDER:– - it ’ s not so 6 much – - it ’ s not so much rent regulation – -7 SPEAKER QUINN:	Right.	So let 8 me just answer –- just in different  --9 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Well, let me 10 finish first.	It’ s not so much rent regulation,11 is the –- the generator of affordable  housing 12 because also in this report, it shows  that 13 unregulated housing and regulated housing have  the 14 same rent income burdens.	So it’ s not that.15 I think that the – - it ’ s – - it ’ s16 the economy –- it’ s the financial security  rather 17 than the financial insecurity that may be the   real 18 issue here .19 SPEAKER QUINN:	Well, let me –-20 I think you’ ve asked two points.21 One is what are we doing on  these 22 three other areas?	One is on the job training ,23 quite a bit.	I won’ t go into the details of  all 24 of it because it’ s just too extensive, but  the 25 Council has a Jobs to Build Program, where  we’ re 6 
2 working closely with CWE and other entities to  get 3 people into job training programs for  the 4 particular focus, either in the construction  field 5 or truck drivers, which is actually an area  where 6 work is needed .7 And also in areas in  the 8 automotive industry where it’ s all computers now.9 There’ s a great training facility in Queens.	Jobs 10 are open there .11 Two, we’ re really driving -- if 12 you’ d look –- and I’ m happy to send you a copy  of 13 it -- are our Food Works Plan and how you can    use 14 food as an economic engine in New York   City.15 And we recently converted the  old 16 La Marketa facility in East Harlem into  an 17 industrial kitchen .	You can rent the stoves  and 18 ovens there by the hour.	It has the capacity and 19 will create 40 food start- ups a year.20 In addition, it has  an 21 entrepreneurial training programming where people 22 like Elvis Hernandez, who are now in ten   bodegas,23 will come out of that with a capacity to sell   his 24 cakes in 100 different supermarkets.25 We ’ ve also begun focusing on the 2 
2 connection and , look, housing isn’ t the only 3 problem in the City.4 The connection between the  high 5 GED problem in our City and the problem with   job 6 training.	There’ s 8 . 4 million New Yorkers , 1 . 77 million of them don’ t have a high school  diploma 8 and don’ t have a GED.	Every job we offer at  a9 Work Force One Center requires a GED or a   high 10 school diploma .11 Now, because of the Council’ s12 intervention and funding, when you go to  Work 13 Force One Centers, it started at  one facility.	It 14 will go to scale in all of the ones in the   City.15 For the first time ever you get asked, do you   have 16 a diploma?	Do you have a GED?	If you don ’ t, you 17 can sign up there for prep  classes .	And to take 18 the test, which is noteworthy of the prep  because 19 the State of New York has been 49 or 50 th  in 20 failing the GED in he  nation.21 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Um- hum.22 SPEAKER QUINN:	Job training.23 Two, health care.	If you look at every  budget 24 that has been passed since I’ ve been Speaker  of 25 the City Council, it is the Council that has   held 2 
2 funding consistent as much as we could to   the 3 Health and Hospitals Corporation and to the  free 4 and public programs within the Department  of 5 Health , which is a critical way to make sure  under 6 insured and uninsured people get very good  health 7 care in the City of  New York.	And that will 8 largely continue when we pass the budget  later 9 this week.10 We also are the folks who  support 11 Working Today and the Freelancers Union and  Dance 12 Theater Workshop and other entities that  provide 13 group insurance options for fields which don’ t14 typically have insurance.15 On the issue of taxes, for  about 16 three years in a row before we got it done   and 17 then we got it done, the Council went up to   Albany 18 and then took corresponding action of our own   to 19 make changes in the unincorporated business  tax,20 to give tax cuts to small businesses and  to 21 eliminate the double taxation of the UBT  on 22 freelancers altogether .23 We ’ ve also been pushing for six 24 years in Albany to get changes made in the S    Corp.25 structure so that double taxation of smaller  S2 
2 Corps. , not big S Corps. Like Bloomberg LP , but 3 smaller S Corps. Get taken out of the   budget,4 which will be an important way to help those   small 5 businesses grow and create jobs.6 Now all of that said, I  believe,7 even if we were able to address those  things,8 those three areas in a greater  capacity,9 affordable housing is still going to be  a10 challenge in this City of New  York .	And what we 11 need to do is make sure that as people get   work,12 we are able to keep housing in the City of   New 13 York that they and their families can  address.14 And, look, I think you ’ re right.15 The fact that Council stats says housing is  the 16 thing most people call us about, that doesn’ t  mean 17 we should respond to that with 100 percent of   our 18 efforts.	And the study you reported says  these 19 other three things -- and that doesn’ t mean  that 20 you, as the Rent Guidelines Board,  should 21 disregard your responsibilities.22 As elected and appointed 23 officials, our job isn ’ t to respond to polls or 24 public surveys , it ’ s to put things into a greater 25 context.	And you’ re right to say, not you as  the 2 
2 Rent Guidelines Board, but me, have other  things 3 we have to work on and we  do.4 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .5 ( Applause. )6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	Thank 7 you.8 SPEAKER QUINN:	Thank you .9 Thank you all.10 ( Applause. )11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Speaker Quinn,12 thank you for coming in.13 If there is anybody in the  room 14 who would like to speak and has not –-   is 15 pre- registered and would like to speak and has  not 16 registered at the table outside, please do  so.17 Our next speaker will be  Patrick 18 Siconolfi, who will be followed by Anita Romm,  who 19 will be followed by Robert  Rosenberg.20 MR . SICONOLFI:	Good morning.21 I am Patrick Siconolfi , Executive 22 Director of the Community Housing  Improvement 23 Program or CHIP, an association of  housing 24 providers of small and medium- size properties.	We 25 represent about 5 , 000 owners.2 
2 And I would ask you to  consider 3 three brief points :4 First, we would ask you to  enact 5 a low- rent supplement.	Obviously, the Court of 6 Appeals has confirmed your authority to do  so.7 The need remains acute with approximately  12 8 percent of the stabilized buildings are  distressed 9 and an additional 31 percent are at the break   even 10 point, meaning that they are just one  financial 11 shock away from becoming distressed themselves .12 Between these two categories,13 43 percent of the stabilized buildings  are 14 financially endangered , and these tend to be 15 smaller older buildings that are 16 disproportionately the ones with lower  rent 17 structures .18 Not surprisingly, foreclosures 19 are up as a result and you ’ re aware of the  recent 20 Furman Center report, which noted the trends  in 21 foreclosures.22 A principal cause of  this 23 distressed or endangered status is the  property 24 tax burden imposed by the City of New   York .	We 25 continue to advise the RGB strategy of  withholding 2 
2 the revenue necessary to pay taxes imposed by   the 3 very same government, is a questionable  public 4 policy and it’ s financially ruinous to affordable 5 housing, particularly –- excuse me , particularly,6 the smaller and medium sized housing that  CHIP 7 represents .8 So we would recommend that you  do 9 a low rent supplement similar to the way you   did 10 in Orders 40 and 41 .11 The second is, we would ask  you 12 to set the guideline at the PIOC since you   have 13 determined that it represents the actual  cost 14 increases already experienced by  housing 15 providers.	Accordingly, the one- year renewal 16 should be set at 6 percent and the two - year 17 renewal at 10 percent.	These numbers are the  same 18 as RGB ’ s inflation adjusted commensurate 19 measurement.20 And this is particularly 21 important because the RGB does not  recognize 22 numerous actual costs in operating  residential 23 buildings.	And, you know, there’ s a legendary 24 list of those things, but lead paint, asbestos ,25 trash compactors, higher penalty schedules , new 2 
2 building codes , inspection of retaining walls, new 3 facade law requirements, bed bugs, mandating  the 4 phase out of four and  six oil.	And the list goes 5 on and on, without going through the whole  thing 6 in my testimony.7 Understand that we agree with  the 8 majority of these measures that they’ re part of  a9 meritorious public policy.	That’ s not the issue.10 We simply assert that this costs money .11 The last thing , net operating 12 income .	Net operating income is  not profit.	And 13 you heard a speaker earlier use it as if it   was.14 Not surprisingly, because in your reports it’ s15 spoken as if it  is .	And net operating income is 16 not profit .17 Net operating income is not 18 profit -- is where you pay for the things that   are 19 not in the PIOC.	Capital costs for investment in 20 the aging infrastructure are not in  the PIOC.	So 21 they must be paid from net operating income,  the 22 same with these unfunded mandates, the same  with 23 taxes.	And so what you realize is that  net 24 operating income is a –- if there is any   profit,25 it ’ s a much smaller number than that.2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	All right.3 I’ m going to ask you to wrap it up .4 MR . SICONOLFI:	Sure .	That’ s5 it .6 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Question.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Oh, Mr.8 Schleider.	I didn ’ t mean to wrap up that quickly.9 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .10 Going back to the –- to the  NOI 11 in –-12 MR . SICONOFLI:	Yes.13 MR . SCHLEIDER:	– - and Speaker 14 Quinn made mention of $ 194 , 000 figure as NOI,15 being exceptionally –- and I don’ t want  to 16 mis- characterize her, but it certainly came across 17 that it was very generous and income for a   family.18 If we were to look at the  Bronx,19 just citing the report that you cited, in units   of 20 11 to 19 – - in buildings of 11 to 19 units , and  if 21 we were to say an average of 15 units for   a22 building that size , we ’ re showing a net operating 23 income of $ 129 per apartment per month .	All 24 right.	So you annualize that times 15  apartments,25 that’ s $ 23 , 220 .	All right .2 
2 The poverty level for a  family 3 four is $ 22 , 050 .	So why own an apartment  building 4 in the Bronx if –- if you’ re essentially at  a5 poverty level for a family of four ?6 MR . SICONOLFI:	Well, you make 7 an excellent point and –- and it’ s even worse  than 8 you presented because –-9 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Not that it 10 assumes that there ’ s no debt on the building.11 This is just – -12 MR . SICONOLFI:	Right . Right.13 And, you know, it’ s worse than that because  from 14 that $ 23 , 000 , which would be the net operating 15 income , you still have to pay for  capital 16 investment .	And, by the way, you know , the  board 17 –- you include the revenue from an MCI in   your 18 calculations, but you don’ t include the expenses.19 You don’ t show them anywhere.20 So this is an inherently  unfair 21 process.	So that has to come out of  the NOI.	The 22 unfunded mandates have to come out of the   NOI.23 Certain kinds of income taxes have to come out   of 24 the NOI.	So what you’ re left with is pennies on  a25 building that –- like the one  you described.	And 2 
2 that’ s actually the bulk of the –- the housing  in 3 the boroughs.4 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Now 15 years – -5 so if you were to move to the other borough,   say 6 Brooklyn, Queens and say Upper Manhattan, where  we 7 have a little more income than operating  income,8 same calculations provide about $ 40 , 000 , 44 ,9 $ 45 , 000 a year , before all these unfunded 10 mandates.11 MR . SICONOLFI:	Right .12 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Before any 13 financing, before capital expenses , –-14 MR . SICONOLFI:	Right.15 MR . SCHLEIDER:	–- before 16 surprises.17 MR . SICONOLFI:	Right .18 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Right ?19 MR . SICONOLFI:	And that’ s true 20 and it leads to one other point which the   Speaker 21 made before about people who take  on debt.	I22 mean, she –- in the hopes of flipping  the 23 buildings and, you know, being something like  a24 speculator .25 But, you know, the  average 2 
2 holding of a rent stabilized property is close  to 3 30 years.4 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Um- hum.5 MR . SICONOLFI:	And I think,6 you know, you don’ t think of that when you  think 7 of rent stabilized property.	The average holding 8 period is almost 30 years.	It ’ s not a quick flip 9 as was the suggestion  earlier.10 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .11 MR . SICONOLFI:	Okay.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Cheigh.13 MR . CHEIGH :	Hi.	Good morning.14 Thank you for coming.15 I just have –- I wanted to   start 16 out with some basic questions.	You said you’ re a17 person with over 5 , 000 owners.	Could you say 18 approximately what boroughs they’ re mostly located 19 in ?20 MR . SICONOLFI:	Well, the four 21 big ones and even some in Staten  Island.22 MR . CHEIGH :	Is there like a23 ratio?	Do you have a lot of members in, you   know,24 Manhattan or - -25 MR . SICONOLFI:	We have members 2 
2 in all five boroughs.	And , you know, reasonably 3 evenly distributed .4 MR . CHEIGH :	Do you happen to 5 know what percentage of your owners are on  natural 6 gas or oil heat?7 MR . SICONOLFI:	We don ’ t collect 8 that information, no.9 MR . CHEIGH :	Do you know –-10 MR . SICONOLFI:	But, you know ,11 there’ s a corollary to your question which  is,12 what portion of our owners can ’ t get gas heat 13 because, you know, there’ s no Con Ed  service?14 And the other thing which you’ re 15 not really asking is, what portion of them are   on 16 –- using No. 2 oil where they, you know,  that’ s17 the kind of oil where they rely on   oil .	And the 18 great majority are using No. 2 oil .19 MR . CHEIGH :	Okay.	And do you 20 know if your owners took the low rent  supplements 21 in 2009 and –- was it 2008 –- the two   years?22 MR . SICONOLFI:	I mean , the 23 question contains a false premise.	I mean , it ’ s24 as if there’ s one answer.	I mean, there was 5 , 000 25 members and each of those members have , you  know,2 
2 a certain number of  apartments .	I mean, you’ ll 3 see the answers will be  quite various.	Some 4 buildings will have taken it and some  apartments 5 will have taken it .	It depends entirely on the 6 rent history of a given  building.7 And I think, you know, that  rent 8 histories are not building wide, they are –-   and 9 they’ re certainly not citywide , rent histories are 10 individual to each apartment.	So whether or not 11 the owner took a low rent supplement in a   given 12 instance depends on the rental history in  that 13 apartment.	And there would literally be dozens  of 14 different scenarios to consider.15 MR . CHEIGH :	But, generally, I16 guess, you can ’ t tell us if, you know, if your 17 members said they took the  –-18 MR . SICONOLFI:	Oh, no.	I told 19 –- no.	You’ re –- where did you hear that from ?20 Not from me.21 What I ’ m telling you is that the 22 answer is very different from the question you ’ re 23 asking .	You’ re assuming that there’ s kind of a24 one- size- fits all answer.	And what I’ m trying to 25 tell you is that there isn ’ t.	That some owners 2 
 2 would have taken it depending on the  rental 3 history of that unit and others would  not.4 MR . CHEIGH :	You mean, if there 5 were – - if there were –- it they had tenants  who 6 were there six years or longer and the   rentals 7 must meet all the  guidelines?8 MR . SICONOLFI:	Right .	And you 9 know what the guideline is .	Sure.10 MR . CHEIGH :	So –- yeah, I  guess,11 the question was, basically –- I’ m sorry.	If 12 there were tenants who met the requirements  for 13 the low rent supplement, so that’ s what I  meant.14 And I guess we ’ re –- I guess you can’ t answer that 15 question then.16 MR . SICONOLFI:	I did answer it.17 Twice now.	I can do it again, if you’ d  like.18 MR . CHEIGH :	I mean, I’ m just 19 trying to get a sense of the – - we asked all   the 20 building owners yesterday –-21 MR . SICONOLFI:	What is –- where 22	–-23 MR . CHEIGH :	– - we did ask all 24 the building owners on Thursday if they took  the 25 minimum surcharge and they said they  did.23 
2 MR . SICONOLFI:	Right.	But you 3 understand I’ m here representing 5 , 000 of them .4 And if you ask one owner what he or she   did,5 you’ ll get the very specific answer.	But I’ m here 6 representing 5 , 000 of them and what I’ m telling 7 you is very specifically, that some did and  some 8 didn’ t .9 MR . CHEIGH :	Um- hum.10 MR . SICONOLFI:	And where are you 11 going with the question, though?12 MR . CHEIGH :	No, I ’ m just asking 13 very basic questions that I asked the  owners.14 MR . SICONOLFI:	Right .	Right .15 Okay.16 MR . CHEIGH :	Okay .17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I think you get 18 a –- I think, at least from some of the   owners 19 that I ’ ve spoken to, you get a cross section, as 20 Pat said.	Some collected it.	Some didn’ t collect 21 it .	Some returned it.	Some didn’ t return it.	I22 think it runs the  gamut.23 Mr . Schleider.24 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Oh, I thought 2 
2you had aquestion .	I ’ m sorry .3MR . SCHLEIDER:No.I’ m fine .
456	questions?789	for coming today.10
Thank you.CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Any other Ms . Cruz.MS . CRUZ:	Thank you very much Would you describe for the  board 
11 the impact of the Roberts decision on  your 12 membership of the potential that thousands  of 13 apartments will go back into rent regulation  if 14 the courts and / or the legislature decides that the 15 owners that had been deregulating while  taking 16 J- 51 are – - are now subject to not being able  to 17 apply luxury deregulation?18 MR . SICONOLFI:	Okay.	Well,19 there will be some problematic impact where it ’ s20 applicable .	And I think it’ s important to keep  in 21 mind where Roberts is applicable.	It’ s applicable 22 where an apartment had been deregulated and then  a23 tenant moved in at a fair market rent, paying   some 24 number , some considerable number, presumably with 25 the income that supported that number and  then 11 
2 that apartment was re- regulated.	So the sole 3 beneficiaries of the Roberts decision were  wealthy 4 tenants.	And I think it’ s important to keep  that 5 in mind.	So it has nothing to do  with 6 affordability.	It ’ s a –- it’ s a, you know , a7 smoke screen.8 So it depends on – - it depends  on 9 what, again, what the type of building  it is.	Now 10 certainly there are a lot of buildings and   they 11 would tend to be, you know , sort of –- refer  to 12 the earlier question, they would tend to be  in 13 Manhattan those buildings where rents tend to  be 14 higher and , of course, Stuyvesant Town was one  of 15 the big places .	But there ’ s certainly a lot of 16 other places where that happens.17 Now the specific point , it ’ s18 problematic because what a lot of owners have   been 19 forced to do as the Rent Guidelines Board  has 20 continued to attribute , you know, the actual  cash 21 flow to the building, is that cash flow to   the 22 building was supplemented by the  luxury 23 decontrolled apartments.	So if you stop that 24 process, what you don’ t realize, I think,25 sometimes is that the luxury decontrolled  tenants 2 
2 kept the increases lower for the  stabilized 3 tenants so without that, I think, you know ,  you 4 don’ t have these cross subsidies to the stabilized 5 tenants.	It’ s going to put further pressure on 6 the stabilized rents.7 Thank you.8 MS . CRUZ:	Thank you.9 MR . CHEIGH :	Okay .	I don ’ t10 think there’ s anything that allows us to say - -  I11 mean, we’ ve introduced the proviso this year 12 saying , if there’ s significant decontrol, we 13 should consider minimum increases, but we haven’ t14 had.	There’ s been nothing to say that our 15 stabilization increases rely on assessment on  how 16 many de- controlled units there are .17 MR . SICONOLFI:	Oh, that’ s not 18 correct.19 MR . CHEIGH :	That ’ s only on the 20 SRO unit.21 MR . SICONOLFI:	That’ s actually 22 incorrect.	Because if you , the net operating 23 income and commensurate rent adjustment  numbers,24 take that into account because they –- what  they 25 do is, they take account of the entire income   from 2 
2 the building including the deregulated  apartments.3 So you ’ re recognizing that revenue and then –-4 then what you do is in the commensurate  rent 5 adjustment , you then take that and you hold  net 6 operating income constant, in effect  confiscating 7 that excess income .	So, yes, you do.8 MR . CHEIGH :	Thank you.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,10 Pat.11 MS . HOLDER :	I have a  question.12 I’ m sorry.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Oh, I’ m sorry.14 Ms . Holder .15 MS . HOLDER :	You stated that 12 16 percent of housing is  distressed.17 MR . SICONOLFI:	Yes.18 MS . HOLDER :	How many –- what 19 percentage of your members are –- are owners   of 20 distressed properties?21 MR . SICONOLFI:	You know, we did 22 a survey of that and we found that –- we   found 23 essentially the same number.	We found 11 percent.24 We had a study done two years ago and we found   11 25 percent.2 
2 And then the second number  I3 quoted to you, which was the 31 percent, was   the 4 group that is just breaking even which is the,   you 5 know, the one financial shock away from  becoming,6 perhaps, distressed themselves .7 So our number, at least on  the 8 distressed is very close to the number that  Rent 9 Guidelines Board came up with.10 MS . HOLDER :	And what do you  do,11 your – - your member organization in trying to 12 assist those owners?13 MR . SICONOLFI:	Well, we do a14 number of things.	CHIP –- first of all, we have  a15 newsletter which we produce 11 times a year  which 16 keeps members apprised first and foremost of  what 17 the various regulatory requirements are, State  and 18 City government.	And they ’ re voluminous so it ’ s19 important to keep abreast of those .20 And one of the things that , you 21 know, we find is important is making sure   that 22 members know about that.23 The second thing we do is, we  run 24 a seminar series.	We have seminars throughout the 25 year which teach owners the best ways to do,   you 2 
2 know, best practices basically .	And one of the 3 things that that does is, it helps owners  in 4 managing their costs.5 And another thing we do is , we 6 have members of government speak, you know ,  sort 7 of an expert panel , to help owners understand  what 8 their obligations are.	So we do a number  of 9 things in that regard to  help.10 MS . HOLDER :	Do you all have a11 legislative agenda that you advocate for  reform 12 for owners in terms of taxes and – - and  –-13 MR . SICONOLFI:	Well, yeah, I14 mean, you’ ve heard me say a number of times  that 15 we thought that the tax rates are extremely  high.16 You probably heard me say something to the   effect 17 that when you consider all the taxes, not just   the 18 one labeled property tax that are paid to the   City 19 of New York, somewhere between 35 and 40 cents   of 20 every dollar spent to run a stabilized  building 21 goes back to the City of  New York.	It ’ s like the 22 City of New York is a partner with us in   the 23 operation of the building.24 So , you know, so 40 cents of 25 every dollar to run a stabilized building  goes 2 
2 back to the City of  New York.	So one of the 3 things that we keep saying and this is , you  know,4 part of our agenda , is that if you care –- and   I5 believe everyone here does , if you care  about 6 stabilized housing and if you care  about 7 affordable housing , one of the things that  you 8 need to do is address the components of   housing 9 that make it hard to keep affordability in   check.10 So taxes are certainly the  –-11 it ’ s the largest single expense that owners pay.12 It ’ s much bigger than debt service .	It’ s the 13 largest single expense .	And it goes up  the 14 fastest.	It’ s going up faster than any –- it’ s15 going up faster than fuel.	And so if you want  to 16 maintain affordability , taxes have to be 17 addressed.18 MS . HOLDER :	And with your , your 19 owners , how many of them own multiple buildings?20 MR . SICONOLFI:	I don’ t have that 21 specific number, but certainly a number of  them 22 do .23 MS . HOLDER :	A number ?24 MR . SICONOLFI:	Yeah.25 MS . HOLDER :	Like a majority?2 
2 MR . SICONOLFI:	I don ’ t know 3 that.	No.	I’ d probably say no.4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,5 Pat.6 MR . SICONOLFI:	Okay.	Sure.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Anita Romm.8 MS . ROMM:	Yes.	Good morning .9 My name is Anita Romm.	I’ m the song writer for 10 Metropolitan Council on Housing.11 In my opinion, the proposed  rent 12 increases are excessive in view of a number   of 13 realities.	The landlords are doing reasonably 14 well as net operating income increased 15 . 515 percent.16 Why do you have to squeeze  the 17 tenants?	Unemployment has increased and wages 18 have gone down .19 Although oil prices have risen ,20 they actually went down a bit since I wrote   this 21 speech last month.	Natural gas prices went down 22 5 . 1 percent.	If buildings were run in a  more 23 efficient way, costs could be  kept down.	Why 24 squeeze the tenants as they have no control  over 25 how a building is  run?2 
2 The median income of tenants  is 3 half the median income of owners and the  recession 4 has hit all strata of our society, except  owners 5 of rent stabilized buildings.6 Do you really want to make  more 7 people homeless?	Do you want to hurt  businesses 8 if people have to pay so much rent that they  can’ t9 afford goods and services, squeeze the  tenants 10 even more and we could have a city where   everybody 11 who isn’ t rich , will end up in camp with “ Arbeit 12 Mcht Frei” on the front  door?13 For many years you gave  increases 14 which were not called for, when expenses went  down 15 in those years , such as 2002 .16 Do the right thing ?	Give us a17 rent freeze.	Laissez- faire, mon derriere.18 ( Applause. )19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,20 Anita.21 ( Applause. )22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	We’ re going to 23 take a ten - minute break to get the sound system 24 back up and running and get the mikes on   the 25 table.2

Rosenberg.18 MR . ROSENBERG:	Thank you .19 Good morning, honorable members 20 of the board.21 In past years, I’ ve stood before 22 the Rent Guidelines Board and sought to  convince 23 our policymakers in public office and  in 24 government agencies of the importance of low  rent 25 supplements to help affordable housing stay  in 2 

2	business.3
I was happy to see that low  rent 
4 supplements were implemented in 2008 - 2009 and 5 2009 - 2010 .	However, today there is so much  hoopla 6 regarding vacancy decontrol and $ 2 , 000 rents in 7 the media, that many people would get  the 8 impression that all rents are in that range  and 9 all rents are too high .10 This is far from the reality  of 11 the type of housing that my  company runs.	And I12 won’ t quote any statistics or mumbo jumbo, just 13 with a lot of stats, just the facts of   my 14 business.15 Recently, I had my  fiscal 16 department conduct a portfolio - wide review of the 17 rents that we’ re collecting.	And I’ m going to 18 tell you some of the rents that I   collect.19 I have in the $ 100 to $ 199 end 20 category, I have ten  tenants.21 In the $ 200 to $ 299 category, I22 have five tenants.23 Tenants paying $ 300 to $ 399 , I24 have 13 tenants.25 $ 400 to $ 499 , I have 49 tenants.4 
2$ 500 to $ 599 amonth, 66 tenants.3$ 600 to $ 699 ,109 tenants.4$ 700 to $ 799 ,174 tenants.5$ 800 to $ 899 ,$ 243 tenants .6$ 900 to $ 999 ,284 tenants.7 That’ s 953 tenants that are below the market  rent.8 No one in the housing industry  of 9 New York will dispute that our costs, real   estate 10 taxes and water have had double digit increases  in 11 the past years and heating oil is through   the 12 roof.	No one would argue that the paperwork  that 13 the -- regarding the federal agencies,  the 14 bureaucracy, the over regulation, have  increased 15 significantly.16 People know that affordable 17 housing is a sacred resource.	The City tried back 18 in the ‘ 70 ' s and in the ‘ 80 ' s to rent affordable 19 housing and they failed and they couldn’ t do it  so 20 they divested.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Rosenberg,22 if you could wrap up,  please.23 MR . ROSENBERG:	Oh , it takes 24 dedicated owners to make it work.	Affordable 25 housing is the housing of  last resort.	People 7 
 2 have nowhere else to go.	We must get together  to 3 provide that needy housing .4 We ’ re locally based.	I’ m just 5 going to run through quick .	We’ re locally based.6 All my properties are open to the –- all   my 7 tenants and every building is renovated.	And what 8 housing is creating the low rent end which  I’ m9 dealing with, is creating a lot of other   issues.10 Squatters, buying apartments, upset tenants  paying 11 market rent or lower than market rent are  very 12 upset with the tenants paying way below  market 13 rents.	That’ s a problem.	The tenants are angry.14 And succession rights.	We ’ re 15 losing our apartments because families are  moving 16 in and we never  get increases.	We don ’ t get them 17 back.18 So you took action before.	The 19 court agreed with you.	I would like to ask  you 20 today to give supplemental increases, $ 100 for the 21	$ 100 to $ 500 ranges, $ 50 for $ 500 to $ 1 , 000 range.22 And I’ ll tell you lastly, we’ re a captive audience 23 forced to watch Albany deal with rent  regulation.24 It ’ s difficult .	It’ s painful to watch and we know 25 how it will end up in the end and    it reminds me of 22 
2 a theatrical version of  Spiderman.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.4 Rosenberg.5 How many of your tenants  are 6 deregulated?7 MR . ROSENBERG:	What?8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	How many of 9 your tenants are deregulated?10 MR . ROSENBERG:	Let me think 11 about that one .	Zero .12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And what’ s the 13 maximum rents that you  have?14 MR . ROSENBERG:	I have no rent  at 15 $ 2 , 000 a month or higher, not one.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	What’ s your 17 turnover rate?18 ( No response.)19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	In other words,20 have you – - have you gotten vacancy  increases?21 MR . ROSENBERG:	We get vacancy 22 increases –-23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	What kind of 24 numbers?25 MR . ROSENBERG:	– - when we’ re 2 
2 due them and when we get the - - like I   said,3 there’ s a whole segment off the market  through 4 squatters which we have to vigilantly go  after 5 which we can’ t .	And, also , succession .	We lose 6 an awful lot.7 And then we get the  natural 8 turnover which is three percent, four  percent,9 five percent, whatever it might  be .	I ’ m not 10 exactly sure.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	What’ s the 12 total number of tenants?13 ( Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Questions will 15 come from here instead of from the  audience.16 What’ s the total number of 17 tenants and buildings that you own ?18 MR . ROSENBERG:	And I’ ve been in 19 it for my life ’ s work.	That’ s all I do and that’ s20 all I love to do, and satisfy  my tenants.	I’ m21 just here to make it work.	It ’ s a business.	But 22 it ’ s also you have to have compassion to run them 23 right.24 Okay.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	What’ s the 2 
2 total number of units that you have, total  number 3 of buildings, total number of  tenants?4 MR . ROSENBERG:	I have 5 approximately 2 , 500 apartments and approximately 6 50 properties.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Any other 8 questions?9 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Yes.10 MR . CHEIGH :	Could you let us 11 know – -12 MR . ROSENBERG:	Very easy .	You 13 just apply for an apartment and we ’ ll give 14 everybody a fair shot.15 MR . CHEIGH :	Could you let us 16 know where –- could you let us know where   the 17 apartments , where your buildings are.18 MR . ROSENBERG:	Primarily the 19 Bronx.	All over the Bronx .20 MS . HOLDER :	Which neighborhood?21 MR . ROSENBERG:	All over.22 MS . HOLDER :	All neighborhoods 23 in the Bronx.24 MR . ROSENBERG:	All 25 neighborhoods.	Not Riverdale, that’ s not the 2 

2	Bronx.34	Bronx.567	do you have?8
MS . HOLDER :	Riverdale is the ( Laughter. )MS . HOLDER :	How many buildings MR . ROSENBERG:	Riverdale’ s
9	really Manhattan.	Nobody knows that.10 MS . HOLDER :	So you have one 11 building in each of the neighborhoods of  the 12 Bronx?13 MR . ROSENBERG:	Probably.	It 14 depends on what you call the neighborhoods ,  yeah.15 Mostly mid Bronx, east Bronx, south Bronx,  north 16 Bronx, the Concourse.17 MR . CHEIGH :	And how long have 18 you owned the properties?19 MR . ROSENBERG:	Probably as old 20 as anybody on this panel.	I’ ve never sold a21 building yet and I ’ ve been buying since the ‘ 60 ' s.22 I was –- I had buildings when oil was eight   cents 23 a gallon and the average rent was 50  bucks .24 MR . CHEIGH :	Are some of these 25 units that you cited the rents for , are they  rent 10 

2	controlled ?3
MR . ROSENBERG:	Every apartment I
4 have is either rent controlled or rent  stabilized.5 I probably have rent controlled, maybe 25 , 50 ,6 something like that.7 MR . CHEIGH :	And did you take the 8 minimum increases?9 MR . ROSENBERG:	Any time I had 10 the possibility to take an increase, I took it ,  if 11 it was justified, of course.	Why would I not  take 12 an increase?13 MR . CHEIGH :	Do you also 14 take – -15 MR . ROSENBERG:	Unless , of 16 course , I felt the rent was fair.	It was a  good 17 tenant and I am flexible about that, if it ’ s  been 18 a good tenant and I could get a little more   and 19 they don’ t want to pay a little more, I  sometimes 20 am flexible and don’ t take it.21 MR . CHEIGH :	Do you have a lot  of 22 tenants who receive Section 8 , SCRIE?23 MR . ROSENBERG:	Yes, I do.24 They have a very  tough 25 requirement for maintaining your property,  but 4 
2 they’ re also, if you know how to work with  them,3 you’ re guaranteed your rent, for the most part .4 MS . HOLDER :	That’ s right.	And 5 you’ re –- and I appreciate your testimony  today.6 MR . ROSENBERG:	Yeah, a lot of 7 people say they don’ t like it.	I love it.8 MS . HOLDER :	Right.9 MR . ROSENBERG:	Providing you 10 keep the apartment fair, they have a lot   of 11 glitches that you have to keep on them for   not 12 getting notification of things , but I would  say 13 all in all , the program works.14 MS . HOLDER :	Right.	And if 15 you’ re a good business person and you know how  to 16 run a business , then you should be able to  handle 17 that.18 MR . ROSENBERG:	As best as 19 possible, yes.20 MS . HOLDER :	Right.	And so I21 appreciate your testimony, that’ s honest.22 The –- the MCI increases  or 23 individual apartment improvements, have you  had 24 any occasion to take any of those in your   –-25 buildings?2 
2 MR . ROSENBERG:	Usually only on 3 building wide.	I rarely do much.	When it ’ s a4 vacancy, I will turn over, reshape it,  put 5 everything new and present .	But for the most part 6 I do City programs and I do building   wide 7 renovation , which gives an MCI or sometimes,  or 8 just sometimes a tax abatement .9 MS . HOLDER :	So I can imagine 10 that your buildings must be in pretty  good 11 condition?12 MR . ROSENBERG:	They are.13 MS . HOLDER :	So you are 14 definitely one of these landlords that –-  that 15 takes very seriously the preservation of  their 16 buildings and their apartment and so I can see   why 17 you may not have a lot of  turnover .18 MR . ROSENBERG:	And the turnover 19 I have they ask can I stay in   your building.	But 20 yet and still there are buildings that make  zero 21 and there are buildings that lose so I guess   the 22 small owner has a problem whereas I can say,   you 23 know, it’ s not my habit to get rid of  housing.24 I’ m losing money, actually losing money and I’ ll 25 take it from another building to pay that  one.2 
2 So there are buildings that  I3 have – - why do you think there ’ s so much liens 4 going on and lien sales?	Because people can’ t5 afford these high expenses , especially the ones 6 I’ ve mentioned taxes and water now , which is the 7 biggest killer .8 MS . HOLDER :	Do you have any 9 commercial space in any of your  buildings?10 MR . ROSENBERG:	Yes.11 MS . HOLDER :	What percentage of 12 your five buildings do you have commercial  space?13 MR . ROSENBERG:	Out of 50 14 buildings I probably have 60 stores in  different 15 buildings.	Not much, you know , a few in  each 16 building, some none, mostly zero.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay. Any 18 other questions?19 ( No response.)20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	Thank 21 you.22 MR . ROSENBERG:	Thank you .23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Larry Wood.24 MR . WOOD:	I gave Andrew some 25 handouts so if you just want to wait a minute   for 2 

2	those to get out.345
Can you hold the clock a second? Thank you.I didn ’ t start talking yet .	I ’ m
 6 just waiting for the handouts.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Larry, let’ s8 start.9 MR . WOOD:	Okay.	Thank you.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	It’ s a long 11 day.12 MR . WOOD:	Yes.	One , I always 13 start by thanking the members of the  Rent 14 Guidelines Board for their service because I   know 15 largely it ’ s a thankless job.16 And it ’ s even a little more 17 difficult this year because in your  deliberations 18 you do have an opportunity to do more than   one 19 size fits all rent increases because of  the 20 decision on supplemental increases being seen  as 21 lawful .	The whole issue of provisos is  now 22 something you have before you and it’ s  something 23 you’ ve used in the context of SROs going back to 24	1983 .25	So I do want to start off by   just 
2 suggesting that the Rent Guideline proposal  for 3 the SROs was way too high, both the guideline   and 4 the proviso itself .	That while only the SRO  stock 5 is only less than five percent of the   rent 6 stabilized stock, it’ s still a very critical 7 portion of the housing out there, particularly  for 8 low income single adults.9 We ’ ve almost come full circle in 10 government policy around SROs. And I did  share 11 this at some of the earlier meetings  with 12 individuals, but just two weeks ago the City  had 13 hearings on illegal SROs, that are buildings  that 14 have been illegally converted into SROs.	It could 15 be a one or two- family house or it could be  an 16 apartment being subdivided .	And the estimates are 17 somewhere between 80 and 100 , 000 units of illegal 18 SRO housing is out there and it just  illustrates 19 how much this housing stock is  needed.20 I shared a copy of that  full 21 report with Andrew .	If you look at the one  chart 22 I gave you with the –- that came from   our 23 submissions, I hope you can just stipulate  that 24 the tenants that reside in SRO housing are   among 25 the poorest of the poor.	But this chart has data 2 
2 from the ‘ 96 and 2002 Housing and Vacancy  Survey 3 and then some data comes from the RGB memos   that 4 Andrew had produced.5 And the bottom , I guess the line 6 22 and 23 shows you how much – - how high – -  how 7 much of rent people pay and how high a   proportion 8 of their income that is.	And it hasn’ t gotten any 9 better .10 The other thing to note is , we ’ ve 11 gone from 165 , 000 units of SRO housing down to 12 about 65 , 000 units currently.	So the legal SRO 13 units are just a small portion of the much   larger 14 universe of illegal SROs that are out  there.15 The other thing is the rents  are 16 pretty high in the SROs.	And I wanted to refer  to 17 the last page of that two- pager that’ s stapled 18 together.	And if you look at the medium  rents 19 outside of Manhattan, they ’ re much higher.	And I20 believe that’ s because in Manhattan we ’ ve been 21 able to effectively let tenants know about  their 22 rights as SRO tenants.	They do operate within the 23 stabilization system and we’ ve kept those 24 increases low over the  years.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Larry, I’ m2 
2 going to have to ask you to wrap  up.3 MR . WOOD:	Sure.4 I did want to make some  points 5 about this study in Community Board 7 that   looked 6 at all the SROs and I’ d entertain any questions  on 7 this particular report and then a little about  the 8 provisos.9 MS . HOLDER :	Can you talk to – -10 because we ’ re very interested in this Community 11 District 7 study.	Can you talk a little bit  more 12 about that .13 MR . WOOD:	Yeah.	I just want to 14 quickly highlight.	Of the remaining SRO  housing 15 stock in the City, 70 percent of it is   in 16 Manhattan and 40 percent of the 65 , 000 units are 17 Community Boards 4 and  7 .	So this is just a  most 18 comprehensive look at Community Board 7 and  gives 19 you a real sense of what’ s happening in  this 20 particular stock.21 The questions here are how  many 22 SRO units are in Community Board 7 , how many  have 23 been lost and how are they basically being  used?24 If you flip up to the first  pie 25 chart it shows a breakdown of the B units, the   SRO 2 
2 units in Community Board 7 and they  basically 3 found there was a little over 13 , 000 units left in 4 Community Board 7 .	Out of those 13 , 000 units,5 1957 almost 2 , 000 are operated by non- profits,6 including my agency God at  Riverside.7 A small percent, less than  300 8 units are servants quarters and the  Chairman 9 talked about some in the Dakota, on the top   floor.10 A much smaller number, but there are servants   who 11 live in SRO units in big apartment  buildings.12 Another big use is  students,13 universities, net	lease SROs.	There’ s many 14 buildings that are net leased by a university   or 15 are net leasing a large number of floors in   a16 building.17 Category D , the 3 , 287 , this is 18 the remaining rent stabilized units.	So out of 19 13 , 000 units in Community Board 7 , only a little 20 over 3 , 000 are still used as for stabilized 21 purposes.	The biggest use of the SRO stock  in 22 that neighborhood is what we call market  driven.23 There are over 6 , 000 units , almost half, are 24 either rented out to tourists or rented out  to 25 different City placements.2 
2 Just flipping up, this next  chart 3 here is lost B units.	Owners are allowed to 4 convert buildings back to their former  uses.5 Maybe going back to a one or two- family house  or 6 reconfiguring it as an  apartment building.	It 7 just gives you a sense of how many units have   been 8 converted over the last number of  years.9 The next chart or the next map  is 10 the map of the 17 buildings which are operated   by 11 non- profits.	And this is really the only  thing 12 that has preserved these units for  their 13 traditional use for low income permanent  tenants 14 and that’ s really getting them out of the  private 15 sector in the for- profit market.	And these are 16 homes to – - close to 2 , 000 units of SRO housing on 17 the westside.18 And the breakdown of those  market 19 units, those 6 , 000 market units, this pie chart 20 here shows the illegal hotel use, the  City 21 placement use or some  combination.22 And then you flip to the  last 23 map.	This is a map of some of the illegal   hotels 24 that have been operating on  the westside.	And 25 what we mean by illegal hotels , we mean  illegal 2 
2 tourist hotels where they’ re doing daily rentals 3 at anywhere from $ 99 to $ 150 a day .	Sometimes 4 they put bunk beds in some of the units and   rent 5 it out as a hostel where you might get $ 50   a6 night, but you got four bunk beds, I mean   four 7 beds in a room so they ’ re getting $ 200 a night .8 This is –- they’ re not always 9 legal and there’ s been a crackdown on this  but 10 it ’ s still largely going on unabated.	And that’ s11 why the provisos have been  so useful.	You can see 12 the vast bulk of the units in Community Board   713 would not qualify for a guideline increase  because 14 the landlord is making more than enough money  on 15 their building .16 You’ ve been able to protect it –-17 remaining stabilized tenants from what ’ s already a18 very difficult economic situation for them  because 19 you’ ve had those provisos, they haven’ t had to pay 20 an increase and it ’ s lessened the burden on them 21 and it hasn’ t made any change in the  landlord 22 being able to run a very profitable  building.23 MS . HOLDER :	So Larry, could you 24 tell us about –- through the years , and as  you 25 know, we’ ve introduced the idea of provisos the 2 
2 same way that there was a supplemental increase  in 3 2008 and 2009 , that being one such proviso we’ ve 4 introduced –- or we’ ve proposed, it hasn’ t been 5 introduced as a preliminary vote, but we’ ve 6 proposed looking at other types.	But tell us,7 through the years with the hotels, how  the 8 provisos for the hotels that has been improved  by 9 this board through the years has worked and  how 10 you enforce it and as organizers, how you guys   go 11 about helping tenants to enforce  that?12 MR . WOOD:	Sure.	Well , the first 13 proviso we got was back in the mid ‘ 80 ' s when the 14 issue was more warehousing , when buildings were 15 being emptied and we made an argument that   an 16 owner, if they really needed the rental income ,17 should rent the empty units first before  they 18 would get the RGB  increase .	And that was a  pretty 19 effective tool to, again, protect the tenants  in 20 buildings that were being emptied from undue – -21 rent increases .22 When it’ s a borderline case, it’ s23 sometimes difficult for the enforcement.	But the 24 proviso, the most recent proviso that had  been 25 approved by the Guideline Board, said that if   15 2 
2 percent or more of the building was deregulated  or 3 85 percent or more had to be used as   stabilized 4 housing, many of the buildings –- if you have   one 5 building deregulated, you usually have a  lot.6 So many of the hotels, you  know,7 just looking at the number , 13 , 000 units in 8 Community Board 7 , only 3 , 000 are stabilized.9 That means many buildings have significant  numbers 10 of deregulations where you only have ten  percent 11 of the building occupied by stabilized tenants .12 So usually it’ s almost black and white .	You can 13 tell pretty readily.	When it’ s the borderline ,14 it ’ s a little rougher.15 The proviso this year that ’ s16 being considered is 25  percent .	You know, that’ s17 –- that’ s a little harder to enforce because it’ s18 harder to know how many building – - how  many 19 units.	It ’ s hard for a tenant to tell .	It’ s not 20 that difficult from an enforcement point of  view,21 DHCR has the registration and knows which  are 22 registered and which is occupied by a   rent 23 stabilized tenant and how much they’ re paying and 24 which units are temporarily exempt or  permanently 25 exempt because they’ ve been deregulated or they’ re 2 
2 being rented out for some other  purpose.3 So if a tenant alleges that  they 4 don’ t have to pay the rent overcharge, they file  a5 complaint with DHCR.	DHCR can readily determine 6 whether or not the landlord has met  the 7 requirement of having X percent as regulated  units 8 in their building.9 We haven’ t had a proviso around 10 conditions but a proviso around rent  impairing 11 violations or violations placed by HPD can also  be 12 determined .13 The proviso around the 14 deregulated units, we’ ve won those over the years 15 because we ’ ve been able to demonstrate that most 16 owners were making a great rate of return in   their 17 building, in fact, making huge income on some  of 18 the deregulated units whether they ’ re renting to 19 the City, Department of Homeless Services,  they 20 were paying sometimes $ 3 , 000 a month for an SRO 21 unit, you know , it ’ s obscene when the stabilized 22 rent might have been $ 400 , $ 500 or $ 600 a month.23 It ’ s – - it really enabled those owners to do quite 24 well with those buildings.25 And it ’ s, I think, also evidenced 2 
2 by the fact that they’ re not down here  arguing 3 here for an increase.	I think we’ ve presented a4 lot of testimony indicating how much of a   hardship 5 it would be for the tenants that these owners   are 6 not here because they don’ t really need the 7 increase.	And there’ s no Rent Guideline Board 8 increase that you could propose that would  serve 9 as an incentive to keep these as stabilized  units.10 There’ s just so many other uses for these  units 11 that they’ re just going to go with the  higher 12 rent.13 And, in fact, there’ s such a  pent 14 up demand for this type of housing by --   evidenced 15 by all the illegal SROs out there that  we’ ve 16 really been insisting that the City look  at 17 allowing for new SRO construction or allow for  the 18 legalization of some of those illegally  converted 19 units so they’ re not fire traps but they meet  the 20 Health and Fire Codes and are really safe  housing.21 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Mr. Chair .22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.23 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you ,24 Larry.25 MR . WOOD:	Hey , Steven .2 
2 ( Applause. )3 MR . SCHLEIDER:	First , I think 4 you do great work.	You know that.5 A quick question on this  one.6 What is a B unit?	Just so I’ m clear on something.7 MR . WOOD:	A B unit is what  they 8 call an SRO unit.	It could –- they come  in 9 different sizes.	There’ s a chart that , depending 10 on when the building was converted , it might  have 11 been an apartment at one point .12 MR . SCHLEIDER:	All right .	So 13 these are just B units of a certain   quality,14 certain configuration?15 MR . WOOD:	It runs the gamut.16 Some of them are rooming housing.	Some of them 17 are apartments that were subdivided.	Some of them 18 were Class B hotels that were built as   hotel 19 units.20 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	Now you 21 have your first category was non- profit, includes 22 non- profit City placement and as you identified,23 your rent –-24 MR . WOOD:	But those are specific 25 non- profit owned buildings .	Not the placements by 2 
2 non- profit groups.3 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	Now –-4 now, of the almost 2 , 000 units , –-5 MR . WOOD:	Yeah.6 MR . SCHLEIDER:	–- those are 7 owned by non- profits?8 MR . WOOD:	Yes.9 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	And about 10 how many units are in each of those   buildings?11 MR . WOOD:	The non - profits have 12 generally acquired large hotels, Euclid  Hall,13 which we operate, has  160 units.	The Senate is 14 close to 200 .	Euclid Hall on 86 th Street is about 15 300 or so units.	So I think the largest – -  Times 16 Square .17 MR . SCHLEIDER:	So it ’ s roughly 18 five or six buildings then ?19 MR . WOOD:	No.	I think there’ s20 17 buildings altogether.21 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Seventeen 22 buildings.	You have a lot of small  buildings,23 aside from the large buildings ?24 MR . WOOD:	There’ s a few but not 25 much.	I think the smallest are maybe 60 units ,  of 2 
2 the big SROs that’ s been acquired by non- profits.3 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.4 MR . WOOD:	The biggest is Times 5 Square Hotel, also known as Common Ground on  43 rd 6 Street and that’ s almost 700 units .7 MR . SCHLEIDER:	All right .8 Okay.	Now , of these – - but that’ s not included in 9 Community District 7 ?10 MR . WOOD:	No , that’ s Community 11 Board 4 .12 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	Are these 13 buildings run profitably?14 MR . WOOD:	Whether they’ re 15 non- profit -- but yes, there is enough money  made 16 in the building that we build up a  reserve .17 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And this is 18 purely from the rents from your  residents?19 MR . WOOD:	It’ s from the – - yeah,20 the tenants, largely if they’ re eligible, do get 21 Section 8 .	There are some tenants who are  over 22 income for Section 8 because when the  buildings 23 were acquired by the non- profits, they might have 24 had preexisting tenants.	If the tenants were 25 below a certain income , they could get a Section  82 

2	--34
MR . SCHLEIDER:	Yeah.MR . WOOD:	–- which would bring 
5 down their rent burden .6 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	So the 7 average rent for these almost 2 , 000 units would be 8 approximately –-9 MR . WOOD:	Probably $ 700 , $ 800 ,10 in that ballpark.11 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	Are there 12 any expenses that the non- profits don’ t have that 13 a for- profit operator would have?14 MR . WOOD:	Yes , there’ s15 additional subsidies, SRO support money that  comes 16 to provide social workers onsite, people who  have 17 been formerly mentally ill , homeless and might 18 have substance abuse issues, they have a   counselor 19 to work with.20 MR . SCHLEIDER:	But those are –-21 but those are non –- those are non - shelter 22 services.	I’ m talking about the operations of the 23 building itself.24 MR . WOOD:	Well, we have money 25 management and medicine management of  some 5 
2 formerly homeless folks.	It’ s not just –- we’ re 3 not just a landlord.	We’ re there providing social 4 services onsite.5 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Oh, I appreciate 6 that.7 MR . WOOD:	Yeah.8 MR . SCHLEIDER:	But I ’ m talking 9 about just running , keeping the doors open , aside 10 from the non- shelter services which are important,11 I imagine, for the population that you ’ re serving,12 but water and sewer, maintenance, insurance,  are 13 there any expenses that you incur that you don ’ t14 –- let me put it  another way.	Are there any 15 expenses that a for- profit landlord would incur 16 that you as a non- profit do not?17 MR . WOOD:	I’ m not sure beyond 18 what they need to pull  out profit.	I’ m not sure 19 what other expense there may be that a for - profit 20 owner would have.	I don’ t know.	You know , maybe 21 a high mortgage?	I don’ t know .22 MR . SCHLEIDER:	What percentage 23 of real estate taxes then would you be paying as   a24 percentage of say, your  collections?25 MR . WOOD:	I’ d have to get you 2 
2 that data.	I don’ t know offhand.3 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Um - hum .	Okay.4 And do you have any supplemental income aside  from 5 just rent?	Do you have contributions,  subsidies 6 that go just to rent, not to the  non- shelter 7 services?8 MR . WOOD:	Our agency does.	I9 mean, do private fundraising and some of  that 10 money might support activities at the  building .	I11 –- it’ s not a significant amount.	The buildings 12 really have to operate on their –- on the   rental 13 income and the Section 8 subsidies they  get.14 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	Thank 15 you.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Larry, you 17 mentioned the Times Square Hotel.	Do any –- do 18 any of these, I would assume larger buildings  have 19 commercial space in them.20 MR . WOOD:	Yes.	Many do,21 particularly the ones up and down  Broadway .	In 22 fact, West Side Federation for Senior  Housing,23 regrets when they bought Euclid Hall on 86 th 24 Street , they net leased the ground floor to  the 25 original owner for the 99 - year lease.	So that 2 
2 owner is making a fortune on retaining  the 3 commercial space in that building and  the 4 non- profit has , you know, has to operate the 5 building without that income.6 And I know Laura Jervis  regrets 7 that deal.	She would have loved to have had  that 8 rental income, that supplement was needed in  that 9 building.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Adams.11 MS . ADAMS:	Yes.	Would you 12 repeat your recommendations to this board  –-13 MR . WOOD:	Well, we would 14 certainly would think it would be warranted for  a15 zero increase across the board for the  SROs.16 We ’ ve shown that – -17 ( Applause. )18 MR . WOOD:	–- the bulk of  the 19 SROs would not be eligible for an increase   with 20 the proviso at 85 percent and that ’ s what you did 21 the last two years when we were doing a one   size 22 fits all rent increase .	If you were going to do  a23 modest increase of one to two percent if   you 24 really felt it was  necessary.25 And there’ s no owners down here 2 
2 asking for it so I don ’ t believe it is .	But if 3 you were, we would ask that you increase  the 4 proviso back to being at least 85 percent used   for 5 stabilized purposes.	It was reduced to 25  percent 6 in the preliminary vote.	And we think that would 7 allow –-8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Seventy - five.9 MR . WOOD:	Seventy- five, right.10 So we’ d like to go back up to 85 .11 MS . ADAMS:	Okay.	Thank you.12 MR . WOOD:	Thank you, Betty.13 MR . CRUZ:	I have a  question.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes , Ms . Cruz.15 MS . CRUZ:	In the buildings that 16 are operated by not- for- profit organizations - -17 MR . WOOD:	Yes.18 MS . CRUZ:	–- with a zero  percent 19 increase or a one percent increase , how would  an 20 emergency repair be funded ?	How would a leaky 21 roof, how would a boiler that breaks down,   how 22 would an elevator that breaks down , be  funded?23 MR . WOOD:	Sure.24 MS . CRUZ:	How would you do  bed 25 bug abatement?	How would you do lead –-  lead 2 

2	paint abatement?34
MR . WOOD:	Sure.MS . CRUZ:	Could you just 
5 explain how?	I mean, I just can’ t –-6 MR . WOOD:	Sure.7 MS . CRUZ:	–- put my mind  around 8 the possibility of doing those kinds of  major 9 expenses with a zero percent rent increase .10 MR . WOOD:	Okay.	Well , the –- on 11 our experience of the buildings we run , we  are 12 building a reserve and we use the reserve to do   –-13 MS . CRUZ:	And how do you build  a14 reserve?15 MR . WOOD:	Because the income we 16 collect from the tenants’ rent plus the Section  817 exceeds the operating expenses in a given year .18 We built up quite a reserve in the Senate   Hotel 19 and we ’ re replacing the elevators this summer.20 MS . CRUZ:	And that’ s because 21 you’ re not paying certain expenses for your –-  you 22 have tax abatement ?23 MR . WOOD:	Because the rent is 24 set at a high enough rate that we’ re able to  cover 25 all the expenses plus put money in the   bank.5 
2 That’ s what it comes down to.3 ( Applause. )4 MS . CRUZ:	So your buildings are 5 taxed at full rates?6 MR . CHEIGH :	I ’ m assuming, Larry,7 you guys have a tax abatement that ’ s available to 8 any building owner in the  City .	Unless it ’ s – -9 I’ m assuming you guys must get 420 C abatement.10 MR . WOOD:	You know, I don ’ t know 11 the specific financing .	I know they’ re different.12 We have different SROs and the  financing,13 different agencies .	They were done at  different 14 times so I don ’ t know exactly the tax rates of 15 each one.16 MS . CRUZ:	Thank you.17 MR . WOOD:	Thank you.18 MS . CRUZ:	Enough said.	Thank 19 you.20 MR . WOOD:	Thank you.21 MS . HOLDER :	Larry, just to be 22 clear, because I keep getting  this question.	Tell 23 us who actually lives in SROs?	Because when you 24 think about how much people pay daily and then   you 25 extrapolate over the month , there are some people 2 
2 who don’ t understand why someone would live in  an 3 SRO.	Can you explain why people live in  SROs?4 We know and we hear the  phrases,5 " the housing of last resort."	But what does that 6 really mean?	And then also, could you tell us  the 7 condition of a lot of the SROs and how it   compares 8 to the condition of some of the other rooms   that 9 are being rented out in –- with the  private 10 market , in the same buildings?11 MR . WOOD:	Sure.	Okay, well,12 SROs basically have served a need for  single 13 households , basically and generally low income 14 folks.	They could be people new to the City  of 15 New York.	When I first moved into the City as   a16 student –- I attended school here  actually .	In 17 1976 I moved into an SRO in  midtown.18 MS . HOLDER :	And you majored in 19 Engineering; right ?20 MR . WOOD:	I did.	That’ s an 21 aside.22 But SRO housing didn’ t exist, you 23 know, at one point . But in the 1930 ' s during 24 another economic depression, a lot of  people 25 couldn ’ t make their mortgages so they took in 2 
2 extra boarders or they chopped up one and   two 3 family houses, similar to some of the  illegal 4 conversions that we’ re seeing now or they took  big 5 apartments and subdivided them into smaller  units.6 During –- then the City  actually 7 allowed for the legalization of these units  after 8 initially trying to crack down on  them .	Depending 9 on the building, the demographics can vary .10 Students certainly use SROs when they move  into 11 the City.	Truck drivers, construction workers ,12 actors , actresses who are here , you know, come and 13 go from the City.14 The Holland Hotel at one point  in 15 time was really used by the theater industry  and 16 was a luxurious SRO back in the ‘ 50 ' s.	So this 17 always provided a, you know, stock was used by   low 18 income singles .19 As the City encourages demolition 20 and conversion and didn’ t allow new SRO 21 construction, it really became more  depressed.22 The housing deteriorated.	In the 1970 ' s when 23 mental health institutions were closed , many 24 people were released and put  in SROs.	Some of 25 them were run as  group homes.	Some of them had 2 
2 social services in them.3 The demographics, you can  see 4 from the chart , kind of varied .	I ’ d say roughly a5 third of the people are probably on fixed  income,6 whether they’ re a retiree on Social Security 7 disability or veterans benefits, another  third 8 might be working poor, low  income people.	A lot 9 of people work in restaurants, waiters ,  porters,10 they’ re often in SROs.11 And then you have the people,  you 12 know, the retirees on fixed income , working  poor 13 and there’ s a lot of immigrants too, around  the 14 City, who live in SROs , sometimes with  families,15 which is not appropriate, but they ’ re just 16 squeezed out of the housing market and they’ re  in 17 an SRO unit.18 MS . HOLDER :	And the conditions?19 MR . WOOD:	It runs the gamut.20 Some of the smaller rooming houses , hotels had 21 gotten in bad shape at one point  in time.	The 22 flip side though is because some of  these 23 buildings have been used for tourism, some of   them 24 have been upgraded , but not the rooms that  have 25 the permanent stabilized tenant in them.	But as 2 
2 these buildings have been converted and  turned 3 into tourist buildings , they’ ve gotten 4 substantially upgraded .5 The –- I did include a permit  in 6 that little packet I brought with you –- I   handed 7 out to you .	This is an SRO on 87 th Street , 201 8 West 87 th Street. It had been an old Class  A9 multiple dwelling.	In other words , it had been an 10 apartment building at one  time .	It had been 11 converted to an SRO so people rented out  rooms .12 But it wasn’ t allowed –- you couldn’ t do daily 13 transient rentals in it.14 But the zoning in  that 15 neighborhood allows them to do transient  rentals.16 So they’ re actually converting it to a Class  B17 hotel at this point which would allow them to   do 18 tourist rentals.19 The Class A SRO units are  only 20 meant for long term  permanent tenants.	The Class 21 B hotel units are allowed to do transient   rentals 22 because they have higher fire safety provisions  in 23 them.	They might have sprinklers or other  things 24 in those particular buildings.25 MS . HOLDER :	And typically how 2 
2 large are these rooms?3 MR . WOOD:	The smallest unit 4 could be 60 to 80 square feet, by   law.5 Typically, they’ re between 80 and 100 square  feet 6 and you need to have 132 square feet for   two 7 people .	So it depends on the  building .	Rooming 8 houses tend to have  smaller units.	The Class B9 hotels tend to be around 100 square foot. And   then 10 you have some more limited number of  residential 11 Class A hotels which could be like  studio 12 apartments or small suites , like a small 13 apartment, basically.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Larry, thank 15 you.16 I’ m going to cut this.	I’ m17 sorry.18 MR . SCHLEIDER:	One – - just one 19 quick question .20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Because we’ re 21 going to – - we ’ ve got 90 people --22 MR . SCHLEIDER:	All right.	I’ ll 23 ask somebody else then .24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	–- signed up 25 and it ’ s not fair to everybody else in this room.2 

234	Larry.567
MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay. CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:		Thank you,MR . WOOD:	Thank you, Jonathan. ( Applause. )CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	James 
8 Anderson, who will be followed by Adele Bender .9 MS . BENDER :	Hello.	Good 10 morning.	My name is Adele  Bender.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Adele, James 12 Anderson.13 MS . BENDER :	What ?14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	James Anderson 15 is next.16 MS . BENDER :	Oh, I thought you 17 said Adele Bender.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Followed by 19 you.20 MS . BENDER :	Followed by me.21 I’ m sorry.	Okay.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is Mr.23 Anderson here?24 ( No response.)25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Wait a minute.8 
2 Don’ t go anyplace.	You may be next.3 Do you want to  speak?4 MR . SCHLEIDER:	He’ ll come back.5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Adele, why 6 don’ t you go.7 MS . BENDER :	Okay .	Good 8 morning.	My name is Adele  Bender.9 I am a member of the  Metropolitan 10 Council on Housing .	I also speak for and  work 11 with tenants and neighbors occasionally.	I’ m a12 member –- I used to work for the Joint   Public 13 Affairs Committee for older adults known as  JPAC,14 which is part of JASA and I am on the board of the 15 Queens Interagency Council on Aging, so, I   guess,16 much of my thrust, while I am concerned about   all 17 tenants, is on the senior citizen  issue.18 Speaking for myself, Social 19 Security has not gone up in going on three   years,20 but yet the rent goes up.	I don’ t qualify for 21 SCRIE.	Many seniors do not qualify for SCRIE  so 22 they’ re just about making it.	Maybe if they have 23 a couple of dollars more, two or three   dollars 24 more than the requirements for SCRIE, they ’ re 25 really , you know, they ’ re really biting the bullet 2 

2	financially.3
Food you could manipulate a
4 little , you know.	You can eat spaghetti  instead 5 of steak.	But , you know, it also affects the 6 restaurant business because a lot of us eat out   a7 lot less than we did.	And, remember, it’ s like a8 domino effect because there are waiters  and 9 waitresses that may work in a restaurant that  may 10 not have as many customers as they used to   because 11 there is a growing senior population and it is   a12 big concern.13 I have a friend that lives in   the 14 next block .	Her income on Social Security  alone 15 is $ 1 , 400 .	She belongs to one of the HMOs , so  she 16 pays them money and she has certain expenses  that 17 are not covered.	This is another issue.18 I have my rent to pay. Then  I19 have to pay my supplemental, my Medigap and  I20 don’ t have that much.	I’ m not going hungry.	I’ m21 not a big eater.	But, you know, it doesn’ t really 22 leave me very much at, you know, the end of   all 23 that.24 The other thing is , I think, it 25 affects, in my opinion , business.	I haven ’ t4 
2 bought anything –- anything new really for  several 3 years.	Why?	Because I’ d rather – - I’ m a little 4 hesitant.	I’ m spending more money on more 5 clothing so I make  due .	And that goes for a  lot 6 of other people and it ’ s, again, a domino effect,7 because people are not purchasing that many  things 8 unless it is absolutely necessary.	So , I think,9 it also contributes to a negative  economy.10 As I say, there are also  health 11 issues .	There are food issues and , you know,  this 12 is why , I think, the increase in Social –- I’ m13 sorry, the increases in the rents, you have to   do 14 something about it .	As I say, we have a   growing 15 senior population and I was up in Albany last   week 16 and I really wish I were a clone because I    could 17 be here and I could be up in Albany again   today.18 But I can’ t.19 So I really hope that you  will 20 take all these things into consideration.	Again,21 as I say, that seniors are a growing   population 22 and our income is limited.	But –- and for many  of 23 us the rents keep going  up .	So I think that  you 24 will take my testimony into serious  consideration.25 Thank you very much.2 

2345	Adele.67	a question .8910	Adriene, hi.1112
CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.( Applause. )MS . HOLDER :	I have a  question,CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Adele, there’ sMS . BENDER :	Yes.MS . HOLDER :	Thanks for your –-Thanks for your testimony today. Could you tell us just in  your 
13 roles –- I appreciate your personal testimony,  but 14 even in your roles as an advocate with Met   Council 15 and with other groups, what are the biggest  issues 16 outside of affordability, because I know that’ s17 huge?18 MS . BENDER :	Well , –-19 MS . HOLDER :	What are the 20 biggest issues that you hear people are  doing?21 MS . BENDER :	I always talk about 22 the three big Hs, health, housing  and hunger.	And 23 there is a lot of  hunger around.	Trust me . And so 24 these, you know, these are health related  issues 25 too.	If your rent is too much , you may not  eat 13 
2 what you’ re supposed to eat, you know, depending 3 upon your situation.	I know people that cut – -  I4 have one friend and I’ ll tell you right  now,5 $ 1 , 400 she gets in her Social Security .	She gets 6 –- she needs very expensive medication for  her 7 eyes.	And that medication costs her a  few 8 hundreds dollars.9 So , you know, she’ ll sometimes 10 cut what she takes on  her medication.	And this 11 is , you know, that we’ re not talking about health,12 we ’ re talking about housing, but I hope that you 13 people will understand that many of these  things 14 are interrelated and these are her  eyes.15 ( Applause. )16 MS . BENDER :	And she takes less 17 sometimes and there are a lot of people that   take 18 a half a pill or take less drops for their eyes   or 19 whatever it is because what the rent is –-   you 20 can’ t manipulate the rent.	You can manipulate the 21 food, instead of steak you ’ ll have spaghetti.22 You’ ll shop in another supermarket or another 23 grocery, but when it comes to the rent , this  is 24 frozen .25 And when you have to make up  your 2 
2 mind well, should I take a half a pill , should  I3 take a whole pill, well, my rent is coming   up?4 You know this is  scary .	My Medigap is going up 5 and I say, you know, I ’ m in good shape .	If I live 6 another 10 or 15 years , am I going to be able   to 7 keep paying my Medigap , you know.8 So I know we’ re talking about 9 rents but, you know, they are connected  and,10 again, I’ m hoping that you will take all  these 11 things into consideration.12 Look, I know there are  young 13 people too and there are young families, you  know,14 like they got four people living in a one –-   a15 teeny one- bedroom apartment.	It’ s a big important 16 social issue.	The economy , as we all know , they 17 say it ’ s going up but a lot of them are  hurting.18 People are still losing their jobs .19 So , you know, a lot of people  are 20 hurting.	I’ m a senior but I know a lot of   seniors 21 are helping their children and  grandchildren.22 Because I go to the senior centers and I   hear 23 these stories.	So really, you know,  housing,24 again, is as I say , a basic human need and I   know 25 that we’ re dollars –- we – - every, you know, money 2 
 2 makes the world go round.	But , please , I’ m hoping 3 that you will take the human element  into 4 consideration when you make a decision on   these 5 rents.6 Thank you very much.	Any other 7 questions?8 ( Applause. )9 MR . CHEIGH :	Just quickly, could 10 you reiterate, when was the last Social  Security 11 increase?	This is Brian.12 MS . BENDER :	The last Social 13 Security increase –- everybody answer  that .	I14 don’ t know .	I don ’ t know if I got the last one.15 There’ s two –- I think there’ s another year –-16 MS . HOLDER :	Three years ago, 17	2008 .18 MS . BENDER :	Going on three years 19 there’ s been no Social Security income –-20 increase, rather.	We’ ll be going this year, will 21 be the third year there’ s been no Social  Security 22 increase.	Okay.23 Anything else?24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25 MS .

( Applause. )CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	James MR . ANDERSON:	I’ m here again 
6 because before you don ’ t ask me question,7 discriminate me.	And I want to point to these  two 8 people .	I don ’ t know their name.	Ask me 9 questions that I like.	If you don ’ t ask me the 10 one you like.11 Expenses of the building never 12 coming down.	Management. How we thinking to  cut 13 the tax if we have too many parasites in the   City,14 State and federal government level .	School people 15 receive big salary and they are against the  City.16 Can never be.17 Fuel sometime little coming down.18 Then going up.	Insurance, the same thing.	After 19 they demolish 2 Trade World Central,  insurance 20 company raise as much as they want , 10 , 20 21 percent.	They don ’ t care.	They just rise 22 insurance.23 And you see two politicians  being 24 today.	They just mislead tenants and  they 25 declare that they’ re for tenant.	They only for 6 
2 themselves to receive big salary. And  they 3 increase them salary every year.	City broke for 4 working people and for Commissioners,  Deputy 5 Commissioners, the system, the City Council,  and 6 other not broke.	Before a few years, they  rise 7 the salary of big shots in the City, 10 ,  12 8 percent, maybe go more .9 And the mayor, next mayor  now 10 will receive $ 224 , 000 salary.	This is the second 11 salary in the United States after the  President.12 And second one after the President  is 13 vice- president , Speaker of the House then –- and 14 others .	So we have big corruption .15 Affordable houses for big  family 16 with lower income, City employees they do not   have 17 in 1970 , until now , 41 years, no one city project.18 And they cannot help anymore because they have  819 billion –- 8 billions  deficit.20 The mayor, who is a  billionaire,21 he ’ s a rich bum.	He just give interview to the  TV 22 and two, three days going Bahama to relax  because 23 there are safety and very good for  the health.	So 24 he know how to get to make 8 billions for him    but 25 don’ t know how get to straight City deficit.	And 2 
2 City Council are City comedians.	They cannot do 3 nothing.4 So all the business  between 5 landlord and tenant, we must to take care not   to 6 fight. Serious landlord repair manage correct  and 7 serious tenants do not make damage , even pay  a8 little late, still all right.	This way we ’ re not 9 supposed to fight they take  care.10 Any questions?	No sit down and 11 tell me that I  like.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Anderson.13 Are there any questions?14 MR . ANDERSON:	No questions.15 You discriminate me.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	No questions.17 MR . ANDERSON:	I going report to 18 the District Attorney.	Don’ t want to talk with 19 me .20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.21 Larus Westvind , who will be 22 followed by James Jones, who will be followed  by 23 Ed Korman.24 MR .

2 owners of SRO buildings in Central  Harlem.3 We have small buildings.	There 4 are approximately 15 buildings altogether.	Four 5 of us are senior citizens.	We run the buildings 6 by ourselves and we have great  difficulty 7 understanding why we don’ t get the rent  increases 8 that rent stabilized apartments get.9 We have higher expenses.	We 10 don’ t rent to tourists . Last time I was here I  was 11 told that the reason we don’ t get rent  increases 12 is because we rent rooms for $ 100 a day or $ 1 , 000 13 a week .	This is simply not true.	It doesn’ t14 occur.15 Our tenants are mostly steady 16 tenants and besides it ’ s against the law not to 17 rent to anybody for less than 30 days, as far as   I18 know.19 Our expenses, as you know,  as 20 Patrick pointed out, real estate taxes , water and 21 sewer, insurance, oil, all have gone  up 22 tremendously and yet you’ re not granting any rent 23 increases.24 Larry Wood representing the 25 non- profit large hotels downtown that have 2 
2 commercial –- commercial spaces in their  buildings 3 as well, he may not need any rent increases,   but 4 we do.	Absolutely .5 An SRO , you not only have to  keep 6 the building in good shape , you have to keep  the 7 building clean .	You have bathrooms to clean.	We 8 have to hire people to clean bathrooms ,  kitchens 9 and, often , we also pay for the utilities for  the 10 tenants, most of the time.11 So we need at least a six   percent 12 increase this year .13 ( Audience participation.)14 MR . WESTVIND:	And we need an 15 increase, at least the same increase every  year,16 as the rent stabilized apartments  get.17 Any questions?18 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Yes.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.20 A VOICE:	What’ s your profit 21 margin ?22 MR . WESTVIND:	My profit 23 margin –-24 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Among the owners 25 that are here, it’ s four buildings that you’ re 2 

2	representing?3
MR . WESTVIND:	No, I’ m
4 representing approximately 15 buildings.	Four 5 owners .6 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Four owners.7 And approximately how many units  per building?	Or 8 an average or the total number of  units?9 MR . WESTWIND:	Maybe eight or 10 eight to twelve.11 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	And 12 they’ re all rent stabilized?13 MR . WESTWIND:	They’ re all rent 14 stabilized .	Well, they’ re not rent stable –-15 well, they ’ re –- we have to register them, you 16 know, yearly with DHCR , but they don’ t come under 17 the same rule as rent stabilized  apartments 18 because they’ re SROs.19 There’ s also the difficulty with 20 doing any improvements to the building because  we 21 have to get a Certificate of No Harassment   –-22 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Um- hum.23 MR . WESTWIND:	–- which is a,  you 24 know, there are already laws against  harassing 25 people , yet they have this agency that now  charges 4 
2 $ 1 , 500 .	They send an investigator that  interviews 3 all the tenants, that goes through the  whole 4 building and it takes six months – -5 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Before you can 6 do any improvement .7 MR . WESTVIND:	Before you can do 8 any improvements.9 There’ s a lot of restrictions 10 that don’ t seem to make any sense whatsoever  apart 11 from keeping these organizations alive  and 12 supporting these people.	It must cost the City  a13 tremendous amount of money .	I wonder how many 14 people the City employs for these  SRO 15 organizations that certainly don’ t help us any .16 They make life difficult for  us.17 MR . SCHLEIDER:	So how are you 18 managing to keep these buildings afloat?	Because 19 our documents here show that the – - the  price 20 index of operating costs for rent  stabilized 21 hotels , SROs, rooming houses and such, went up  a22 greater percentage than it went up for a   typical 23 apartment building .24 MR . WESTVIND:	Well, we get less 25 money in our pocket after we’ re finished.	That’ s2 
2 basically it.	You know, we don’ t do this because 3 we enjoy doing it.	I mean , we enjoy doing it to  a4 certain extent like, you know, people  enjoy 5 working, but we want to be compensated fairly  for 6 it and we don’ t want to be discriminated  against 7 and that’ s what we feel we are .8 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .9 MS . HOLDER :	I have a  question.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Holder.11 MS . HOLDER :	So I ’ m still 12 confused.	So of the 15 buildings with 8 to   12 13 units in them per building , how many of those  or 14 what percentage of those are regulated ?15 MR . WESTVIND:	Are what?16 MS . HOLDER :	Are rent regulated?17 Subject to rent stabilization law?18 MR . WESTWIND:	They’ re all rent 19 –- all the buildings – - all the SRO units  are 20 subject to the rent stabilization  laws .	But, as 21 you know, you give different increases to  rent 22 stabilized apartments than you do to SRO units .23 Are you familiar with that ?	Has any one of  you 24 ever been in an  SRO?25 MS . HOLDER :	Yes.2 
2 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Yes.3 MR . WESTVIND:	Do you know how  it 4 is to operate an  SRO?5 MS . HOLDER :	Yes.	But I – - but 6 you’ re saying that all 15 of these buildings,  all 7 the units in them are rent  regulated?8 MR . WESTVIND:	Well, yes, they 9 are.	You have to by according to law,  register 10 each unit with DHCR every year .11 MS . HOLDER :	That ’ s not what I’ m12 asking you .13 MR . WESTVIND:	What are you 14 trying to say?15 MS . HOLDER :	I ’ m asking you if 16 they are rent stabilized units .	Are they rent 17 stabilized units?18 MS . CRUZ:	They’ re rent 19 stabilized hotel units ; are they not?20 MR . WESTVIND:	Is an SRO unit 21 rent stabilized?22 MS . CRUZ:	Yes.23 MS . HOLDER :	Are each of the 24 units –-25 MR . WESTVIND:	Is SRO –-2 
2 I’ m asking you a question.	Are SRO units rent 3 stabilized ?4 MS . HOLDER :	Not all of them.5 MS . WESTVIND:	They’ re not?6 MS . HOLDER :	No.7 MS . WESTVIND:	What could they 8 be ?	What are the alternatives?9 MS . HOLDER :	Well, I’ m just –- do 10 you rent to students?	You have long term tenants?11 MR . WESTVIND:	Yes.12 MS . HOLDER :	And they have 13 leases ?14 MR . WESTVIND:	Yes.15 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .	And have you 16 all in those 15 buildings, have you been able   to 17 get a Certificate of No Harassment ?18 MR . WESTVIND:	Yes.19 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .	And so you 20 don’ t have any problems taking any increases if 21 you need to?22 MR . WESTVIND:	Of course I  do.23 MS . HOLDER :	Why?24 MR . WESTVIND:	I’ m not allowed 25 to .	You tell me how much I’ m allowed to  increase 2 

2	the rent.3
MS . HOLDER :	But with the 
4 proviso, through the years when there has been  a5 proviso with – -6 MR . WESTVIND:	Well, the last 7 time I was here, two years ago , you gave a 4 . 58 percent increase.	That’ s the last time I got an 9 increase.10 MS . HOLDER :	Right.	And so – -11 MR . WESTVIND:	Last year there 12 was no increase.13 MS . HOLDER :	So if there was a14 proviso that said if 85 percent or more of   the 15 units are actually rent regulated, subject to  rent 16 regulation , you can get the increase?17 MR . WESTVIND:	Everything is 18 subject to rent regulation , all the units.19 MR . SCHLEIDER:	In your 20 buildings.21 MS . HOLDER :	Your buildings.22 MR . WESTVIND:	They’ re all 23 registered with DHCR, all of the units .24 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And this is what 25 we ’ ve been trying to bring forth what the average,4 
2 that when you have the percent , is the  high 3 percentage units that are consistent with the  law 4 and consistent with the intent that these  owners 5 should be allowed to extract an  increase.6 MS . HOLDER :	And that’ s what a7 proviso would provide them .8 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Yes.9 MR . WESTVIND:	Pardon ?10 MS . HOLDER :	Yes.11 MR . SCHLEIDER:	But you would 12 have zero percent increase even though you do   have 13 this percentage of –- of – -14 MS . HOLDER :	But that was not  my 15 question.	I asked if there was an increase  but 16 there was a proviso in place, if he would be   able 17 to take advantage of that and he’ s saying  yes,18 because he ’ s saying that 100 percent of the units 19 are subject to rent regulations.	So that’ s20 what – -21 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And then they 22 deserve their increase because their  operating 23 expenses are rising.	They ’ re not offset.24 MR . WESTVIND:	We’ re not – -25 you’ re just –- you ’ re not giving us –- why aren’ t2 
 2 you giving us the rent  increase?3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is that –- is 4 that the case with all the other buildings  too 5 that the rest of your group  –-6 MR . WESTVIND:	Pardon ?7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is that the 8 case also with all the other buildings  also?9 MR . WESTVIND:	Yes, all of them.10 MR . CHEIGH :	Can I ask what  the 11 average rents are in the units ?12 MR . WESTVIND:	Probably around 13	$ 600 to $ 700 .14 MR . CHEIGH :	And are these –-15 how many other units share a kitchen – - are  they 16 typically like one kitchen per floor and there ’ s17 four units ?18 MR . WESTVIND:	It varies.	But 19 there are some units with kitchens and others  that 20 share a common kitchen .	They all share bathrooms.21 MR . CHEIGH :	And if most of  the 22 units are occupied because there are long  term 23 tenants in them?24 MR . WESTVIND:	If I didn’ t keep 25 them occupied, I would not be able to pay   my 14 

2	taxes.345	located?6
MR . CHEIGH :	Okay .MS . HOLDER :	Where are the units MR . WESTVIND:	In Harlem.	All of 
7 these buildings are in central  Harlem.8 MR . CHEIGH :	And when you –-  when 9 you mean eight units, that means eight SRO  rooming 10 units?11 MR . WESTVIND:	Right.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 Thank you.14 MR . WESTVIND:	You’ re welcome .15 Oh , by the way , I have one other 16 thing.	I was told by Larry there that at   one 17 point, apparently, you had different increases ,18 you had like – - you had an increase for units  like 19 we have, buildings like we have, but not for   the 20 large hotels that don’ t need them.	Now we need 21 the increases.	Maybe you could do it that  way .	I22 don’ t know .	But, you know , if you have a  large 23 hotel that ’ s subsidized both by the City and by 24 tax incentives , they have commercial units , and 25 it ’ s a non - profit organizations, they’ re fine.7 
2 But we ’ re not.	We need the rent increases .3 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .4 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	Are you units 5 rooming house units or  SROs?6 MR . WESTVIND:	Rooming units,7 SRO.	What ’ s the difference between –-8 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	But there’ s a9 distinction in the law .	We set guidelines .	We 10 can set –- there’ s five different classifications.11 So when you register your units, are  they 12 registered as rooming house units or  SROs?13 There’ s a difference within the law.14 MR . WESTVIND:	I have –- I15 frankly, I don ’ t know what the difference is.	And 16 I don’ t think any one of us  knows.17 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	It sounds like 18 they may be rooming house rooms, which are  under 19 hotel guidelines, don’ t get me wrong.	But there’ s20 a difference between – - under the law between  an 21 SRO and a rooming  house.22 A VOICE:	How do you know  the 23 difference ?24 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	It’ s how the 25 building was originally registered and how it  –-2 
2 the C of O on the building   –-3 MR . WESTVIND:	We don ’ t have 4 C of O ’ s.	None of these buildings have C of  O’ s.5 MS . HOLDER :	You have to have a  C6 of O.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	Thank 8 you.9 We appreciate you coming in.10 MR . WESTVIND:	But this is a11 very important question here.	Do you think we  can 12 clarify that before I leave, what this  difference 13 is ?14 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	Sure, if you 15 want to get in touch with me, that ’ s fine.	We can 16 –- we can try to help you figure   it out.	Andrew 17 McLaughlin .18 MR . WESTVIND:	Okay.	Thank you.19 ( Applause. )20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.21 James Jones.22 MR . JONES:	In the colloquial 23 usage section of the English language, the  female 24 fakes the role of the man in a   lesbian 25 relationship is described as a bull dagger .2 
2 At one point the mayor ’ s board on 3 New York City Police directed Jones back to  the 4 Law Department , 100 Church , for further 5 clarification on their summary .	Jones was met by 6 a second officer, Rita Dumain.	Rita Dumain 7 indicated their first officer did not error  or 8 make a mistake in the  summary.9 Two women cannot reproduce life.10 Two men cannot reproduce life.	It is reported by 11 the Zonderun that those attitudes will attract  the 12 wrath of God.	College level Biology will show  you 13 that reproductive organs exist between the man  and 14 wombman, W - o- m - b- m - a- n .	Spell it. College Biology 15 uses the word uterus.	Some did not go to  college 16 to see this.17 There was an article in  an 18 earlier edition " Smithsonian Magazine, "19 Washington , D. C., about Henry Tudor, monarch of 20 England.	His grandson ordered the  bible 21 translated into English.	Henry Tudor ordered 22 England’ s relations when the Vatican Rome Italy 23 severed beyond a shadow of a  doubt .	According to 24 this article, Smithsonian Magazine , many would 25 have you believe the issue was Henry Tudor ’ s wife.2 
2 England simultaneously contemporaneously stopped 3 sending wagons loaded with gold and silver  money 4 to the Vatican , Rome, Italy. $ $$ – - dollar sign,5 dollar sign, dollar sign.6 Senior tenants indicated these 7 Negroes are notorious about pocketing large  sums 8 of money.	Some facts about the Democratic  party,9 United States, have been suppressed.10 When news of Abraham Lincoln’ s11 election as president, Republican abolitionists,12 reached the Southern Democratic Party,  the 13 Democratic Party took a vote to destroy  this 14 nation .	Abraham Lincoln had not even taken  the 15 oath of office before the Democratic Party  voted 16 to destroy this nation .	Abraham Lincoln was known 17 to be planning to abolish unpaid labor ,  cheap 18 slave labor.19 The Democratic Party were –-20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Jones, I’ m21 going to ask you to wrap  up.22 MR . JONES:	The Democratic Party 23 were the principal dealers in this cheap,  unpaid 24 labor.	This Negro CEO and his organization  were 25 absentees, absenteeism , 1880 Seventh Avenue,2 
2 Powell Boulevard.	The boiler exploded , blowed up 3 one Sunday night; entire building was  lifted 4 diagonally , diagonally .	Senior tenants responded.5 This Negro CEO rushed in 9 : 00 a. m. Monday morning 6 after parking the luxury automobile on the  street.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Jones,8 please wrap.9 Thank you.10 ( Applause. )11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Any questions?12 ( No response.)13 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Is there more ?14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ed Korman who 15 will be followed by Maggie  Silver.16 MR . KORMAN :	My name is Edward 17 Korman .	I ’ m the Executive Vice President of the 18 Small Property Owners of New  York.19 Good morning, Mr. Chairman and 20 members of the board – - or make it good  afternoon.21 You have heard and will  continue 22 to hear from owners, mostly small owners  about 23 rising costs, fuel repairs both real estate  and 24 water taxes that are needed to pay for  City 25 workers.2 
2 You will also hear about 3 protections for the tenants.	What about financial 4 protections for the small owners?5 Rising assessments , new laws 6 geared for the tenants , Section 8  applicants 7 cannot be turned away.	There are many small 8 houses that still have rents in the $ 600 and $ 700 9 range which cannot sustain the rising  costs.10 We all have to share the  burden 11 of rising costs.	Vendors pass on to us  as 12 government passes increases on to  them .	We need 13 to pass some of these on to  tenants.14 Speaker Quinn once said, so 15 owners will make a little bit  less .	If some 16 owners make any less than they are now , they  could 17 be out on the street.	They could get another job 18 to support their buildings or they could be out   on 19 the street .20 Government is cutting back  on 21 subsidies.	The first ones affected is the  rental 22 properties .	The small owner does not have  the 23 volume of income, as larger earners do as well   as 24 dealing with vendors.	Rent –- all we hear  about 25 how landlord treat tenants .	Let’ s hear about how 2 
2 tenants treat their apartments and the expenses  to 3 the owners for tenant destruction, for  the 4 professional tenants that have a country  home,5 fall behind on rent.	Take me to court .	The 6 courts are as congested as Grand Central  Station 7 and getting worse.8 The administration does not think 9 about the ‘ 70 ' s and ‘ 80 ' s that we had.	They 10 better open their eyes because they’ re coming 11 back.12 This is, and will continue to  be,13 the cause of the deterioration and loss of   fine 14 buildings, homelessness and unaffordable housing,15 mostly in the six to 15 - family range.	Houses 16 which are owned and maintained by small owners ,17 mom and pop owners and newly migrated  families 18 that have saved to be able to own a piece of    this 19 wonderful City .	Many of them will , and are losing 20 their homes and investments.21 There are a lot of good  owners 22 that care for their tenants but no one cares   as 23 long as they can get – - try to get the tenants   to 24 live rent free .	Tenants that are on subsidies .25 They have jobs working off the books and   working 2 
2 off the books is why owners will not rent to   some 3 tenants.	And you also have tenants with more  than 4 one identity.5 Many owners are starting to  sell 6 off, unfortunately , for the tenants the only ones 7 that are able to buy are the foreign  developers 8 with cash.	Do you know what they do to  housing 9 when they get through with the housing  industry?10 They’ ll be nobody but rich and projects.11 I would like to repeat one  thing 12 about the real estate taxes that are increased  by 13 assessments of the property as well as the   current 14 rate increases .	I think this is called  double 15 jeopardy.	We need rent increases to sustain  all 16 the housing industry in the City of New  York.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.18 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Question.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.20 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .21 SPONY is a long  established 22 organization?23 MR . KORMAN :	Yes.24 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And approximately 25 how many members does your organization  have?2 

23	thousand.4
MR . KORMAN :	About two to three MR . SCHLEIDER:	Two to three 
5 thousand.	And you mentioned a range of  building 6 size, 6 to 15 .	That’ s the typical building size 7 for your members?8 MR . KORMAN :	Yeah.	There are –-9 that’ s the approximate size.	There could be one 10 or two other owners that have maybe 20   families.11 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.12 MR . KORMAN :	Really, I have 13 no –-14 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And the 15 percentage of your membership that owns  multiple 16 buildings?17 MR . KORMAN :	I don ’ t think so.	I18 think if they own multiple buildings, it’ s no  more 19 than two or three if  any.20 MR . SCHLEIDER:	All right.	So 21 they don’ t have the efficiencies of portfolios say 22 that Mr. Rosenberg has .23 MR . KORMAN :	Correct.24 MR . SCHLEIDER:	He owns 50 25 buildings; right?5 
 2 MR . KORMAN :	Correct.3 MR . SCHLEIDER:	So how do your 4 members then cope with squeezed net  operating 5 income , squeezed margins?	How do they do  it 6 when – -7 MR . KORMAN :	A lot of them –-  a8 lot of them have – - a lot of them have   jobs. 9 MR . SCHLEIDER:	–- with expenses 10	–-11 MR . KORMAN :	And they’ re 12 subsidizing their properties.	Unfortunately,13 right now I have to subsidize one property   because 14 two out of six tenants are behind in their   rent 15 more than 25 or 30 percent of my total   annual 16 income .	And I doubt whether I ’ m going to get it.17 They keep going to court asking for a –- what   do 18 you call it?19 MS . HOLDER :	Extension .20 Adjournment.21 MR . KORMAN :	Adjournments and 22 adjournments and more adjournments and  more 23 adjournments and the judges give them.	And then 24 they give them an adjournment and then they go   and 25 the judge says you have to pay or   get out.	Then 11 
2 they come with a letter from some  organization 3 says we’ re gonna help support you and it  takes 4 months and months and months.	The rents keep 5 falling behind and it’ s not a good situation  out 6 there.7 We would like to have –- none  of 8 my buildings have a violation by  the way.	Every 9 building is clean.	I take care of my  buildings.10 I put cameras in my buildings to protect   the 11 tenants in a 13 - family building and you know what 12 the tenants did, they took the  cameras down.	We 13 caught them because they’ re not smart enough or 14 they’ re stupid that when they come up to  the 15 camera to see them taking them down, their  picture 16 is in there.	We gave it to the police .17 These are the things that  the 18 tenants are doing.	And it ’ s time that we got a19 fair share and be able to make a decent   income 20 without having to support it where I had to   break 21 my back all the years to build up a   portfolio.22 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Across your 23 membership ’ s portfolio , about how many apartments 24 would be eligible say for the supplemental  that 25 was passed a couple of years  ago?2 
2 MR . KORMAN :	I don ’ t know that 3 amount but out of –- and I have one building is   a4 six family .	I have two that are paying $ 600  and 5 one in the six - family that ’ s paying about $ 700 .6 This is going on for  years .	They were there 7 before I even bought the building so I can ’ t  even 8 get a vacancy increase or anything like  that.9 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	And across 10 your membership’ s portfolio then, the average 11 length of residency for these  tenants?12 MR . KORMAN :	They’ re pretty long 13 I have them.	And if you think that  if 14 deregulation is going to happen, you can only  get 15 if you have a Section 8 tenant , you could only   get 16 what Section 8 allows, which is a   preferential 17 rent and it can go on for years and years   and 18 years.19 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Right .	Thank 20 you.21 MR . CHEIGH :	I have some quick 22 questions.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Cheigh.24 MR . CHEIGH :	How many buildings 25 do you own , sir?2 
2 MR . KORMAN :	Three right now.3 MR . CHEIGH :	Three right now.4 And did you take the  minimum 5 increases that were available to  you?6 MR . KORMAN :	I can ’ t hear you.7 MR . CHEIGH :	Did you take the 8 minimum surcharges , the minimum increases from 9	2009 to 2010 ?10 MR . KORMAN :	Would you please 11 repeat that?12 MR . CHEIGH :	The minimum 13 increases, did you take the minimum increases,  the 14 surcharges ?15 MR . KORMAN :	What do you mean 16 the surcharges ?17 MR . CHEIGH :	For long term 18 tenants who pay less than $ 1 , 000 ?19 MR . KORMAN :	Yeah.	One –- I  took 20 one, and what I did was and because –- until   the 21 court decision was there, I escrowed that  money 22 and put it away in case I had    to give it back to 23 that person.	And that person knew about  it.24 MR . CHEIGH :	And where are your 25 buildings located?10 
2 MR . KORMAN :	Bushwick.3 Ridgewood, Bushwick.4 MR . CHEIGH :	And what are the 5 market rate rents in that area ?6 MR . KORMAN :	I don ’ t know.7 Somewhere in - –8 MR . CHEIGH :	You don’ t know the 9 market rate rents?10 MR . KORMAN :	The market rate 11 rents –- it depends on what’ s going on in  the 12 area.	New developers are coming in.	They ’ re 13 rehabbing the buildings with untold amounts  of 14 cash, which we don ’ t have, and they could be 15 getting, 2 , 3 , $ 4 , 000 and a lot of the houses are 16 empty because they can ’ t rent them .17 MR . SCHLEIDER:	How many 18 vacancies do you have?19 MR . KORMAN :	Right now I –-20 thank God I’ m not –- I have no  vacancies.21 MR . SCHLEIDER:	All right. So 22 then, obviously, your rents are, would  you 23 characterize them as below market?24 MR . KORMAN :	Yes.25 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	Thank 2

7 ladies and gentlemen.	My name is Maggie  Silver.8 I’ m from Bronx , New York.9 I would like to tell you part  of 10 this whole thing – - what I have in my mind  which 11 is true.	I’ m certainly glad that I’ m talking to 12 you people in here today because many people  even 13 so because they are seeking staff and not able   to 14 work good, they didn’ t made it down  here.15 And so glad that I have a   few 16 friends and then they really appreciate what I ’ m17 doing.18 But most of this it’ s very 19 important to let you people know up there, and   I20 want you to understand then we live in very   poor 21 communities where we don’ t receive income in  order 22 to pay the rent.	That ’ s the first of all that I’ m23 gonna tell you .	Maybe sometimes at night, and  I24 know, because I’ m a mother of seven kids and  I25 come along and this here, in this country, when   my 7 
2 husband pass away, I had to work three jobs and   I3 was miserable and then I had to pay tuition   and 4 all that.5 But that’ s past.	This is the 6 present time now.	Remember 1963 , 1964 , 1965 , we 7 don’ t have as much people that we have in  the 8 present time.	Just only to freshen your memory  a9 little bit only, you know, because I know that   you 10 know this.	But now it ’ s very difficult.	We have 11 more people.	We got to have more  housing 12 available for poor communities , for poor people 13 who live in there who doesn’ t have enough  income 14 to pay the rent.15 Now on top of this , the landlords 16 they are sometimes overcharging and they’ re –-17 because people don ’ t speak English and don ’ t18 understand the rules and regulations of the  law.19 They just let it go far and  far.20 Like in my building where I  live,21 we have 88 apartments.	We have only five that  are 22 Section 8 .	The rest of the people they got  to 23 work hard. Sometimes they have two and three  jobs 24 in order to pay the  rent.25 The landlord don’ t give us really 2 
2 what we deserve.	Like myself, I had my ceiling  in 3 there for January of this year , three  times 4 collapse and right now my ceiling is not  fixed .5 It has been over a month. The landlord don ’ t  care.6 They don’ t care for that.7 We don ’ t have the services that 8 really we deserve –- because, you know why ,  we 9 have stabilized rents.	And myself , I really – - I10 really like for the law to state because we  don’ t11 have enough income to pay all this gas   and 12 electric.	We have to pay  telephone bills.	We 13 have to pay the rent and all this coming from   a14 small income coming every month.15 Now landlords –- and I ’ m going to 16 tell you this and I don’ t feel the –- I  don’ t17 think that the landlords, some of them ’ s going to 18 feel, you know , like I ’ m disrespect of them.	No,19 no .	I ’ m not disrespect of nobody.20 But they’ re packing a lot of 21 money in there , living on the people who pays  more 22 than they’ re supposed to when they live –- more  or 23 less than ten years for one room charging $ 1 , 100 .24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Silver,25 I’ m going to have to ask you to wrap up,  please.2 
2 MS . SILVER :	What was that?3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I’ m going to 4 ask you to please wrap up.	You’ ve run out of 5 time.6 You can finish –- you can  finish.7 You can finish what you’ re saying.8 MS . SILVER :	All right.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I’ m just 10 asking you to please draw to a   close.11 MS . SILVER :	All right.	All 12 right.	I’ m sorry.	But I’ m here to say what I ’ m13 supposed to say and I’ m glad that you  people 14 listen to me.	I hope you taking this as  very 15 serious, you know.16 And thank you so much.	Okay.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.18 ( Applause. )19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Any questions?20 ( No response.)21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.22 Faith Steinberg.23 MS . SILVER :	Any questions?24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	No, they 25 didn’ t have any.2 
2 MS . SILVER :	Okay .3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.4 MS . SILVER :	Have a good day.5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You too .6 MS . STEINBERG:	Hi.	Good 7 morning or is it afternoon already ?8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	It’ s9 afternoon.10 MS . STEINBERG:	What I’ m saying 11 is primarily addressed to the public  members.12 When I started appearing  before 13 this board in the mid 1990 ' s under Giuliani’ s14 administration , the board was comprised of all 15 white men which included Latino, if I   remember 16 correctly.	Some of us complained and now there’ s17 a more satisfactory, not perfect, but mixture  of 18 gender and race.19 But the public do not, nor  ever 20 did, represent the population of  our City.	You 21 are financiers from the real estate industry  and 22 generally from the business world.	Where are the 23 educators and the social workers, and  heaven 24 forefend, ( sic ) labor leaders?25 This board is ruled by  a2 
2 plutocrat, with his billions, multiple homes  and 3 offshore bank accounts and does everything  to 4 maintain his status and those of his  fellow 5 billionaires.	He doesn’ t give a damn about people 6 who don’ t have his advantages and you are  the 7 sycophants who enable this man to wreak  havoc 8 among the less fortunate.9 But have no fear, this year I’ m10 offering you the opportunity to mend your ways ,  to 11 stand up to the man and increase the rents   zippo,12 nada, rent freeze.13 ( Applause. )14 MS . STEINBERG:	Give relief to 15 the hard working, underpaid people rather than  the 16 wealthy landlords.	There are a few landlords  who 17 may be having a hard time but they do have   the 18 option to apply for hardship.	And according to 19 the Rent Guideline reports , owners ’ profits have 20 increased by 5 . 8 percent.	From my knowledge of 21 the business world , that’ s way above of what the 22 general interest rate is.	That’ s damn good.23 And by the way , in my building ,24 out of nine apartments , there are only  four 25 stabilized apartments left because of  the 2 
2 draconian decontrol regulations.3 And to close, my mantra is ,4 housing is a basic necessity of  life.5 Thank you.6 ( Applause. )7 MR .

2	Scott Tolliver .34
MR . KERR:	Good afternoon .Thank the board for giving me  the 
5 opportunity to speak today .6 I am here as a  property owner.	I7 have owned and managed rent stabilized property  in 8 the City of New York for over 15  years .9 In the last five years it’ s10 become increasingly more difficult to operate  the 11 property from an expense perspective.12 Specifically, I’ ve noticed a phenomenon in the 13 last three years where the gross rent roll or   the 14 rental income that we generate is not a good   price 15 indicator as far as what we’ re collecting on  an 16 annual basis.	Collections have dramatically 17 increased as residents have slowed down  their 18 payment of rent.19 It ’ s not a function of their 20 ability to be able to afford the rent but rather   a21 unique opportunity to delay the inevitable  of 22 paying the rent.	My collections have increased or 23 rather I should say, in 2007 I collected   roughly 24 98 percent of the gross rent that I billed out   to 25 tenants.	That number has dramatically  decreased 5 
2 to roughly 86 percent.	That number, or the 3 difference between the number, is the  difference 4 between me generating enough income to operate  the 5 property.6 Now in most cases those  tenants 7 do pay the rent but they pay it 35 to 55   days 8 thereafter .	In which case , I don’ t have the cash 9 flow necessary to operate the property .10 I think an increase in  the 11 guidelines would help substantiate the cash that  I12 need to be able to support operating the   property 13 on a monthly basis and I look forward to the – -   a14 vote that favors that decision .15 I appreciate your time .16 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	Question.17 Mr . Schleider.18 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thanks for 19 coming by.20 A quick question though, it  seems 21 that the tenants who are responsible and  make 22 their rent payments on time are subsidizing  the 23 activities of those tenants that don’ t make 24 payments.25 MR . KERR:	That’ s correct .2 
2 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And you’ re 3 looking to the board to increase rents so   that 4 those tenants then further subsidize those  –-5 MR . KERR:	I think –- I6 think –-7 MR . SCHLEIDER:	– - delinquent 8 tenants.9 MR . KERR:	I think –- yes.	The 10 board needs to look at  two things.	First,11 obviously, the increases need to be able  to 12 substantiate the, you know , the cost associated 13 with operating the property.14 I think this is –- it’ s not  a15 perceived cost .	Collections generally aren’ t –-16 there’ s a small percentage that, I believe , is 17 used for vacancy and uncollected rent and I  don’ t18 think that number really captures what ’ s happening 19 in the marketplace today.20 In addition, I think, that if  you 21 look historically at – - at the , I guess,22 collection patterns of rent, you can see  that 23 there has been a dramatic change in the   last 24 couple of years and there’ s no real mechanism  to 25 sort of change that on our  end .	So I would look 2 
2 for the board to first –- yeah , increase – -3 increase the annual increases and then to take  a4 look at the vacancy number that’ s used for  vacancy 5 and uncollected rent and maybe modify that in  some 6 capacity.7 MR . SCHLEIDER:	The next 8 question is, forgive me if you mentioned this,  but 9 how many units are in your  building?10 MR . KERR:	We –- I own  and 11 operate approximately 1 , 000 units.12 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Over how many 13 buildings?14 MR . KERR:	Approximately 17 .15 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And do any of 16 those buildings lose money ?17 MR . KERR:	Yes.18 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And is it 19 because they’ re overburdened with debt ?20 MR . KERR:	No .	It’ s absolutely 21 not a function of the debt that’ s on the  property.22 MR . SCHLEIDER:	So you ’ re able to 23 keep these buildings in your portfolio  because 24 some buildings then subsidize the operations  of 25 other buildings that aren’ t as economically 2 

2	viable ?34
MR . KERR:	That’ s correct . MR . SCHLEIDER:	And these 
5 buildings are located primarily  where?6 MR . KERR:	Brooklyn, south side 7 of Brooklyn, Sheepshead Bay, Midwood.8 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And your overall 9 vacancy rate in these buildings?10 MR . KERR:	It ’ s – - it ’ s higher 11 than it was.	I don’ t have the exact number but 12 it ’ s over five percent .13 MR . SCHLEIDER:	So you have more 14 than 50 apartments vacant at one  time?15 MR . KERR:	Yes.16 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And how 17 difficult is it for you to release  those 18 apartments at prevailing – - or your legal  rents?19 MR . KERR:	At the legal rents ?20 It all depends .	Lately, it’ s been difficult.21 It ’ s hard to – - we tried to capitalize on the 22 1 / 40 th , but it ’ s difficult to spend enough money 23 where you can –-24 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Yeah, that ’ s on 25 the individual apartment improvements.5 

23	apartments , yes.4
MR . KERR:	On the individual MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	So the 
5 rents for your vacant apartments, are  they 6 demonstrably higher or the rents that you’ re 7 seeking, are they demonstrably higher than  your 8 average rents in your building ?9 MR . KERR:	Than the average 10 rents, no.	They’ re probably on the –- on the 11 vacancies, yes , they’ re greater than the average 12 rent.	Yes .13 MR . SCHLEIDER:	All right .	All 14 right.	And the lowest rents that you have in   your 15 building?16 MR . KERR:	I don’ t have that 17 number offhand .18 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Roughly.	Under 19 $ 400 a month?20 MR . KERR:	I would say –- I  would 21 say probably under $ 500 .22 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	All right.23 And the type of rents that you ’ re asking on your 24 vacant apartments?25 MR . KERR:	Um –-5 
2 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Typical.3 MR . KERR:	I wouldn’ t take less 4 than market.	You’ re looking for a number?5 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Roughly, just so 6 we can get an order of magnitude between the   low 7 rents that you ’ re collecting and what you’ re 8 looking to collect and on these  –-9 MR . KERR:	I’ d say a10 one- bedroom’ s approximately $ 1 , 200 a month .11 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	So it’ s12 market rent for those neighborhoods.13 MR . KERR:	It ’ s market rent.14 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	Anything 15 unique or outstanding about your buildings  that 16 would make them more marketable or less  than 17 marketable than a peer group in  your 18 neighborhoods?19 MR . KERR:	We own our properties.20 We care about our properties.	We care about our 21 tenants.	We’ re looking to provide our tenants 22 with a home.	I live in one of our buildings  so 23 our tenant , no different than the rest of  them .	I24 really appreciate the type of, you know,  service 25 and product that we offer  people.2 
2 We spend the money necessary  to 3 be able to provide an atmosphere where people  can 4 feel like they ’ re living at home, that it’ s not a5 rental apartment.6 MR . SCHLEIDER:	So you’ re the 7 second operator of properties that have more  than,8 let’ s say a dozen properties in their  portfolio.9 Would you make the recommendation that  all 10 property owners should have at least 12  properties 11 so they can cross subsidize the operations  of 12 the –-13 MR . KERR:	You can ’ t afford to 14 operate without cross subsidization.	I bought a15 47 - unit building in the Bronx, by myself,16 independent of the property ownership that ’ s in 17 Brooklyn, and this was in 2006 I bought   the 18 property.	Within three years I had to sell  it .	I19 couldn ’ t afford to operate it without shifting 20 cash flow from another operation where there’ s  –-21 there’ s enough income coming in to substantiate 22 it .	It’ s just too difficult to operate it .23 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Was it 24 overburdened with debt ?25 MR . KERR:	No .	No, I ’ d say it 2 
2 had, our debt was less than 30  percent .3 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Really .	So it ’ s4 a significant equity portion that you’ re bringing 5 into these purchases?6 MR . KERR:	Yes.7 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And you still 8 couldn ’ t make it?9 MR . KERR:	Not in this case.10 MR . SCHLEIDER:	So what changed 11 during your attraction to purchase the building  to 12 the time you finally divested?13 MR . KERR:	I couldn’ t afford to 14 continue to operate it .	It was just too 15 expensive.16 MR . SCHLEIDER:	What type of 17 expenses came up as a surprise ?18 MR . KERR:	It was –- it wasn’ t so 19 much that it was a surprise.	I think it was  a20 change in the regulatory environment in the  City 21 of New York.	It’ s become extremely hostile in 22 some cases to operate property  here.23 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Yes.24 MR . KERR:	Combination of 25 legislation, maintenance requirements.2 
2 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Um- hum.	Your 3 tenancy in that building, they paid their rent  on 4 time?5 MR . KERR:	Initially not so much 6 but ultimately they did, I would  say.7 MR . SCHLEIDER:	No worse than any 8 other building in your  portfolio?9 MR . KERR:	Yeah, I would say  I10 had the same – - the same conditions there.11 MR . SCHLEIDER:	All right .12 MR . KERR:	It was managed to  the 13 same standard.14 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .15 MR . KERR:	Thank you.16 MR . CHEIGH :	Evan .17 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	Mr. Cheigh.18 MR . CHEIGH :	Do you have a  –-19 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	One more 20 question.21 MR . KERR:	Okay.22 MR . CHEIGH :	Do you have any 23 units that you ’ re providing preferential rents 24 because the market can ’ t bear the stabilized rents 25 in the building?2 
2 MR . KERR:	There’ s –- there’ s –-3 I’ m sure that there are.	There may be 4 preferential rents for either a combination  of 5 reasons, one it could be that it’ s below – - it ’ s6 where the market is.	It’ s possible the legal rent 7 is higher, but in many cases we offer   a8 preferential rent to residents who need some  sort 9 of assistance.	If they can’ t afford to live 10 there, sometimes we’ ll –- we’ ll help them out.11 MR . CHEIGH :	And generally, for 12 2006 , have you purchased property since then?13 MR . KERR:	Since 2006 , yes.14 MR . CHEIGH :	And what, I mean,  do 15 you pretty much –- have you had the same   situation 16 on your purchases of the same  –-17 MR . KERR:	The only difference 18 was the partners that I went in on had –-   had 19 enough equity to be able to carry the   properties 20 that I purchased since 2006 .21 MR . CHEIGH :	Why are you 22 purchasing properties that aren’ t cash flowing 23 well enough for you?24 MR . KERR:	Based on my experience 25 I thought it would cash flow in this   particular 2 

2	case.34	experience .5
MR . CHEIGH :	Fifteen years of MR . KERR:	Fifteen years.	A lot 
 6 has changed since 2006 .7 MR . CHEIGH :	But what you’ re 8 saying –- could you explain what the  regulatory 9 environment changes were?10 MR . KERR: The Roberts Decision .11 I look at Casado, what happened, you know,   with 12 rent stabilization .13 MR . CHEIGH :	Casado was a benefit 14 to the –-15 MR . KERR:	It ultimately was,16 yes.17 MR . CHEIGH :	And that was in 18	2008 .19 MR . KERR:	But it doesn’ t change 20 that when it was originally –- when it   was 21 originally –- when a decision came out before   it 22 was appealed, we were obligated to follow the   law,23 which meant we had to go back and   change 24 everybody’ s rent and there ’ s an operating cost 25 associated with that, an administrative  cost.19 
2 MR . CHEIGH :	But there’ s still a3 –- you see –- you still see a value to   acquiring 4 properties and running them and, you  know,5 acquiring rent stabilized properties.6 MR . KERR:	And the properties 7 that I ’ ve purchased since 2006 were not rent 8 stabilized .	They were all market rate 9 properties .10 MR . SCHLEIDER:	There ’ s your 11 answer .12 MR . KERR:	That’ s the difference.13 Thank you, Brian.14 Thank you everybody.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Scott 16 Tolliver.17 MR . TOLLIVER:	Good afternoon .18 My name is Scott Tolliver.	I19 reside in a SRO apartment in upper  Manhattan.20 I’ ve listened to owners and 21 tenants and I ask the question , why should I   have 22 to give a  increase ?	My landlord is trying to  get 23 me out of my apartment so he can flip it over   and 24 make some money.	Should I pay for  this?25 I’ m being dragged back and forth 2 
2 to court at least twice a month for no   reason.3 And sometime there are –- landlords or  attorney 4 don’ t even show up in court?	Should I pay for 5 this?6 I’ m in a situation where I ’ m a7 senior also on medication.	Should I have to 8 choose between medication and  rent ?	Now I know 9 that there are at least three types of   landlords.10 Some of them really care about their property  and 11 I’ m not a fool to think that you can  operate 12 property without finance.	But also there’ s what 13 we call the PP landlord.	You can use the 14 expression piss poor or pimping property.	All 15 they do is drag all the money out of the   property 16 that they can and leave it up for rent –- for   a17 tax sale.18 You have people that also  use 19 their property just for the convenience of  having 20 something where they can throw tax  on it.	I’ m not 21 making any money for this.	I’ m not making any 22 money for that .	Nobody is making any money  these 23 days.	The rich are ever standstill and the  poor 24 are getting poorer .	Where does the rent increase 25 come from?2 
2 Are you going to tell me  that 3 after 40 years of working and paying rent that   an 4 increase would help somebody that’ s trying to get 5 off of their back and make more money that   they 6 can jump in their Lexus and drive over in   Jersey 7 to their homes .	How much of the money stays  in 8 this City.9 ( Applause. )10 MR . TOLLIVER:	You could, at 11 least, I would like to see your board with   more 12 power than it has, enough power to look at   certain 13 landlords and say, hey , you’ ve done nothing to 14 support your building.	You’ ve just collected the 15 rent from it and sat back and let that building   go 16 to shambles.17 Any farmer that milks his  cow 18 knows that he has to leave something for the   calf.19 If you ’ re not going to use your known ability to 20 at least try to regulate building where at  least 21 there is something coming in for you, then you ’ re 22 poor management.	You made a bad  investment.23 Now if you ’ re so intelligent that 24 you have all these finances at your disposal  where 25 you can get money to operate your building and   you 2 
2 don’ t do it, then you need advice.3 I’ m asking this board for no 4 increase for those landlords that do nothing  but 5 suck out of the building.	But for those that  care 6 about their property, you deserve  something.7 Thank you.8 ( Applause. )9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you, Mr.10 Tolliver.11 MR . CHEIGH :	Mr. Tolliver .	Mr.12 Tolliver, I just have very quick questions .13 How many apartments –- how  many 14 SRO units are in your building ?15 MR . TOLLIVER:	Three now.16 They’ ve chased at least two people out .17 MR . CHEIGH :	So how big is  the 18 building?19 MR . TOLLIVER:	Oh, it’ s very 20 small.	There’ s only one, two, three, four , five 21 units –- seven –- seven  units.22 MR . CHEIGH :	And is the building 23 owner –- has the building owner been the same   the 24 whole time you ’ ve been there?25 MR . TOLLIVER:	Oh , no , no .	I ’ ve 2 
2 went through three landlords.	I’ ve been through 3 the good, the bad and the  ugly .	I ’ m with the ugly 4 now.5 ( Laughter. )6 MR . CHEIGH :	And what are the 7 pressures –- what are the tenants who are not   the 8 stabilized tenants , what are they –- do you  know 9 if your building owner , if they’ re renting out to 10 tourists or –-11 MR . TOLLIVER:	Oh, no, they’ re 12 not renting out to tourists.	Their main thing is 13 to clean the building out so they can flip   it 14 over.15 MR . CHEIGH :	And where ’ s your 16 building located?17 MR . TOLLIVER:	On 138 th between 18 uptown Manhattan – - between 8 th Avenue and 19 Bradhurst.20 MR . CHEIGH :	And how long has 21 the owner been warehousing the  building?22 MR . TOLLIVER:	Only since ‘ 07 .23 MR . CHEIGH :	Okay .24 MR . TOLLIVER:	But I’ ve been 25 there for 30 years .2 
2 MS . HOLDER :	So I have a3 question, I’ m sorry.4 You said that you’ ve been 5 repeatedly taken to court.	Can you elaborate on 6 that?7 MR . TOLLIVER:	Yes .	The first 8 time I was taken to court it was because one   of 9 the landlords just –- after he sucked all   the 10 money he could get and the taxes built up on   it,11 another corporation came in and bought the  taxes 12 out of it.	So they –- for a whole year they   just 13 sat and let the tenants take care of the   building.14 Then they stepped back in  and 15 said, we’ re the land owners.	You owe us back 16 rent.	They take you to court for  that .	After 17 they found out that all of my rent had been   paid 18 up and I’ m never late on my rent because I   know 19 that it takes money to run a building, then   they 20 take me to court saying we ’ re –– they found out I21 was a senior citizen and they said , hey, we  gonna 22 relocate you.	But nobody came to relocate –-  how 23 can you relocate someone within their area  where 24 they live when there’ s no apartments there to  be 25 relocated in?2

9	Bernstein, who will be followed by Celia  Delgado.10 MS . BERNSTEIN:	Good afternoon.11 I’ m Roberta Bernstein.	I’ m president of the Small 12 Property Owners of New York.13 A lot of us live in our  buildings 14 that we own.	A lot of us have put our lives   into 15 the buildings that we  own.16 I personally have four  buildings 17 in upper Manhattan , right below Harlem .	And I18 will tell you that it’ s getting really , really 19 rough making ends meet .	I cannot believe how 20 taxes have gone up and the water charges,  you 21 know, it’ s not unusual for an owner to get  a22 $ 4 , 000 increase a year in real estate taxes.	You 23 can’ t make that up when you have six families,  two 24 percent a year , four percent on a two- year lease.25 It ’ s impossible.10 
2 Whenever the City needs money,  it 3 looks to the real estate industry, it looks to   us.4 At the same time, we’ re sitting ducks.	There are 5 many categories of tenants as well as  owners.6 There are –- most tenants are very good. But   there 7 are some tenants who really do take  advantage.8 And if an owner should ask for an increase or   be 9 taking a tenant to court, it’ s not unusual  and 10 I’ ve had a lot of complaints from  members,11 suddenly the water charges , the water usage has 12 gone through the roof.	I think the answer ’ s13 obvious.	And that’ s just one of the many  ways 14 that a vindictive person can get retribution so   to 15 speak.16 Now I understand where  the 17 tenants are coming from, you know, I wish that   we 18 could freeze rents , but who’ s freezing our real 19 estate taxes, our water charges, our  plumbers 20 rates, gasoline?	Unless you’ re going to have a21 system where everything is controlled by  the 22 government , you can’ t just freeze one sector.23 You know, a lot of my  owners,24 I’ ve been doing this – - SPONY’ s been here since 25 1984 and along with me , we have an aging  owner 2 
2 population .	I have owners who need medication  and 3 who can’ t always take that pill.	Their Social 4 Security benefits have not gone up either  and 5 their income from the properties has actually  gone 6 down.7 So I have owners that come to  me 8 in tears and they don’ t know where they’ re going 9 to , you know, buy their next meal.	It ’ s not quite 10 as bad as that but they haven’ t got the  resources 11 that a tenant has that ’ s desperate .	What you’ ve 12 got to realize is, you ’ ve got to protect the 13 middle class.	Who benefits the most from 14 regulation ?	It’ s really the middle class.	And 15 what you’ ve got to realize is that we small  owners 16 are the middle class as  well.17 You know, regulation has become 18 an entitlement here in New York and it really is   a19 problem when somebody’ s getting something for 20 nothing.	The government should step in and  not 21 the individual owner to help recalcitrant  and 22 impoverished tenants.23 You know, when Larry Wood  was 24 talking before and a question was asked of   him 25 about expenses that he did not have to pay as   a2 
2 not- for- profit , it ’ s been my understanding the 3 not- for- profits do not pay real estate taxes.	I4 may be wrong but that’ s what I ’ ve learned over the 5 years.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Bernstein,7 I’ m going to ask you to wrap  up.8 MS . BERNSTEIN:	I’ m going to ask 9 you to allow a low rent adjustment for   those 10 apartments that are renting between –- that  are 11 below $ 700 , $ 100 increase a month.	For those 12 apartments renting between $ 700 and $ 1 , 000 , a $ 60 13 increase a month and because of our  humongous 14 increase in operating expenses , six percent on  a15 one- year lease and ten percent for a two- year 16 lease renewal.17 ( Audience participation.)18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.19 Celia Delgado.20 MS . DELGADO:	Okay.	Hello 21 everyone.	My name is Celia Delgado.	I live at 22 the Pennington –- Pennington.	It’ s an SRO , 316 23 West 95 th Street and I ’ ve lived there for about 30 24 years.	And I’ ve seen and experienced the 25 evolution of the building and the neighborhood .2 
2 Now, the conditions and 3 circumstances that the tenants of the  Pennington 4 have been subjected to over the years show me   that 5 that place does not warrant any type of  rent 6 increase for the owner or the landlord ,  whoever 7 that might be because there’ s –- we don’ t know who 8 that is.	You know , it changes it every minute .9 People try to find out what’ s10 going on with the  building .	You can’ t find out 11 anything.	They keep changing everything.12 Now the first point that I  want 13 to make about this building is that it is   infested 14 with vermin, mice and roaches, bed  bug 15 infestation, rats in the basement.	The bed bug 16 epidemic began when the building was turned  into 17 an illegal tourist hotel and that was about  eight 18 to ten years ago.19 And I can tell you that many  of 20 our permanent tenants were plagued by bed  bugs .	I21 mean, I can show you the scars where I have   got 22 bitten by bed bugs because , you know,23 unfortunately, love me . So you know –-24 Now also even recently I  have 25 overheard complaints about that problem from  the 2 
2 tenants –- from the clients rather , of  the 3 Department of Homeless Services/ The Volunteers of 4 America, who have rented out rooms in  the 5 Pennington to be used as shelter  placements.6 Now the City has contracted  to 7 use the building as a homeless shelter and  they’ re 8 paying up to like $ 3 , 000 per month per room, to 9 house two men.	Now approximately 150 rooms have 10 been used for this purpose in our building so   they 11 are netting $ 450 , 000 a month.	This is what these 12 people are getting already .13 Now I’ m, unfortunately , I see my 14 time – - I talk too slowly and my time is   running 15 out but I do want to see, mention this   Fitos 16 Neophytou, who is one of the slum landlords of   New 17 York and I just want to say that my   experience 18 with him and how he has harassed people  and 19 everything else that goes on and how we  haven’ t20 had elevator service for six months, if the  Rent 21 Guidelines Board, if you guys have to  give 22 somebody a rent increase, I can understand  from 23 what I ’ ve heard previously , that some people 24 deserve rent increases and –- but we are in a    very 25 bad economic situation at this point and there  is 2 
2 one person and one building –- a group   of 3 buildings that these people have made money  hand 4 over fist.	They don’ t need any rent increases .5 ( Applause. )6 MS . DELGADO:	And that ’ s for the 7 Pennington SRO and any other SROs that  are 8 associated with this person named Fitos  Neophytou.9 I hope I’ m –- I’ m probably not saying his  name 10 correctly but he is a  monster.11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Delgado, if 12 you would wrap up.13 MS . DELGADO:	I’ m finished.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	Thank 15 you.16 MS . DELGADO:	I left out a  lot 17 of stuff but – -18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	If you’ d like 19 to submit something in writing , we ’ d be happy to 20 take it.21 MS .

FILS- AIME:	Good afternoon,25 Chairman Kimmel and the members of the  Rent 7 

2	Guidelines Board.34	service.5
Thank you in advance for  your I have been at the  Guided 
6 Riverside SRO lower project for about six  months.7 And in my experience, my brief experience, I’ ve 8 been to about ten buildings personally and have  a9 caseload of about 60 residents .10 Here’ s how I would categorize the 11 buildings and the issues that I’ ve seen,  illegal 12 tourist hotels , City placements, warehousing/ lack 13 of services and repairs.14 The majority of intakes are  for 15 loss of services or lack of repairs, and in   some 16 cases, tenant harassment, harassment of offers  and 17 inducements to move, asking residents who  reside 18 to give up their homes , their communities and 19 sometimes their rent regulated status.20 It is disheartening to see  a21 tenant that you’ re serving evicted from their home 22 when they do not have a right to tenancy or   they 23 have lost their job and can no longer pay   the 24 rent.	That’ s very disheartening.25 It is another feeling  altogether 6 
2 when a City agency has to remove the   tenant 3 because the landlord has chosen to allow  the 4 building to fall into disrepair because of lack  of 5 repairs or lack of services, a strategy that   some 6 in the tenant advocacy community would  call 7 eviction by neglect.	A strategy in which 8 taxpayers’ funded agencies , such as the Fire 9 Department , the Department of Buildings or HPD 10 have to come in and vacate a unit and people   have 11 to lose their homes.12 I witnessed this with 129  West 13 122 nd Street, a rooming house of 11 units,  eight 14 of them occupied, the longest resident was  there 15 30 years, a strong family connection in  Central 16 Harlem and to see the building  continuously 17 flipped into a point where HPD had to come   in 18 vacate , was very sad.19 It ’ s another thing for landlords 20 not to have enough capital to make  repairs .21 Though it is entirely different to see  buildings 22 where units are being constructed  alongside 23 permanent tenants with totally new amenities  and 24 the unit in the middle can ’ t even get a  repair 25 done such as the front door or their water   faucet.2 
2 We ’ re not asking for brand new wood floors or COLA 3 amenities.	We ’ re just asking for repairs and 4 services to be provided so that the tenant  can 5 live in the peaceful, quiet enjoyment of  their 6 home.7 As you will continue to hear  from 8 other tenants and their advocates, we are  not 9 asking that the good landlords not find a way   to 10 continue to run their buildings.	What we’ re 11 saying is, that bad landlords should not be   aided,12 especially aided unwarrantedly , undeservedly and 13 definitely would cause the expense of  having 14 tenants who haven’ t had a cost of living  increase 15 who are, some of them working furloughed  jobs,16 some of them not getting any increases in this   job 17 market to pay for bad  landlords.18 Thank you again for your  service.19 ( Applause. )20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.21 Ms . Adams.22 MS . ADAMS:	Yes.	Thank you for 23 your testimony .24 MR . FILS- AIME:	Thank you , Ms .25 Adams.2 
2 MS . ADAMS:	What would be your 3 estimate on the number of SRO units in the   City,4 roughly?5 MR . FILS- AIME:	From our 6 calculations, there are under 60 , 000 units .	A lot 7 of it is – - all the units have to be   self 8 reported, Ms. Adams, so we believe it’ s  around 9 60 , 000 and in the projects catchment area, which 10 covers from the entire west side from 14 th  Street 11 to the tip of Manhattan, we might see about 30 , 000 12 units in that area .13 MS . ADAMS:	Okay.	And granted,14 one size doesn ’ t fit all, but how would you split 15 that into decent SRO units and those where  people 16 are just ripping it off and making  money?17 MR . FILS- AIME:	Yeah, I would –-18 I know there’ s already –- I would suggest  a19 strong , a very strong proviso to be entirely  fair.20 A very strong proviso that , not only would look  at 21 the number of regulated units, but to also   make 22 sure that the building is up  to Code.	Too many 23 landlords are able to get an increase  really 24 driving the tenant , some of them who are 25 uneducated –- this is housing of the first   resort,2 
2 Ms . Adams, so you have a lot of single men   and 3 women just arriving in this country living in   an 4 SRO.5 For example, the Cork Apartments,6 38 West 31 st Street.	It’ s a huge, huge building 7 right on Broadway and 31 st .	You know, we hear 8 stories that there are brokers who seek out  new 9 immigrants , from Korea or China especially , and 10 escort them into the building.	Those residents 11 don’ t know their rights and we feel that they  get 12 taken advantage of .13 So if the landlord just shows  up 14 and says, I’ ve got a rent increase , there’ s really 15 no mechanism for them to  challenge that.	So to 16 make sure that a landlord such as that would   not 17 benefit, especially when they’ re not providing 18 repairs or services and there are a ton   of 19 violations on their buildings.20 MS . ADAMS:	Okay.	Who would we 21 rely on to determine if they had those kinds   of 22 violations ?23 MR . FILS- AIME:	I think there 24 should be –- I think the board has a broad   range 25 of power and the board can negotiate  and 2 
2 determine, I think , you have a lot of  strong 3 advocates both on the landlord side, both on   the 4 tenant side, the same way the landlords were  able 5 –- the board was able in Casado to alert – -   put 6 language in on the site, landlords went and  told 7 tenants, hey, here ’ s what the increase is.	It 8 might change due to this pending legislation,  so 9 please be aware that although I’ m collecting this 10 money it might change because of this  pending 11 legislation, you might get it back or you   might 12 not get it back.	But I think the board has  that 13 ability to create that .14 MS . HOLDER :	Why wouldn’ t it just 15 be HPD ?16 MR . FILS- AIME:	I’ m sorry.17 MS . HOLDER :	Why not just HPD?18 MR . FILS- AIME:	I –- I’ ve been 19 an organizer for almost ten  years.20 MS . HOLDER :	HPD can report on 21 the buildings that are in  violation.22 MR . FILS- AIME:	Oh , sure, sure .23 HPD could report on that but can HPD get   that 24 information out to the  tenants .	I think that’ s25 what Ms. Adams question was about who would –-   HPD 2 
2 could do that.	HPD should definitely –-3 MS . HOLDER :	And HPD could share 4 information with HCR.5 MR . FILS- AIME:	Yes.	HPD,6 HCR –-7 MS . HOLDER :	So that landlords 8 when they’ re registered –-9 MR . FILS- AIME:	– - I think at 10 every level where tenants could get assistance  on 11 housing issues , that would have to be –-  that 12 should be noted.13 MS . HOLDER :	And then those 14 landlords would know when they register  their 15 buildings.16 MR . FILS- AIME:	Yeah, well ,17 landlords would know, you know , hopefully will 18 know June 27 th .19 MS . HOLDER :	That they ’ re not 20 entitled to take increases ?21 MR .

Owners No. 27 ,11 will be next.12 ( Brief 15 - minute recess.)13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Welcome back 14 to the session .15 The next speaker, Daniel 16 Andrejcuk.	I hope I’ m pronouncing it correctly,17 to be followed by Louise Weiss , to be followed  by 18 Jessica Anderson, to be followed by Clare  Dockery.19 MS . WEISS:	I ’ m Louise Weiss.	I20 am a rent stabilized tenant.	At the moment my 21 rent is 53 percent of my income. I ’ m a  freelance 22 writer and editor and there’ s not a lot of  money 23 in that.	So I , basically, live on a fixed  income.24 I’ ve lived in my apartment since 25 1974 .	It’ s a 421 A building which means there was 5 
2 a really hefty tax abatement for a long,   long 3 time.	There is lots of turnover in my  building.4 I think –- it’ s a 17 - story building, there are 5 probably six to eight stabilized  tenants 6 remaining.7 The turnover has occurred because 8 the landlord, instead of renting to  stable 9 tenants, has divided apartments up and rents  to 10 young people new to New York.	They put a11 temporary partition in a three - room apartment and 12 renting to them as a four- room apartment.	It’ s13 now -- wasn’ t previously – - is there now – - a Fire 14 Department , okay, but as far as the  legality 15 otherwise is a concern I don’ t know.	It ends up 16 with one dark room with no window, even though   it 17 has a door .18 The smallest increase in rent,  as 19 you can imagine, will lift the proportion of   my 20 income spent for rent from 53 percent to   55 21 percent and to 57 percent, et cetera, et   cetera.22 The $ 2 , 000 break off point for 23 luxury housing is really a joke in this day   and 24 age.	$ 2 , 000 a month is really a lot of money.25 Right now it’ s simply a way for rents to  creep 2 
2 upward and upward very quickly , hit the level  and 3 be cut free.4 There are studios in my  building 5 renting for close to $ 2 , 000 a month and so I think 6 -- I think , there should be no  rent increases.	If 7 there are any, they should be minimal and I   think 8 that the $ 2 , 000 cutoff point is –- has to be 9 renegotiated because it’ s perfectly ridiculous .	A10 percentage figure would be much more sensible  than 11 a flat numeric figure.12 I have to say before I   finish 13 that I was interested to read the   qualifications 14 that the public members of the board, and they ’ re 15 very exciting, we’ ve got investment counseling ,16 corporate finance, maximizing real estate  value,17 hedging –- all this wonderful stuff, this is   not 18 the public that I meet when I’ m shopping in  Cheap 19 Jack’ s so I think maybe you ought to get out  more.20 Thank you.21 ( Applause. )22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.23 Jessica Anderson.24 MS . ANDERSON:	Hello.	My name 25 is Jessica Anderson and I’ m a small  building 2 
2 manager in a poor co- op in Queens.	And we have 3 five rent stabilized apartments.4 Now we have faced great  cost 5 increases in running the building.	And in 2009 ,6 for No . 2 oil, the average cost of a gallon   oil 7 over the year was $ 2 . 20 .	In 2010 , the cost was 8 $ 2 . 73 .	And this year the average cost , so far , is 9	$ 3 . 43 .10 The building runs efficiently as 11 possible as we did weatherization in  2009 .	How 12 does rent stabilization hurt us?	Well , in 2012 we 13 have to refinance.	I was already told by  one 14 government mortgage broker that, basically , we 15 weren’ t really eligible for a Fannie Mae  and 16 Freddie Mac because the rents in our building  are 17 considered underwater rents.	That means that the 18 investors, and before we had investors , us , the 19 small income and middle income were owners , had  to 20 subsidize these rents.21 Now the average maintenance for 22 the building is $ 1 , 100 for a six- room and $ 900 for 23 a five - room apartment.	They’ re all either that,24 one or the other.	The average rent stabilized is 25 anywhere from $ 500 to $ 700 max .	That means that 10 
2 the investors are paying $ 400 to $ 500 a month  for 3 people to live on  their property.	And before 4 that, we, the owners of the building who  live 5 there, the owners who live there, were paying  that 6 for them to live in  their apartments.	We all had 7 to increases for this.8 The average cost of the  building 9 for water, $ 12 . 50 a day.	And that –- with  doing 10 all the water improvements we can.	I don’ t know 11 how I’ m going to refinance next year in order  so 12 we can keep making improvements.	Basically,13 you’ re putting all 12 –- actually 16 families  at 14 risk to benefit just 5 .	They need the increases.15 We need the increases so we can keep paying   our 16 taxes, so we can keep paying for water and so   that 17 we all have a place to  live.18 You think that maybe because it’ s19 just the owners or the investors, it doesn ’ t20 affect us, but it  does .	Because if they run out,21 we ’ re destabilized and then it falls on the middle 22 class families who live here.23 Any questions?24 MR . CHEIGH :	I have some.25 MS . ANDERSON:	Sure.2 
2 MR . CHEIGH :	When did the 3 building convert to co - op?4 MS . ANDERSON:	1987 .5 MR . CHEIGH :	1987 .6 MS . ANDERSON:	It’ s been 7 struggling because of this ever  since.8 MR . CHEIGH :	And these are 9 tenants who have been living there since – -10 MS . ANDERSON:	Thirty years.11 Average 30 years.	Nobody has ever moved.12 MR . CHEIGH :	And the common 13 charges –- what are the common  charges ?	Well, how 14 long have you been residing –- I’ m sorry, you’ re 15 the property owner .16 MS . ANDERSON:	I have been –-17 I’ ve been the property manager since fall of  2008 18 and I’ ve been living there since 2001 .19 MR . CHEIGH :	And most of the 20 co - op tenants have been living there for similar 21 amounts of time?22 MS . ANDERSON:	Similar amounts 23 of time.	There have been some new owners  moving 24 in .	We had turnover with –-  with owners.	We 25 haven’ t had any turnover with renters in any  way.2 

23	MCI increases?4
MR . CHEIGH :	And have you taken MS . ANDERSON:	I did 
5 weatherization through the government, which  was 6 the only way we could have afforded –- I’ m  not 7 eligible for an MCI.	I’ m eligible only for a J 41 8 tax credit .	I don ’ t know if we’ ll get it because 9 I have professional tenants who’ ve managed to  put 10 violations on the building that –- since I ’ m not a11 professional, I’ m not able to remove.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Any questions?13 ( No response.)14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.15 MS .

2 MS . DOCKERY:	Hi.	I’ m a rent 3 stabilized tenant and I’ ve lived in the same 4 building for 27 some years .5 The apartments in my building  are 6 becoming deregulated because the rents keep  going 7 up because of the high rent increases every   year.8 There’ s becoming a lot of transients in  the 9 building.	There are families, small families,10 large families living in  small apartments.	We 11 can’ t keep getting these rent increases and up  in 12 these buildings.13 As I said, the building  is 14 becoming very overcrowded.	Many of us are  not 15 eligible for SCRIE .	Because it’ s a federal rent 16 stabilized building, a lot of the tenants are   old.17 They’ re paying a third to a half of our income  in 18 rent and we’ re not eligible for any benefits.19 Young families , as I said, are 20 moving in with four and five kids in a   small,21 small apartment.22 You’ ve heard all the arguments 23 about why we don’ t need any increases. We don’ t24 need an increase this year .	Please listen to us 25 old folks and the people on fixed income and   no 2 
2 increases this year, please.3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.4 MR . CHEIGH :	Could you –-5 ( Applause. )6 MR . CHEIGH :	Excuse me, ma’ am .7 Hello.

CHEIGH :	And do you live  in 12 an apartment or are in you an  SRO?13 MS . DOCKERY:	No, I’ m in an 14 apartment, a rent- regulated apartment.15 MR .

MR . ANDREJCUK:	You heard many 
4 testimonies and I would like to say briefly a   few 5 words.6 Tenants complaining that no 7 increase, no increase, we’ re so poor. Landlords,8 he ’ s making profit .	This is the United States .9 That’ s the place of opportunity to every person.10 Everyone can be a  millionaire.11 The best example is Mr . –- our 12 mayor.	He started working as  a clerk.	Now he ’ s13 millionaire.	So every landlord is entitled  for 14 profit just like coffee shop or  restaurant .	And I15 would like to address this that expenses, they   are 16 not going down , going up.	Taxes, water and 17 sewage , maintenance, oil – - everything going up.18 We need decent increase to  keep 19 the buildings.	And I’ m asking you –- you have  all 20 authorities and the best example is what  happened 21 March 24 this year , that Court of Appeals  opened 22 door for you and gave you a green light to   give 23 supplement on top of increase.	And I’ m asking you 24 to the –- to the tip of your heart , to the   common 25 sense, give a decent increase to the landlord  to 4 
2 keep the buildings .3 And my suggestion is for one  year 4 increase six- and- a - half percent plus 45 percent on 5 top of that supplement .	For two years , eleven -6 and- a- half percent increase, plus $ 90 supplement.7 ( Audience participation.)8 MR . ANDREJCUK:	This way we can 9 catch little bit what happened last year where  we 10 had bad –- held badly.	It was very, very  low 11 increase.	And once more I ’ m telling you, I’ m12 asking for your common sense.	Give decent 13 increase to landlord.14 Thank you.15 ( Applause. )16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.17 Thank you, sir .18 Nick Petris.19 ( No response.)20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Not here .21 Tyrone Anthony , to be followed by Iris Lee .22 MR .

2 I volunteer for this work. I  know 3 I look good but I’ m looking for a  job, so.	The 4 suit – - I make it look  good.5 To our respective Chairman  and 6 board members, we would like to say that  we 7 advocate on behalf of the tenants and seniors   in 8 SROs rent stabilized tenants across the  board.9 There should be no rent hike due to owners   who 10 have had tax abatements every year .11 We advocate strengthening the 12 rent laws and long - term rent laws for the 2 . 513 million tenants of New York City, which  will 14 expire tonight .15 There should be no rent  hikes 16 when unemployment is over 9 . 2 percent and I’ m one 17 of those unemployed.18 We advocate the legislators in 19 Albany and the Governor for long- term rent 20 stabilized laws.21 In the words of Dr . Martin Luther 22 King, an injustice to one is an injustice to   all.23 And these rent hikes is an  injustice.24 Some landlords deserve it.	Some 25 landlords do not deserve.	There’ s good and bad 2

LEE:	Hi.	Good afternoon ,12 everybody.13 My name is Iris Lee.	I don’ t14 think New York law is very fair to all   landlords.15 Okay.	Some of the tenants have freezed the  rent.16 Okay.	Why we don’ t have the like –- the  freeze 17 tax also.18 We have our own expense.	Do the 19 government care about can we afford to pay   the 20 mortgage, to pay expense?	And some of the  tenant 21 not pay the rent either for one year if we   take 22 them to court.23 It happened to me.	We take them 24 to court.	It’ s all new apartment.	Brand new 25 condition.	The tenant ripped the parquet  floor,4 
2 ripped the closet and called the City to show   them 3 they have reason not paying rent.	So do you think 4 it ’ s fair to the landlord?	Why is two percent ?5 How much is City increased the water  percentage?6 Did they ask us, can we  afford it?	No .7 Seven- and- a- quarter percent for water increase .8 How about Con Edison?	How about the oil?	Gas 9 company?10 Why tenant ask like freeze  the 11 rent?	Only two percent.	How much a water  bill,12 we got it.	I tell you , this is the first 13 property, six unit , I bought it in 2005  in 14 Brooklyn.	I tell you my  story .	Okay.	I think 15 New York law is protecting tenant very , very  much.16 They accusing the landlord and not reasonable,  not 17 reasonable .	But HDCR is helping them.18 Why?	I tell you my story.	I19 bought the one property in Brooklyn, 2005  August.20 And after two years I been in court case   four,21 five years .	Why?	Because tenant grab a phone ,22 call the HDCR, oh the rent increase no   reasonable.23 Four years ago before I had  closing.24 And final, why I have to  be 25 responsible four years before closing?	And the 2 
2 rent was registered right.	And they said, oh,  you 3 have to pay the tenants $ 17 , 000 and plus the rent 4 $ 1 , 100 drop down to $ 833 .	I said, what reason ?5 Because they were living one bedroom apartment  –-6 and they moved to a two bedroom apartment  for 7 $ 1 , 100 and there was a tenant living there two 8 years before.	And HDCR still give me a  fine,9 $ 17 , 000 .	Have to pay the tenant.	For what reason 10 I have to pay the  tenant?11 Finally, I hire the  lawyer .	I12 went to the Supreme Court  with them.	My two 13 lawyer give me suggestion, Iris, you lost the   case 14 because even Supreme Court is afraid of this  HDCR 15 because they so powerful.	I said, no.	Even ten 16 percent.	We need a chance .	I still take it.17 Okay.	If I lost the case I won’ t bring on  you .18 After four years, first two  years 19 I went to Supreme Court.	Supreme Court said I  had 20 nothing wrong in the rent record.	DHCR supposed 21 to review the case .	And then they wait for  one 22 year – -23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Lee , I’ m24 going to ask you – - I’ m going to ask you to  please 25 wrap up.2

Tenant 11 had to pay me back $ 16 , 000 , almost $ 17 , 000 .	Why?12 Because it ’ s easy want them pay me like almost 13 $ 400 less every month.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Wrap it up.15 MS . LEE:	Now, why they don’ t16 have opened an account for like  money escrow.	Who 17 won the case, who take  the money?	Now I won the 18 case but I lost like $ 40 , 000 for the lawyer fee.19 Who pay me back?20 Tenant , when they don’ t pay rent,21 they go to court.

MR . CAMPUCANO:	We’ ve had a
4 major power –- not power, gas and hot   water 5 elimination from December to January.	We have no 6 services in the building.7 It ’ s – - our apartment and the one 8 next door that are available everybody else  has 9 gone out of the building.	One of them might  have 10 been illegally thrown out.	There’ s cats in the 11 building, their litter is not being changed.  The 12 doors are being left open.13 Like I said, the building is  not 14 being swept or mopped.	The landlord now wants to 15 take the remaining apartments for non- traditional 16 family .	And we’ ve had several complaints of heat 17 and hot water throughout the  years .	And I feel 18 like it’ s a retribution now to get us  out.19 The building, about 20 years it’ s20 been going on.	It was taken over by 7 A21 administration and it’ s just on and on like  this.22 It ’ s been –- the apartment is no longer a home .23 It ’ s more like a harassment and encirclement now 24 and this, you know , like I said, I don ’ t know if I25 mentioned, they had to send him back to   Puerto 4 
2 Rico because of the shutoff of the services in   the 3 building.4 They’ re –- the apartment is under 5 DRIE, which is a disability.	The landlord gets a6 disability abatement so, you know, it’ s not like 7 he ’ s losing anything.	There’ s a restaurant on the 8 bottom floor that is owned by him and the   agent.9 They were just cited for infestation in  the 10 restaurant , for rat droppings in the food and  food 11 areas.12 So it’ s just been one thing after 13 another.	Rosie Mendez ’ office has been involved.14 And Good Old Lower East Side has also  been 15 involved.	So what I’ m saying then , basically, is 16 that, you know , the landlords are complaining 17 constantly about increases of cost of running  the 18 buildings, but people on disabilities have  gotten 19 no increases also in the last  two years.	So it’ s20 like they’ re crying and we ’ re crying about it 21 also.22 And the lack of services,  they 23 know how much the apartments are worth and  they’ re 24 harassing people just to get  them out.	They can 25 smell the money and it ’ s, you know , it ’ s just –-2 
2 it ’ s citywide.	So basically that’ s what I have to 3 say.4 Thank you.5 ( Applause. )6 MS . HOLDER :	Thank you –- thank 7 you for your testimony .8 I’ m sorry, just one quick 9 question.10 MR . CAMPUCANO:	If you need any 11 documents or pictures, another thing I forgot  to 12 add is that we have the fireplace bricks  falling 13 in and major ceiling collapses .14 So DHCR is working and  everybody,15 we have the law project working with us  about 16 everything .	It’ s just a mess.17 MS . HOLDER :	How many units?18 MR . CAMPUCANO:	It ’ s – - it ’ s a19 four- story building, six apartments.	The lady 20 who was evicted, I have the article  on it.	So the 21 landlord took over that apartment.	The super who 22 claims to live in the building , doesn’ t live in 23 the building.	They have – - they made that into 24 one apartment.	The landlord moved downstairs.25 The other tenant left.2 
2 The verbal abuse – - one day after 3 he got rid of the lady , I was coming  downstairs 4 and he said that this is what  happens 5 when people who FU , you know, with me.	And there 6 was another point where he threatened my  friend,7 Miguel , my partner , and said that he got rid of 8 Benjamin.	Peter’ s dead, don’ t mess with what is 9 mine.10 And, it’ s like I said, it’ s11 really uncomfortable for us now.	I have pictures 12 and everything .	We had a mouse infestation and  I13 have pictures of the mouse on the garbage  pail 14 dancing around .	And Miguel put his shoe on  one 15 day and there was a dead mouse in his  shoe .16 The bathroom walls are 17 collapsing .	I got pictures of the  cabinet .	See,18 now he feels like he doesn ’ t have to do anything 19 because now he ’ s threatened to take away the lease 20 as of June 30 th and for, like I said, for  his 21 non- traditional family .	So, that’ s about it.22 Thank you.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.24 Dorris Schiff- Greenberg, to be 25 followed by Stephen Rechner.2 

23	afternoon.4
MS . SCHIFF - GREENBERG:	Good My name is Dorris  Schiff 
5 Greenberg.	I am a manager for 1301 Third  Avenue.6 We have two rent- controlled 7 tenants, two rent stabilized and four  preferential 8 rent tenants.9 Our taxes have escalated since 10 2006 to present time – - I have a present tax   bill,11 $ 10 , 000 in taxes since 2006 .	This is ludicrous.12 The insurance rates have 13 increased.	The water has increased.	The air 14 conditioning guidelines where we have to put  in 15 one- way screws for the air conditioners.	I don’ t16 know whether you’ re aware of that, that no  store 17 in this City supplies you when you buy an   air 18 conditioner with one- way screws.	They give you 19 the regular screws .	And most of them are  using 20 Phillips screws.21 So as a result , as a manager,  you 22 have to take care of all of this even when   the 23 tenant has put in their own air  conditioners.24 The window guards, that’ s another 25 thing.	When you have one child in the  building 5 
2 you have to take over and you have to put in   new 3 window guards which we did in one of   our 4 buildings.	And those also have to have one- way 5 screws .6 The bed bug law, which was put  in 7 by Rosenthal.	Do you think that tenants – - do  you 8 think that landlords have to pay  for this?	We 9 have one tenant –- one had one tenant that was   at 10 Beth Israel Hospital about two  years ago.	She 11 gave birth to a baby, came home with bed   bugs.12 They had an infestation there.13 Goldman Sachs, one of the  tenants 14 in the one of the buildings, got  bed bugs.	She 15 had to leave Goldman Sachs because –- because  of 16 that.	They said that she could –- she  could 17 continue to infest the  place.18 The parking meters that were  just 19 installed recently –- I saw one on Third   Avenue 20 Saturday.	The parking meters are put on  the 21 tenants –- on the landlord ’ s property.	We are 22 responsible for that – - for the sidewalks.	Why 23 should we be responsible for that?	Don’ t you 24 think the City should pay us for taking over   a25 piece of our property that ’ s approximately this 2 
2 square , a rectangle square , however it is?	I3 mean, that ’ s ludicrous too .4 They should –- otherwise, they 5 should reduce the taxes.	This is ridiculous.6 The maintenance has gone up  sky 7 high in the buildings.	Our maintenance for the 8 supplies and everything and the –- for the  supers,9 you can’ t keep up with this.10 The satellite dishes, another 11 tenant put in on  his own.	Now without written 12 consent from the tenant –- we didn ’ t – - from the 13 landlord.	I mean, you call Direct TV and  the 14 landlords –- the tenant said, well we got a   verbal 15 agreement, which isn’ t so.	I deal with Flora 16 Goldstein, who is one of the leading – -  the 17 leading attorneys in the City.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Could you 19 please wrap up .20 MS . SCHIFF - GREENBERG:	Yes, I21 certainly will .22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.23 MS . SCHIFF - GREENBERG:	I think 24 something has to be done  about that.	They –- in 25 order for a tenant to put up a TV dish on    the 2 
2 roof, they must have a written consent from   the 3 landlord.	They cannot do it on their  own.4 We have a roof that’ s been 5 ruined .	Our roof has been –- a new roof has   been 6 put up .	Five years we ’ ve had it there and it’ s in 7 excellent condition.	This tenant came along and 8 decided to put up his –- his antenna, the   Direct 9 TV .	It’ s ridiculous.	Down we have a damage  of 10 over $ 1 , 700 .	This has to be taken care  of .	It 11 has to addressed.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Let ’ s wrap.13 MS . SCHIFF - GREENBERG:	And it 14 should be addressed.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.16 MS . SCHIFF - GREENBERG:	Thank you 17 so very much.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.19 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Yes.	Question,20 please .21 What range of rent increase  would 22 you recommend this board to consider given  your 23 building situation ?24 MS . SCHIFF - GREENBERG:	I would 25 say the ten percent as you advocated, plus   the 2 

2	six.34
MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .  MS . SCHIFF - GREENBERG:	But you 
5 know what, we have excellent tenants and  even 6 though they go over the $ 2 , 000 mark and if they’ re 7 good and we have a wonderful rapport with them ,  I8 kept them on preferential rent .	But at least have 9 that legal rent at that –- at  that amount.	That 10 if at some point where , you know, the taxes  will 11 be frozen.	This is what should happen .12 I mean if they want to  raise 13 rents, then they have to raise –- they –- it’ s   –-14 it ’ s ridiculous.	I mean, I can’ t see a lot of  the 15 tenants paying a lot of money for an   apartment .	I16 feel very badly for them and I do consider   them.17 And we have an excellent building and I take   care 18 of it personally.19 I’ ve been in this business and 20 taking care of this for about six years and I   have 21 –- we don’ t have any violations on the  building 22 and every building that I have taken care of,   I23 make damn sure that everybody is treated  equally.24 And they are.	We have recommendations from all 25 our tenants and I invite the board down, if  you’ d5 
2 ever like to see the building, we’ d be more  than 3 happy to show it to  you.4 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .5 MS . SCHIFF - GREENBERG:	I really 6 mean that.	If you want, I can give you the   phone 7 number .	I can leave it here and I ’ d be more  than 8 happy for you to see it because it ’ s spotless,9 because I demand it.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.11 MS . SCHIFF - GREENBERG:	Thank you 12 so much for listening to  me.13 ( Applause. )14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Stephen 15 Rechner.16 MR . RECHNER:	Good afternoon.17 I’ m Stephen Rechner.	I’ m a rent stabilized tenant 18 at 324 East 334 th Street in Manhattan.19 I speak today as president of  the 20 Union of Clerical, Administrative and  Technical 21 Staff representing 1 , 500 working men and women at 22 New York University and as a member of the   Board 23 of Directors of New York State United  Teachers 24 which in addition to UCATS , includes among its 25 affiliate locals in the New York  metropolitan 2 
2 area, the Union at Cooper, the Professional  Staff 3 Congress of CUNY, Pace Adjunct faculty , Marymount 4 Union of Staff Employees, United College  Employees 5 at FIT and the United Federation of  Teachers,6 which represents thousands of underpaid  teachers 7 aides, assistants, school secretaries, cafeteria 8 workers and home care workers.9 So let ’ s talk real numbers for 10 real working people.11 Union members at UFT are  entering 12 their third year with no  raises.13 Union members at Professional 14 Staff Congress and UCE at FIT and Marymount   are 15 entering their second year with no  raises 16 Adjunct faculty at NYU got  no 17 raise last year and just 2 . 5 percent this year .18 Managers at NYU got no raise  in 19 2009 , 1 . 5 percent in 2010 and they ’ re just getting 20 just 2 . 5 percent this coming September .	And many 21 of them don’ t make much more than the UCAT ’ s22 members they supervise after they pay for  their 23 health insurance and pension contributions .24 UCATs members, my union, got  just 25 3 percent last year, and we will be negotiating   a2 
2 new contract this year , but it doesn’ t look good.3 And now some good news .	This 4 year the Union at Cooper just signed a   new 5 contract that will give them a 2 . 5 percent raise 6 this year and a minimum starting salary of $ 35 , 000 7 which was an achievement.	Now a worker who  makes 8 $ 35 , 000 and 2 . 5 percent raise, gets about $ 51 a9 month after taxes.10 If he’ s lucky enough to have a11 $ 1 , 200 a month rent stabilized apartment, a six 12 percent raise will cost him about $ 72 a  month.13 Leaving him with $ 21 less per month to  absorb 14 rising food, utility and transportation  costs.15 Even a worker who earns $ 45 , 000 16 and gets a 2 . 5 percent raise, only takes home 17 about $ 65 a month after taxes.18 And as union members, we’ re the 19 lucky ones .	We’ re the ones who haven’ t been laid 20 off yet, the ones who haven’ t been forced to  take 21 unpaid furloughs, or had our hours reduced  or 22 endured astronomical increases in health  insurance 23 costs.24 Let’ s not kid ourselves, anyone 25 who has participated in this annual theater  piece,2 
2 knows that the people who control this  board 3 intend to pass the highest increases in  the 4 proposed range , 5 . 75 to 9 percent increases, plus 5 a 1 percent surcharge is unconscionable in   this 6 economic environment.7 Real estate has become the  winner 8 take all industry in  our City.	In addition to sky 9 high rent increases, they demand and get  billions 10 of dollars in tax subsidies for their  commercial 11 development projects while at the same time  they 12 oppose a living wage bill in New York that   would 13 require them to pay just $ 11 . 50 an hour for the 14 retail and service jobs –-15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Rechner ,16 if you could please wrap  up.17 MR . RECHNER:	–- that go into 18 their tax subsidized properties.19 The working people of New  York 20 cannot absorb rent increases year after year  that 21 far outstrip our ability to  earn.22 Thank you.23 ( Applause. )24 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Question,25 please .2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.3 MR . SCHLEIDER:	I ’ m a little 4 unclear.	You represent – - I mean , you say that 5 you’ re a rent stabilized tenant and then you  went 6 on this list of people you  represent.7 MR . RECHNER:	I am the president 8 of the Clerical Workers at New York University .9 MR . SCHLEIDER:	What does that 10 mean?11 MR . RECHNER:	What does that 12 mean?	It means there are 1 , 500 working men and 13 women, many of them who are rent stabilized,  many 14 of them who are trying to get apartments in   New 15 York City.16 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Is this a  union 17 that you’ re president of?18 MR . RECHNER:	Yes.19 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	Are there 20 any other unions that you’ re affiliated with that 21 you have control over?22 MR . RECHNER:	I am on the  Board 23 of Directors of New York State United Teachers  and 24 that’ s a federation, it’ s the largest union state 25 federation in the City –- in New  York State.	And 2 
2 the other unions I mentioned are affiliate  locals 3 of New York State United Teachers and  –-4 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Right.	So –-5 MR . RECHNER:	–- I am –- I am  –-6 have professional interactions with the  presidents 7 of those locals and I know what their  contracts 8 are.9 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	Just so I10 get this straight.	So you cited all these  unions 11 that you are either directly or somehow  affiliated 12 with and there were no increases in their  salaries 13 for years; correct ?14 MR . RECHNER:	Yes , that’ s15 correct.16 MR . SCHLEIDER:	How much is the 17 average union dues that your membership pays  each 18 month?19 MR . RECHNER:	I’ m not familiar 20 with the actual dues that the other locals  pay .21 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	But of 22 the 1 , 200 something member union – -23 MR . RECHNER:	Our union dues – -24 MR . SCHLEIDER:	– - that you’ re 25 president of	–-2 
2MR . RECHNER:	Yes , it ’ s $ 51 to 3$ 62 per month.4MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .5MS . HOLDER :	I have a  question.6Thanks so much for coming  to 7testify today.8MR . RECHNER:	You’ re welcome.9MS . HOLDER :	With your union and 10 the other unions that you work with, are  you 11 finding that more and more of your brothers  and 12 sisters are actually having to leave New York  City 13 because of the high cost of rents and   housing 14 here?15 MR . RECHNER:	Well , the real 16 problem, obviously , we work here.	We cannot leave 17 the metropolitan area.	Nobody ’ s living in 18 Manhattan anymore except me.	You know , when I19 started working at NYU , I made $ 14 , 000 a year and 20 I moved in a year after I started working there,   I21 moved into the building I live in  now.22 I make $ 52 , 000 a year now and I23 cannot afford to move into the building  I24 currently live in now.	At that time when I25 started in 1986 , generally , you know, the clerical 10 
2 staff lived in the East Village and the  managers 3 and faculty lived in the nicer parts of  Manhattan.4 What happens now is, our  members 5 live farther and farther away in the  outer 6 boroughs and, as public transportation  becomes 7 increasingly tenuous, they on December 6 th 8 instituted a new time clock system , called  My 9 Time.	It’ s the same time clock system that the 10 City is now discovering they lost like , you  know,11 a few hundred billion dollars  on.12 And the difficulty it creates  is 13 that people can’ t get to work on time because  they 14 live so far away and the public transportation  is 15 so unreliable and then the managers discipline  us 16 when we come in to work late and then some of   our 17 members lose their jobs because they live so  far 18 away.19 MS . HOLDER :	And how long have 20 you been in your apartment now ?21 MR . RECHNER:	I’ ve been in my 22 current apartment since 1986 .	But let me tell  you 23 –- I’ d like to elaborate a little bit about  that.24 The reason I can afford to live there is, I    was 25 actually a tenant of this landlord when I lived   on 2 
2 95 th Street.	I moved to his – - an apartment  in 3 one of his buildings on 95 th Street in 1980 and  my 4 rent, first rent, was $ 125 a  month .	But it was –-5 if you know that neighborhood at the time it   was 6 like the South Bronx.	It was one of five  occupied 7 buildings on the block .8 Normandy Court , which is a big 9 housing complex on –- between 95 th and 96 th 10 between 2 nd and 3 rd, was a collection of rubble 11 and abandoned buildings. It was not a   neighborhood 12 people wanted to move into .	And when I moved  in 13 there, around the same time a number of   other 14 young people moved into the building, because  we 15 were the first wave of young people who  were 16 coming back to New York to take advantage  of 17 affordable rents.18 And the building had gone  through 19 some transition with, you know , questionable 20 tenants, some of the non- rent payers, our 21 landlords complained about drugs and things.	And 22 so when we –- this group of young people and   I23 came in, we were actually working people who  paid 24 our rent on time and our landlord, when he had   a25 vacancy, he used to send his super around to   knock 2 
2 on our doors to ask if we had any friends   who 3 wanted to rent his  apartment.4 So the point of the story,  is 5 that, you know , I’ ve been paying a rent to my 6 landlord in good times and  bad .	And I pay my  rent 7 on time every month.	And my apartment is  in 8 better condition today than when I moved into  it 9 because I do know my rent is affordable and   I10 don’ t, you know, like to ask him to make,  you 11 know, cosmetic repairs .	So of course, I got  down 12 on my hands and knees and sanded my floors   and 13 revarnished them.14 You know, I’ m the one who paints 15 my apartment.	So he’ s –- he’ s done well with 16 these rent stabilized tenants.17 MS . HOLDER :	Thank you.18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Rechner ,19 just a question to follow up on something   Mr.20 Schleider had asked.	You said that the dues  for 21 your union , about $ 50 or $ 60 a month for your 22 members and the others that you are  affiliated 23 with, have those dues increased in recent  years?24 MR . RECHNER:	Well , I can only 25 tell you the increases from my  own local.	But 2 
2 there’ s two components to union dues.	There’ s the 3 –- I mentioned New York State United Teachers,   our 4 union dues to them are about $ 500 per member  per 5 year and then on top of that you add a   small 6 amount to support the local.	So our union dues go 7 up about $ 2 per month per year .8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	Thank 9 you.10 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Have they ever 11 gone down?12 MR . RECHNER:	No.13 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .14 ( Applause. )15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Sid Miller.16 ( No response.)17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is Mr. Miller 18 here?19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	To be followed 20 by Anne Perryman, to be followed by Alan  Zucco .21 MR . MILLER :	What ’ s all this 22 arguing about?	We ’ re all friends.	You said no 23 increase.	I say ten percent.	You say you can ’ t24 afford –- we’ ve –- we’ ve got to stop this problem.25 I’ ve have the perfect solution .	It solves all 2 
2 problems.	It’ s called the truth glasses.	It only 3 reads the truth.	It doesn ’ t read a lie, it 4 doesn’ t read – - and now we ’ re going to read the 5 truth.6 And the true facts , the past 65 7 years of rent regulation have been a disaster  for 8 the entire City of New York, all five  boroughs .9 The rich have gotten richer.	The 10 poor have gotten poorer.	The gap is getting  wider 11 and wider and wider.	It’ s not coming together .12 The middle class is being squeezed out .13 Now remember before 1943 , anybody 14 could live anywhere they desired in any  community,15 anybody.	The only limiting factors was  the 16 tenants of building to pay  money.17 Before 1943 there was  competition 18 among the providers of  housing .	Competition 19 lowers prices.	But that’ s long gone thanks to the 20 administration of this government.21 The creeping crawling cancer of 22 rent regulations has destroyed our once  great 23 neighborhoods and community.	They ’ re never going 24 to return.	And all this damage could have  been 25 prevented.	Yes, it could have been prevented  very 2 
2 easily but there is only one time in our   history 3 when that could have been  prevented.4 That was 1946 when national  rent 5 regulations came up for renewal in the  State 6 Legislature, they sunset and sometimes in the  mid 7 ‘ 40 ' s but the lawmakers in Albany at the time were 8 spineless.	They said what ’ s good for me, not 9 what’ s good for the country so they made  rent 10 regulations a temporary wartime measure.11 The renters before you  said,12 lawmakers keep my rent low even if the City   burns 13 down around me .	And that’ s exactly what happened,14 the City burned down around  people .	Tenants, you 15 asked for it, now you’ ve got it.16 Now you got to remember, if  you 17 can’ t afford the rend, move.18 ( Audience participation.)19 MR .

MR . MILLER :	Glad to be here. ( Applause. )MR . MC LAUGHLIN:		Anne Perryman. MS . PERRYMAN:	Hi .		That’ s a
12 tough act to follow.13 Good afternoon .	I ’ m Anne 14 Perryman and I ’ m president of the Association of 15 Tenants of Lincoln Towers, whose members  I16 represent here today.17 We live in the remaining 450  rent 18 stabilized apartments in a 4 , 000 - unit development 19 that went co- op some years ago under a20 non- eviction plan.21 The nine Lincoln Towers were 22 built in the early 1960 ' s as part of a west  side 23 rejuvenation program that began with the  creation 24 of Lincoln Center.	The developers received 25 substantial public support for the  affordable 12 
2 high- rise apartment buildings in which we live .3 Many of our members were  the 4 first to occupy their apartments. In the  years 5 since then , we have raised our families, we  have 6 supported our schools, cultural institutions,7 restaurants, move theaters and stores through  good 8 times and bad.9 Now we are grandparents and  great 10 grandparents.	Some are retired and many of  us 11 continue to work.	We are active volunteers in  our 12 community.	We participate in the cultural life  of 13 the City and we all vote.	Our City Council 14 member , Gale Brewer, says that our community is 15 among the highest in the nation in the   percentage 16 of eligible voters who  vote.17 ATLT agrees with many of  the 18 points our colleagues in the tenant movement  have 19 made and our members have asked me to say that   the 20 rent stabilization program has allowed us to  live 21 the interesting lives we have sought in one of   the 22 greatest cities in the world.	For our part, we 23 have made New York City a richer, better  place .24 But we are concerned for our children  and 25 grandchildren and other creative young people  who 2 
2 wish to live in the  urban community.	They , too,3 would like to raise their families here and  New 4 York City needs their talents and their  diversity.5 We need to keep the rent  laws 6 strong and the rent increases modest and  we 7 desperately need more affordable housing so  that 8 the new generation of teachers , librarians ,9 writers, artists, dancers, musicians, waiters,10 shopkeepers, students and senior citizens will  be 11 able to live here.12 Housing the people of any  large 13 city will always be a challenge and New York   City,14 historically, has been a good place for  renters.15 The rents we pay at Lincoln Towers are  high 16 compared to many cities around the  country .	And 17 many of our members pay more than a third of   their 18 income for rent.	The image of us as  freeloaders 19 in a co- op is inaccurate.20 The DHCR is a  severely 21 understaffed agency that cannot enforce  the 22 housing laws we have already. Both the DHCR  and 23 the Rent Guidelines Board need reform.	We agree 24 with many who have testified that the system  is 25 broken .	The housing rules that we live by  should 2 
2 be fair and they should be made and enforced   in 3 New York City, not in  Albany.4 Thank you for giving me  this 5 opportunity to speak.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz.7 MR . SCHLEIDER:	There ’ s a8 question for you, Ms. Perryman .9 MS . CRUZ:	About how many units 10 are there in Lincoln Towers?11 MS . PERRYMAN:	Four thousand.12 MS . CRUZ:	And you –-13 MS . PERRYMAN:	There are eight 14 buildings.15 MS . CRUZ:	There are eight 16 buildings and you represent the group of  rent 17 stabilized –-18 MS . PERRYMAN:	I represent the 19 remaining rent stabilized tenants.20 MS . CRUZ:	And you said that 21 there were about 400 ?22 MS . PERRYMAN:	Four hundred and 23 fifty apartments.24 MS . CRUZ:	Four hundred and fifty 25 out of four thousand?2 
2 MS . PERRYMAN:	Yes.3 MS . CRUZ:	And would – - how is 4 the makeup of the other 3 , 000 some - odd apartments?5 MS . PERRYMAN:	They’ re owners.6 MS . CRUZ:	All right.7 MS . PERRYMAN:	Co - op owners.8 MS . CRUZ:	And do –- are they  in 9 any way detracting from the community that you ’ re 10 describing of –-11 MS . PERRYMAN:	I don’ t think so.12 I don’ t –- we live –- we live together  as 13 neighbors. I think there’ s a perception on  the 14 part of many of the owners that people who   are 15 rent stabilized tenants are getting a free  rider,16 which we are not.	It is totally inaccurate.17 MS . CRUZ:	Do you know whether 18 the common charges that they pay or  the 19 maintenance that they pay is higher or –- or   lower 20 than the rent stabilized – -21 MS . PERRYMAN:	I can only give 22 you the example of my neighbor across the hall   who 23 has the same apartment that I  have .	He bought the 24 apartment and their maintenance is  now 25 approximately the same as my rent and they have   a2 
2 $ 350 improvement – - additional fee .3 MS . CRUZ:	And –- but you, as  a4 rent stabilized tenant , benefit from all of the 5 improvements that are made in the building ?6 MS . PERRYMAN:	We benefit from 7 the cosmetic improvements but, unfortunately,  we 8 are living with the existing infrastructure of  our 9 apartment.	And so –- and so the same  metal 10 cabinets and we cannot make –- we’ re not  allowed 11 to make any changes, whereas the people who  have 12 bought their apartments have built new  kitchens 13 and so we are living with the  existing .14 MS . CRUZ:	And you think that 15 that’ s not fair?16 MS . PERRYMAN:	No.	I didn ’ t say 17 that.18 MS . CRUZ:	Oh , okay,19 MS . PERRYMAN:	That was not part 20 of what I  said .	That’ s part of the thing, if 21 you’ re going to stay as a rent stabilized  tenant,22 you keep your old  stove.23 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Question.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.25 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Any – - any 2 
2 violations on any of the buildings in  Lincoln 3 Towers that you know of?4 MS . PERRYMAN:	Not that I’ m aware 5 of .	There have been – -6 MR . SCHLEIDER:	So you have –-7 you have eight major apartment buildings, 4 , 000 8 apartments –-9 MS . PERRYMAN:	Right.10 MR . SCHLEIDER:	– - and no 11 significant violations ?12 MS . PERRYMAN:	I’ m not aware of 13 them.14 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And over the – -15 well, you are the president of your  tenants’16 association –-17 MS . PERRYMAN:	Yes .18 MR . SCHLEIDER: I would imagine 19 you would be if –- if –- you do   represent 20 more – -21 MS . PERRYMAN:	Well, you 22 know – -23 MR . SCHLEIDER:	–- than ten 24 percent of the apartments.25 MS . PERRYMAN:	–- people will 2 
2 complain that the landlord didn’ t do something  –-3 MR . SCHLEIDER:	I’ m not talking 4 about complaining.5 MS . PERRYMAN:	–- as promptly as 6 they might have.7 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And over the 8 past 25 years that Lincoln Towers have been  a9 co - operative - -10 MS . PERRYMAN:	No.	It went 11 co - op about 17 years ago.12 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Oh, these past 13 17 years.14 MS . PERRYMAN:	Exactly.15 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .16 -- that Lincoln Towers has been  a17 co - operative, you’ ve lived in the building , you 18 preceded that co- operative date?19 MS . PERRYMAN:	Yes , I’ ve lived in 20 the building for 35 years.21 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And you’ ve seen 22 the –- all right, so you’ ve seen the texture  of 23 the infrastructure at Lincoln Towers improve  over 24 the past 17 years, relative to when you  first 25 moved in?2 
2 MS . PERRYMAN:	It’ s –- it’ s been,3 they’ ve been good buildings.	We’ ve –- they were 4 good buildings when we moved  in.5 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And they’ ve had 6 major capital improvements instituted over  the 7 years.8 MS . PERRYMAN:	There have been 9 –- there have been cosmetic  –-10 MR . SCHLEIDER:	I know there 11 have.12 MS . PERRYMAN:	–- improvements ,13 yes.14 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And there have 15 been mechanical upgrades and systems changes  and 16 retrofits and renovations throughout the years , so 17 I know this as a  fact.18 MS . PERRYMAN:	Okay.19 MR . SCHLEIDER:	So you ’ ve 20 benefitted from this as a rent stabilized  tenant?21 MS . PERRYMAN:	I have indeed.22 MR . SCHLEIDER:	So you live in  a23 beautiful insulated community from the rest  of 24 Manhattan.	It ’ s a park- like setting, lots of 25 flowers, lots gardens, open areas,  parkways,2 
2 walkways, all kinds of niceties that many  people 3 would like to have .4 MS . PERRYMAN:	And so –- but  the 5 reality is that if I – - if I had to have   paid 6 market rent for my apartment, I would have   to 7 move.8 MR . SCHLEIDER:	No, I understand 9 that.10 MS . PERRYMAN:	I have –-11 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And if you had 12 purchased the apartment 17 years ago, you’ d be  in 13 a different position.	You wouldn’ t be part of the 14 tenants’ association.15 MS . PERRYMAN:	Yeah.16 MR . SCHLEIDER:	So it’ s a would 17 of could of.	I understand .18 They’ re beautiful buildings.19 MS . PERRYMAN:	They’ re –- yeah.20 MR . SCHLEIDER:	They’ re not 21 unlike public housing?22 MS . PERRYMAN:	No .	They’ re – -23 they’ re –-24 MR .

MS . PERRYMAN:	No, they’ re decent 
4 –- they’ re decent buildings.	They ’ re 5 well – -6 MR . SCHLEIDER:	–- in those 7 apartments , the amount of closet space in  those 8 apartments and the terraces are quite –- are  quite 9 extraordinary compared to typical housing stock  as 10 buildings go.11 MS . PERRYMAN:	Yeah.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Let’ s try and 13 focus the discussion here.14 Ms . Perryman, can I ask you –-15 MS . PERRYMAN:	Yes.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	–- how big an 17 apartment do you have?18 MS . PERRYMAN:	I have a  two-19 bedroom apartment.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	And what is 21 your rent?22 MS . PERRYMAN:	$ 1 , 711 .23 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .	And I have 24 one last question.25 MS . PERRYMAN:	Yes.4 
 2 MS . HOLDER :	It’ s your testimony 3 that you like where you  live?4 MS . PERRYMAN:	Yes.5 MS . HOLDER :	Okay .	And you’ d6 like to stay there ?7 MS . PERRYMAN:	Yes.8 MS . HOLDER :	Then why didn’ t you 9 buy 17 years ago?10 MS . PERRYMAN:	I didn ’ t have 11	$ 120 , 000 .12 MS .

ATTERBURY:	Hello .	My name 22 is Robert Atterbury and I’ m here on  behalf 23 Assembly Member Micah Z. Kellner, and I’ ll be 24 reading his testimony.25 In New York City,  landlord 12 
2 profits continue to rise, while middle class  New 3 Yorkers are paying ever higher proportions  of 4 their income towards rent.	As you decide on  this 5 year’ s proposed rent increases , I expect that you 6 will consider the challenges faced by our  tenants.7 According to the data  released 8 by this board, it is clear that landlords do   not 9 need another round of rent increases and  any 10 increase would only continue to work to  the 11 detriment of our City’ s seniors and middle class.12 The loss of the middle class means putting  the 13 City between the very rich and the very  poor 14 which, as history has illustrated, will set us   on 15 a path of urban decline that will push New   York 16 into a Detroit - like decay.	I, for one , do not 17 want to see that happen.18 As our economy entered the  most 19 recent downturn, landlords , with a secure supply 20 of income through rent regulation, saw  increased 21 profits while the markets around them  sharply 22 declined.	In the board’ s report on Income and 23 Expenses, you stated very clearly that  landlords’24 profits have grown over the years.	Net Operating 25 Income , a statistic that takes into account 2 
2 increases in operational expenditures, increased 3 5 . 8 percent from 2008 to 2009 and has increased 4 over 9 . 3 percent since 1990 , even after being 5 adjusted for inflation .	This indicates that an 6 ever growing percentage of rents are  going 7 directly to lining landlords’ pockets  and 8 additional increases are unnecessary 9 Rent regulation is designed to 10 protect those tenants who are most vulnerable  --11 those who cannot afford to or are too elderly   to 12 move.	In other words, to protect those  tenants 13 who simply do not have the leverage to   negotiate 14 on even ground with  landlords.15 All too often dishonest landlords 16 take advantage of tenants, using any  means 17 necessary to force hard working families  from 18 their homes.	I deal with this every day  as 19 eastsiders stream into my free legal clinic in   the 20 hopes of evening the balance  of power.	These 21 folks have enough on their plate and forcing  them 22 to defend their right to live in their home   at 23 every turn , sends the message that they are  not 24 wanted in New York , when, in fact, they are  the 25 ones we need the most.2 
2 The Real Estate and Developers 3 Group of New York recently reported that  market 4 rates for a two- bedroom, non- doorman apartment 5 have remained nearly constant over the past  year.6 In fact, they have actually declined by a   few 7 dollars.	The market has clearly reacted to  the 8 economic conditions that New Yorkers,  landlords,9 and tenants alike face and it’ s time that the  Rent 10 Guidelines Board does not issue an increase  for 11 the first time in its  history.12 For years this board has  proposed 13 increases and acted in a way that is   utterly 14 counterproductive to the goal of rent  regulations 15 which is to establish stable and  affordable 16 communities throughout our City.	Housing is 17 considered affordable when it comprises no  more 18 than the 30 percent of a resident’ s income .19 The board outlined this year  in 20 its Income and Affordability Study that,  with 21 unemployment reaching 9 . 5 percent, more than half 22 of New York citizens, are paying more that   30 23 percent of their income for rent.	Unfortunately,24 these tenants have been forced to sacrifice  in 25 other ways to make up the difference;  often 2 
2 compelling them to give up their homes and   move 3 further and further from their communities  and 4 livelihoods.5 Each year, you have approved 6 increases that build up the profits of  landlords 7 while harming the families who rely upon the  board 8 for protection .	It’ s a shame that an organization 9 created and designed to defend affordable  housing 10 in New York, has strayed so far from its   mission 11 by continually failing to maintain stable  and 12 affordable rents for those who need it  most.13 With residents facing decreasing 14 incomes and rising unemployment, and  landlords 15 reaping increased profits, I expect the  Rent 16 Guidelines Board to make the right decision  for 17 both.	I urge you not to issue any increases   for 18 this year.19 Thank you again for this 20 opportunity to testify .21 MR .

CASTAGNO:	All right.10 
2 First off, just before I  start 3 –- after – - I just have to  say something.	After 4 hearing some of these testimonies, like that  five 5 minute or six- minute testimony you heard a  minute 6 ago, I just have to say to some of these   landlords 7 who were so oppressed, that nobody held a gun   to 8 your head and forced you to buy a building in   New 9 York City or to invest in real estate in New   York.10 ( Applause. )11 MR . CASTAGNO:	According to the 12 numbers that I learned here at the  preliminary 13 hearing a couple of weeks ago, of the $ 679  per 14 apartment –- to sustain an apartment in New   York 15 and the average rent of an apartment being  close 16 to $ 1 , 300 , if you do the simple math, that means 17 that the profit margin of a landlord in New   York 18 is like 43 percent .	That’ s bigger than big 19 farmer , financial services institute – - or 20 companies, bigger than any corporation in  the 21 country.	So that’ s all I got to say that before  I22 jump to this here.23 My name is Don Castagno.	I live 24 on Fourth Street and I ’ m 56 years old.25 My building has 18 units.	There 2 
2 are two small restaurants on the ground floor  of 3 my building.	My landlord owns 17  buildings.4 There are only five rent stabilized tenants  left 5 out of 100 percent that there were 20 –- 15   years 6 ago.7 Due to high turnover rates in  the 8 building, the renovated apartments of the  former 9 stabilized tenants very soon reach the $ 2 , 000 10 decontrolled threshold .	My landlord does quite 11 well.12 I earn my living solely as  a13 musician providing live music and by giving  drum 14 lessons and also by publishing royalties  from 15 songs I’ ve written that have been recorded on 16 blues CDs by many traditional –- or not   many 17 traditional, but many national blues artists  in 18 this country.19 As a musician sometimes I don’ t20 even make $ 1 , 000 a month, even though my rent 21 hikes now are calculated based on that  amount.22 The music industry has seen dramatic reduction  in 23 the sale of CDs, blues CDs never have been   big 24 sellers, so for me that’ s even worse.25 Clubs in New York City pay  less 2 
2 now for bands than they did in the ‘ 80 ' s.	Drum 3 lessons after the economic crash in 2008 , fell  off 4 just like –- almost instantaneously.	People just 5 didn’ t have money to spend on that or didn ’ t want.6 So to the landlords, again , who 7 made 5 . 8 percent increase citywide profits , I’ d8 just like to say, I wish I could say that   my 9 income had only decreased by 5 . 8 percent last 10 year.	Okay.11 I’ m here today to ask this board 12 for one thing only .	I know there will be  rent 13 increases, but I’ m just asking that this  board 14 suspend implementation of what is known as  the 15 poor tax, which is designed to increase  baseline 16 rents of long term –- long time low income   tenants 17 like myself at an accelerated rate .18 The inevitable result of these 19 accelerated rent hikes on lower to modest  income 20 tenants like myself, will either be that we  are 21 driven into poverty and/ or driven from our 22 apartments .23 There’ s much talk about fairness 24 this year in this  rent debate.	In June of 2008 25 when the sky was falling, just like it ’ s falling 2 
2 this year, the first poor tax  was imposed.	Oil 3 was $ 145 per barrel that June.	On December 26 th 4 of that year, oil was $ 35 a  barrel .	Okay.	I’ m5 still paying for that 2008 oil spike and I   will 6 pay for the rest of  my life.	Is that fair ?7 Thirty - five years ago, New York 8 City was a much different  city .	People were 9 leaving in droves.	At that time, New York  City 10 essentially made a deal with folks like me and   the 11 deal was this, if we stayed in our apartments   in 12 our crack- infested neighborhoods, if we stayed , we 13 could have a place in New York City, an   apartment 14 whose rent would increase at a steady,  stable 15 rate, not left to the whims of some landlords   or 16 housing bubbles and bust.17 We took New York City up on  that 18 deal and our apartments became the  grounding 19 factor in our lives.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Castagno,21 please wrap up .22 MR . CASTAGNO:	Half of one 23 paragraph.24 All our lives decisions were  made 25 based on the knowledge that this apartment  would 2 
2 be here.	Every year that New York City  honored 3 that deal, more of a precedent was  established 4 that the agreement would continue.	We passed by 5 other options and opportunities for  affordable 6 housing.	I for one, could have qualified  for 7 artist housing a long time  ago .	Now the waiting 8 list for that housing is so long, they   stopped 9 taking names.10 As I speak , in Albany today,11 members of both parties are poised to renew  rent 12 laws because they are necessary.	We are New 13 Yorkers, we are not expendable .14 Unfortunately, down here in  New 15 York, it feels like New York City is wanting   to 16 break the deal it made with us so long  ago .17 Whatever happens here today will determine  whether 18that happens or not.19Thank you.20CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:Thank you.21( Applause. )22CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:Any questions?23( No response.)24CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:Thank you,25sir.
2 Loren Renz .3 MS . RENZ:	Ladies and gentlemen,4 my name is Loren  Renz.5 I’ ve owned by 1890 ' s brownstone 6 on West 80 th Street in Manhattan for 32  years.7 It ’ s my home and only property .8 I’ m here today to ask you to 9 reenact a low rent adjustment and I don’ t  call 10 that a poor tax.	As a small property owner with  a11 high proportion of stabilized units that  rarely 12 turn over, the flat dollar increases that  this 13 board approved two years ago and that the Court   of 14 Appeals recently upheld, were very important  to 15 me .	Such adjustments are the only way to  raise 16 extremely low rents of long- term tenants to a17 level where they will begin to pay a fairer   share 18 of the building’ s operating and capital costs.19 The problem is especially acute 20 in high rent neighborhoods like mine  where 21 property taxes and service fees  are highest.	As 22 prices escalate, long- term tenants with low rents 23 pay a smaller and smaller portion of our   overall 24 costs.25 Here are the facts about my  own 2 
2 house:	Half of the eight rental apartments  are 3 rent stabilized.	Three of these apartments have 4 been continuously occupied for more than 35  years,5 longer than I’ ve owned the building.	The tenants 6 are working couples, some with cars and  weekend 7 retreats.	Monthly rents range from $ 715 to $ 750 .8 Under the 2009 Low Rent Guidelines , increases were 9 $ 30 for a one- year lease and $ 60 for two- year 10 leases .	Without the flat dollar increase,11 percentage increases for that period for  those 12 apartments would have been just $ 17 to $ 19 for one 13 year or $ 35 to $ 39 for two years.	The flat dollar 14 adjustment made a difference.	Still these rents 15 are far below what is needed to break  even .16 This year all of my  stabilized 17 leases are up for renewal.	Unless this board 18 votes at the high end of the proposed ranges,   the 19 increases on these apartments will fall below  the 20 small gains of 2009 - 2010 .	This, despite that in 21 the same two- year period, my real estate taxes 22 along have increased by 16  percent .	They go up 23 eight percent every year, regardless.	This is a24 ten- unit building.25 I strongly urge you to include  a2 
2 low rent adjustment increase for long- term 3 tenancy. $ 40 for a one - year lease and $ 75 for a4 two- year lease .	Without it, I must ask you  to 5 vote increases of six percent of one year and   ten 6 percent for two years.	Clearly, the adjustment 7 allows the board more flexibility in  setting 8 guidelines for rents overall.	For that reason , it 9 should be used this year and every year to   bring 10 more reason and justice to the  system.11 Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 MR . CHEIGH :	I have – - I have a14 basic question .15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Cheigh.16 MR . CHEIGH :	I guess, you know ,17 for us we have to think about large categories   of 18 different types of building owners , where they ’ re 19 located.	There’ s buildings where the market rents 20 are very low and there ’ s buildings where there ’ s a21 lot of preferential –- recent preferential  rents.22 MS . RENZ:	Yes.23 MR . CHEIGH :	So as a  small 24 building owner , you know, could you give us  more,25 you know, with the Casado case , the tenant  members 2 
2 at least have –- have provided some  provisos 3 thinking about how to carve out different types  of 4 buildings.	As a small building owner, how  would 5 you respond to that?6 MS . RENZ:	Well, I think that 7 that was my point.	That if you provide a low  rent 8 adjustment , it gives you some possibilities for 9 differentiating between different kinds of  rents 10 and properties .	In my property it just  happens 11 that I have such a high proportion that   these 12 difference make a real –- a real difference in   my 13 bottom line.14 And I should say I do have  market 15 rents.	They’ re about $ 1 , 700 to $ 1 , 800 .	Those are 16 one- bedroom apartments .	And I really haven’ t been 17 able to increase those since 2008 and even for   one 18 tenant , since before that when she was  beginning 19 to lose her job.	So I think you have to see  that 20 we have a lot of turnover at the high end   because 21 people have to go where there are jobs and  it’ s22 not always New York.	People who are paying at  the 23 high end have to leave if they lose their  jobs .24 So I’ ve had more vacancies than I25 used to have.	It used to be that, you  know,2 
2 someone would come in and stay six or eight   years 3 until they got married , if they were at the  high 4 end.	And now those people are turning over  more 5 quickly and I have to be careful to make my   rents 6 affordable to them too .7 So it just means that the  bottom 8 line is not increasing and at the same time   we 9 have people who really can afford, and I’ m  not 10 only saying can afford , but are paying a11 disproportionately small portion of what the  costs 12 are for the house.	And I think that’ s –- that ’ s13 my issue.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.15 MS . RENZ:	Thank you.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Amelia 17 Rasalan, followed by Andrew Hoffman, followed  by 18 Ann Cunningham .19 We ’ ve got two ahead of you , Ann.20 MS . RASALAN:	Hello, everyone .21 My name’ s Amelia Rasalan.	I’ m22 presently now living at 511 East 20 th Street  in 23 Peter Cooper Village, Manhattan.	I have been 24 living there since 1970 , 41 years.25 I’ m opposed to any kind of rent 2 
2 increase proposals because I’ m living on a  single 3 fixed income. I just became a widow very   recently.4 And since I do not qualify for SCRIE nor do   I5 depend on any kind of rental assistance, I   just 6 cannot afford any kind of increases in  my 7 apartment where I’ m living now .8 I’ ve been living there for 40 9 years. I can’ t see myself being uprooted after  41 10 years in my apartment.	And I speak, also,  on 11 behalf of my neighbors who have been living  there 12 for even more than 50 years and they are so   afraid 13 that they may be displaced once the rent  increases 14 get finalized, that they just can’ t afford nine 15 percent or ten percent .	It’ s just too much for a16 single fixed income family .17 Additionally, I have been  so 18 afraid that there is also a proposal for – - to   cut 19 the threshold and reduce it from $ 2 , 000 to $ 1 , 500 .20 My rent now is very close to almost $ 1 , 500 because 21 I am not only paying the basic rent, I ’ m  also 22 paying an additional rent for MCI improvements  and 23 replacement of my appliances because I ’ ve been 24 there for so long and the appliances were   not 25 working.	So ten years ago, my husband and I   –-2 
2 when he was still alive, requested to replace  them 3 –- and we’ re still –- and I’ m still paying for 4 those additional rent on appliances.	It’ s5 forever.	It’ s permanent.6 Regarding repairs, you know,7 Peter Cooper is more or less okay when it comes   to 8 maintenance. But because of the –- what’ s9 happening, you know, right now , the repairs on  the 10 –- every single wintertime that we stay in   the 11 apartment, that we ’ re living in the apartment, I,12 you know, I feel that they have not done   anything 13 at all with the heating system , either you  have 14 too much heat or no heat at  all.15 Additionally, since I live in  the 16 main floor , we are only two tenants there on  our 17 floor that are stabilized rents, everybody else  is 18 market rent –- or market rate  renters.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Could you wrap 20 up , please .21 MS . RASALAN:	Pardon me.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Could you wrap 23 up .24 MS . RASALAN:	Oh, sure.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Your time has 2 

2	run out.3
MS . RASALAN:	Okay.	What –-
4 okay – - all I hope that you, who have the power   to 5 make a difference to seniors like me, you  know ,6 that you would be more considerate and  sensitive 7 to our needs.8 Thank you very much.9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.10 ( Applause. )11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Holder.12 MS . HOLDER :	I have – - yes, I13 have a question.14 Thank you so much for  your 15 personal testimony today.	I really appreciate 16 your coming forward.17 Could you tell me, again,  where 18 is your apartment located?19 MS . RASALAN:	Peter Cooper 20 Village, it runs from 20 – - First Avenue to 23 rd.21 It ’ s owned by –- it used to be owned by  Tishman,22 original owner was Met  Life.23 MS . HOLDER :	And how long have 24 you been there again?25 MS . RASALAN:	Since 1970 , that 4 
2 was my first apartment .3 MS . HOLDER :	And how long have 4 you had your MCIs?5 MS . RASALAN:	It was quite some 6 time ago, about ten year  ago.7 MS . HOLDER :	How many rooms in 8 your apartment ?9 MS . RASALAN:	It’ s a three –- a10 three- room apartment; a one bedroom.11 MS . HOLDER :	Oh, okay.	And then 12 you said you’ re also paying for individual 13 apartment improvement, the appliances?14 MS . RASALAN:	The appliances.15 Once you replace your appliances, you know ,  they 16 own it and they charge you every single  month 17 forever.	It’ s a permanent increase.18 MS . HOLDER :	Thank you so much 19 for your testimony today.20 MS . RASALAN:	Thank you.21 ( Applause. )22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.23 Andrew Hoffman .24 MR . HOFFMAN:	Good afternoon.25 My name is Andrew Hoffman.	I am the vice  chairman 2 
2 of the Community Housing Improvement  Program.3 Thank you for allowing me  the 4 opportunity to testify today.5 As a property manager, I live  the 6 hard facts of what ’ s going on in the New York  City 7 housing market from real life, I live these  facts,8 not from a bunch of numbers that attempt to   tell 9 you what’ s going on.10 The life – - the life that I  live 11 is the life of too high expenses,  especially 12 water, real estate taxes and energy  costs.13 Increased governmental regulations impacting our 14 bottom line that is not included in any of   the 15 Rent Guidelines Board numbers.	And recently,16 rental concessions on our high rent market  units 17 with absurdly low guidelines on the low  rent 18 units.19 This year must be different.	In 20 a hostile city where doing all types of   businesses 21 is impossible, the Rent Guidelines Board  must 22 transcend politics and set guidelines that  reflect 23 the cost of living in a workable, no   rent 24 supplement that provides sufficient increases  for 25 the low rent units .2 
2 We know –- we all know there  are 3 basically two types of apartments  out there.	The 4 apartments of market where the rents are  being 5 negotiated every day between the landlord and  the 6 tenant and the below market apartment that  this 7 board is setting its levels  for.8 Let’ s understand the market rents 9 are subsidizing the below market apartments.	The 10 rents have fallen 30 percent over the past  three 11 years.	Every renewal becomes a challenge  and 12 every new lease is a nightmare . The past  few 13 years we’ ve seen market rents decline where 14 concessions are now the norm.	The few market rate 15 units we have in the buildings that once  provided 16 the necessary dollars to subsidize the low  rents,17 are no longer doing so .18 We need high percentage Guideline 19 increase on these low subsidized – - the math  is 20 simple .	Low percentage increases on low  rent,21 below market apartments are too low and  are 22 unacceptable.	Owners who run good buildings  are 23 plagued with long- term tenants who pay in turn ,24 the lowest rents.	Small percentage increases on 25 these small rents don’ t pay bills and will 2 
2 directly go to abandonment in areas that  need 3 affordable housing the most.4 It ’ s the Rent Guidelines Board 5 job that during these hard times to make  it 6 possible for us to stay in business in   these 7 adverse economic times .	The board ’ s mandate is 8 simple .	You do the economic conditions of  the 9 residential real estate industry in New  York,10 including such factors as prevailing and  projected 11 real estate taxes, water and sewer  increases,12 ongoing maintenance costs, et  cetera.13 Given the City ’ s most important 14 citizens, the landlord , proper Guidelines 15 increases comparable to the price index with  the 16 low rent supplements.17Thank you.18CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Any questions?19( No response.)20CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.21MR . CHEIGH :	I have a  question 22for Mr .Hoffman.23CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	A question for 24you.25MR . CHEIGH :	Mr. Hoffman, thank 
2 you for your testimony .3 Did you say –- did you say  that 4 rents have fallen 30 percent?	Which neighborhoods 5 do you –- do you manage property  in?6 MR . HOFFMAN:	Core Manhattan – - I7 managed in core Manhattan and also in some of   the 8 boroughs.	Over the past three years, we’ ve seen 9 rents decrease by 30  percent.10 MR . CHEIGH :	Thirty percent 11 so –-12 MR . HOFFMAN:	I mean it’ s only 13 recently that we’ ve started seeing some price 14 increases but you can’ t look at the last three  or 15 four months in a vacuum, you need to look at   the 16 last couple of years.17 MR . CHEIGH :	I mean most of  the 18 data seems to show –- I mean, I’ m just looking  at 19 the City habitats releasing statement saying  that 20 in core Manhattan vacancy rates are under  one 21 percent, concessions from building owners  are 22 decreasing and , in fact, you know, the anecdote  of 23 rents from peers and colleagues that I have  for 24 market rate renters that I have, they’ re  seeing 25 increases back to the levels where they  expected 2 
2 from two or three years  ago.3 This is –- I mean, for me   –-4 MR . HOFFMAN:	No, no, certainly 5 the data that you’ re looking at is second  quarter 6 2011 ; right?	It’ s kind of difficult to sit here 7 and look at something that minutely, you know,  it 8 –- yes , the last three months have been  good.9 Students are coming into the market.	People are 10 starting to hire.	Unfortunately, as the real 11 estate market goes , when times are rough – - slow,12 the economy is bad , people don ’ t do any 13 construction.	So for the past three years  there 14 hasn’ t been any new construction - -15 MR . CHEIGH :	But does that help 16 the rental –-17 MR . HOFFMAN:	–- which , of 18 course , leads to a demand and now there’ s an  up 19 fit and it ’ s – - it ’ s very concentrated in core 20 Manhattan.	It ’ s not in the outer boroughs at all.21 MS . HOLDER :	How long have you 22 been in this business?23 MR . HOFFMAN:	I’ ve been in this 24 business for almost 30 years now.	Thirty years.25 MR . HOFFMAN:	Well, in New York 2 
2 City – - well, first of all , I’ m a third generation 3 so I didn’ t have much of a choice.	My grandfather 4 didn’ t , you know buy any other business –- he –-5 he bought –- yes, so I was here by default   but 6 there wasn ’ t anything other than market then.7 Stabilized units prior to 1974 , you know, all 8 buildings that were built prior to 1974  are 9 stabilized .	So he really didn ’ t have much of 10 choice .	He bought an apartment building  with 11 stabilized apartments.12 MR . CHEIGH :	Can I ask, you 13 know, have a lot of apartments also gone  to 14 decontrol, as well ?15 MR . HOFFMAN:	Yeah , about 30 16 percent of our housing stock in core Manhattan  has 17 been decontrolled, about 20 percent in the  other 18 boroughs.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Schleider.20 MR . SCHLEIDER:	So this is CHIP 21 that you’ re talking about?22 MR . HOFFMAN:	Yes , sir.23 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .24 So is there across the  portfolio 25 of your holdings and the members’ holdings ,  how 2 
2 many buildings are we speaking  of?3 MR . HOFFMAN:	CHIP members 4 represent about 100 , 000 apartments .5 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Roughly in about 6 how many buildings ?	Roughly?7 MR . HOFFMAN:	Three thousand.8 MR . SCHLEIDER:	I –- just maybe 9 to clear something up, maybe the – - well, I  don’ t10 want to talk about the rent reduction –-   the 11 apartments in the portfolio, and the holdings  that 12 are well below market and don’ t tend – - and those 13 rents are fairly static given the  percentage 14 increases that the board passes –- with the  fall 15 off in your deregulated rents or your top   end 16 rents, and I’ m not going to say yes or no  that 17 it ’ s 30 percent, but certainly with the fall off,18 even if it ’ s 10 percent, that certainly has 19 impacted the operating margins and your ability  to 20 keep these buildings at a proper level so that   you 21 can attract those top tier  rents.22 What – - what percentage of 23 buildings in your holdings and in your  members ’24 holdings would you say are really  suffering 25 because of the rent rollbacks, top end , the  amount 2 
2 of increases in real estate taxes, sewer taxes ,3 insurance rates, unfunded mandates and  other 4 government regulations , how is that really 5 impacting, because you ’ re talking about core 6 Manhattan and the board is told how core   Manhattan 7 properties are outperforming the rest of the  City,8 maybe yes, maybe no.9 But how are you going to  maintain 10 these buildings and still have the allure to   be 11 able to attract this type of tenants that make   the 12 top end rents and want to –- and are attracted   to 13 the City in the first  place?14 Certainly it’ s part of the 15 economic diversity to have those top earners  here 16 and if we can’ t afford to keep those  rental 17 buildings up, it may impact the ability of   the 18 City to be a magnetic for that type of   tenant.19 MR . HOFFMAN:	It’ s a real 20 challenge.	You know, if you’ re looking at a21 building with a 30 percent decontrol rate, so   if 22 you have, you know , your typical 100 - unit 23 building, maybe 30 units are decontrolled at  or 24 above market and the others are stabilized , you 25 know, you walk this fine  line.2 
2 The first problem is, you know ,3 you have those 30 apartments, the last thing  you 4 want to do is to try to quickly get back to   the 5 pre Lehman numbers .	All right , that’ s your first 6 challenge.	You know, of course, you want to  get 7 the most rents you can but if you’ re talking  about 8 a couple of hundred dollars on a $ 3 , 000 apartment,9 you’ re not going to lose a tenant over a couple  of 10 hundred dollars.	You just can ’ t get back to your 11 three- year losses in one year.	You lose one or 12 two or three months of rent because the  apartment 13 turns over .	It kills your bottom line .14 I don’ t think the bottom line in 15 core Manhattan has moved much in the last  three 16 years.	It ’ s been a real problem.	And in order to 17 keep - - as you said, in order to keep the  high 18 rent apartment , you need to continually upgrade 19 the buildings to keep with the Joneses of the   new 20 buildings that are completely decontrolled , you 21 know, where they have unbelievable amenities  space 22 and they have fancy gyms and they have , you  know,23 breakfast that they give – - it ’ s really, it’ s an 24 arms race at the new construction compared to   some 25 of the old construction.2 
2 And, you know, you want  to 3 maintain the property for everyone .	You know, my 4 supers and my managers don ’ t have a list of who’ s5 rent stabilized and who’ s fair market.	Somebody 6 calls and they have a problem in their   apartment,7 they get their problem taken  care of.	They don’ t8 know if they’ re –- the doorman doesn’ t know if 9 somebody’ s a rent stabilized tenant paying $ 1 , 000 10 or $ 3 , 000 for a market rent.11 But the last three years  have 12 seen a dramatic decrease in the improvements  that 13 we make.	And we’ re not talking about improvements 14 that we make that we  get MCIs.	We ’ re talking 15 about cosmetic improvements that are necessary  in 16 order to retain and bring in new high  paying 17 tenants who are subsidizing the low  stabilized 18 people .	That has stopped over the last couple  of 19 years.20 And, you know, I hope I’ m  going 21 to be able to continue that process of   renovating 22 the buildings and increasing the common areas  and 23 increasing tenant amenities for all tenants in  the 24 building.	You know, if I have a gym in   a25 stabilized building, the tenants in the  building 2 
2 are entitled to use the gym.	Fair market tenants 3 want a little nicer, so I have to do a    little 4 nicer improvement for 30 percent of the  building 5 and 70 percent of the building gets  that 6 improvement and it ’ s not MCIable.7 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Are your 8 buildings over leveraged?9 MR . HOFFMAN:	No, luckily, you 10 know, we were –- you know, as I said, I’ m   third 11 generation so I’ m kind of lucky in that  regard 12 that they’ re not over leveraged. I could only 13 imagine if we had something more than a 50   percent 14 LTV mortgage, I’ d probably be a lot more  hard 15 pressed than not sitting here in the same –-   the 16 same light .17 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .18 MR . HOFFMAN:	Thank you.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.20 Ann Cunningham , will be followed 21 by Hal Brill, will be followed by Joo Yeon  Lee .22 MS . CUNNINGHAM :	Good afternoon,23 Mr . Chairman, members of the Rent Guidelines  Board 24 staff and all present.25 My name is Ann Cunningham.	Since 2 
2 1979 , I have been assisting tenants in  every 3 possible capacity.	For the past ten years I  have 4 served working for Council Member Gale A.  Brewer,5 as a housing specialist and liaison to  senior 6 citizens.7 In the past two years  while 8 working part time from Hamilton Project  Senior 9 Center , I have acquired well over 200 cases.	As a10 community activist , I touch base with local 11 homeless, several being former SRO and  residential 12 hotel tenants.	Needless to say, these tenants  are 13 rapidly disappearing from communities throughout 14 the City.	We need more statistics on this  group.15 This testimony includes 17 16 creditable letters to you from tenants in  the 17 Temple Hotel, an upper westside illegal  hotel 18 where I reside .	The letters describe it  all,19 alleged prostitution and drugs are brought  into 20 the hotel by Wogo ( phonetic), which has many 21 aliases as you will see in the building  profile 22 attached to this testimony .23 A company that the landlord  Incos 24 ( phonetic) , signed a contract with for the past 25 eight years, alleged prostitutes, and I  say 2 
2 alleged so I don’ t be sued , alleged prostitutes 3 both female and male rent rooms for less than   30 4 days and then are changed to other rooms,  always 5 on different floors.	One escort in the building 6 advertised her building –- her business on  the 7 website, Spicy Jordan Weblicon .	If the 8 advertisement is deleted, I will supply you with  a9 copy, just ask me.10 Several guests have departed May 11 20 th after I had informed the authorities  and 12 Council Member Brewer.	Across the board there ’ s a13 shortage of affordable and senior  housing.14 Seniors are living longer and therefore not  many 15 vacancies are available in the senior  housing 16 capacity.17 Rent controlled tenants are, of 18 course , bear the burden of the most harassment 19 from landlords .	Many single parents have lost 20 their jobs and simply cannot afford higher and / or 21 present rents.	This board should also consider 22 the millions of dollars owed to the City  on 23 violations for landlords.	Should a rent increase 24 be given to this group ?	Actually, they do not 25 maintain their buildings.2 
2 Attached is a building profile  of 3 the Temple Hotel informing you of all  necessary 4 details which is certain proof that SRO  and 5 residential hotel owners are not a poverty  group.6 In fact, now they have a lot of destabilized   units 7 in these buildings and I strongly urge you to   vote 8 no on a rent  increase.9 On thing I do want to say is,   I10 neglected to put in the income that my   landlord 11 Inco receives.	They receive $ 1 million a year 12 from the tourist trade .	And I found that  out 13 because a law case that they have is now on   the 14 Internet.	And from the commercial tenants there’ s15 a play school in there for children,  Gymboree,16 many doctors’ offices.	The SRO rooms were taken 17 down and they made it  commercial.18 That’ s another $ 1 million a year.19 Plus there are destabilized units in the  building,20 more money .21 Thank you, once again, for  your 22 work and for the pleasure of participation .23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you very 24 much, Ann.25 Any questions?2 
2 ( No response.)3 MS . CUNNINGHAM :	Thank you.4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Hal Brill.5 MR . BRILL:	Hi.	Good afternoon.6 I’ m Hal Brill and I manage a small –- I own   and 7 manage a small Manhattan  building.8 The inadequate guidelines –- I ’ ve 9 created long term rentals with rents too low  to 10 cover costs.	Water rates continue to increase ,11 real estate taxes continue to go through the  roof,12 repairs and labor costs go up.	My building is ,13 unfortunately, heated by oil and the increase  in 14 the price of oil  is unbelievable.	It just keeps 15 going up.16 One wonders how the Rent 17 Guidelines Board justifies the figures to  support 18 the measly increases that you’ ve provided over the 19 years.	The supplemental increases have helped  in 20 the past by providing a minimum increase for  the 21 lowest rents in our building.	This must be 22 continued this year and I urge you to   implement 23 the highest minimum increases you could see  fit 24 doing.25 Because the Rent Guidelines have 2 
2 not kept up with the costs , the longer a  tenant 3 has been living in our building, the lower  the 4 rent is.	The system does not address  merit,5 income , family need, just longevity.6 This inspires, I believe,  tenant 7 corruption .	Tenants fight to keep their 8 apartments .	They sublet them illegally to  two 9 successors after they leave, getting paid to  do 10 so .	Even after the move or die, they will  it,11 they try to push it onto partners that may or   may 12 not have existed, so people with no rights  to 13 secede get in via these illegal means and we   have 14 to jump through hoops to go through the  legal 15 system and try to get these people  out .16 So , I think, we have to spend  an 17 inordinate amount of time and legal fees just  to 18 get our control of apartments.	This convoluted 19 regulatory systems burdens the legal system  with 20 illegal tenants who hang on no matter  how 21 flagrantly they don’ t qualify and now they  even 22 claim landlord harassment.23 This system is skewed against  all 24 landlords, including fair reasonable cooperative 25 ones, in favor of tenants.	Overwhelming volume of 2 
2 paperwork, court cases are a routine part of   our 3 lives and lead compliance laws all add  instability 4 and uncertainty to the very raw deal of owning   a5 small residential building in New York  City.6 We have the plague of bed  bugs 7 that just add more costs and more  problems .	So I8 think the Rent Guidelines Board has failed  the 9 small landlord , has failed the small property 10 owner and it only allows minuscule increases  that 11 have not kept up with inflation and, in fact,   fall 12 further behind every single year.13 Clearly the situation cannot be 14 rectified overnight, but incremental steps can  be 15 taken to gradually turn things around, raise  the 16 Guideline increases, re- institute vacancy 17 allowances and supplemental increases so  apartment 18 rents can rise to subsistence  levels.19 Thank you.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,21 sir.22 Joo Yeon Lee, who will  be 23 followed by Natasha Missick, to be followed  by 24 Grace Torres.25 MS . LEE:	Thank you for the 2 
2 opportunity to testify .3 My name is Joo Yeon Lee,  staff 4 attorney at Bedford Stuyvesant Community  Leader 5 Services.6 I’ m speaking on behalf of Legal 7 Services New York City and together with the  Legal 8 Aid Society, we have submitted our  written 9 testimony documenting in detail the dire  situation 10 facing low income tenants.11 My work as a staff attorney  at 12 Legal Services involves direct representation  of 13 tenants in Central Brooklyn.	Our clientele 14 includes mostly people on fixed income  because 15 they’ re disabled or retired, low income working 16 families and families on welfare.	The majority of 17 our clients are paying 40 percent or more of   their 18 income towards rent.19 While our written testimony 20 states statistical data, I would like to take   this 21 chance to share an example of what my office   sees 22 as an effective rent increase in my  neighborhood.23 Recently, I represented a single mother with  a24 15 - year old son.	She has monthly income of  about 25 $ 1 , 300 , working full time closer to a minimum wage 2 
2 as a bus driver.	Her rent was about $ 921 , which 3 is 70 percent of her income, leaving her less   than 4 $ 400 to maintain her and her son’ s living,5 including paying for utilities , metro cards,6 school supplies, food and clothing .7 This year her rent was  increased 8 to about $ 962 , which is 4 . 5 percent increase for 9 one year, leaving her less than $ 340 per week  to 10 support her and her son’ s living.11 You may think this example  only 12 highlights the people in extreme  poverty.13 However, as noted in our written testimony ,  total 14 of 435 , 000 low income families live in 15 rent- regulated housing , households with income 16 below or closer to our federal poverty  line.17 These include any working family earning close  to 18 a minimum wage .19 To give you an idea, a family  of 20 four, whose dad earns minimum wage full- time every 21 week, will have about $ 1 , 300 per month to support 22 –- to maintain their four –- family living ,  paying 23 rent, utilities and food.24 If mom works also at a  minimum 25 wage too, then this family would have only $ 2 , 600 2 
2 per month to pay rent and buy other  necessities 3 for a family of  four.4 This year is extremely brutal  for 5 low income tenants who have lost government  rent 6 subsidy programs.	Tenants are left without 7 Section 8 benefits or programs by Department  of 8 Homeland Services.9 With soaring unemployment rate 10 and declining income, rent - stabilized tenants are 11 left with really limited options this year .12 Therefore, we urge the board to consider  the 13 current hardship imposed to low income tenants  and 14 to freeze the rent  increase.15 In addition, there shouldn ’ t be 16 any minimum increase for long- term tenants .	In 17 the testimony, we have listed a few provisos  to 18 allow the Rent Guidelines Board to consider  zero 19 rent increases in the following situations  where 20 less than 80 percent of the residential units  in 21 the building are occupied by rent- regulated 22 tenants, that means if sufficient number of  units 23 are deregulated, allow some profits for  the 24 landlord, and other situations include  violations 25 exist in the building that have not  been 2 
2 corrected.	And the other situation includes  the 3 apartment that has been subject to one or   more 4 vacancy increase in the past four  years.5 We also are –- I’ m almost 6 finished – - not to adopt proposed one percent  fuel 7 surcharge because it is already counted in  the 8 proposed rent increase guidelines.	That’ s it.9 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	Thank you, Ms.10 Lee.11 ( Applause. )12 MS . CRUZ:	Can you just give us 13 the –- recommendation not the fuel surcharge,  but 14 the one before that?15 MS . LEE:	The provisos .	Yes.16 So there are provisos which is in our   written 17 testimony, includes –- no –- zero rent  increase 18 for the buildings if the less than 80 percent   of 19 the residential units are occupied  by 20 rent- regulated tenants , which means that enough 21 units in that building , a sufficient number of  the 22 units are deregulated to allow some profits  for 23 the landlord.24 And, also, the situation includes 25 rent impairing and hazardous violations which  will 2 
2 be documented by Department of Housing  and 3 Development as HPD violations and that have  not 4 been corrected by the owners, which means that  the 5 building is not being maintained up to  Code.6 Another situation includes , if 7 the apartment has been subject to one or   more 8 vacancy increases for the past four years,  which 9 allows the landlord to take 17 percent or   20 10 percent of the vacancy increase for the past  four 11 years.12 MS . CRUZ:	Okay.	Thank you.13 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	Any other?14 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Question.15 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	Mr. Schleider.16 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you for 17 your presentation.18 You made a reference to  a19 hypothetical family of four –-20 MS . LEE:	Right.21 MR . SCHLEIDER:	– - they got 22 minimum wage and then you said if the mother   works 23 at minimum wage, – -24 MS . LEE:	Right.25 MR . SCHLEIDER:	–- they come up 2 
2 with a certain –- hypothetically then how  long 3 have these people been in New York  City?4 MS . LEE:	Well , it ’ s not actually 5 hypothetical, I feel that our tenants  –-6 MR . SCHLEIDER:	No , no , you used 7 the word hypothetical.8 MS . LEE:	Right.9 MR . SCHLEIDER:	So I’ m asking,10 how long have these people hypothetically been  in 11 New York City?12 MS . LEE:	Well , this – - we see a13 lot of tenants who come to our offices who   have 14 been living there for 10 , 20 , 30 years in New  York 15 City.16 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	But you 17 made a hypothetical.	Hypothetically, how long 18 have these people been here?19 MS . LEE:	Let’ s say 30 years or 20 20 years.21 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .22 MS . LEE:	Would it make a23 difference ?24 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Thank you .25 MS . LEE:	You ’ re welcome.2 
2 MS . HOLDER :	I have a question .3 Thank you for your  testimony.4 So –- and I know you’ re at  South 5 Brooklyn Legal Services and you’ re also presenting 6 testimony on behalf of the Legal Aid Society  as 7 well as Legal Services , two very fine 8 organizations, I must add.9 MS . LEE:	Thank you.10 MS . HOLDER :	Thank you.11 So some people ask that in  terms 12 of the conditions that some of the tenants live   in 13 that organizers in legal services  organizations 14 should help those folks get the –- the  conditions 15 corrected.	What’ s your response or the response 16 of other advocates in dealing with conditions  in 17 some of the buildings that we see in   the 18 communities?19 MS . LEE:	Well , we ’ ve been 20 working with a lot of tenant organizers and we ,  as 21 the lawyers, will help them to go to court   to 22 address these violations.	But not all the 23 buildings and not all the tenants have  resources 24 to go to court and address  these violations.	But 25 all of the tenants are faced to this three   percent 2 
2 or six percent rent increases last  year.3 So what we proposed is that  in 4 Casado decision, the Court of Appeals allows  them 5 classified different – - differentiated rent 6 increases for some of  the tenants.	So we also ,7 you know, provide –- in our provisos  suggested 8 that it’ s a differentiated increase for some  of 9 the buildings and zero increase for the  other 10 buildings which have not been maintained  or 11 repaired at all.12 MS . HOLDER :	Also, some tenants 13 have stated that they actually are afraid to   sue 14 their landlords for conditions in what we know  as 15 HP actions in Housing Court; why is  that?16 MS . LEE:	Because if – - if , you 17 know – - well, sometimes they are fearful that  if 18 they bring the landlord to court, then they,  you 19 know, for some reason they will be also  harassed 20 by the landlord in terms of, you know, not   giving 21 them services or, you know , just try to  increase 22 the rent and a lot of tenants were actually   also 23 being overcharged.24 We see a lot of them in  court 25 being overcharged by – - in form of harassment  that 2 
2 if they make complaints to the government and,  you 3 know, all of a sudden they find that their   rent 4 jumped to a certain level or they find   themselves 5 in Housing Court.6 MS . HOLDER : And what’ s the risk 7 these days in tenants who try to withhold   their 8 rent because of conditions in the apartment  or 9 participating in rent strikes?10 MS . LEE:	The risk for the 11 tenants, actually if it’ s not market rate 12 apartment, if it’ s market rate or a small  building 13 landlord, then they can terminate their lease  and 14 ask them to move out.	Then they will lose their 15 home if they make complaint about the  repairs.16 MS . HOLDER :	And what about –-17 what about the record keeping of tenants who  are 18 being sued if they ’ re withholding the rent for a19 rent strike?	Do they get –- do they get listed  on 20 a –- is there like a list that ’ s kept about  the 21 tenants who are being sued by  landlords?22 MS . LEE:	Right.	In Housing 23 Court if any tenant who were sued for cause   or 24 without cause for any reason, then they will  – -25 then all of the tenants will be ended up on  what’ s2 
2 called the black list for –- for the bad   tenants,3 which means that, you know , any landlord who’ s4 trying to rent the apartment can pre- screen the 5 tenant who end up in those  lists.6 And any tenant who were  justified 7 with – - in withholding the rent because of  the 8 repair issue can end up in those lists and   they 9 can have hard time in finding a new   apartment 10 because, you know, the prospective landlord  can 11 find themselves –- find the tenant in that  black 12 list that they ’ re in.13 So , you know, that has been 14 impacted the tenant that they want to shy  away 15 from suing the landlord because they don’ t want  to 16 end up in Housing Court and have – - either have  a17 poor credit or have a tenant screening  bureaus 18 that they can be found .19 MS . HOLDER :	Thank you.20 MS . CRUZ:	I have a  question.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes , Ms . Cruz.22 MS . CRUZ:	So you describe how 23 difficult for some tenants it is to bring an   HP 24 action or make any kind of complaint because  of 25 the fear of retribution.2 
2 MS . LEE:	Um- hum.3 MS . CRUZ:	So how would that  be 4 any different if there was a proviso that no   rent 5 increase, if there are building code conditions  in 6 a particular building, how would that be  enforced?7 Wouldn ’ t it be the exact same problem, the tenants 8 in those kinds of buildings would not be able   to 9 enforce any –- that type of a proviso because   they 10 would be afraid of retribution by their  owner?11 MS . LEE:	Well , we ’ re hoping that 12 that could encourage some of the landlords  at 13 least to make –- to change the owners’ mind   in 14 terms of making improvement or repairs in  the 15 building.16 I see your point that it  could 17 not make a difference for some of the   buildings 18 but, you know, if you classify the tenants ,  why 19 not classify the landlord who is doing their  job 20 and who is not doing their job .21 MS . CRUZ:	Because there are 22 many, many laws already that are directed  towards 23 maintaining buildings in a safe and  habitable 24 condition and tenants have many ways to  enforce 25 that.	To add yet one more layer, based on   what 2 
2 you’ re telling us –-3 MS . LEE:	Um - hum .4 MS . CRUZ:	–- would make 5 absolutely no difference because it isn’ t the  type 6 of building that maybe need that kind  of 7 enforcement where the tenants, perhaps , are most 8 afraid to enforce their rights .	That’ s what I ’ m9 hearing from your testimony.10 MS . LEE:	Right.	But from where 11 I can see from my clients, we don’ t see  direct 12 impact of increasing the rent and how it   affects 13 the increased services .	The tenants have been 14 suffering every year they increase rents  for 15 rent- stabilized tenants but not always they have 16 the benefit of increased services or  maintenance.17 Actually, the complaint for the heat  violations 18 have increased and the complaints for lead  paint 19 violations have been increased .20 MS . CRUZ:	And why , in those 21 instances, don ’ t your clients file a complaint 22 with DHCR and get a rent reduction order   where 23 their rents would not go up if the agency goes   out 24 and –-25 MS . LEE:	Right.2 
2 MS . CRUZ:	–- inspects and finds 3 that those are , in fact, truthful conditions?4 MS . LEE:	Well , some of the 5 tenants are filing complaints but some of  the 6 tenants can’ t because they cannot hire –-  either 7 they can’ t hire lawyers or they can’ t –- they have 8 jobs where they have to go to work and not   always 9 they can hire lawyer.10 MS . CRUZ:	I understand it ’ s just 11 a form that you mail in or you make a phone   call.12 You don’ t need a lawyer to file a DCHR  complaint.13 ( Audience participation.)14 MS . LEE:	Well , –-15 MS . HOLDER :	Isn’ t it the case 16 that the proviso would suggest that it would be   –-17 that HPD would be reporting that these  violations 18 exist and that these buildings , therefore, would 19 not be entitled to the increase which is   far 20 different than a tenant asserting and having  to 21 affirmatively assert that there are  these 22 conditions that exist and communicating  that 23 therefore to DHCR would be –- it would   be 24 something where the agency would therefore  know 25 and be able to tell another agency that this  – -2 
2 this landlord hasn ’ t registered and the building 3 is not entitled to any  increase?4 MS . CRUZ:	I don’ t quite think 5 that this board has the authority to direct  other 6 City agencies to monitor buildings , but be that  as 7 it may –-8 MS . HOLDER :	HPD already monitors 9 buildings.	But this would be different.	HPD 10 would be there for sharing its information that  it 11 already gathers reporting to a State agency,  HCR 12 that also gathers information from landlords  when 13 they register their buildings and,  therefore,14 those buildings would not be entitled  to 15 increases.16 MS . LEE:	Any more questions?17 ( No response.)18 ( Applause. )19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.20 Natasha Missick.21 MS . MISSICK:	Hi .	My name’ s22 Natasha Missick.	I’ m an advocate with University 23 Settlement . I’ m also a tenant in a rent- stabilized 24 apartment and I’ m going to speak about both  areas.25 " The New York Times" today 2 
2 reported the City jobless rate at 8 . 6 percent.	We 3 know that Section 8 is not accepting any   more 4 applications.	SCRIE is backed up in  applications 5 and they’ re basically accepting people who are 6 either working or on some kind of a   domestic 7 violence priority, which is important that  they 8 have that priority , but most people wouldn ’ t be 9 entitled to getting that.10 The rates are extremely high  for 11 market rate apartments and , also, we know  that 12 113 , 553 people turned to shelters in the year 13 2010 .	And 38 percent of those were children  and 14 that it cost $ 36 , 000 to house a family in a15 shelter which is very expensive.	So just in terms 16 of the cost analysis, it’ s expensive to  have 17 people going to shelters.	It’ s also detrimental 18 to families, to children and what we’ re finding  is 19 that people are coming to University  Settlement 20 asking for help, begging for  help.21 We ’ re having people come to us 22 because of this high unemployment that ’ s being 23 faced in the City and long - term unemployment.24 We ’ re grateful that unemployment has been extended 25 for people but , you know, they ’ re needing it and 2 
2 people are coming to us where they can ’ t get help 3 with one- shot deals from HRA because their rents 4 are too high.5 So it’ s harder and harder to help 6 people who are struggling.	I go to Housing  Court 7 and it ’ s full. And I’ ve been working at University 8 Settlement for ten years, I see a   difference 9 between when I first started and what the   calendar 10 looked like and what it looks like  now .	There ’ s a11 morning calendar, the afternoon calendar’ s looking 12 pretty full these days .	And it’ s disheartening.13 So we’ re seeing that people are 14 struggling that they’ re falling beneath the 15 cracks .	And I hear you talking about  having 16 surcharges for long- term tenants, well , I’ m one of 17 the tenants that’ s –- I’ ve been in my apartment 18 for ten years.	When I moved into my apartment ,19 there were drugs and prostitution going on and  I20 was one of the people who was working with   the 21 police to make the property  better .	Hanging in 22 there as many tenants, many long- term tenants have 23 been anchors in the community.	And to tax us 24 extra as though we ’ re a problem, we’ re part of 25 what has made this –- these viable communities  and 2 
2 it ’ s completely unfair to go after us now.3 And also, at University 4 Settlement we have a lot of seniors coming   in.5 Even if they may be on SCRIE, which as   other 6 people have said, you can over qualify for $ 2  over 7 and you can’ t get it.	What happens when a  spouse 8 dies and now they’ re falling further and further 9 below the poverty level.10 We ’ ve heard other seniors 11 testifying about having to choose between food  and 12 medicine.	We have families coming to us all  the 13 time asking for help with food pantry  referrals 14 and the food pantries are full and turning  people 15 away.16 So this whole City is  struggling 17 right now and I’ m not sure why the  landlords 18 should be the only people reaping the profits   in 19 this City.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Will you –-21 MS . MISSICK:	If everybody ’ s22 turning over – -23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Missick,24 can you –- can you  –-25 MS . MISSICK:	–- more than 50 2 
2 percent of their income to rent, – -3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	–- please wrap 4 up , please .5 MS . MISSICK:	Okay.	If 6 everybody’ s turning over more than 50 percent  of 7 their income to rent or many working people that’ s8 the situation in New York City , then that’ s9 basically what ’ s happening and it’ s –- you really 10 need to consider how your decisions affect  the 11 people on the street and what’ s happening out  in 12 the community when you make these kinds  of 13 decisions and make increases every single  year 14 without any consideration for what else people  are 15 facing .16 Social Services sectors have been 17 cut ten times within the last three years so  we’ re 18 working to help people with  less.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You ’ ve got to 20 close.21 MS . MISSICK:	Okay.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.23 Questions?24 MR . CHEIGH :	Could you explain 25 where University Settlement is .2 
2 MS . MISSICK:	We’ re on the Lower 3 East Side.	My program is Project Home and  we 4 service people in Manhattan from 59 th Street down 5 and in Bushwick in Brooklyn and  Brooklyn 6 Chinatown.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 ( Applause. )9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Grace Torres.10 MS . TORRES :	I will be brief.11 Good afternoon everyone, tenants 12 and landlords alike.	My name is Grace  Torres.13 I’ m the head of the Tenants Association at  111 14 East 167 th Street, Bronx, New York .	I am also 15 affiliated with CASA New Settlement for safe  and 16 affordable apartments at 1512 Townsend  Avenue.17 My landlord has gotten J- 51 18 abatements .	He has more than 30  buildings .	These 19 buildings have been hit with multiple MCIs  whether 20 they were deemed fit or  not.21 DHCR does not investigate these 22 issues until the tenant screams murder  because 23 their rents have gone up anywhere from 50 to   100 24 percent.	They are supposed to collect these  MCIs 25 that are six percent when they are approved at   six 2 
2 percent, every 12 months.3 So in -- adjacent to the  yearly 4 increases from the Rent Guidelines Board, some  of 5 these tenants are being displaced, out priced  –-6 they have to get out.	So they ’ re getting out by 7 any way, means possible, which is fleeing  the 8 City, apply for low or moderate income  housing 9 which it’ s out of their price range because  their 10 incomes, if it ’ s $ 15 , 000 a year, it’ s a lot 11 because most of them are hotel workers ,  home 12 health care workers, child care providers and  they 13 don’ t make that much money .14 I myself have been there  33 15 years.	I was there when it was a drug   infested 16 neighborhood. I moved in as a young tenant with   a17 young child, a single mom.	I chose to stay  there.18 I chose to make the community my home and be   part 19 of the community.	I had a wonderful  landlord 20 previously when I first  moved in.	This was a21 hands- on landlord that came in every Saturday and 22 if you had a problem, you discussed it face   to 23 face.24 So we’ re not talking about the 25 small landlords here, I feel their plight and   for 2 
2 those good landlords, they have my total  respect.3 We ’ re talking about landlords that have multiple 4 dwellings and keep purchasing more and  more.5 The problem is that these 6 purchases are being on the MCIs and the   rent 7 increases on the backs of their old tenants  that 8 stuck it out with them despite violations,  despite 9 no heat or hot water, despite turning  your 10 apartment into construction sites illegally  by 11 obtaining permits from the Buildings  Department 12 for one thing and doing  another.13 This – - this is –- then they  have 14 high powered lawyers that go and if the State   DHCR 15 refuses the MCI because this was part of  services 16 that the – - the tenants are paying rent  for 17 anyway , and you get left without services leaving 18 the apartment unlivable but yet you want to  turn 19 around and slap the tenant in the face with   an 20 increase, it’ s just ludicrous.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Torres,22 I’ m going to – -23 MS . TORRES :	And on top of  that 24 we have to deal with – - well, let me get to   the 25 point.2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Torres, I’ d3 like you to wrap up.	Your out of –- you’ re 4 running out of time.5 MS . TORRES :	Yes.	Okay.	This 6 landlord, his name is Steven Finkelstein and  he 7 was touted as the savior of the Bronx  for 8 purchasing ten buildings that belonged to  Millbank 9 –- Millbank Corporation and he is known as the   MCI 10 king.	And he offered $ 28 million for these 11 properties which no other purchaser or  investor 12 would because they weren’ t worth it.	And all of 13 this money is being –- coming from the backs   of 14 his other tenants that are being dragged  into 15 court for nonpayment, except they are paying  their 16 rent.	It’ s not a nonpayment.	It’ s the MCI 17 increases.18 And then he’ s using the court 19 system , the Housing Court as his personal 20 collection agency.21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You got to wrap 22 up .23 MS . TORRES :	And they’ re being 24 sent into Public Assistance for one- shot deal,25 which is taxpayer money and that is a pattern   and 2 
2 practice of fraud and corruption.	And this is 3 what we’ re facing in the Bronx .4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	You ’ ve got to 5 wrap.	You ’ ve got to wrap.6 MR . TORRES :	Thank you very much 7 for your time.8 ( Applause. )9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.10 MR . CHEIGH :	Question .11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.12 MR . CHEIGH :	Could you –-13 MS . TORRES :	Any questions?14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Oh, I’ m sorry.15 Betty.16 MS . ADAMS:	Yeah.	Would you 17 explain a little more about what happens when  you 18 go to Housing Court or when they went to   Housing 19 Court.20 MS . TORRES :	Okay.	Most of the 21 time when these tenants are being faced in  Housing 22 Court, as I said, a lot of them are home   health 23 aids, they can ’ t afford to take days off because 24 they’ re barely above water .	The current rents 25 that this guys is getting for displacing  these 2 
2 tenants is $ 1 , 400 for a two bedroom and $ 1 , 100 for 3 one bedroom and this is  the Bronx.	This is not in 4 Manhattan or Soho, Boho or  whatever.5 The judges are so  overwhelmed 6 they go by the paperwork that the lawyers   are 7 putting in front of them and since the   tenants 8 that I try to educate, I wasn’ t even allowed – -  I9 went in with one tenant and I wanted to explain   to 10 the –- to the judge’ s court attorney what  the 11 situation was.	Why if the old rent was $ 639 , how 12 did it jump to $ 813 ?	And I was trying to  tell 13 them but I –- wasn ’ t allowed to speak.14 When the tenant took me  for 15 translation and as the head of the  tenant’ s16 association, she was put with the translator  and 17 the translator ’ s job was basically to spew out 18 whatever the lawyer was saying .19 So basically they’ re being 20 railroaded .	They’ re saying this is what your rent 21 is .	You either pay it or  get out.	Okay.	And 22 this is –- it’ s just disgusting.23 And referring to the black  list,24 you can’ t –- I mean, you have good landlords  that 25 you can maybe have a communication with and a   lot 2 
2 of people in these buildings are not getting  paint 3 jobs.	They’ re not getting repairs .	A lot of 4 these tenants are responsible tenants that go  out 5 and buy their own paint, their own  plaster .	They 6 do their walls .	They do their floors.	You know 7 what I ’ m saying?8 And instead of being rewarded  for 9 being responsible tenants and not give you  hell 10 over repairs or whatever.	It’ s grief.	It ’ s out 11 and out grief.	And the Housing Court is  assisting 12 them in blacklisting tenants and serving as  their 13 own personal collection agency .14 MS . ADAMS:	Thank you .15 ( Applause. )16 MS . TORRES :	And they ’ re looking 17 to –-18 MR . CHEIGH :	Could I ask quickly,19 ma ’ am.	Could I ask quickly, how long did  the 20 previous owner own the  building?21 MS . TORRES :	The previous owner 22 prior to me moving in there –- I really don’ t   know 23 how long he had it .	But he had –- he gave it  up 24 because he was getting on in age and he wanted   to 25 retire .	So then this company that took over, it’ s2 
2 a family.	So this is while they milk the  City 3 also because my building and another building  was 4 recently sold but what they do is, they have   an 5 umbrella.	You have one name, another name –-  it’ s6 like find out who’ s your landlord?7 Because what they’ re going is to 8 avoid whatever liens and fines they have from  the 9 City on these properties, they sell it to   a10 relative or a nephew or a niece and say, oh,   the 11 new owner is going to take over this building   and 12 take on these responsibilities and these liens  and 13 these fines.	But guess what, they get a  break 14 because they’ re purchasing the building so the 15 City brings down the fines and the liens in   order 16 to accommodate the new owner but it’ s not a  new 17 owner, it’ s a family member.18 ( Applause. )19 MS . TORRES :	Thank you for your 20 time.21 I pray that you make the  right 22 decision because it’ s not –- and another thing  –-23 a statement real quick .24 I understand that the  landlords 25 are saying the property taxes the water  and 2 
2 everything that’ s gone up, then you should be 3 organizing and using your legal teams to lobby  the 4 City and the State . It is their responsibility  for 5 bringing up these taxes and these water  bills.6 Not the tenants.7 ( Applause. )8 MS . TORRES :	We suffer the brunt 9 of everything that gets raised .	It’ s not the 10 tenants.11 Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 MS . HOLDER :	Thank you for your 14 testimony.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Carol, is it 16 Puttre ?	Forgive me if I mispronounce the name .17 MS . PUTTRE :	That was a tough 18 act to follow.19 ( Laughter. )20 MS . PUTTRE :	I ’ m Carol 21 Puttre - Chez.	I’ m a rent- stabilized tenant .	I ’ m a22 native New Yorker. I’ ve lived in the East  Village 23 for 25 years.	Of course, when I moved there,  it 24 was no man ’ s land and you know what it ’ s become 25 now.2 
2 My daughter, who goes to  Brooklyn 3 College lives with me.	My rent has tripled in  the 4 past 25 years.	Needless to say, my salary hasn’ t5 tripled in 25 years.	I’ m 65 and one of these days 6 I’ d really like to retire but I’ m really afraid.7 I don’ t think I’ ll be able to afford my rent in  my 8 current apartment.9 My mother lived to 99 . I don’ t10 think if I live to 99 that I’ d ever again be   able 11 to afford my rent. Although with all the  stress 12 with rent increases, growing – - the growing 13 partisanship of the government towards real  estate 14 rather than their renting constituents and  the 15 ever looming fear of eviction, I doubt if I   will 16 live anywhere to 99 years  old.17 There are 28 apartments in  my 18 building, only eight are rent stabilized at  this 19 point.	I know that my landlord is getting  triple 20 the rent that I pay for my apartment and there ’ s  a21 constant turnover of apartments.	At the end of 22 every single month there’ s furniture out on the 23 street because people are moving in and  out.24 If my landlord would turn  down 25 the heat once in awhile in the winter, he  wouldn’ t2 
2 have to incur a fuel surcharge because I have   to 3 open my windows all the  time.4 Rent increases of nine to  ten 5 percent are really scary on a fixed  income .	I ’ m6 not there yet but I’ m close to it.	Where does the 7 money come from; less food , less medications?8 Last weekend I heard a  commercial 9 on the radio from a small building owner in   the 10 Bronx, paid for, I ’ m sure, by the real estate 11 lobby, where the landlord said that the  rich 12 people in Manhattan are the only ones  benefiting 13 from rent stabilization laws.	Please don’ t speak 14 about what you don ’ t know.	I’ m not rich and 15 neither are my neighbors or my  friends .	We’ re all 16 just managing to get by.17 My apartment is my home.	The 18 only home my daughter and I have ever known. I    was 19 born here and I love this  City .	Where do I go 20 when I can no longer afford  my rent?	Florida?21 Heaven help me .22 ( Applause. )23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.24 Charles Gedinsky, will be 25 followed by Barry Soltz, who will be followed  by 2

MR . GEDLINSKY:	My name is I’ m here to talk to you about a
6 21 - unit building I own and self manage in 7 Flushing, Queens.8 The cost of running my 80 - year 9 old building over the past year has increased  by 10 over nine percent while rents on average  have 11 increased a little over two  percent.12 I am expected to maintain  a13 certain standard of housing. I am expected  to 14 maintain minimum apartment temperatures eight 15 months a year.	Unless local government reduces 16 these requirements , I need increases that are  the 17 minimum to cover the tremendous increases  in 18 heating fuel, water and sewer, real estate  taxes 19 and materials I need to purchase to maintain  this 20 old building.21 I need the low rent  supplement 22 restored that you gave us a few years ago. I    have 23 tenants paying me extremely low rents who  can 24 afford to pay more .25 Apartment 4 B pays $ 811 . 82 for a6 
2 three- bedroom apartment.	In addition to her 3 Social Security and pension, she has her  grandson 4 and his wife and their child living in  the 5 apartment.	Both her grandson and his wife  are 6 employed.7 Apartment 2 A pays $ 877 . 08 for a8 two- bedroom apartment that has a value of $ 1 , 400 .9 Apartment 4 A pays $ 363 . 89 under a10 SCRIE benefit for a three- bedroom apartment.	Any 11 increase in rent would not cause her any  financial 12 hardship for it would be absorbed by SCRIE .13 In addition, her daughter moved 14 in with her about four years ago so she   can 15 legally take over this low rent apartment  some 16 day.17 Apartment 1 B pays $ 1 , 006 for a18 four- bedroom apartment .	He sublets two rooms in 19 his apartment since two of his children moved  out.20 Both he and his wife are  employed.21 Apartment 1 A does pay me $ 1 , 400 22 for a two- bedroom but only after I lost 14  months 23 of rent waiting for an eviction.	I had to tap 24 into a line of credit to pay the legal fees   and 25 the $ 20 , 000 plus cost to renovate this trashed 2 
2	apartment in order to re- rent it.3	On may 1 st , 2001 – - 2011 , I’ m4 sorry, " The New York Post" had a two- page article 5 in bright colors showing how supermarkets had  to 6 increase costs of necessities in order to  survive 7 from 2010 to 2011 .	Without these increases the 8 grocers would not survive.	Without these food 9 markets, we would not survive.10 Without rent increases that 11 reflect the cost of running our buildings,  the 12 small and medium- sized property owners will not 13 survive and the tenants will not have a   decent 14 place to live. For now we need a six   percent 15 increase for a one - year renewal, nine percent for 16 two- year renewal in order for us, us meaning 17 property owners and tenants, to  survive.18 Thank you.19 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	Thank you, Mr.20 Gedinsky.21 Any questions?22 ( No response.)23 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	Okay.	Barry 24 Soltz.25 MR . SOLTZ:	Good afternoon.4 
2 I am a tenant and also the   legal 3 coordinator and organizer for my building’ s tenant 4 association, Janel Towers in the Bronx .5 Our building is a  former 6 Mitchell- Lama that was removed from the program 7 and entered rent stabilization .	Our building was 8 bought by Larry Gluck, a highly  successful 9 landlord whose predatory practices has led to  a10 large reduction in the numbers of Mitchell - Lama 11 housing today.12 Gluck is not one of those  small,13 poor, impoverished landlords that are  skillfully 14 portrayed by the opposition at  these hearings.	We 15 have been fighting and spending thousands  on 16 attorney fees on the unique or peculiar  issue 17 which could result in market rates for us if   the 18 case goes to the Court of Appeals and we   lose.19 In addition, we have just 20 received an MCI increase and are expecting  another 21 for roof work done recently.	MCI increases are 22 permanent and are one of the ways in   which 23 landlords can get rent increases in addition  to 24 the RGB increases.25 Well over 30 units out of 229  in 2 
2 our building have been deregulated since  buying 3 out –- using questionable arithmetic and means  all 4 regardless of the fact that we have a  J- 51 .	These 5 tenants are paying market rates.	My deregulated 6 neighbor is paying $ 1 , 500 for a one bedroom.7 Remember, this is the  Bronx.8 It ’ s estimated that over 300 , 000 9 units throughout the City have been de - stabilized 10 since vacancy destabilization was  enacted.11 Windfall profits from deregulated units need to  be 12 factored in by the board when landlords  present 13 their case .14 It is also worth noting,  that 15 according to the RGB’ s own survey, the  net 16 operating income for buildings in the Bronx  rose 17 by 29 . 9 percent during the years 2008 to 2009 .18 This proves that landlords in the Bronx have  a19 very profitable and lucrative business .20 With that in mind,  perhaps 21 someone here today can tell me why there are   very 22 few hardship cases filed with DHCR by  landlords.23 Perhaps one of the landlord advocates here  would 24 like to answer that question.25 Also worth mentioning is, that 2 
2 although RGB increases were lower than usual  last 3 year, when compared to the suburban communities  in 4 Westchester and Long Island where they got  zero 5 percent increases, last year’ s increases were 6 quite high by comparison.	This illustrates my 7 belief that the public members of this board  are 8 not fair and impartial but are clearly biased  in 9 favor of the real estate industry.	Otherwise, we 10 would have had a zero percent increase last   year 11 as other boards had voted  for.12 Any reasonable unbiased person 13 who looks at the numbers and data could  only 14 conclude that a zero or a small increase would   be 15 appropriate this year.	Anything more than a  minor 16 increase would be an egregious  miscalculation 17 resulting in significant hardships for the  tenants 18 of New York City.19 Thank you.20 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Question.21 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	Any questions?22 Mr . Schleider.23 MR . SCHLEIDER:	I ’ m confused.24 You have a tenant across the hall from you who ’ s25 renting a one- bedroom apartment and you said it 2 
2 was $ 1 , 500 a month .3 MR . SOLTZ:	Yeah, deregulated .4 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And then you 5 said, and this is the  Bronx.6 MR . SOLTZ:	Correct.7 MR . SCHLEIDER:	So –- so I’ m8 curious.	Did your neighbor not know he was in   the 9 Bronx or are you trying to say that  there’ s10 something systemically wrong with the  Bronx?11 MR . SOLTZ:	Well, if the argument 12 –- as the real estate industry argument is   always 13 that, well , you know what, Manhattan are the  only 14 tenants who are paying high rents.	Well, you know 15 what, this is affecting every borough here in   –-16 throughout the City.	And you know what, enough’ s17 enough .18 MR . SCHLEIDER:	So –- so $ 1 , 500 19 for a one- bedroom apartment in your building in 20 the Bronx is deemed an attractive or viable  option 21 as somebody went in there to – - as  you 22 characterized it, a deregulated apartment and I’ m23 still not understanding your answer.	I don’ t see 24 it as –- as answering whether your next   door 25 neighbor didn’ t see himself as in the Bronx  or 2 
2 you’ re not convinced that the Bronx is able  to 3 withstand that type of rent  level.4 MR . SOLTZ:	Well, basically,5 obviously, the tenant knows that they’ re in the 6 Bronx, I mean, they’ re not retarded.	Okay .7 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Then I don ’ t8 understand why you characterized the $ 1 , 500 9 because he ’ s in the Bronx?10 MR . SOLTZ:	Because – - because 11 the argument that we always hear from the  real 12 estate industry is that people in the  Manhattan 13 are the only ones paying high  rents.14 MR . SCHLEIDER:	And that’ s not 15 what we –-16 MR . SOLTZ:	You know, rent –-17 destabilized rents are not a problem in the   Bronx,18 in Brooklyn, areas like that.	Well, you know 19 what, they are a problem.	This tenant rent is , I20 mean, it’ s totally destabilized so in other  words,21 the landlord had to show numbers to raise  that 22 rent to meet over the $ 2 , 000 threshold .23 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Um- hum.24 MR . SOLTZ:	This tenant has no 25 protections that the rent stabilized tenants  have.2 

23	in the Bronx.45	Bronx.6
MR . SCHLEIDER:	And yet they’ re MR . SOLTZ:	Yes, they ’ re in the MR . SCHLEIDER:	Now you asked a
7 question maybe –- and you, I guess ,  queried 8 whether somebody on the board, specifically  an 9 owner advocate , could –- or an owner member  could 10 answer about the hardship applications .11 MR . SOLTZ:	Correct.12 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Unfortunately,13 you weren’ t at our June 1 st meeting when DH –-14 when HCR was testifying.	One of the questions  was 15 asked was, how many hardship applications  were 16 filed this past year and there were  three 17 applications filed in 2010 .18 The followup question was, what 19 is the average time it takes to process a   hardship 20 application?	And the answer was, there is  no 21 average time for processing a  hardship 22 application. Generally these cases were filed  and 23 there are tax certiorari proceedings pending  or 24 filed and they can take many years to   resolve.25 Since the tax is an element  of 7 
2 calculating expenses, we have to wait for  the 3 court proceedings to be completed prior to  issuing 4 an order.	So I hope that answers your  question.5 A VOICE:	( Inaudible. )6 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Everything takes 7 years.8 MR . SOLTZ:	And also –- I  should 9 mention also, our landlord is over leveraged  on 10 our building as well.11 MR . SCHLEIDER:	Okay.	It wasn’ t12 asked but all right.13 MR . SOLTZ:	All right .	Just 14 supplying that information .15 MR . CHEIGH :	Thank you .16 MS . ADAMS:	Thank you .17 ( Applause. )18 MR .

So if you do want to speak you   need 8 to go to our registration out in the  lobby .9 Mr . Donovan.10 MR . DONOVAN:	Hi.	Thank you 11 very much for this  time.12 I’ m Anthony Donovan.	I live 13 right around the corner here on 4 th Street .	Fifth 14 generation New Yorker.	My grandparents were all 15 born here.	My parents were born and raised  here.16 Okay – - do I need to – - all 17 right, I’ m sorry.18 So I am –- thank you for  this 19 time.20 I do a lot of  volunteer work.	My 21 parents raised me.	I’ m a New Yorker and my 22 parents raised me to care about community and   to 23 be thinking about service not to be thinking  about 24 how much money I can make and I’ ve lived my  life 25 this way as my mother, 83 - year old is still doing 4 
2 community work and volunteer work all her  life .3 And I spend my life also doing a lot of   volunteer 4 work in our community.5 I worry about whether I’ ll be 6 able to live in my own home  soon.7 St . Vincent’ s Hospital , as you 8 know, closed nearby. It’ s very hard for me as  a9 59 - year old to find a job.	I did find one 10 recently.	My salary has gone down by a third   and 11 when I was at St. Vincent’ s I got no  salary 12 increases because of hardship –- hardship  every 13 year.14 So I just –- I ’ m not sure why we 15 should assure property owners making a  profit 16 every year , why that should be a concern for  us 17 when it’ s very hard for us to make a living  and 18 when my salary is going  down.19 I wish you would listen,  Steven,20 because that’ s an important point for you to  hear.21 MR . SCHLEIDER:	I heard 22 everything you said.23 MR . DONOVAN:	Yeah.24 MR . SCHLEIDER:	You’ re 59 years 25 old and you just started a new job at a    lower 2 
2 salary .	I heard everything you  said.3 MR . DONOVAN:	So anyway, I  just 4 thank you for your time.	I –- I – - what’ s5 happening in my building right now is it’ s  been 6 taken over by a landlord – - I think we should   make 7 a differentiation between landlords who live  here 8 and who own property here that live in   their 9 buildings.	I’ m all for supporting them.10 I’ m not for creating an 11 antagonism between tenants and landlords but  in 12 this case in the East Village where I live ,  we 13 have lots of landlords who are just from all   over 14 the world.	They’ re investment people.	My 15 building’ s been taken over .	It’ s taken us six 16 months to find out who this person is,   where 17 they’ re from.	They’ re an outfit from London.18 They sweeped in.	We’ re an investment.19 We ’ ve lost half the people in my 20 building.	They’ ve decontrolled in the past six 21 months rents have –- I found out all about   this 22 just recently –- suddenly by a woman crying  going 23 down my hall that I’ ve known for many  years,24 saying they won’ t negotiate my rent.	I have to 25 leave.	Her rent went up $ 800 .2 
2 So it’ s been really –- it’ s been 3 a crime.	We’ ve lost several businesses on my 4 block, lost half the tenants in my building in   the 5 past six months because of this  aggressive 6 landlording.	So I really make a  distinction 7 between landlords that live here and these  outfits 8 that are just coming in and making as much as   they 9 can.10 And thank you for your  time.11 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	Thank you, Mr.12 Donovan.13 MR . CHEIGH :	Can I ask a  basic 14 question, sir.15 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	One question.16 MR . DONOVAN:	Yeah, thank you .17 MR . CHEIGH :	How long did your 18 previous landlord own your building?19 MR . DONOVAN:	The previous 20 landlord about seven years , I think.21 MR . CHEIGH :	And under his 22 tenure were most of the units rent  stabilized?23 MR . DONOVAN:	I know before he 24 came they were all rent stabilized , yes.25 MR . CHEIGH :	Um- hum.2 
2 MR . DONOVAN:	There were about –-3 there’ s about 40 units in this building.4 MR . CHEIGH :	Forty?5 MR . DONOVAN:	There are about 6	40 , yeah.7 MR . CHEIGH :	Okay .8 MR . DONOVAN:	And they were all 9 rent stabilized and we know whoever came  in 10 somehow –- I don’ t know how it worked.	I’ m not a11 pro at this.12 MR . CHEIGH :	But the new owner 13 just came –- purchased recently or you said  –-14 MR . DONOVAN:	The new owner came 15 in six months ago.	Obviously, he sold this 16 building telling this guy that like these are  the 17 leases that are coming up.	I gave him –-  from 18 what we can gather , because we –- we only have  a19 P. O. box, by the way.	We don’ t have a name.	We 20 don’ t have an address.	We have a  P. O.	–- that’ s21 our owner now, is a P. O. box.	It’ s really hard to 22 communicate with this particular landlord.23 Like I said, I ’ m not against 24 landlords, you know.	But –- so anyway , yeah,25 there are 40 units and they’ ve all become  rent 7 
2 decontrolled and people are just flying out of  the 3 building.	Half our lobby is gone now.	They’ ve 4 made a new unit there.	They’ ve taken over our 5 roof for high end tenants.	Dust’ s been flying –-6 I’ ve been living with construction now for  six 7 months .8 It ’ s – - and but we ’ ve been losing 9 lots of tenants.	I don’ t know what else to say 10 except they’ re –- yeah , they’ re now market rate 11 these units.12 MR . CHEIGH :	Were the tenants 13 getting preferential rents in the building ?14 MR . DONOVAN:	What I think 15 happened is this previous landlord came in –-   from 16 what I gathered, because they’ re all gone now.17 They’ re all –- these people –- before I knew  what 18 was happening, to ask them questions – - but  the 19 few that I got before they left in their vans   with 20 their material , is that they were told by  the 21 previous landlord that as a rent- stabilized 22 building and these people, a lot of them  don’ t23 know leases or how to look at a lease and that   he 24 was going to give them preferential rent but  it’ s25 a rent stabilized building .2 
 2 So they thought it was  rent 3 stabilized and they also heard the word we ’ re 4 getting preferential rent.	So , yes, they were not 5 educated consumers .	Most of these people they 6 didn’ t know how to look at a lease properly  and 7 when their leases –- so I guess he sold this   to 8 the present owner knowing that at least half  the 9 people in our building were coming up for this   –-10 and there’ s more coming.11 So they were given preferential 12 rent and now that preferential rent when it  came 13 for renewal in the past six months , it has gone up 14	$ 1 , 000 in some cases, from $ 1 , 600 to $ 2 , 600 .	I15 don’ t know how it got to $ 2 , 600 but I don’ t know 16 how this is happening.	And we ’ re trying to figure 17 it all out .18 We ’ re trying to figure out who 19 our landlord is.	All right.	That ’ s what’ s20 happening in the East Village right now and it ’ s21 happening in many buildings here.	We can’ t even 22 figure out who our landlord is .23 So we have these managers  that 24 zip in and out , don’ t answer questions .	They’ re 25 hassling people.	There’ s a 30 - year old tenant in 15 
2 my building.	He’ s a very old man who has  been 3 paying his rent for 30 years in  my building.	They 4 came and knocked on his door the other day   and 5 said we did not get your December rent and   like 6 he ’ s been paying rent on time all of his life 7 here, all of a sudden they can ’ t – - why didn’ t you 8 come to me in December  about this.	Why do you 9 come – - this is last week this  happened.10 So there’ s a lot of harassment on 11 us in the building .	And I can go through  many 12 other examples but I want to give other   people 13 time unless you want to  hear them.	Do you want to 14 hear – -15 MR . CHEIGH :	Thank you.	Thank 16 you very much.17 MR . DONOVAN:	Thank you so much.18 MS . HOLDER :	Thank you for your 19 testimony.20 ( Applause. )21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.22 Joyce Goodman for Assembly Member 23 Daniel O’ Donnell.24 MS . GOODMAN:	Good afternoon.25 My name is Joyce Goodman, as you said, and  I’ m2 
2 here for Assembly Member O ' Donnell , Daniel 3 certiorari who represents the 69 th Assembly 4 District, covering the neighborhoods of  Manhattan 5 Valley , Morningside Heights, the Upper West Side 6 of Manhattan and southern Harlem.7 Thank you for the opportunity  to 8 discuss rent adjustments for renewal leases  for 9 rent stabilized apartments .10 The proposed rent increases, if 11 passed , will be an economic burden to thousands  of 12 families and individual renters who reside in  my 13 district and throughout the City at  large.14 The main purpose of rent 15 regulation is to protect tenants during  an 16 emergency housing shortage from rent  increases 17 that would constitute a hardship.	The function of 18 the Rent Guidelines Board when authorizing  rent 19 increases every year is to strike a   balance 20 between maintaining affordable housing for  tenants 21 and allowing landlords to maintain services  and 22 make a reasonable profit.23 For too long, however, the  City 24 has failed to grasp who our renters are,  what 25 incomes they have.	The result is that  more 2 
2 families are finding it increasingly difficult  to 3 afford their rents .	Once forced out of their 4 apartments , there are fewer and fewer affordable 5 housing options for low and middle income  New 6 Yorkers.7 In my community office , the 8 crisis comes to life on a  regular basis.	I’ m the 9 point person for those crises so I know  about 10 them.	He may be in  Albany .	He may be in the  next 11 room, I’ m the point person for every  housing 12 crisis that comes through the  office.13 We see many forced to  choose 14 between paying the rent and paying for  other 15 necessities such as basic dental care.	We see 16 those who are chronically late with paying  their 17 rent because they have no savings and rely on   the 18 arrival of their Social Security check  before 19 paying the rent.20 We see those living on 21 unemployment insurance , needing to partition their 22 one- bedroom apartments to make space for roommates 23 in order to pay the  rent.24 We help our constituents complete 25 applications for SCRIE and DRIE, only to  realize 2 
2 that even with the subsidy , they will have to  pay 3 well over 50 percent of their income to  rent.4 We see many families with 5 children unable to find any housing anywhere  after 6 living in a City shelter for 11 or 12   months.7 We see a constant flow of  people 8 looking for rental assistance to  avoid 9 homelessness, most of whom are working full  time 10 but cannot afford their rents.11 The reality is it doesn’ t have to 12 be this way.	The rent burden does not have to  be 13 so large a portion of incomes in order   for 14 landlords to realize reasonable profits.	We know 15 what affordable housing means to people and  to 16 communities.	Affordable housing helps to build 17 more stable communities, relieves stress  within 18 families and enables people to eat  healthier,19 become better educated and save for live’ s20 inevitable emergencies .21 I am adamantly opposed to  yet 22 another rent increase which will further  burden 23 thousands of New Yorkers who are  already 24 struggling to make ends meet.25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I’ m going to 2

2 Jeanette Doal followed by Jimmy Silber and  then 3 we ’ re going to need to take a 15 - minute break for 4 our court reporter .5 MS . DOAL:	Good afternoon .6 During college I belonged to  a7 group called Constitutional Political Alliance 8 which was headquartered in Maine whose  director 9 was a U. S. Senator .	The goal of the group was  to 10 increase the blessings of liberty in the life  of 11 each student by building his knowledge and  belief 12 in the representative form of  government 13 established in the United States  Constitution.14 Now I’ ve been attending this 15 forum for the past number of years and I   do 16 believe there is a  void here.	Without question, I17 have seen and heard our elected  representatives 18 implore you to vote no on any rent increase   and 19 given substantial reasons for it, yet each  year 20 you vote a rent  increase.21 It seems to me you should  align 22 your votes with the peoples’ duly  elected 23 representatives.24 The second observation I  wanted 25 to state today is this , given one million  rent 2 
2 regulated tenants in this City , why are there  only 3 two tenant representatives on this  panel?4 ( Applause. )5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.6 Jimmy Silber.7 MR . SILBER :	Good afternoon.8 I’ m Jimmy Silber. I’ m9 representing small property owners and on  behalf 10 of the small owners in the City, we were   extremely 11 disheartened when the Rent Guidelines Board  came 12 out with their proposed guidelines and you did  not 13 mention at all about a low rent  adjustment .14 In view of the fact that this  has 15 been such a controversial subject and in March   the 16 New York State Court of Appeals, our highest  court 17 in Casado vs. Marcos, ruled that the  Rent 18 Guidelines Board did – - indeed did have the  power 19 to promulgate a low rent adjustment and the  Rent 20 Guidelines Board has done this , if you  remember,21 in 15 different years of  your existence.	So this 22 is not something new.23 But we just don’ t understand why 24 the board, this year, when tenants were so   against 25 the rent – - the low rent adjustment and dragged  it 2 
2 out in court as long as they did and finally   the 3 Court of Appeals upheld the validity why, in  this 4 year, would the board then decide not to pass   the 5 low rent adjustment.6 Because what you’ re doing is 7 you’ re giving in to exactly what the tenants  were 8 asking for .	You’ re giving in.	You’ re not passing 9 it .	And this is the year when the Court  of 10 Appeals says yes, you can. You have the   authority.11 It doesn’ t make sense not to pay a low  rent 12 adjustment this year after the message the  Court 13 of Appeals sent.14 And if you ’ re doing it because 15 you feel like you don’ t have the sufficient  data,16 that’ s erroneous.	The Court of Appeals said  the 17 analysis by the Rent Guidelines Board show  that 18 the median rent- to - income ratio for tenants living 19 in their apartments six years or more, was  lower 20 than the same ratio for all tenants and  would 21 continue to be lower even if minimum increases  in 22 the range of those at issue here were  imposed.23 The Court of Appeals told  you.24 We use data for income  and 25 expense this year that ’ s two years old .	It’ s not 2 
2 current.	You had data presented to you in  2008 3 that the Court of Appeals is reciting in   their 4 verdict. This is data that gives you the  ability 5 to continue to pass the low rent  adjustment.6 We hope if you really want to  do 7 something for small owners in this City,  our 8 problem is , again, that our owners who are  the 9 best owners in this City, because they live  in 10 their buildings, they have a building that ’ s 10 ,11 15 units, and they ’ ve kept the building in 12 immaculate condition, they don ’ t get turnover.13 The tenants don’ t move because they love it  there.14 And the problem we  have 15 economically is the rents do not justify  the 16 expenses that it costs to run a building  today .17 That’ s why we need the low rent adjustment . It ’ s18 the only way you’ re going to help small owners .19 And if you decide not to, as  you 20 did in the proposed guidelines , just, again,21 remember what the Court of Appeals said on   this 22 point, they said where the rent is  relatively 23 small and there is no vacancy for many years,   the 24 disproportion can be acute with small  annually 25 authorized increases that do not come close  to 2 
2 covering the increased costs.	Those costs have to 3 be paid somehow.4 So if percentage increases  are 5 uniform, the increases must be set at a level   that 6 allows landlords to make larger profits on  the 7 apartments that get larger increases and to  use 8 those profits to pay the costs of the lower   rent 9 apartments .10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Jimmy, would 11 you wrap it?12 MR . SILBER :	In other words,13 tenants paying higher rents would subsidize  those 14 paying lower rents .15 Thanks .16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.17 Thank you.18 We will take a 15 - minute break 19 and when we come back, the first speaker will   be 20 Joan Roth, followed by Lucille  Krasne.21 MR . SCHLEIDER:	What number is 22 that?23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Forty- eight .24 ( Brief recess taken.)25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.	We can 2 
2 continue with testimony right now.3 Joan Roth.4 ( No response.)5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is Joan Roth 6 here?7 MS . ROTH:	Okay.	So first of 8 all, I want to say good afternoon to all of you   –-9 Honorable Chairman and board members and  whatever.10 A VOICE:	We can’ t hear you.11 MS . ROTH:	Okay.	Sorry.	I just 12 want to say good afternoon to all of you – - to   the 13 Honorable Chairman and board members.14 I want to say that I’ ve yet  to 15 meet any poor landlords, but I have met   thousands 16 –- hundreds, if not thousands of tenants  without 17 portfolios , holdings and paper losses.	And, I18 think, as far as values, I still think that it ’ s19 much more important to honor the right  of 20 everybody to have a roof over their heads than   for 21 landlords to improve their buildings to have  gyms 22 and fancy conference rooms .23 So I think that affordability,  I24 think when you ’ re reviewing your portfolios, it’ s25 very, very important to take into  consideration 2 

2	affordability.3
I –- I am a senior  citizen .	As 
4 you can see, I ’ ve lived in my apartment for over 5 –- for over –- for over almost 50   years now.	When 6 I came there to our neighborhood, nobody wanted  to 7 live in our neighborhood.	And it is in  Yorkville 8 but it was in the poorer section of Yorkville   and 9 it was –- it was mostly tenements –- a few , one   or 10 two high risers just going  up.11 And so the landlord was 12 practically giving away our apartments because  he 13 was –- they were begging people to move  in .	The 14 schools weren’ t good.	The neighborhood –- the 15 block wasn ’ t good and we all worked really , really 16 hard to build up the schools in our  neighborhood,17 to build up the blocks and when we –- the block   in 18 our neighborhood.19 We worked for civil rights .	We 20 worked for the women’ s movement.	This is the City 21 that we lived in. We worked for the greatness   of 22 New York City. We were  artists .	We brought very,23 very many great things to the City and we made   it 24 so good that everyone wanted to come to  our 25 neighborhood but the problem is they didn’ t  want 4 

2	to keep us in  it.3
And what happened is, our 
4 neighborhood began to gentrify and people began  to 5 lose their apartments, I became a  personal 6 advocate for the women who were losing  their 7 apartments .	And over the years, as I have  done 8 so , and one thing I have to say, we –- even   though 9 they owed lots of money to landlords, we   always 10 paid – - we always somehow got to pay the  landlords 11 their full amount.12 It –- over the years though,  the 13 amount of homeless women has not decreased but   is 14 increasing .	And what’ s really remarkable is – - is 15 how many more middle class women are  becoming 16 homeless at a higher rate.	And, perhaps, myself 17 may be among them.18 So when I –- when my – - when I   –-19 in my neighborhood , our landlord when he’ s –- when 20 they sold the building –- the landlord , he wasn’ t21 losing money – - when the landlord even when  he 22 couldn ’ t fully rent the building, he wasn’ t losing 23 money.	And then he sold the building for  a24 profit .	Our landlord bought it with the  intention 25 of getting rid of all of us, of flipping   the 4 

2	building.3
And so what he did is,  he 
4 warehoused apartments and he seemed to be able   to 5 have a profit warehousing the apartments.  He 6 didn’ t mind doing that for years and years . And he 7 made no repairs and he never pointed our  building.8 So when he finally –-  when 9 finally he wanted to co- op the building or  to 10 change the building circumstances, then he –-  then 11 he was able to get a windfall profit of   anywhere 12 from $ 30 to $ 60 million.13 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I’ m going to 14 have to ask you to start wrapping  up.15 MS . ROTH:	Okay, I am .16 He was able to then transfer  that 17 into an MCI which we, the rent stabilized  tenants,18 are left to pay.	So I don ’ t think you can have 19 uniform –- I think you have to take more   into 20 consideration -- who the people are, what we’ ve 21 contributed to the City and that it should  be 22 affordable for all kinds of people .23 My children do not live in  the 24 City.	They can’ t afford to live in the City.	A25 great many young people who could contribute a   lot 4 
2 to the City, like we did, because I feel it’ s   fair 3 to say that some of you wouldn ’ t even be sitting 4 there if it wasn’ t for the life that I  led .5 And I think that I deserve to   be 6 treated with respect as a senior citizen and  not 7 like this YouTube that I just got where a   landlord 8 is taking the women out in a wheelchair in   the 9 park and it looks so nice and so lovely and   then 10 all of a sudden he starts going faster and he   gets 11 to a cliff and throws her over because we  can’ t12 just afford the senior citizens  anymore.13 And it ’ s the same thing, I think,14 that you’ re doing with tenants , all tenants.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.16 ( Applause. )17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Questions?18 ( No response.)19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.20 Lucille Krasne , to be followed by 21 Dorothy Williamson , who will be followed by 22 Roberta Cooper .23 MS . KRASNE :	Good afternoon 24 everybody.25 You’ ll be happy to know I have 2 
2 very brief notes and I ’ m here not because I’ m part 3 of a – - I love the noble work that the people   are 4 doing to save the people who are struggling  so 5 desperately to stay in a home, but I want to   speak 6 about –- my comments will be about  vacancy 7 decontrol and what ’ s going on.8 I want to say that the thing  that 9 stunned me and it brought me here to this   meeting 10 was to learn that there is a loss of 300 , 000 11 affordable apartments in New York City in  ten 12 years due to vacancy decontrol .13 I want to talk about  the 14 destruction of the communities I’ ve witnessed in 15 my 40 years in the  East Village.	I came here from 16 the west.	I chose to live in one of the   most 17 extraordinary cities in –- in  the world.	A city 18 that, I think, is just so admirable for it ’ s19 exquisite qualities of humanity and of the  arts 20 and culture and business.	I was also a  business 21 person .22 The loss of neighbors I’ m23 feeling, the loss of families who can no   longer 24 raise children in the City , the loss of  the 25 multitude of small businesses which have  been 2 
2 shown to be so important in employment issues,  let 3 alone being one of the factors making the City   so 4 liveable.5 The tragic loss of spaces for  the 6 arts, spaces for visual arts, spaces for music ,7 dance, poetry, theater , the cultural life of  this 8 once great City, and I really mean once  great 9 City, world leader in the arts , now a sad  shadow.10 You might not think it ’ s a sad shadow but it is  a11 sad shadow when all I see are people leaving   this 12 town because they cannot live here and do   their 13 work and produce and continue this  extraordinary 14 richness of the City.15 Now I think it is a shadow of   its 16 old self, its old glory and that is because of   the 17 uncontrolled greed of the real estate industry ,18 absolutely uncontrolled.	And, I have to say  I19 think it’ s extremely sad, that the couple of  times 20 I’ ve been to these meetings to see the use of  the 21 small homeowner as a shield to do the dirty   work,22 as we witness this over and over and over   again,23 for the large, large real estate  entities.24 I feel for the small  homeowner 25 and people have addressed where that should  be 2 

2	taken care of.3
I want to say just one  other 
4 thing.	I did not really move here from the   west,5 originally from Oklahoma, I didn’ t move here  to 6 find that my neighborhood, in four blocks  from 7 10 th to 14 th Street would have 20 out of 24 8 storefronts, restaurants, bars and clubs.	That is 9 really astonishing .	Who wants to live in a  world 10 like that?	Because no other business can  afford 11 the rents, ditto the prevalency of nail salons  and 12 such places because it affords –- it has   the 13 possibility of the owner having very, very  cheap 14 labor.15 Well, this is what I just  thought 16 about to say to  you now.	My last comment, vacancy 17 decontrol must finally be  repealed .	I will be one 18 of the victims of  vacancy decontrol.	I will leave 19 this City that I have  loved.20 Let history show that you  members 21 of this year’ s Rent Guidelines Board 22 made the decisions on the side of a viable   City 23 and its citizens and let justice finally be  done.24 I would think that would  be glorious.	I will lead 25 the parade in your  behalf.4 
2 ( Applause. )3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.4 Dorothy Williamson .5 MS . WILLIAMSON :	Good afternoon.6 My name is Dorothy Williamson  and 7 I am an SRO tenant . I have lived at the  Imperial 8 Court since March 2009 as a tourist and in   April 9 of ‘ 09 as a tenant .10 Through the help of the SRO  Law 11 Project, I learned of my rights and that’ s when  I12 had presented them with a letter.	And after I13 presented them with the letter on April 2 nd,  which 14 I go through every April the 2 nd since I’ ve been 15 there.	It ’ s a nightmare.	That’ s when the abuse 16 starts .17 Some of the abuse I will bring  up 18 to lead into what he’ s doing now.	It will consist 19 of locking me out of the room after I was out    of 20 the building, took all my clothes, shoes,  winter 21 clothes, et cetera , which was balled up in a  ball 22 along with food from the refrigerator and  stuffed 23 into two large trash bags and stored behind  the 24 counter in the lobby.25 I say –- I have a home  now .2 
2 While it could be better, it is my home. I have   a3 small kitchen area .	I share a bathroom with  two 4 other permanent tenants, that’ s what I was  told.5 And a large host  of tourists.	There are tourists 6 that comes through that lobby, comes to  the 7 bathroom that I share with two tenants ,  but 8 there’ s four bathrooms in that area.9 The landlord makes a lot  of 10 money.	That’ s fine.	But he’ s trying to get more 11 out of me.	While I have secured a  permanent 12 tenancy in the Imperial Court, it’ s not  without 13 challenge.	He has found a new way to harass   me.14 His new way started two days  before Christmas.	He 15 wanted me to come into his office and he wanted   to 16 offer me another place to live because he   needed 17 my room –- he wanted to put his new office in   my 18 room.19 But my room is three  times 20 smaller than his office. So why would you want   my 21 room?	It’ s too small.	But he wanted the view .22 He said for 30 years he has been in the office   and 23 he didn’ t have a view but he wanted  my room.	But 24 I know he hasn ’ t been in there 30 years.	He’ s25 been in there a couple of years because he  wasn’ t2 
2 even showing up at  the building.	I have done my 3 homework.	I know he’ s lying.4 And then he –- they told  me,5 well, accept it.	I want you to accept my  offer 6 and I will give you $ 2 , 000 to move . $ 2 , 000 ?	I can 7 breathe and $ 2 , 000 will disappear. $ 2 , 000 and then 8 he ’ ll have the nerve to tell me, well, why don ’ t9 you take the offer so you can be   somebody.10 Well, wait a minute, I said,  you 11 mean I ’ m not anybody because I rent this room?12 That’ s when he backed off.	I figure let me  tell 13 you something.	I was born somebody.	I am 14 somebody and I ’ m gonna die somebody.15 ( Applause. )16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Williamson,17 I’ m going to ask you to wrap.18 MS .

MR . BONONNO:	Good afternoon. My name is Robert Bononno.	I
15 have lived in the East Village for the past   30 16 years and in my present apartment for over  20 .17 During that time my neighborhood has evolved  from 18 a low rise , low density community of poor  and 19 working class immigrants, artists, musicians,20 writers and performers , one of the most  diverse 21 neighborhoods in the City, into a theme  park 22 filled with high rise luxury  condominiums,23 boutique hotels and trendy bars and  restaurants 24 catering to a predominantly non- local clientele.25 One of the reasons for the area’ s15 
2 former accessibility and vitality was the  ability 3 to live economically.	There were few luxuries to 4 be had here 30  years ago.	Apartments were small 5 and most had seen no renovations in decades but   no 6 one complained .	The neighborhood was a  community 7 and those with the inclination and the  ability 8 took it upon themselves to upgrade their  living 9 quarters.10 Landlords were happy to have 11 tenants foot the bill for renovations.	In many 12 cases they were happy simply to have  paying 13 tenants in their apartments.	But since then, the 14 lower East Side and East Village have  been 15 marketed relentless.	For at least the past  ten 16 years it has been advertised as the go to   place 17 for the hip and well- heeled young from around  the 18 world.19 And while there is little  point 20 in belaboring the loss of a past that will   never 21 return , it is important, vitally then to  recognize 22 that there ’ s been nothing organic or natural about 23 the process of growth and development in  the 24 neighborhood.	The facts are there for  anyone 25 willing to investigate the  change.2 
2 Needless to say, in a City  as 3 densely populated as New York with current  vacancy 4 rates below one percent, rents in the  neighborhood 5 are now among the highest in the City and if   the 6 neighborhood retains any of the vitality  and 7 diversity of its recent past, the only reason  is 8 the presence of a stable community of long - term 9 residents.10 Like myself, there are people  who 11 have invested a great deal of time and effort   in 12 making this community a place they can call   home.13 Many are here because they can ’ t afford to live 14 anywhere else but I suspect, that like  myself,15 many wouldn’ t want to live anywhere else.	For 16 them this is not simply a place on a map,   a17 vacation destination, a place to go bar hopping  or 18 carousing, it is home, community, neighborhood ,19 things that can’ t be assigned a price and don’ t20 translate well into marketing brochures or  real 21 estate listings.22 The building in which I  live,23 after many years of continuous ownership, was  sold 24 about 11 years ago .	Since then through a  process 25 of attrition, long - standing rent- stabilized 2 
2 tenants have moved out .	The apartments are 3 systematically gut renovated and leased at  near 4 market rents.	Because rents are high and  the 5 apartments are small, we have had  considerable 6 turnover in a building that had once  known 7 stability.	New tenants remain for a year, two  at 8 most.	There is a high level of subleasing .9 In my case , since I have lived 10 here for more than six years, I was affected   by 11 the recent Casado ruling, which represented  the 12 highest one- year increase I have ever experienced 13 at a time when the economy was beginning   to 14 falter .15 I am self employed and  following 16 the 2008 recession , my income declined 17 dramatically.	So with the lump sum increase  that 18 resulted from the Casado ruling and subsequent  RGB 19 approved increases , I am paying a much  larger 20 proportion of net income in rent, well over  40 21 percent at present .22 Tenants in the City are living  a23 state of extreme duress.	Vacancy rates are at 24 historic lows and there is intense competition  for 25 rental apartments.2 
2 At this time, the board  should 3 consider a zero percent increase for  regulated 4 tenants.	This should have been the case for  the 5 past three years as well but instead we have   seen 6 increases of over four to six percent,  far 7 exceeding the rate of inflation.	As clear an 8 attempt as ever there was to reduce the stock   of 9 regulated apartments as quickly as possible  by 10 driving rents up to the current low,  decontrolled 11 limit.12 The RGB should also vote  against 13 a fuel surcharge.	There is no reason at all  why 14 tenants should be forced to pay for a   commodity 15 over which they have no  control.16 Thank you for listening.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.18 ( Applause. )19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Johnny Barnes,20 will be followed by Carol Southwick, who will  be 21 followed by Emily Pinkowitz.22 MR . BARNES :	How are you ladies 23 and gentlemen?	My name is Johnny Barnes and I   was 24 going to read this but it’ s really , you know, I’ m25 just going to do something much shorter, short  and 2 
2 bittersweet, I might say.3 Because I found out in this  last 4 year since I’ ve been down here this first time ,5 I’ m not only a SRO but I’ m protected under SCRIE 6 and yet a few months to my 69 th year, I’ m  well 7 into my seniorhood and on a fixed income so   they 8 just can’ t touch me no ways.	So I ’ m still going 9 to speak though because I want to talk about   the 10 greedy landlords.11 In any event, mine has been  kind 12 of good lately because of SRO and so   forth .	But I13 just want to say – - I said short and sweet , as  far 14 as the increase, for the tenants piece  there 15 should be no increase.	You understand .	Let them 16 go yachtless for awhile or be satisfied with  the 17 yacht they got because the increase should be   for 18 the needy and not the  greedy.19 Thank you.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.21 ( Applause. )22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Carol 23 Southwick.24 A VOICE:	What number ?25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Sixty- one.2 
2 MS . SOUTHWICK:	Good afternoon,3 ladies and gentlemen – -4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Speak into the 5 mike, please.6 MS . SOUTHWICK:	Good afternoon,7 ladies and gentlemen.8 I’ ve been living in a rent 9 stabilized building. When I moved in, it was   rent 10 controlled , in August of 1978 .	We are now on  the 11 third landlord .	None of them do anything  that 12 they’ re supposed to do .13 Okay, Ms. Gross –- Mr. Gross  was 14 ordered to point the building and the water  was 15 coming in the building when I  moved there.	I know 16 I don’ t have much time but where am I gonna  go ?17 Where am I gonna go?	Okay .18 So anyway, he –- what he did  was 19 put bricks double up on top on the corner   because 20 I’ m like a four- story walk up, 24 family.	I’ m on 21 the third floor.	I knew that was illegal  because 22 I saw –- I always watch the news and I ’ m  a23 compulsive reader so I know what’ s going on  around 24 me .	I don ’ t care about my neighbors’ business .25 Okay.	They were ordered to take it  down.2 
2 About nine to eleven months 3 later, a big bulldozer truck came with those,   you 4 know, those bang things that you knock down  the 5 building with.	I get scared to death.	I’ m6 sleeping in the living room.	How would you feel 7 if you see this big thing coming out towards   you 8 because it was a legal  thing.9 The pointing was done. It wasn ’ t10 done correctly .	The stuff came out in  three 11 months .	There was no protective guarding  outside 12 the building, which I know is  not right.	We never 13 get receipts for rents we pay.	She comes over and 14 collects money . She makes saps out of the  supers.15 This is about the ninth or eleventh super and   then 16 she don’ t pay them .	And then somehow we  always 17 get with the shorter end of the freaken  stick.18 I got water stains –- I’ ve been 19 paying increases and increases . The rent 20 controlled tenants paid increases and  increases.21 I have a water stain that was  coming in.	Their 22 answer to water stains and fixing is paint  over.23 Paint over .	Paint over.	The apartment in the 24 basement had an illegal ceiling which I  researched 25 on with, you know, the tenant information I   have 2 
2 and a drop ceiling .	That apartment alone was 3 turned over five to six  times.4 He likes to harass people.	The 5 Pakistanis –- because I don’ t know , sometimes I6 don’ t think they have much brains.	I don’ t like 7 to say anything against nationality but to me   they 8 don’ t have what’ s known as , like I have, a clear 9 head, a logical thinking  way.10 Anybody coming knocking to  the 11 door.	They open up the door.	This is 2011 .12 Don’ t you know not to open your door?	They get 13 scared to anybody.	You know what I  mean.14 And I was harassed a lot  of 15 times.	So I don’ t see anything good coming 16 whatsoever .	And the same thing with all – -  the 17 fourth floor.	When I first moved in there in ‘ 78 ,18 a rent controlled tenants told me  a lot.	The 19 boiler wasn’ t big enough to begin with .20 The building opened up in 1924 .21 The Certificate of Occupancy didn’ t come until 22 1927 , okay .	And the same thing –- and  the 23 corporation, they do not have to pay taxes  when 24 you’ re a corporation.	So don’ t say, oh, the 25 landlords pay taxes.	They don ’ t pay taxes .2 
2 And, plus the fact that my building opened  up 3 before 1932 and it was a rent exempt   building 4 okay.5 Okay, so the same thing  keeps 6 happening over and over again.	They don’ t really 7 fix anything.	Up on the fourth floor when I   first 8 moved in, they had a – - how do you see   electrical 9 impulses from the roof to the tenants and   stuff.10 A hard hat was coming down from the building  – -11 fourth floor.	I love cellphones, I find I ’ m12 always going on.	He said, we tell the  landlord 13 what to do but they don’ t do it.	And they don ’ t14 do the right repairs.	I swear they’ re not doing 15 the right repairs on the  roof.16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I’ m going to 17 ask you to start to wrap up, Ms.  Southwick .18 MS . SOUTHWICK:	Okay.	My wrap up 19 is we shouldn’ t get any increases because there’ s20 no systems of checks and balances with the   City 21 and with them.	And what’ s going to happen 22 eventually is we’ re all going to have to get  out 23 because the building’ s going down.24 And it ’ s shame .	I try to  picture 25 it when it opened up in  1924 .	They said there was 2 
2 yawning ( sic) out for rent control tenants for  the 3 building. You know , it ’ s hard to picture because I4 see what condition it is in now,  you know.	And 5 nothing’ s getting done period.	People are just 6 paying more and more money , every ten years 7 there’ s something new real with the real  estate 8 taxes and our landlord sells it to somebody  else.9 The whole thing is a racket with a capital   R.10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Let ’ s wrap up.11 MS . SOUTHWICK:	That’ s what I got 12 to say .	Okay.13 Thank you.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.15 Emily Pinkowitz.16 MS . PINKOWITZ:	Okay.	Good 17 afternoon.	My name is Emily and I ’ m a third 18 generation New York.19 I grew up in a rent  stabilized 20 building in Manhattan. And I currently live in   a21 rent stabilized building in Brooklyn.22 And I’ m here today as a23 representative of myself but also of my family   and 24 my parents .	My mother lives in the same – -  has 25 lived in the same apartment on 125 th Street  for 2 
2 over 20 years and for the past ten years she’ s   had 3 to rent out a room in her apartment to a series   of 4 boarders in order for her to  stay.5 My father still lives in the  same 6 apartment I grew up in on 105 th Street and  despite 7 being solidly middle income and having lived in  a8 rent stabilized apartment for 35 years , he 9 currently spends 50 percent of his income on   rent.10 Next year he will turn 65 and I was just   talking 11 to him the other day and he worries about   how 12 he ’ ll be able to afford to stay in his home on  a13 fixed income in the coming  years.14 I have close friends who  are 15 landlords and I, by no means, want them to   suffer 16 unnecessarily.	But in a year in which  older 17 people like my parents have received no raises  or,18 more often , accepted pay cuts or loss of  benefits,19 I know that the landlords in New York   have 20 received an average increase in their  net 21 operating income of 5 . 8 percent.22 And in Brooklyn, where I  live,23 these disparities are even more dramatic  with 24 increases in the landlords ’ net operating income 25 –- of more than 22 percent , which is  completely 2 
2 out of step with the struggling economy of  the 3 City.4 So with such disparities I5 believe it ’ s unconscionable to raise rents in rent 6 stabilized apartments significantly.7 ( Applause. )8 MS . PINKOWITZ:	And we all know 9 that these rent increases come with  larger 10 ramifications.	All right. In my building  in 11 Brooklyn, I currently receive a preferential  rent,12 which means that I pay $ 450 lower than the  legal 13 rent for the rent stabilized apartment I live  in.14 And that’ s because this preferential rent is  more 15 reflective of what middle income New Yorkers,  like 16 myself , are able to pay.17 Yet, each year the landlord of  my 18 building is able to continue to raise the  legal 19 rent by the percentage set by the RGB, moving   it 20 ever closer to the $ 2 , 000 a month mark that will 21 enable them to destabilize the unit once I   leave.22 Having grown up in  Morningside 23 Heights, I ’ m well aware of what destabilization 24 can lead to ultimately . Increases in rent  upwards 25 of $ 1 , 000 to $ 2 , 000 and a permanent loss of 2 
2 affordable housing available to middle  income 3 families.4 Deregulation also leads to a  loss 5 of tenants ’ rights as residents live in fear  of 6 unpredictably massive yearly increases that  cause 7 them to prevent themselves from acting on  their 8 own behalf .9 Again, I recognize that  the 10 individual landlords that are here today,  are 11 struggling . And I feel for them.	But as a  body,12 it ’ s my understanding that you have a13 responsibility to act on behalf of the City as   a14 whole.	And as a whole , this year residents of  the 15 City have struggled to break even while  the 16 majority of landlords have made  significant 17 profits.18 I urge you to consider a   zero 19 percent rent increase for all tenants.	If there’ s20 an increase at all , when you decide what  that 21 increase is, please keep in mind the  considerable 22 hardship that this increase to dedicated long  term 23 New Yorkers like myself and my  family.24 Thank you.25 ( Applause. )2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.3 Josephine Maroonick, to be 4 followed by Allie Kenny.5 MS . MAROONICK:	Hi.	My name is 6 Josephine Maroonick and I’ ve lived at 176  East 7 Third Street for the past 37 years in a   rent 8 stabilized apartment.9 Living in the neighborhood all  my 10 life, as did my mother and I’ m the  third 11 generation in the neighborhood .12 I also am an activist and  a13 member of the Cooper Square Committee. I   retired 14 from working in a bank for 23 years. At   present 15 I’ m a senior on a retired and  disabled .	After my 16 medical expenses and medication, there isn ’ t much 17 left after my rent is paid .18 The only thing that allows me  to 19 live there is due to that it is rent regulation   –-20 rent stabilized.21 There is about 51 units in  the 22 building and since this landlord had bought  the 23 building about four years ago, they had tried  to 24 remove a lot of the tenants by either not   renewing 25 their leases or paid them to leave .2 
2 They also had tried to trick  me 3 out of my apartment, which they had told me   that 4 there was another apartment on the ground  floor 5 available.	That was a deregulated  apartment.6 What they would have done was deregulate  my 7 apartment and I –- I’ m sorry.8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	That’ s okay .9 Take your time .10 MS . MAROONICK:	Where I would 11 have had no protection .	So I had remained in  my 12 own apartment.13 For buildings like mine where 14 there are constantly a turnover, he  profits 15 enormously from the high rents from people  paying 16 approximately $ 1 , 000 , $ 1 , 500 , they ’ re paying now 17 $ 6 , 500 a month .	He’ s changed from two bedrooms 18 into four bedrooms which was against the  law.19 Even though getting these high 20 increases –- high rents, he does not maintain  the 21 building.	I’ ve had problems with my floors which 22 I’ ve let them know .	They told me the landlord ’ s23 not responsible for the wood floors that  are 24 uneven and have many nails sticking up .25 During the winter, I have to  wear 2 
2 gloves in my apartment during the winter  season.3 It is terribly cold.	I called both the  landlord 4 to let them know and  311 .	Nothing gets done.5 I know my building is  heated 6 irregularly and please , if you raise rents , people 7 like me and my neighbors would not be able to   keep 8 their apartments in New York.9 Please , however, keep it to the 10 lowest minimum , if you can .	We’ d appreciate that 11 so I, as a senior, can maintain my apartment   as 12 well as others .	We’ re all not rich.	We wish we 13 were.14 The rent increases proposed are 15 higher than what the rent stabilized tenants  can 16 afford .	Please do not pass another poor  tax.17 Tenants like myself who pay less than $ 1 , 500 18 cannot afford them .	We barely exist, a lot of  us.19 Thank you for your  time.20 ( Applause. )21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.22 Allie Kenny, who will be  followed 23 by Tara Buentello.24 MS . KENNY:	I spent quite a  bit 25 of time reading these reports to try to   better 2 
2 understand the proposed increases.	But I still 3 don’ t understand how costs and income are 4 allocated in buildings like mine with  both 5 stabilized and non - stabilized tenants.6 In my building , a 200 - unit 7 pre- war doorman building in midtown, the services 8 provided to non- stabilized tenants , who now appear 9 to be the majority , are often very different  and 10 in my opinion more costly, than those provided  to 11 stabilized tenants .12 I refer, in particular , to 13 utilities, contractor services , fuel and 14 administrative and miscellaneous expenses.	On my 15 floor there are 12 apartments.	Of these 12 , I16 know that at least 10 have  been destabilized.	I’ m17 not sure about the 11 th and the 12 th is my 18 apartment and is stabilized.	All but two of  the 19 ten destabilized units turn over regularly , often 20 several times a year and in the case of   vacation 21 rentals, sometimes several times a  month.22 Every time one of  these 23 destabilized units turns over it gets cleaning ,24 painting, et cetera.	Plus the destabilized units,25 of course, get things that no stabilized unit   ever 2 
2 gets, dishwashers, microwaves, granite and  marble 3 finishes, new stainless appliances , major 4 renovations, et cetera .5 The destabilized short - term 6 rentals, that is the tourist and business  traveler 7 rentals, also get furnishings, linens,  maid 8 service, owner provided air conditioners and  big 9 TVs, as well as included cable and  utilities.10 I, like other stabilized tenants,11 buy my own AC’ s and TVs and pay all my own   cable 12 and electric.13 The owner is also providing  far 14 more heat than ever before to the whole  building.15 So much so that I can now happily report that   I16 can leave my windows open all  year round.	When 17 the heat suddenly went on during a cool day   in 18 May, a doorman reminded me that tourists  paying 19 $ 300 or $ 400 a night don’ t want to be chilly.20 Further, there are often three ,21 four or five tourists in apartments  formerly 22 occupied by one or  two people.	One can only 23 imagine how much water they use and how much   power 24 they consume when they run those owner - provided 25 AC ’ s 24 / 7 .	How are all these services  and 2 
2 utilities on destabilized units accounted for  and 3 metered?	I don’ t know and I couldn’ t tell from 4 the reports.5 I’ m already paying $ 2 , 200 a month 6 for a one- bedroom with a Pullman kitchen and  half 7 size appliances.	I’ m not interested in paying any 8 more increases until I have clear evidence  showing 9 how costs are allocated in all rent  stabilized 10 buildings, not just the ones that chose  to 11 complete a voluntary survey.	And until I’ m12 convinced that I am not subsidizing  extraordinary 13 expenses an owner incurs trying to attract  big 14 spending short - term tenants and good reviews on 15 TripAdvisor. Com.16 Thank you.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.18 ( Applause. )19 MS . BUENTELLO:	Good afternoon.20 My name is Tara  Buentello.21 I am an organizer and  advocate 22 with single- room occupancy tenants on Manhattan’ s23 west side from 14 th Street to the top  of 24 Manhattan.	I’ d like to just briefly touch on  a25 few of the points that have been made  throughout 2 
2 the day about SROs and SRO  buildings.3 Earlier, Lars Westvind , a4 landlord, spoke to you regarding his SRO  building.5 While he does indeed own two buildings ,  actually 6 only one of those building is  an SRO.	And Mr.7 Westvind made a number of points about how   it 8 seems to be more difficult or more cumbersome  to 9 run SRO buildings.	The main point he made was  a10 Certificate of No Harassment process.11 He incorrectly stated that  CONHs 12 are required for any improvements  to SROs.	This 13 is absolutely not true .	A CONH is required  for 14 what is called an Alt One  Work Permit.	Alt One is 15 a major restructuring of a building, typically  it 16 changes the purpose of  a building.	Usually when 17 we see an CONH application come through  for 18 single - room occupancy buildings, it is because the 19 owner no longer wants this building to be an   SRO 20 building.	You have to be demolishing,  combining 21 rooms, converting in order to require a   CONH.22 So I - – Mr . Westvind has, indeed,23 not applied for any CONHs that we see in   the 24 records.	He made some pretty sweeping  statements 25 about how expensive it is to go through a   CONH 2 
2 process.	This process actually, of course , any 3 application a landlord makes to the City is   going 4 to require some filing fees.	So this isn’ t5 something that ’ s special to SRO owners versus 6 other owners.7 And as far as the cost of  going 8 through the process of a CONH, let ’ s say a  number 9 of tenants should respond, they are informed  that 10 a CONH has been applied for, that it might   change 11 the terms of their tenancy , they’ re only – - they 12 would only respond if they have actually  been 13 harassed.14 Typically, especially in the  part 15 of Manhattan where Mr. Westvind owns buildings ,  in 16 Harlem , when we see an CONH application, I17 personally , along with my colleagues, other 18 organizers at the Law Project, go to  those 19 buildings, we –- to reach out to tenants   and 20 inform them that they do have the right to   respond 21 to this application.22 Typically, we find these 23 buildings empty.	At the end of the  waiting 24 period , the landlord gets a CONH automatically  so 25 there is no cost beyond filing and waiting for   a2 
2 landlord who applies for a CONH in most of   the 3 buildings in Harlem.4 If the tenants do respond, it’ s  a5 typical hearing process.	The landlord can choose 6 to get a lawyer, if  they like.	They don’ t have 7 to .8 So let ’ s see here, also, I , you 9 know, like I said, Mr. Westvind has not   applied 10 for any CONHs and has actually been  making 11 improvements to his building.	I commend him for 12 doing that .	In 2008 he installed solar  roof 13 panels , which is not cheap improvement and  that 14 was done in a year where, yes, increases   were 15 allowed but had not been applied  yet.16 The last increases had been  in 17 ‘ 06 and ‘ 03 .	So he’ d only gotten two increases in 18 the previous five years and yet he could afford  to 19 put solar panels on his  building.20 We overwhelmingly do not  see 21 landlords actually open their books and show  us 22 how much this costs.	He said average rent in  his 23 buildings were $ 700 to $ 800 .	Landlords make more 24 off of SROs versus if they ’ re running an apartment 25 because the expensive elements of a unit are   the 2 
2 ones that require plumbing , appliances .	These are 3 the things exactly that are shared in  SROs .	So 4 a $ 700 or $ 800 rent in an SRO represents  more 5 money to the landlord than you will see in   an 6 apartment.7 And I’ d like to reiterate that 8 our office and the people who work with us , we  are 9 advocating for zero percent across the  board 10 increase for SROs.	Provisos are very difficult to 11 enforce because it is impossible for us to   know 12 what percent of units in those buildings  are 13 actually regulated tenants and , overwhelmingly ,14 the people I work with , their buildings are  being 15 used for tourism and for City placements which  are 16 very high rents.17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	May I ask you 18 to wrap.19 MS . BUENTELLO:	That’ s it .20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Okay.21 Brian.22 MR . CHEIGH :	May I ask about - -23 you said that when you actually –- in some   cases 24 when you actually show up to buildings  where 25 there’ s been an application for a Certificate  of 2 
 2 No Harassment, that it ’ s empty ?3 MS . BUENTELLO:	The last three 4 months that I’ ve gone, I have only been to  one 5 building that has –- still had tenants  remaining.6 MR . CHEIGH :	But how many 7 buildings have you been to in the last   three 8 months ?9 MS . BUENTELLO:	Each month we 10 typically get about –- so we’ ll get a notice  of 11 any of the applications for that previous month  –-12 I would say the lowest number in one month   that 13 I’ ve gone out to is eight and the highest, maybe 14	15 .15 MR . CHEIGH :	And they’ re – -16 usually these are the eight unit, ten- unit rooming 17 houses ?18 MS . BUENTELLO:	These are 19 typically smaller buildings, absolutely.20 MR . CHEIGH :	So is this a  sign 21 that the building has been warehoused and  the 22 final tenants have moved out?23 MS . BUENTELLO:	Yeah, typically 24 I’ ll try to talk to neighbors, people next  door.25 A lot of times they say the building’ s been  empty 15 
2 for a long time or that the last few tenants   have 3 died recently and the owner was warehousing  those 4 rooms.5 I, also –- sometimes, actually ,6 the last few months it ’ s happened every time.	An 7 owner has answered the door and told me   that 8 they’ ve been using it for themselves and they’ re 9 just applying for the CONH so they can   make 10 official that it’ s a single- family home.	And I11 get called things like sick and twisted for  doing 12 outreach work to see only if their tenants  have 13 been harassed.	I’ m not doing anything to any 14 tenants who say they’ re not being harassed .15 MR . CHEIGH :	Thank you.16 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	Thank you.17 ( Applause. )18 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	Our next 19 speaker is Kate Conroy .	She’ ll be followed by 20 Michele VanSaun and followed by Fran  Baskin.21 So Ms. Conroy.22 MS . CONROY :	Hi.	I’ m Kate 23 Conroy .	I have a rent stabilized lease in   a24 building renovated in 1961 to include an  elevator.25 My neighbors had to move out  last 2 
2 month.	Their $ 2 , 600 apartment broke them. They 3 moved to Brooklyn.	The were college grads ,4 friends sharing a so- called two bedroom.5 Four years and three tenants  ago,6 their apartment was a comfortable one- bedroom 7 apartment stabilized at about $ 1 , 100 a month.	The 8 renovations the new landlord made cut the  living 9 room in half to create a room that barely fits   a10 twin bed and a  small dresser.	The room does not 11 have a closet and the air conditioner  sleeve 12 through the wall was crudely boarded  over.13 The leftover living room is now  a14 corridor barely accommodating a love seat and  TV.15 They cook in the 5 by 7   kitchen,16 which has not been renovated past the 1970 ' s,17 minimum.	And I wonder how this type of  renovation 18 was allowed to take place and destabilize  the 19 apartment.20 When I moved to the East  Village 21 in 1990 , I had a better chance of surviving  this 22 neighborhood than the hard working young  adults 23 today.	The neighborhood was sketchier then and  my 24 one- bedroom apartment was still twice what I  could 25 afford on my secretarial salary.	I took in 2 
2 roommates from time to time to help defray  my 3 expenses while I paid off school loans .4 The new landlord’ s attorneys 5 accused me of illegally subletting to Marty,  my 6 spouse , and threatened us with eviction.	They 7 backed off when she walked into their offices  and 8 offered to explain the rights of lesbian  domestic 9 partnership in New York  City.10 We ’ ve lost a lot of lesbians from 11 the East Village, artists, writers , social 12 workers, techies, who caved to negligent  and 13 aggressive landlords before they and we  were 14 mature enough to know our housing  rights.15 Landlords prey upon young 16 adults .	They squeeze off of – - they squeeze  them 17 and their living off of their school loans  or 18 entry- level salaries into cramped conditions 19 resembling the early tenements .20 I am lucky I can still carve  out 21 a living that affords me to volunteer at   Dickson 22 Place and keep growing –- keep culture  growing 23 locally.	I can give to the inclusive and  artistic 24 middle collegiate church, St. Marks annual  poetry 25 slam, the Howell Festival and Art Around the  Park.2 
2 Do my landlords give anything  to 3 these cultural institutions in my neighborhood ?4 Do they help the aging residents cross the  street 5 or pick up their canes ?	Do they go to  restaurants 6 and help keep them thriving?	No.	No, my landlord 7 is not my neighbor .8 Yet, through destabilization 9 laws, their corporations have siphoned  resources 10 from the neighborhood by keeping tenants  rent 11 poor, nice hardworking kids like my ex - neighbors 12 can’ t afford to live here let alone eat at  our 13 affordable restaurants or drink at the  expensive 14 bars.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	May I ask you 16 to wrap up , please , Ms . Conroy .17 MS . CONROY :	Will do.18 Please strengthen the rent 19 protection for tenants so we don’ t lose  more 20 hardworking adults we would –- who could  settle 21 down and contribute to this culturally  rich 22 neighborhood.	I advocate for zero increases  on 23 stabilized rent leases to send a message to   greedy 24 landlords who are spending any increases  to 25 further subdivide apartments, harass and  evict 2 
2 hardworking neighbors.3 Thank you.4 ( Applause. )5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.6 Michele Van Saun.7 MS . VAN SAUN:	Hi .	Thank you 8 for inviting us.9 My name is Michele Van Saun  and 10 I’ m 69 .	And I live in my apartment with  my 11 daughter Freya and her seven- year old son Max.12 Years ago I owned a fabric  shop 13 on 9 th Street and later I had a sewing factory   in 14 the garment center employing many  people.15 But now I’ m elderly and disabled 16 and live on a  fix income.	My daughter ’ s on the 17 faculty of a design school in Manhattan but on   an 18 adjunct salary , it ’ s low.	But between us, we 19 manage to get by.	Our rent takes a little  more 20 than a third of our income , but with the poor  tax 21 and the increase, this year will be  hard.22 We ’ re both involved with Max’ s23 grade school, volunteering and making  handcrafts 24 to sell at the fairs and auctions  every year.	We 25 lived in this apartment for about 40 years and   my 2 
2 daughter grew up here and returned here as a   young 3 mother .4 We have witnessed the changes  in 5 our community.	Bars have replaced bakeries.6 Tourists and young affluent partiers replace  kids 7 playing stickball.8 My building has eight apartments 9 which were all rent controlled rent stabilized .10 And then the building was bought maybe 20   years 11 ago by a  large firm.	Six of the apartments now 12 are market rate.	This means over $ 3 , 000 a month.13 And this is in the East Village on St.  Mark’ s14 Place in a tenement building with  railroad 15 apartments , very small . There are two commercial 16 units downstairs.17 I highly recommend that the  board 18 pass the proviso that rent stabilized and  rent 19 controlled tenants should receive zero increase  in 20 buildings occupied by less than 80 percent  rent 21 controlled , rent stabilized tenants.22 ( Applause. )23 MS . VAN SAUN:	Our new tenants 24 are very young .	They move , often after one year 25 or sooner and have lots of parties with   drunken 2 
2 friends running up and down the stairs  until 3 morning.	But this frequent turnover generates 4 constant rent increases.5 We have gas heating.	We’ ve 6 complained many times about the  over heating.	I7 was a super and I can tell when a system is    being 8 run improperly so I’ m constantly complaining to 9 them, you’ re giving too much heat or your  boiler 10 system is being run on manual, not automatic,   and 11 you’ re breaking the boiler down.	There are 12 frequent breakdowns, which means we’ re without 13 heat for weeks .14 This spring our heat was off  from 15 mid March and was never repaired. We should  not 16 have to pay a fuel surcharge when out   landlord 17 allows the system to waste this expensive fuel  and 18 allows the system to be managed so poorly that   we 19 now -- we haven’ t a functioning boiler  system.20 I reported violations when I  felt 21 they were serious and dangerous.	When I found the 22 old support columns in the basement were  destroyed 23 and the building’ s center was collapsing, I24 reported it.	Because of my complaint,  hydraulic 25 supports were installed and tie rods were  placed 2 
2 through every floor.3 As a result, I received  many 4 eviction notices and threats.	The office always 5 tells me, Mr. Friedman  hates you.	My last 6 eviction notice this winter was served on me  the 7 day before I was going for  cancer surgery.	When I8 called the office, the agent told me, it’ s  nothing 9 personal, we just don’ t want elderly rent 10 stabilized tenants in our buildings, so we ’ re 11 throwing you out.	Well, they failed.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Van Saun,13 I’ m going to ask you to start to wrap  up.14 MS . VAN SAUN:	What?15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I’ m going to 16 ask you to wrap up , your time.17 MS . VAN SAUN:	Yes . I do 18 sympathize with long term owners of  small 19 properties but I have no sympathy for  the 20 predatory landlords that purchase cheap  buildings 21 filled with rent controlled rent  stabilized 22 tenants with the intention of destabilizing  the 23 apartments by eviction , harassment or simply 24 waiting for them to die.25 Do they believe in an after  life?2 
2 ( Applause. )3 MS . VAN SAUN:	Thanks .4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.5 Fran Baskin, who will be  followed 6 by Council Member Gale  Brewer.7 MS . BASKIN :	Good afternoon.8 Can you hear me?9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Get a little 10 closer to the mike .	It will be easier .11 MS . BASKIN :	Is that good ?12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yeah , that’ s13 fine.14 MS . BASKIN :	Okay .	My name is 15 Fran Baskin.	I am a writer, an English  teacher 16 who has lived in my studio apartment on  10 th 17 Street since 1978 .18 As a rent stabilized tenant,  I19 have signed a new two- year lease with the  rent 20 increase allowed by law for  33 years.	I have 21 never made much money but because there are  rent 22 regulations, I ’ ve always managed to keep up with 23 each increase.24 Now I am unemployed.	I was laid 25 off of my last job last year and have been   on 2 
2 unemployment ever since.	I would like to  keep 3 working and have always assumed that I would  work 4 until I was 70 .	But the nature of the changes  in 5 larger economy , lead me to believe that I  may 6 never get another job.7 I first faced job  discrimination 8 based on age when I was  40 .	I will turn 62  this 9 July and applied for Social Security, not  because 10 I want or even can afford to retire, but because   I11 have no choice .	There are no job prospects that  I12 can see and at least the reduced rate of   Social 13 Security I will be eligible for at 62 , will  cover 14 my rent.15 But what will I do if it doesn ’ t?16 Without rent regulations, my rent will  increase 17 far beyond my ability  to pay.	Unless I am 18 eligible for SCRIE , my rent, even with rent 19 regulation , will eventually increase beyond my 20 ability to pay if I do not get cost of   living 21 increases from Social Security .	There have been 22 no cost of living increases from Social  Security 23 for the past several years .24 Rent regulations exist for a25 reason .	New York is a vital economic  engine,2 
2 highly desired as a place to live because of   its 3 diverse population .	Before rent increases and 4 fuel surcharges are imposed, the Rent  Guidelines 5 Board should consider research that shows  building 6 owners from all over the City are making a   profit 7 while most tenants are lucky to be getting   by.8 There should be no rent  increases 9 or fuel surcharges in this time of great  economic 10 peril.11 Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 ( Applause. )14 A VOICE:	How old are you ?15 MS . BASKIN :	Oh, I ’ m 72 .16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	She was 72 .17 Council Member Gail Brewer .18 COUNCIL MEMBER BREWER:	Thank 19 you very much.20 My name is Gail Brewer and  I21 represent the Sixth District from 54 th Street to 22 96 th Street on the west side.	And , actually,23 there are over 45 , 000 rent regulated apartments,24 more than any other council district in the  City.25 And I’ m here today , like many 2 
2 others in the audience , to request that the  Rent 3 Guidelines Board freeze increases of all kinds  for 4 all regulated rental units , be it class A,  SRO 5 buildings, rooming houses or just  regular 6 apartments .7 I don’ t need to tell you that 8 there are over a million rent  stabilized 9 apartments , close to 40 , 000 rent controlled.	And 10 I don’ t need to tell you that the  destabilization 11 rates are high , I would say particularly  in 12 Manhattan.13	As we –- about 16 , 000 , 17 , 000 14 units left rent stabilization in  2010 .	And it was 15 interesting, I asked HPD how many new  rent 16 stabilization units came on line and they said ,17 under 10 , 000 .	But the Rent Guidelines Board  says 18 12 , 347 on their website.	So even with that 19 there’ s a discrepancy.20 And I’ m here to summarize what I21 have to say.	Most specifically, I want to  urge 22 you to do something that I ’ ve been talking about 23 for at least four years, which is the same kind   of 24 proviso that you are thankfully in the past,  have 25 given to the rooming houses and the SROs and   the 14 
2 residential hotels when there are units used  for 3 more lucrative aspects in that building, I ’ m4 asking you to do the same with any   rental 5 building.6 In my district on the west  side,7 I don’ t know that there is any rent  regulated 8 apartment building left.	Almost every building 9 has market rate rentals, co- ops and, in some 10 cases, condos and rentals.	And the reason for 11 this moratorium is that across the board  increases 12 and estimates of the – - give the increased  –-13 estimates of increased costs by landlords, it  –-14 they – - those increased costs that landlords,  you 15 can argue half the day , although I would  argue 16 they are not as drastic as they do , they don’ t17 take into account at the RGB the  significant 18 additional revenue that owners receive from  these 19 conversions and market rate units.	And these 20 revenues, as well as the costs , must be taken  into 21 account when deciding to impose any rent  increase.22 And, of course , I would argue one is not  necessary 23 at all .24 I also want to remind the  board,25 which you already know , is that there is  an 2 
2 amazing –- there is an almost ten  percent 3 unemployment in the City of  New York.	You ’ ve 4 heard over and over again that individuals are   not 5 getting cost of living if they are , in  fact,6 working.7 I know all this because for  the 8 last eight years I have sponsored monthly  housing 9 clinics in my district and , obviously, people  come 10 into the office every single day with all kinds   of 11 issues regarding their rent.	So I ’ m here to say 12 it doesn’ t matter which type of increase, we  need 13 a freeze.14 And I do have a question for  you 15 which is that one of the – - this is a   difficult 16 time for tenants.	They’ re dealing with Albany 17 challenges , with SCRIE challenges, with rent 18 control challenges , even those who are not on  rent 19 stabilization, are nervous because of the  fuel 20 pass along .	Just in general, in terms of  rent 21 regulation , what is the status of any kind of  a22 fuel charge, how would that impact or not  impact 23 SCRIE?	That’ s a question I have for you.24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25 Good question.	We will check 2 

2	that out.34	you very much.56	the rents at all.78910	Council Member .1112

WALDMAN:	Hello, everybody.24 This is my third year  testifying.25 I’ m a retired CUNY professor living in  Stuyvesant 13 

2	Town.3
I was 21 in 1968 when I came   to 
4 Stuyvesant Town from the Bronx as  a newlywed.	I5 had just gotten my first and only job that I   had 6 for 40 years as a professor of Spanish ,  Women 7 Studies and Latin American Studies at York  College 8 of the City University of New York in   Queens.9 I also taught at the  Graduate 10 Center , Latino and Latin American Theater.11 So , I guess, I have lived there 12 for my entire adult life.	Seen neighbors come and 13 go , shared joys, losses, divorce, death of 14 parents, the death of my husband, retirement – -  a15 life.	I’ ve always considered myself very lucky to 16 have had an affordable apartment in New York  City.17 Today, however , I’ m not speaking 18 as a former Bronxite and very  fortunate 19 Manhattanite, but rather on behalf of a   statewide 20 organization, the New York State Tenants  and 21 Neighbors Coalition that wants residents in  other 22 boroughs also to have affordable  housing.23 I can tell you , personally , that 24 dear friends of mine in their 70 s had to move  from 25 Manhattan after many years on East 30 th -- as  a4 
2 teacher, you got to be  quiet.3 Thank you.4 Come in quietly.	Thank you very 5 much.	And listen.6 ( Laughter. )7 DR . WALDMAN:	Okay.	Thank you,8 thank you.9 Can’ t get a teacher, you know,10 the teacher out of the teacher .11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Wait , I’ ll try 12 it from here.13 Ladies and gentlemen, as you’ re 14 coming in, there are speakers, please try and   come 15 in and take seats  quietly.16 Thank you.17 DR . WALDMAN:	I’ m so glad that 18 –- we were just –- we just came from this   rally 19 starting at 14 th Street and First Avenue with  Dan 20 Garodnik and all the marvelous people and so   we 21 just got here.22 ( Applause. )23 DR . WALDMAN:	Okay.24 So now it’ s more like the people,25 now you’ re seeing the people like you see us  every 2 
2 year.	But now you really see us in  person .3 Okay.	La gente, el pueblo .4 Verdad ? Aqui estamos.	Professore de Espanol.5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Your time is 6 running.7 DR . WALDMAN:	I just –- I ’ m8 going to finish.9 So these people had to leave  New 10 York and move to Queens because they could  no 11 longer afford their –- after 30 years of living   in 12 the City.	So a life of activism leads me  to 13 believe that we are not impotent and that you   are 14 listening.15 I request that you do the  right 16 thing for the working class and for the  middle 17 class, for all of us who call New York City   our 18 home, and vote for a zero percent rent   increase.19 ( Applause. )20 DR . WALDMAN:	And –- and, I21 promise this wonderful , very elegant woman with 22 the hat, that I would mention the  MCIs .	She said 23 nobody ’ s talking about MCIs.	What does it mean –-24 the capital improvement.	So the MCIs are going  to 25 kill us and that’ s what she wanted me to tell  you 2 
2 all.	So I want to have that also in the   record.3 So thank you very much for  –-4 thank you very much for listening and let’ s  just 5 take care of business.	Right?	Okay.6 ( Applause. )7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 Thomas Behrens .9 Mr . Behrens will be followed by 10 Council Member Garodnik.11 MR . BEHRENS:	Hi.	Thank you.12 Well, I am going to  be quick.	I13 live in a rent stabilized apartment here in   the 14 East Village.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Can you speak a16 little closer to the mike,  please.17 MR . BEHRENS:	Okay, sure.	One,18 two –- how ’ s that?19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.20 MR . BEHRENS:	I live in a  rent 21 stabilized apartment here on 12 th Street in the 22 East Village.	I moved here in  1985 .	My rent was 23 $ 460 or $ 480 or thereabouts.	It is now $ 1 , 235 , an 24 increase of 257 percent over the years .25 I looked up on line  –-2 
2 A VOICE:	Louder.3 MR . BEHRENS:	I – - my mouth is 4 right next to the  microphone now.	How ’ s that?5 Jesus Christ.6 Sorry.7 I moved into the East Village  in 8 1985 .	My rent was about $ 480 .	It ’ s now $ 1 , 235 ,9 an increase of 257 percent .10 I looked online on a  consumer 11 price dollar evaluator and if you take a   1985 12 dollar , it ’ s now worth $ 2 . 08 .	Rents, therefore,13 have increased , at least on my behalf, well  over 14 the cost of inflation.15 I –- rents are just  insane .	It’ s16 –- where’ s –- there’ s no one sticking up for the 17 middle class anymore in this country.	And without 18 a middle class in this City, we’ re going to  become 19 a barren desert of tourists, like  Paris.20 ( Applause. )21 MR . BEHRENS:	I moved here in 22 1985 when at night , as soon as it was dark ,  you 23 looked over your shoulder, you got a sore   neck 24 from looking up –- to looking behind you to see   if 25 anyone was going to be mugging you .2 
2 I paid the rent on time  every 3 month my entire life here in this  City .	I –- it’ s4 because of people like me and a lot of   other 5 people that we have allowed you, the  building 6 owners , to have massive increases in the value  of 7 your property.	A little respect coming back 8 towards us would be  nice.9 My building was a dump for  years.10 It ’ s been slowly improved over the years but when 11 it went co - op, the building was in really bad 12 shape and my bathroom ceiling used to fall   in 13 about every three to six months.	Why would I buy 14 into a building like that?	Too bad I didn ’ t.	But 15 whatever the case, rents are too damn high  and 16 it ’ s – -17 ( Applause. )18 MR BEHRENS :	– - and the $ 2 , 000 19 limit has to be increased.	That – - within a few 20 years of large increases there ’ s going to be an 21 avalanche of apartments becoming deregulated  will,22 you know, will weigh too far on the  owners ’23 behalf .24 That’ s all I have to say.25 Thank you.2 
2 ( Applause. )3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.4 Council Member Garodnik.5 ( Applause. )6 COUNCIL MEMBER GARODNIK:	Good 7 afternoon, Chairman Kimmel and members of the  Rent 8 Guidelines Board.9 I’ m delighted to be here today .10 As you may have gleaned from a few moments  ago ,11 the influx of people joined Council Member  Rosie 12 Mendez and myself walking from 14 th Street and 13 First Avenue here and we were joined by   Council 14 Member Margaret Chin who walked up from  lower 15 Manhattan, so thus the great influx of people  that 16 you now have in the  audience.17 I represent a district that  goes 18 from Stuyvesant Town up to the Upper East  Side .	I19 speak to you at a time when New York City is   only 20 slowly emerging from the recession that  has 21 impacted working families across every 22 neighborhood and point on the economic  spectrum.23 Indeed , your own 2011 Income and 24 Affordability Study presents as good news  that 25 “ most economic indicators are only marginally 2 

2	negative.” 3
Unemployment rose to 
4 nine- and- a - half percent in 2010 .	Cash assistance 5 levels increased for only the third time  since 6 1994 .	The number of Food Stamp recipients  climbed 7 again.	Following the largest local drop in  wages 8 on record, your report indicates that  inflation 9 adjusted wages grew three- and- a- half percent in 10 the last 12 months , an amount that would  be 11 swallowed or worse by your proposed rent  increases 12 of three to 5 . 7 percent for a one- year lease.13 The economic recovery has been 14 kinder on building owners. In 2008 to 2009 ,  the 15 most recent year for which data is  available,16 while the average New Yorkers wages were  falling,17 the average net operating income for  landlords 18 rose by 5 . 8 percent, the second straight year of 19 such growth.20 Yet despite the growth in  income,21 for landlords the RGB has approved increases  of 22 three percent and two- and- a- quarter percent in 23 2009 and 2010 respectively , levels nearly twice as 24 high as the measure, the net revenue  commensurate 25 adjustment with vacancy increase measure,  a4 
2 disparity that is out of scale with  previous 3 years.4 In light of this trend of  sizable 5 increases in ample net revenues for  building 6 owners , it is without question that any  rent 7 increases this year should be minimal.	The RGB 8 must not worsen this already skewed  economic 9 imbalance.10 On top of the already  steep 11 proposed allowable increases, the RGB has  this 12 year proposed an additional surcharge of  one 13 percent on buildings heated with  fuel oil.	In 14 short, this practice will reward  environmentally 15 damaging behavior, again, at a time when  building 16 owners are already earning steady and  healthy 17 returns.18 Buildings that burn dirty heating 19 oil, i . e. No. 4 and No . 6 are responsible for 86 20 percent of heating oil soot emission in New  York 21 City despite representing only one percent of  all 22 buildings.23 These emissions are directly 24 linked to asthma and respiratory illnesses ,25 increased rates of cancer and premature  death.2 
2 And a new study from the Manhattan  Borough 3 President shows that 63 percent of the  boilers 4 burning these fuels are predominantly in  buildings 5 with rent stabilized tenants.6 To allow landlords to  reap 7 additional income to cover the cost of  burning 8 dirty fuel , even as the City has passed rules  to 9 phase out the use of these fuels, is   contradictory 10 as a policy matter and would be deleterious to   the 11 environment.12 This is not the forum to  discuss 13 the proper economic incentives for conversion  to 14 cleaner methods for heating, but let it be  said 15 that there are such incentives .16 Finally, and then I will  close 17 because I know that my time is running out ,  I’ d18 like to address two provisos to exempt  rent 19 stabilized apartments from any  increase.20 As you very well know, the  Court 21 of Appeals decision in Casado v. Marcos held  that 22 the Rent Guidelines Board may apply  distinct 23 increases to different classes of  apartments.24 With that precedent in mind,  I25 believe this board should first exempt  from 2 
2 increases any apartment that has been subject  to 3 one or more vacancy bonuses in the previous  four 4 years.	Vacancy increases and the  prospective 5 vacancy destabilization already generate 6 significant revenue for building owners and  they 7 have served, certainly in my community , an 8 incentive for landlords to take unseemly  actions 9 to remove rent protected tenants from  their 10 apartments , including frivolous legal pursuits and 11 harassment .	No further increase on these units  is 12 necessary.13 Secondly, the well being of 14 tenants depends, in part, on landlords  providing 15 safe and well maintained housing.	Accordingly ,16 building owners must be given the resources  to 17 meet that obligation.	However , in buildings with 18 immediately hazardous conditions, as documented  by 19 the Department of Housing Preservation  and 20 Development, the owner is not holding up his   or 21 her responsibility and thus his or her should   not 22 be awarded a rent increase in that  circumstance.23 The extent that increases are 24 necessary at all, and this is my last   paragraph 25 here, they should be consistent with  the 2 
2 objectives of affordability, habitability and  fair 3 returns for owners as well as with over   arching 4 City policy.5 Thus, for the reasons  mentioned 6 above, I urge you to seek the lowest of   possible 7 increases, to reject the fuel surcharge and  exempt 8 from increases those frequently vacant  apartments 9 and those buildings with immediately  hazardous 10 conditions .11 Thank you very much to the  board.12 I appreciate your hearing me  out 13 today.14 Thank you very much.15 ( Applause. )16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Council Member 17 Rosie Mendez.18 COUNCIL MEMBER MENDEZ:	Good 19 evening.	I think it’ s evening .20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Council Member 21 Mendez will be followed by Council Member  Margaret 22 Chin.23 COUNCIL MEMBER MENDEZ:	Thank 24 you.25 Today we have a united east  side 2 
2 in Council Member Garodnik , Council Member Chin 3 and I who came together with our tenants, many   who 4 are at risk of losing their apartments  because 5 they can no longer afford their  rents.6 I am Councilwoman Rosie  Mendez 7 and I am pleased to be here in front of the   RGB.8 And I represent the Lower East Side, the   East 9 Village, Gramercy Park , Kipps Bay and Murray Hill 10 in Manhattan.11 Within the communities of  my 12 district there are tens of thousands of  rent 13 stabilized housing units which are at risk  of 14 being lost .	At this time when the recession  has 15 hit hardworking New Yorkers, it is  critically 16 important that the Rent Guidelines Board  takes 17 steps to ensure that these units are preserved  for 18 our City’ s low and middle income families.19 I was elected to serve  an 20 economically diverse district and I impress  upon 21 you the importance of decisive action on your  part 22 to ensure that it remains  so.23 I believe that the  Rent 24 Guidelines Board has a responsibility to  protect 25 tenants that have been much more severely  affected 2 
2 by the current recession than the owners of   their 3 buildings.	Statistics clearly indicate that the 4 past three years have taken a far larger toll   on 5 the pocketbooks of regulated tenants than on  their 6 landlords.7 The recession has caused 8 unemployment rates to rise each year since  2008 9 and to be approximately double the pre - 2006 rates.10 Wage rates are not  growing .	Job growth has been 11 bleak and current indicators show that we are   not 12 coming out of the recession and the  economic 13 forecast may be getting even  bleaker.14 While the economic condition of 15 average New Yorkers has gotten worse,  building 16 owners have done just fine .17 Thankfully , really , New York’ s18 rental housing stock has not declined in value  at 19 anything like the manner that has afflicted  many 20 other cities.	Owners have consistently seen the 21 operating income from their properties  increase.22 Citywide the median net operating income of  rental 23 buildings have increased more than 16 percent  from 24 2008 to 2009 and it seems like the increase   is 25 continuing .2 
2 At the same time, the cost to  run 3 a vacant building –- to run a building , there  are 4 too many – there were many vacant  buildings 5 before , sorry –- in our City overall have  actually 6 gone down slightly .7 I have more things in  my 8 testimony.	I ask you to  read it.	I’ m just going 9 to get to the important points because there   are 10 many tenants here who want to testify and I   want 11 to give them the opportunity to do  so.12 I ask the board to keep the  rent 13 increases low, below two percent for one- year 14 lease and four percent for a two- year lease, to  do 15 away with the minimum rent increase, to not  impose 16 a fuel surcharge, to allow no increases  on 17 buildings that have hazardous violations or  on 18 buildings where more than ten percent of the  units 19 have been destabilized .20 I urge the board to  strengthen 21 rent regulations not destroy them.22 Thank you.23 ( Applause. )24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.25 Council Member Margaret Chin.2 

23	afternoon.45	speak before you.6
COUNCIL MEMBER CHIN:	Good Thank you for the opportunity  to Right before we came here, we  had 
7 a rally outside.	I march with residents,  tenants 8 from Chinatown and from Lower Manhattan all  the 9 way up here and we walk all the way here,   fighting 10 for tenants’ rights.11 The City of New York faces  a12 difficult economic time.	Renters have faced the 13 worst of this economic crisis.	While unemployment 14 figures goes up, rents are always also  increasing.15 The real estate market has improved while  other 16 sector of the New York City are barely making   a17 comeback.18 In the midst of the  worst 19 economic situation since The Depression,  landlords 20 in my district are doing better  than most.	I21 represent Lower Manhattan, not just Chinatown,  and 22 the rent in some of the area are sky   high,23 especially in the area of Tribeca and Battery   Park 24 City.	But even in Chinatown, we are  seeing 25 apartments renting for more than $ 2 , 000 and up .7 
2 Tenants have seen their incomes 3 fall approximately 12 percent in the last  two 4 years while landlords have continued to  increase 5 their net operating income .	The average rent for 6 stabilized apartment in Manhattan is just  over 7 $ 1 , 000 per unit.	The average cost to  maintain 8 these units is about $ 679 .9 It must also be remembered  that 10 the number of units taken out of  stabilization 11 because of luxury and vacancy decontrol  continue 12 to rise.	These units that are costing more  than 13 $ 2 , 000 and up, represent a significant source of 14 income from landlords.	While some costs such as 15 heating oil have risen , these costs can be  offset 16 through subsidy programs, often by  utility 17 provider and government agency .18 It is not easy for  small 19 landlord.	We know that maintaining a building  is 20 hard work.	However, make no mistake, very  rarely 21 do landlords lose money.	No matter what, the 22 landlord – -23 ( Applause. )24 COUNCIL MEMBER CHIN:	–- the 25 landlord – - no matter what , landlord knows that 2 
2 they will be receiving higher rents and  more 3 income regardless of the economy and their  expense 4 because every year the Rent Guidelines Board,  you 5 have approved a rent  increase.6 So rent increase should be 7 narrowly tailored to provide only the  income 8 necessary for owners to maintain services  and 9 should not burn tenants –- and should burn   tenants 10 as slightly as possible.11 I stand with my  elected 12 colleagues , my constituency, community group,13 community boards and housing advocates .	We 14 understand that increases may be necessary  given 15 the rise in costs, but I really urge you   to 16 consider the lowest amount possible in the one  and 17 two year and be fair to the tenant and make   sure 18 that it is a fair rent  increase.19 Thank you very much.20 ( Applause. )21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,22 Council Member .23 ( Applause. )24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Manhattan 25 Borough President, Scott Stringer.2 
2 ( Applause. )3 BORO. PRES . STRINGER:	Good 4 afternoon, Chairman Kimmel and members of the  Rent 5 Guidelines Board.6 My name is Scott  Stringer,7 Manhattan Borough President and I am – -8 ( Applause. )9 MR . STRINGER:	Thank you for 10 giving me an opportunity to testify  tonight.11 I just want to say a couple  of 12 things .	First of all, this economy is very  tough 13 in New York City.	Tenants continue to struggle 14 through the worst economic downturn since  the 15 Great Depression.16 The Rent Guidelines Board should 17 finally acquiesce to common sense and  economic 18 reality and institute a freeze on regulated  rents 19 this year.	The conditions on the ground  are 20 pointing to the need to protect tenants in a   way 21 we never have had to  before.22 New York has become an 23 increasingly unaffordable place for the low  and 24 middle income tenants that ensure the richness  and 25 vitality of this great City.	One need look no 2 
2 further than dozens of recent news stories  on 3 overcrowded living conditions in local  buildings 4 to deeply understand that New York City  has 5 serious safety and quality of life products  that 6 are deeply rooted in the unaffordable nature  of 7 our affordable housing .8 As the Rent Guidelines Board  2011 9 Housing Supply Report notes, 11 . 6 percent of rent 10 stabilized housing in New York City is  classified 11 as overcrowded .	And additional 4 . 8 percent of 12 rent stabilized housing is classified as  severely 13 overcrowded.	So let’ s be clear.	Unaffordable 14 rents in New York City are breeding  perilous 15 housing conditions that put tenants in harms  way,16 that deteriorate the physical conditions of  our 17 building stock , which has caused unnecessary death 18 and destruction.19 I also want to talk to you  about 20 -- specifically address the issue of fuel  costs.21 Back in 2008 , building owners made much of  the 22 vitality – - the volatility of the fuel  prices 23 stoking fear that escalating fuel costs  would 24 create untenable profit margins in their  building.25 Although these concerns had not 2 
2 materialized as many had suggested they would,  the 3 Rent Guidelines Board was successfully  persuaded 4 to enact substantial rent increases.	As fuel 5 prices stabilized, tenants were left in the  lurch.6 Now as oil prices reach their lowest point in   four 7 months , I fear that history could repeat  itself 8 again.9 I’ m going to submit to you a10 report concerning boilers burning 4 and 6 home   oil 11 oils in rent regulated buildings.	For the record,12 I am submitting a report released three weeks   ago 13 by my office which found that 5 , 614 of the 8 , 912 14 boilers burning the dirty oil in New York  City 15 comes from buildings which have rent  regulated 16 apartments .17 We should be doing something  to 18 get those boilers out of  these buildings.	But 19 your formula for doing that is going to create   a20 cycle where thousands of people will be put  in 21 jeopardy.	You see , you could have a  profound 22 impact on the state of our housing stock if   you 23 think differently, if you think bigger  and 24 broader, if you identify problems like  dirty 25 boilers but also recognize that you have to  find 2 
2 economic incentives for landlords but not at  the 3 expense of the tenants .4 I’ m going to offer you a menu  of 5 options and buckets of money to deal with  that 6 issue.	But the cost must not be put upon  the 7 tenants because you will force more people  in 8 eviction.9 ( Applause. )10 BORO. PRES . STRINGER:	So –- so 11 we want to give you alternatives to think  about.12 I ask you to read  this report.	It ’ s called 13 " Tenants and Toxins."	It’ s a way for you to  do 14 some amazing things but you can have it both   ways.15 You can actually help remove these  boilers .	You 16 don’ t have to pass the increases on to  the 17 tenants.	There’ s money available in various 18 areas.	We should work collectively to do this .19 And, finally, I just want to  say 20 –- finally , I just want to say to all of you   that 21 in tough times tenants get  rent increases.	In 22 very tough times tenants get  rent increases.	In 23 good times , tenants get rent increases .	When do 24 we ever have a different outcome  here?25 ( Applause. )2 
2 BORO. PRES . STRINGER:	That’ s3 what we want here.	Just want a different  outcome.4 That’ s what we want to do.5 Thank you very much.6 ( Applause. )7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 ( Applause. )9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Council Member 10 Robert Jackson .11 COUNCIL MEMBER JACKSON :	Good 12 afternoon, Mr. Chair and members of the  board.13 Let me thank you for  the 14 opportunity to be in front  of you.	I represent 15 the Seventh Councilmatic District in  Manhattan 16 which encompasses part of West Harlem,  Washington 17 Heights and Inwood which has more than 41 , 000 rent 18 stabilized apartments.	The fourth largest number 19 of rent stabilized apartments in the City of   New 20 York.21 And stable housing is  the 22 foundation from which individuals and  families 23 develop communities, pursue education and  work 24 opportunities and contribute to the City’ s25 economic and cultural vibrancy .2 
2 New York University’ s Furman 3 Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy  recently 4 reported that despite the recession,  medium 5 monthly rent continues to rise in Manhattan,  6	reaching, $ 1 , 243 in 2009 .7 And Manhattan residents, 75 8 percent of whom rent, paid the highest rents  in 9 New York City.	The northern Manhattan 10 neighborhoods of West Harlem, Washington  Heights 11 and Inwood are home to about 350 , 000 people.	The 12 vast majority are renters.13 And last February, the  Department 14 of Housing and Preservation and  Development 15 released its tri- annual report .	Housing New York 16 City which indicated that New Yorkers now  pay 17 substantially more of their household income  for 18 rent, 40 percent of renters’ households pay  50 19 percent or more of their income  for rent.	How can 20 you expect working class New Yorkers to live  a21 decent life and prepare their children for  the 22 future under these financial conditions?23 According to the last  Census,24 immigrants and their families account for  almost 25 two- thirds of the City ’ s population.	Immigrant 7 
2 New Yorkers, on an average , pay a  higher 3 percentage of their income and rent and are  more 4 likely to live in overcrowded housing and  occupy 5 housing in significant disrepair.6 Our lowest paid workers are  often 7 living in unacceptable conditions and paying  even 8 more for the privilege .	For most immigrants,9 housing instability is , unfortunately, a shared 10 experience .	Keeping rent stable will help  working 11 immigrant families to stay in their apartments  and 12 allow the development of entrepreneurial  spirit 13 that drives the City economy in  most 14 neighborhoods.15 What the Rent Guidelines Board 16 does directly affects the quality of life  for 17 millions of working people in this City we   call 18 home.	There are countless people from whom a  $ 50 19 or $ 100 difference in their monthly expenses 20 changes everything .21 At this time of  rising 22 unemployment rates and wage reductions  when 23 homeless shelters are at maximum capacity and  City 24 and State governments must drastically  cut 25 services to close billion dollar budget gaps,  it 2 
2 is clear that this year we need you, the board ,  to 3 take unprecedented action and not issue a   rent 4 increase.5 Thank you very much.6 ( Applause. )7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you,8 Council Member .9 Edward Maloney , 78 .10 MR . MALONEY:	My name is Edward 11 Maloney.	I’ m co- chair of a tenant association of 12 215 East 80 th Street and I ’ m a stabilized tenant.13 Our large building is a  converted 14 condo.	I’ m here to say these seem to be  hard 15 times for almost everyone except bankers  and 16 landlords.	I lost my store after 15 years  because 17 another landlord wanted more rent than  came 18 through the door and my roommate lost their  job 19 after 16 years to recession  cutbacks.20 I am here to say that  our 21 landlord, an owner of many large buildings in   his 22 management company , does not need a hefty  annual 23 increase from this board.24 I’ m in a condo converted building 25 so my landlord is opting out of affordable   housing 2 
2 and selling apartments .	It’ s a proven fact that 3 rent regulation is the most successful , and these 4 days, almost the only form of housing  preservation 5 for the middle class and working class .6 ( Applause. )7 MR . MALONEY:	This year alone 8 after my landlord repaired some violations  and 9 spruced up the building for condo sales, he   has 10 received an 18 percent MCI , a major  capital 11 improvement increase from DHCR .	That gives him a12 permanent 18 percent rent increase .	And by the 13 way, the condo owners only pay their share  once.14 We have a permanent 18 percent base rent   increase 15 and he has more MCI projects in the  works,16 amounting to another 20 to 24 percent  coming.17 This landlord doesn’ t need a18 hefty rent increase.	He’ s cashing in on selling 19 apartments .	The MCI – - the MCIs alone are  killing 20 us .	I have been in my apartment for  32 years.	We 21 have never missed a  rent payment.	We used to be 22 considered good tenants but now with all the  loop 23 holes that they have for increases , landlords 24 consider that you are holding back their  profits 25 if you are a tenant for over six   years .	Something 2 
2 is very wrong if this system rewards greed  over 3 stability.4 ( Applause. )5 MR . MALONEY:	The vast –- the 6 vast landlord money and real estate industry  tries 7 to buy everyone off and distort the  entire 8 picture.	Two sentences from January 2010  anti 9 regulation and pro landlord " New York Times."	New 10 records show that even as the industry  has 11 confronted its worst crisis in decades ,12 developers , construction executives and real 13 estate lobbyists have given millions of dollars  to 14 Mr . Cuomo, providing one in every five  dollars 15 over the past six  months.16 The analysis by " The New York 17 Times" shows that the real estate industry  was 18 the top giver to Mr. Cuomo over the past   three 19 years.20 This board has to balance  in 21 these hard times mere additional business  profit 22 against an essential commodity , housing.	The very 23 basis for existence in the City, peoples’  homes.24 The bankers and landlords are the last people  in 25 need of bailout.2 
2CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr. Maloney ,3I’ mgoing to ask you to start to wrap  up.4( Applause. )5MR . MALONEY:	I’ m asking for 6 this board to stop landlord welfare.	No increase 7 at all this year and certainly no increase  in 8 converted buildings and there should never be  MCI 9 increases in converted buildings.10 I think that you can take care  of 11 the small struggling owners, let them open  their 12 books and help them.	But don’ t give the landlords 13 more power and more profit .14 ( Applause. )15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.16 Kyra Sokolof representing Council 17 Member Jessica Lapin.18 Is she here?19 ( No response.)20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Kim Slansky.21 ( No response.)22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Jocelyn 23 Mingbess?24 ( No response.)25 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Oh, I’ m sorry.6 
2 MS . SIANSKY:	Good afternoon.3 My name is Kim Siansky and I live on the   Upper 4 West Side.5 I am currently a vice  president 6 in my building ’ s tenant association, the Hotel 7 Windemere.	I live in a hotel stabilized  building 8 and have been living there for  20 years.	I live 9 in a small studio apartment without a stove and   a10 half size refrigerator .11 While I did not plan to live in   a12 small room for 20 years, I ’ m very grateful to  have 13 this apartment .	I was born and raised  in 14 Brooklyn, New York .	So, I think, that  officially 15 makes me a native New  Yorkers.16 While I have a full- time job and 17 I work for a large corporate employer, I would   say 18 that I live on a  fixed income.	My salary only 19 allows me to stay in  this apartment.	I can’ t20 afford to move or to pay any higher  rent.21 One of the reasons that makes  New 22 York City the city that it is, are the   diversity 23 of people who live here.	New York thrives because 24 of its neighborhoods and its communities and  the 25 length of time that people stay in one place   to 2 

2	build them .34
( Applause. )MS . SIANSKY:	During the 20 
5 years that I’ ve lived in this building , I have 6 witnessed a large turnover  of apartments.	The 7 owners have enjoyed large increases in rent  during 8 the last decade due to illegal amounts charged  for 9 apartment improvement and the lack of  enforcement 10 of the rule of law .11 Apartments have been illegally 12 destabilized.	Since this building was sold  seven 13 months ago , we now have over 100 empty  apartments.14 The new owners were successful in getting  the 15 tenants who were already paying market rent,  to 16 break their leases and to move  out .	Of course ,17 they could stay and renew their lease if they   were 18 willing to pay an additional 90 percent  increase 19 in their rent.20 My fellow neighbors and I  are 21 terrified that we will fall victim to  predatory 22 equity landlord tactics that ultimately  force 23 people out of their homes.	Do the landlords of 24 New York really want to create more  homeless 25 people ?5 
2 Landlords in Upper Manhattan have 3 seen their profits have a net operating  income 4 increase by over 22 percent according to RGB’ s5 data.	The RGB should consider a zero  percent 6 increase for all tenants.	The board must remain 7 mindful of the incredible hardship any  increases 8 would cause.	They should also consider the 9 current population of the homeless people  living 10 in this City and by what number that  might 11 increase should affordable housing be  compromised.12 Thank you for your time  today.13 ( Applause. )14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.15 If there are people in the  room 16 who would like to speak and have not  registered,17 the registration desk outside will close at 6 : 00 .18 If you would like to speak , please go there  and 19register and we will be happy to hear  you.20Joycelyn Mingbess?21( No response.)22CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	David 23Finkelstein?24( No response.)25CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Paul

( Applause. )MR . BRIDGEWATER:	Hello.	My name 
5 is Paul Bridgewater.	I’ ve lived on East 3 rd 6 Street for 29 and in my current building for  27 .7 That year we formed a  tenants 8 association to fight the heroin trade and  worked 9 to make it a livable – - a livable neighborhood .10 In 1984 , I opened the first 11 upscale restaurant across from LaMama on  Fourth 12 Street .	I later opened one of the early  East 13 Village galleries.14 I’ m now involved in our community 15 gardens trying to make the neighborhood a   nicer 16 place.17 In 1996 , I discovered I had  Aids,18 suffering two strokes, Kaposi Sarcoma,  Wasting 19 Syndrome and am now fighting macular  degeneration 20 which could make me blind.	Much of my time is 21 dedicated to my health .22 With the current economy, age 23 discrimination , health issues and lack of viable 24 employment , I struggle to make ends meet.	Any 25 substantial rent increase would be devastating  to 5 

2	my tiny income .3
Since moving into my  building,
4 it ’ s been sold several times, starting at 5 $ 250 , 000 , currently offered at $ 30 million .	Our 6 current owners have 48 residential buildings  in 7 Manhattan alone plus hotels and parking  garages.8 Many buildings have ground floor commercial  spaces 9 and cellular towers providing additional  income.10 When our landlord purchased our 11 building, they started buying people out  and 12 illegally turned J - 51 apartments into deregulated 13 high rental units.	One bedrooms became two.	Two 14 bedrooms became three and four , resulting in 15 multiple stop work orders.16 Next, without informing the 17 tenants or protecting their workers, they  started 18 removing asbestos.	Numbers of our tenants ,19 including children , suffered respiratory problems 20 causing one tenant to be  hospitalized.21 Now the landlord offers new 22 tenants maximum one- year leases, creating high 23 turnover resulting in large increases  each 24 vacancy.25 Our building has become a  college 4

( Applause. )MR . BRIDGEWATER:	–- not a
5 residential building.	Multiple users are stacked 6 into overbuilt and overcrowded conditions just  so 7 they can afford the rent.8 Every winter we complain of  over 9 heating, forcing us to keep our windows  open.10 Considering our landlord’ s11 inefficiency and waste of energy, tenants  should 12 not be penalized with an additional  fuel 13 surcharge.14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Mr.15 Bridgewater, I ’ m going to ask you to start to  wrap 16 up , if you would.17 MR . BRIDGEWATER:	Yep.18 The RGB should be considering  no 19 increases now.	With every landlord receiving 5 . 820 percent increase the board , none of us has seen  an 21 increase in wages in years .22 I recommend any landlord who  has 23 broken the law on J- 51 rules, receive no  rent 24 increases period.25 ( Applause. )5

GAMMIE :	Hello.	As a10 member of Tenants and Neighbors, I thank you,   RGB 11 members, for taking the time to put faces on   the 12 data you have been studying.13 My name is Susan Gammie and I’ m  a14 native New Yorker.	I’ m a theatrical designer and 15 member of United Scenic Artists Local 829 .16 As a citizen, I am an  active 17 participant in Community Board No. 2 , where as  an 18 appointed member of the Landmarks and  Public 19 Aesthetics Committee, I volunteer over 100 hours  a20 year.	So, like you, I am invested in the   future 21 of our City.22 I have lived with my husband  and 23 son in a rent stabilized apartment in  Greenwich 24 Village for 33 years.	We are the only  rent 25 regulated tenants remaining in our building  where 2 
2 several units have been deregulated  and 3 consolidated to create luxury housing.4 My building is heated by  fuel 5 oil.	Two years ago, several panes of glass  fell 6 out of a rear window in  my apartment.	Management 7 was notified.	Management ignored.	Cold wind 8 blasted through for two full winters while  a9 full- time crew worked onsite renovating the 10 deregulated units.	Ultimately , a thin sheet of 11 plastic has been slapped up, not up to Code   and 12 certainly not energy efficient .13 So when I hear fuel surcharge,  I14 can only think , really .	My apartment is no  more 15 energy efficient now than it was in 1846 when   it 16 was built.17 ( Laughter. )18 MS . GAMMIE :	These are tough 19 times for everyone .	In November, I will lose  the 20 job I held for  20 years.	Every working person I21 know has been forced to take cuts in pay   and 22 benefits over the past few  years.23 During this time, owners, many  of 24 whom have profited handsomely, pre the  downturn,25 continue to profit .	As you know, the average  net 2 
2 operating income for owners throughout the  City 3 this year increased by 5 . 8 percent .	The figure 4 jumps to 22 . 2 percent if you exclude core 5 Manhattan.6 So when you hear the  owners 7 describe their hardships, I ask that you  place 8 that in the larger context of the burden we’ re  all 9 shouldering right now.10 Continued economic , cultural and 11 ethnic diversity is essential to the long  term 12 health of the City . As you draw up this year’ s13 guidelines , I ask you to realize that you are  also 14 drawing a picture of who could afford to live   in 15 the City and who cannot.16 In view of the fact that  owners’17 net operating incomes are still up , I ask  the 18 board to recommend a zero percent increase  this 19 year.	If you deem that impossible , I ask that  you 20 pass the tenant representative proviso  that 21 tenants receive zero percent increase if they  live 22 in a building where less than 80 percent of   the 23 units are currently rent stabilized or  controlled.24 I also ask that the board  to 25 abolish the proposed fuel surcharge  which 2 
2 potentially penalizes tenants for  owner 3 negligence .4 Thank you for your time  and 5 consideration.6 ( Applause. )7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 Mr . Diana.9 MR . DIANA:	Hi, guys.	I just 10 wanted to see how the usual score card was   coming.11 The other night I was here  for 12 just about three hours .13 Councilman Williams rails against 14 us while he, himself, is a slum lord in his   own 15 illegal apartments .	Maybe you guys saw the  City 16 Council hearings on that.	He had illegal 17 apartments in his building .18 But none of you guys had  the 19 nerve to ask him what he charges for  the 20 apartments .	That would have – - that should have 21 been your absolute minimum because he was  railing 22 against us pretty good , but he refused 23 continuously to tell us what he’ s charging .	That 24 would have been very telling.25 One of the other gentleman was  a2 
2 single film editor .	He had a three- bedroom 3 apartment on 23 rd Street.	Young, healthy guy, big 4 ponytail – - right.	He was working part- time and 5 he ’ s complaining about it.	Well, maybe he ’ s6 healthy enough to do the same 70 - hour work week 7 that I do.	All right.	And that I ’ ve been doing 8 for 23 years.9 Where are the SCRIE  applications?10 I keep hitting you guys for the last   several 11 years. Nobody wants to fill out a   SCRIE 12 application	Well , none of the council people 13 here – - nobody .	I grabbed Mr. Williams in the  –-14 Mr . Jackson in the hallway and I asked him  about 15 that, why do 17 , 000 that have got more bedrooms 16 than people living in public housing?	That’ s17 disgraceful.18 We have 75 , 000 tenants who are 19 eligible, according to the Budget Office  for 20 SCRIE, yet I still can ’ t give out applications at 21 these –- at these meetings .	Something ’ s wrong .22 The few who do answer the question always seem   to 23 be just $ 100 over the $ 35 , 000 income level that’ s24 applicable for SCRIE.	Okay.25 Maybe some of the  politicians 2 
2 could explain the 90 , 000 apartments that are 3 renting for under $ 300 a month .	I mean, you guys 4 you do hundreds of pages of applications  of 5 information, listing every single possible cost  of 6 light bulbs and toothbrushes on your stuff  and 7 then you come back and you say , apartments  for 8 $ 300 are okay.	That’ s not fair to the people that 9 are paying 15 , 16 , $ 1 , 700 for apartments.	That’ s10 really not fair.11 A lot of these people  are 12 chronically unemployed from their own  testimony.13 There was a woman there who had four jobs in   the 14 past three years and she got fired from all   of 15 them.	How am I as a landlord, supposed to   do 16 something about that?	Tell me you ’ ve had the 17 things –-18 ( Audience participation.)19 MR .

You guys could really start  fixing 23 stuff that ’ s wrong here.	You have the ability  to 24 fix it .	Okay.	You have the ability to fix it .25 ( Audience participation.)2

I’ ve got plenty of SCRIE 10 applications and I have yet, in four years ,  been 11 able to give away any of them, not a   single 12 application in four years.	And you guys should be 13 asking people why they can ’ t fill out a two- page 14 application.15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	If anybody 16 needs one, they know where they can get  one.17 Thank you.18 MR .

2 MR . EPSTEIN:	Thank you.3 The Urban Justice Center is a  25 4 year old legal services organization that  provides 5 legal and advocate services throughout New  York 6 City.7 We look at not just direct  legal 8 assistance but systemic advocacy, community 9 education to low or moderate income rent  regulated 10 tenants throughout New York City.11 The Community Development Project 12 provides legal , technical, research and policy 13 assistance to grassroots, community- based 14 organizations throughout New York on a wide  range 15 of issues.16 The focus here is to ensure  that 17 real and lasting change in low income  communities 18 throughout New York City is rooted through  a19 community empowerment through grassroots 20 movements.21 It ’ s evident to us that in New 22 York there ’ s still a huge economic downturn.23 Individuals in New York are  struggling .	We see it 24 everyday.	We provide legal services to over 9 , 000 25 people every year.	People walk in our door  who 2 
2 can’ t afford to stay in this City.	And it ’ s all 3 about affordable housing.	Rent regulation is the 4 biggest source of affordable housing within  our 5 community.6 We ’ re seeing the effects of Rents 7 Guidelines Boards throughout New York,  whether 8 it ’ s neighborhoods on the Upper East Side, Upper 9 West Side, South Bronx , Bed Sty, Staten Island .10 These rent guidelines and the  substantial 11 increases you’ re recommending, will have a12 detrimental effect on these low income  New 13 Yorkers.14 The average New Yorker making 15 $ 38 , 000 a year can no longer afford to live in the 16 rent regulated apartments with five, seven  and 17 nine percent increases .18 We urge you to think about a   rent 19 freeze again this year .	Rent freeze is what we’ re 20 talking about for low  income tenants.	There are 21 income freezes going on every day.	If you see ,22 government employees are giving back.	The Mayor 23 is suggesting that people don’ t look for  salary 24 increases, non - profit organizations are cutting 25 back and not seeing any increases.	Small 2 
2 businesses are suggesting that people  forego 3 salary increases and have to pay portions to   their 4 benefits.5 But here at the Rent  Guidelines 6 Board, we are talking about rent increases to   the 7 people who can afford it the least .8 So , again, I suggest we talk 9 about rent freezes .	We talk about landlord 10 profit . We talk about preserving communities.	We 11 talk about what neighborhoods mean  to us.	And if 12 we think about those issues, you would realize  the 13 most important thing we have is our  neighborhoods.14 It makes New York what  it is.	We need these rent 15 regulated apartments.	We need a rent freeze  now.16 Thank you very much.17 ( Applause. )18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.19 Georgina Christ.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Chris.

I have lived on the Lower  East 
4 Side for 42 years.	For the last 15 years, I  have 5 been what is called a suite organizer for   various 6 community issues, one being, affordable  housing.7 Every year , for four to six months , I set up  my 8 table and I become a person who people talk  to .9 I have not once –- not once met   a10 Rockefeller who lives in a rent  stabilized 11 apartment.	On the contrary, I have met  minimum 12 wage to moderate income and some self- employed 13 tenants.14 And they came to this  area 15 because they could afford to  live there.	That no 16 longer is true .	For the last few years, I  have 17 reported to the RGB the desperation, the  clear 18 desperation of the rent stabilized  tenants 19 concerning affordability.	And you know it ’ s got 20 to be desperate when tenants, especially women ,21 cannot wait to turn 62 and apply for  SCRIE .	And 22 that isn’ t even going to save them .23 Out of the 22 apartments in  my 24 building, we had eight rent stabilized  apartments.25 I say had as we just lost a 25 - year resident  who 4 
2 could not afford to take care of his diabetes   and 3 now he has passed on and we lose   another 4 affordability.5 It ’ s criminal, absolutely 6 criminal because that is one of the pride of   the 7 tenants on the Lower East Side is that  they’ ve 8 lost their jobs, they’ ve been downsized.	They 9 can’ t find employment and they feel that it is  age 10 discrimination because most of the tenants in  rent 11 stabilized apartments are my age and just a   little 12 bit younger.	I moved here when I was 18 but 19   in 13 the residence that I live in  now.14 They lost their jobs.	They don’ t15 have health insurance.	They – - and they can’ t16 even take care of their teeth because teeth  are 17 not included in health insurance, you pay out   of 18 pocket .19 So what I would like  to 20 recommend, based on my experience and the  hardship 21 that is taking place here on the Lower East   Side 22 of tenants who here, for the most part , are  in 23 their late 40 s and up to 60 s, is a zero  rent 24 increase.	And no fuel charge .	That’ s absurd .25 And I would also like, at  this 2 
2 point, to hand in 50 letters of signature   from 3 tenants on the Lower East Side .4 ( Applause. )5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.6 Give it to Marc.

Please go to the table outside if  you 14 would like to speak.15 Linda McGhee.16 MS . MC GHEE:	Good afternoon.17 My name is Linda McGhee and I live at 50 East   21 st 18 Street in Brooklyn , New York.19 I am a board member of the   Urban 20 Women’ s Safe Haven and I am retired, living on  a21 pension, no other income.	I’ m also the president 22 of my tenant’ s –- building ’ s tenants association 23 and I have worked with the Tenants and   Neighbors 24 group.25 I have lived at 50 East 21 st 2 
2 Street since July 1976 .	That’ s 35 years.	And the 3 owners of this building have changed five  times 4 since I moved there.	That gives them about seven 5 years apiece before they sell.6 The current owner bought this 7 building for $ 20 - – and knowing that work had to 8 be done.	We’ re getting good heat –- I ’ m going to 9 get back to that.10 We ’ re getting good heat.11 Sometimes, as others have said , too much heat,  but 12 I’ d rather have too much and let the window up  so 13 I can go out then to be freezing, so that’ s what   I14 did.15 There are times when we  needed 16 heat and we didn’ t get it and I have called 311   to 17 let them know that and then we got   it.18 Back in January of 2010  we 19 received a permanent MCI for repairs that  the 20 landlord knew had to be done when he paid his  $ 20 21 for the building.	He said he bought ten  buildings 22 from the previous landlord .23 He also said this –- well, I   hate 24 to say this, but I think I ’ ll skip that, but  he 25 did say this was an  investment .	I won ’ t tell you 2 

2	the other part .3
That caused me , as the president 
4 of the tenant’ s association to read the  Rent 5 Stabilization Code , part 25 , 22 part 4 , which 6 gives a long list of things that the landlord   can 7 get a permanent increase for.	And the most 8 shocking was a lobby door that we need   for 9 protection .	And it cost them about $ 2 , 800 .10 They also charged us for a  burner 11 for $ 68 , 000 , a new roof for $ 46 , 460 , a security 12 system which consisted of cameras that was  never 13 in the building but the DHCR granted that as   well.14 And then, of course, the entrance door and  a15 refurbished elevator.16 Since then the elevator has  been 17 down for repairs.	The heat has been turned  off 18 for repairs and these are the things that  we’ re 19 being asked to pay for . We ’ re actually paying them 20 because DHCR granted that MCI.	We immediately 21 filed an administrative Par which held up the   back 22 paper 2009 .23 Now my lease expired in  November 24 last year, 2010 , which I was given the $ 60 rent 25 increase on top of a $ 42 MCI.	That was $ 14 . 12 or 4 
2 14 center, per room. I have a  three- room 3 apartment.4 Many of the tenants have  a5 three- room apartment and the most is four.	So 6 this, to me and to the tenants , was another way  of 7 getting around that rent stabilization if they  got 8 two increases.	And we ’ re going to be paying that 9 MCI going forward forever.10 But we ’ re also going to have to 11 go back and pay that 2009 increase , MCI  increase,12 if DHCR grants it.	And, by that time my  lease 13 will expire again and then they’ ll be another $ 60 .14 My rent went up in less than a year $ 100 for   the 15 first time in 35 years that I   live there.	And 16 this is going to continue.	If it continues, I17 have to count the years too that I can stay   in 18 this building that I’ ve been in for 35 years  that 19 I call home.20 And my recommendation –-  our 21 recommendation is that the Rent Guidelines  Board 22 should consider a zero percent rent increase  for 23 all tenants and if there is an increase, it   should 24 not be any higher than what the data presented   by 25 the RGB warrants. And the RGB should keep in   mind 2 
2 the incredible hardship that any increase at  all 3 will cause to most low and moderate  income 4 tenants.5 Thank you.6 ( Applause. )7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 Katharine Wolpe.9 A VOICE:	What number is that ?10 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ninety- four .11 A VOICE:	Thank you.12 MS . WOLPE:	My name is Katharine 13 Wolpe.	I’ ve been a rent stabilized tenant on  East 14 Tenth Street, Manhattan, since November 1971 .15 You should have copies of  my 16 testimony.17 I am currently a retired  senior 18 citizen, formerly employed as a law  librarian.19 During my residence in the East Village, I ’ ve 20 worked on numerous neighborhood issues .	Some 21 examples are, efforts to fight drug  trafficking,22 which was rampant in the 1980 ' s on the block next 23 to mine, working with other community  activists,24 including a Catholic nun and local small  landlords 25 to reduce the concentration of services  to 2 
2 homeless men at the then City shelter on   East 3 Tenth –- East Third Street , which was having  a4 devastating effect on the  surrounding 5 neighborhood.6 And the struggle to find  a7 beneficial use for the former Public School 122 ,8 which closed in the mid 1970 ' s and is now a9 non- profit art and social service community 10 center .11 While serving on the board of  122 12 community center, I became familiar with the  costs 13 and needs of maintaining an older, though  well 14 constructed building.	Therefore, I know that 15 ongoing maintenance and repair is essential  in 16 residential buildings housing tenants.17 In the building I live in,  the 18 heating oil tank sprang a leak which seeped  under 19 adjacent buildings causing problems for  my 20 neighbors. The tenants in my building were  charged 21 an MCI increase for the replacement of  the 22 defective tank and for new windows , which we  are 23 still paying.24 While this problem occurred under 25 the prior landlord , the current landlord does 2 
2 provide timely and competent repairs.	However ,3 the current landlord has made determined  efforts 4 to force out or harass long- term tenants.5 Two examples, one tenant who 6 works at a New Jersey business was taken   to 7 Housing Court in an attempt to disprove him as   a8 primary resident because he had a bank account  in 9 New Jersey .10 Another tenant who had an  elderly 11 mother in Massachusetts, was also taken to  Housing 12 Court over the same issue even though she   worked 13 and lived in New York City .14 Several years ago, the  landlord 15 tacked $ 95 charge onto my rent on the  spurious 16 claim that I had damaged the paint in the hall   by 17 posting a notice about a neighborhood  event,18 postings for which I always use non- sticking 19 artist tape, which does no damage to paint .20 There are still some problems 21 with overheating in the winter , as old  radiators 22 for which I must cope by opening my   windows.23 Long- term tenants in my building 24 are hardworking though they occasionally run  into 25 financial problems .	I have assisted three of  them 2 
2 financially when they have faced health issues  or 3 fell behind in their rent because of  unemployment.4 I and other long- term –- I ’ m5 going to skip over a couple of  things.6 I urge that the Rent  Guidelines 7 Board not pass a fuel surcharge which will just   be 8 passed onto tenants. Legislation by the  City 9 Council or State Legislature giving tax  incentives 10 to create more energy efficient and less  polluting 11 buildings, would be a better way to  encourage 12 landlords to make the changes  needed.13 I would also urge either no  rent 14 increase or the lowest possible  increase.15 Long- time tenants keep neighborhoods stable and 16 local businesses thriving, especially in  these 17 troubled times .18 ( Applause. )19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	If you could 20 wrap up, please.21 MS . WOLPE:	I’ m wrapping up.22 Unwarranted increases lead to 23 increased turnover and to short- term tenants with 24 little stake in the neighborhood.	Jobs and 25 taxpayers are being driven out of the City by   high 2 
2rents which will ultimately lead to a decline  in 3funds for essential City services.4CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.5( Applause. )6MS . WOLPE:	I just wanted to 7 mention I have attached to my  testimony 8 information about the White Roof Project which  is 9 another energy saving initiative that  landlords 10 can take to reduce their electricity costs .11 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.12 Steve Herrick.13 MR . HERRICK:	Good evening.	I’ m14 Steve Herrick, Executive Director of the  Cooper 15 Square Committee.	We’ re a tenants ’ rights 16 organization on the Lower East  Side.17 I’ m here to urge the Rent 18 Guidelines Board to exempt low income  tenants 19 earning less than 80 percent of the  Metropolitan 20 area median income from any rent increase  and 21 those who already pay more than 30 percent   of 22 their income towards rent.23 As the Rent Guidelines Board’ s24 own 2011 Income and Affordability Study  shows,25 more than half of rent stabilized tenants in   2008 7 
2 paid more than 31 percent of their gross  income 3 towards rent.	This is above the HUD  recommended 4 maximum rent to income ratio of 30 percent .5 The logical policy recommendation 6 one could make from this finding is that  low 7 income rent stabilized tenants whose rent  already 8 exceeds 30 percent of their income , should  be 9 exempt from a rent increase  this year.	The 10 recession is hitting rent stabilized  tenants 11 especially hard and hundreds of thousands of  New 12 Yorkers are out of  work.13 New York City’ s unemployment rate 14 is still very high at 8 . 6 percent in April . There 15 are nearly 350 , 000 New York City residents 16 collecting unemployment. This does not  include 17 several hundred thousand residents whose 18 unemployment benefits have run out or people  who 19 have stopped looking for work in a tight  job 20 market .21 The City’ s Independent Budget 22 office does not expect the unemployment rate  to 23 drop below 6 percent until some time after  2014 .24 Given this grim economic picture, households  have 25 less money to spend.	Prices for food and gas  have 2 
2 been rising in the past year and households  have 3 less money to spend on  essentials.4 Retail sales have declined each 5 month from February through May of this  year 6 according to the Census Bureau , down 1 . 5 percent 7 overall in recent months, wiping out the  small 8 gains over the previous year.	This is after 9 climbing 11 percent from – - September 2008  to 10 September 2009 .11 The fact that tenants are  rent 12 poor is hurting small businesses which , in turn,13 is negatively impacting on our communities .14 While tenants are hurting 15 financially, landlords are one group that is  not 16 hurting.	We know of only one rent  stabilized 17 building that is currently in foreclosure in  the 18 East Village.	Last year we researched a  random 19 sample of over 430 multi- family buildings to see 20 if there were any signs of financial  distress.21 Less than two percent of  them 22 owned more than $ 10 , 000 in real estate taxes and 23 some of these buildings didn’ t even have a24 mortgage.	So the reason for the arrears  was 25 simply that the landlord had not bothered to  bring 2 
2 their property taxes up to  date 3 In this climate, a rent  freeze 4 for low income tenants is warranted. Units  that 5 have had a vacancy increase in the past four   years 6 should also be exempt from the rent  increase.7 I urge the Rent Guidelines  Board 8 to be creative in using methods to avoid   passing 9 on rent increases to people who can least  afford 10 it .11 Thank you.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.13 ( Applause. )14 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Frances 15 Golden .16 ( No response.)17 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Frances 18 Golden .19 ( No response.)20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	I’ m sorry.21 Frances Golden .22 Elizabeth Ruff Maldonado?23 ( No response.)24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Rebecca Hall.25 MS .

2 9 : 30 this morning.3 Thank God, I’ m finally called.4 Allow me to say this.	We have 5 been bamboozled.	If you don’ t understand that 6 terminology, it means we’ ve been had.7 Allow me also to preface  my 8 statement with the March 24 th, 2011 Court of 9 Appeals' reversal and dismissal of the  petitions 10 challenging the minimum dollar increase under  the 11 Rent Guidelines Board order No . 40 .12 I am the victim of order No. 40 .13 My rent in a stabilized unit Prospect  South 14 Brooklyn, previously known as Flatbush went  from 15 $ 503 . 03 a month to $ 588 . 06 a month with nothing 16 added except that increase .17 I am a member of the  Tenants 18 Association, Brooklyn Housing and Family  Services.19 I moved into my unit in 1979 with a  three- year 20 lease at the rate of $ 250 per month in a  pre- war 21 building.	Three- year leases are no longer offered 22 and I believe this option was discontinued in   the 23 mid or late ‘ 80 ' s when multiple dwelling units 24 went co- op –- co- op mania.25 Out of the 84 units in  my 2 
2 locations, we have three sectors  of tenancies.	We 3 have rent stabilized which is less than 20   percent 4 now.	We have shareholder owners and  proprietary 5 leasers that are subleasing from shareholders  in 6 order for them to make their mortgage  and 7 maintenance payments.8 There’ s been mass evictions of 9 those that cannot afford the escalating cost  of 10 housing because there are no protections  for 11 deregulated units.	Management has accepted 12 security deposits that are never returned, i. e .13 interest.	Only recourse is through the  landlord 14 and tenants courts to find out where your  deposit,15 your security –- excuse me , your security deposit 16 with interest is.17 Applications for SCRIE has been 18 rejected because we’ re one or two dollars over  the 19 allowance as retirees. Tenants are caught in  a20 Catch 22 situation .	In the last few months,  my 21 rent receipt shows , instead of the $ 588 that was 22 awarded through order No. 40 , has now become $ 601 23 and with no mention of a lease  renewal 24 notification.25 There are things that tenants 2 
2 have to go through such as purchasing their  own 3 refrigerators because management thinks that  they 4 can send in reconditioned refrigerators  that 5 smelled like something died in  them.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	If you –- if 7 you could start to wrap up .8 MS . HALL:	Yes , sir.9 Is there any such thing as  a10 superintendent calling someone on the phone  to 11 tell them to turn the computer on for the   furnace 12 to blow off heat.	It is total madness in  this 13 City what’ s happening to tenants, especially the 14 elder and retirees .15 ( Applause. )16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.17 Leon Gruenbaum .18 MS .

And he represents the 75 th 14 Assembly District in Manhattan which includes  the 15 neighborhoods of Chelsea, Hell ’ s Kitchen, Midtown 16 and part of the Upper West Side and Murray   Hill.17 These proposed increases are 18 unjustified and make life harder for rent  paying 19 New Yorkers.	I strongly oppose this year’ s20 proposals and urge that the board reject  them.21 In past years, the RGB  justified 22 high permanent increases in rents citing  unusual 23 temporary price surges reflected in the  Price 24 Index of Operating Costs.	The truth is that the 25 current rents are already well above  landlord 4 

2	costs.3
Last year, the board approved  a
4 2 . 25 percent increase for one- year leases and a5 4 . 5 percent increase for two- year leases.	While 6 those increases were lower than in years past,  no 7 increase was justified last year and  tenants 8 continue to struggle as a  result.9 Because previous increases were 10 much larger than were warranted, the economy  in 11 New York City is suffering as a result of this   and 12 the economy in the City is suffering as a   result 13 of the nationwide recession, the board should  be 14 enacting a rent freeze this year or at   least 15 scaling back the proposed increases and bring  them 16 down to last year’ s levels .17 It ’ s long past time to abandon 18 the price index.	The index looks at increases  in 19 prices such as fuel, insurance premiums,  utilities 20 and property taxes .	But a price increase is  only 21 a spending increase if the landlord continues  to 22 buy the item at the same price rather than   cutting 23 back on services.24 Studies have shown that many 25 landlords will cut back on services to save   money.4 
2 More important , the index does not take into 3 account the incomes of tenants and its data   on 4 landlord income and expenses is usually  outdated 5 by the time the board makes  its decision.	Because 6 it is so one sided , the price index is  incapable 7 of guiding our decision making  fairly.8 Data from the New York  City 9 Department of Finance and from recent real  estate 10 studies suggest that the ownership of  rent 11 stabilized buildings remains profitable.	The 2011 12 Income and Expense Study shows that increases  in 13 income outpaced increases in operating costs by  a14 wide margin.15 The RGB’ s own study showed that 16 landlords are keeping a staggering 35 percent  of 17 every rental dollar in income.	The average rent 18 stabilized apartment generated $ 362 per month of 19 income .	Based on this figure, a 45 - unit rent 20 stabilized building could generate nearly $ 200 , 000 21 in income each year.22 Apartments in Manhattan are even 23 more able of generating $ 568 per month and in  core 24 Manhattan, where my districts are located,  this 25 figure is an astonishing $ 755 .	When you consider 2 
2 that great many eligible buildings in  Manhattan 3 have been partially deregulated, the  income 4 generated by these properties must  be 5 astronomical.6 I’ ll close up now.7 I’ m alarmed by the board’ s8 apparent lack of understanding and concern for  the 9 dire straits faced by many rent  stabilized 10 tenants.	Particularly in these difficult times  --11 economic times , tenants in rent regulated 12 apartments are paying more and more of  their 13 income for housing .	The needs that concern 14 tenants, especially low income tenants , are 15 fundamental to the health of New York’ s  housing 16 market and safe affordable housing is  the 17 foundation of those concerns.18 New Yorkers are already paying  an 19 excessive and growing percentage of their  income 20 for their rent , much more than the rest of  the 21 country.	It hurts tenants and  the City.	I urge 22 the board to vote against these unjustified  rent 23 increases.24 Thank you.25 ( Applause. )2

2 income so I got a license in   real estate.	I went 3 to the other side.4 However, I realized very  quickly 5 when I started renting apartments for my  landlord 6 and I was going into these buildings where  they 7 were renovating these buildings while people  were 8 still living in there, where they were  pushing 9 people out and I couldn’ t understand how  could 10 they get away with this.	How could people live in 11 these sub –- in  these conditions?	Okay.12 Little did I know that it  was 13 just a matter of time before they started   doing 14 the same thing in  my building.	As a result, I15 have to say, I ’ m no longer doing real estate.	I’ m16 very happy because I am not proud of   that 17 profession .	There ’ s a lot of money being made at 18 the backs and the suffering of a lot of people   in 19 this City.20 ( Applause. )21 MS .

2 the tenants’ association.3 We helped people to  understand 4 what their rights were , that if a landlord  was 5 beginning to harass the tenants, push them out ,6 offer them nice little buyouts for $ 1 , 000 ,7 $ 10 , 000 , $ 100 , 000 if they could get away with it.8 We had the press  in there.	We had a lot of  people 9 helping us out .10 I know my time is  running out.	I11 just want to say a couple of more things that   are 12 very important .13 All of these apartments were 14 renovated under J- 51 .	They were illegally brought 15 to market and these landlords are now paying  – -16 they’ re asking people to pay $ 6 , 000 for a two,17 four, three- bedroom apartment.18 People are given a one - year 19 lease.	They’ re being pushed out because at the 20 end of that one- year lease , once it expires,21 they’ re being charged $ 500 increase.	They cannot 22 afford it. They have to leave.	It is a  turnover.23 I live in a rent  stabilized 24 building.	I’ d like to see my community stabilized 25 again.	I’ ve lived here.	I intend to die here .2 
2 And what’ s going on is illegal .	And I think that 3 these landlords should be looked at and we   should 4 not get –- have to pay increases when they   are 5 doing illegal practices.6 So I’ m asking the board to please 7 consider that.8 These apartments should be 9 converted to their rent stabilization status  and 10 we should look at  vacancy decontrol.	It should 11 not exist because we are weakening the fabric  of 12 this City.

DUBNAU :	–- as the old  song 21 goes.22 Now, two – - Saturday, a week ago 23 last Saturday, there was a large demonstration  in 24 Washington Heights for rents that we can  afford.25 In the rain, in the wind, hundreds of people   came 2 
2 out in Washington Heights in a united show   of 3 strength.4 Now I want to bring a  particular 5 story from RENA to  you .	Years –- two –- I  think 6 it was two years ago when we were thinking   that 7 the public members would care if they  would 8 actually see individuals in our neighborhoods  and 9 speak to them.	Based upon that, I invited you ,10 Mr . Kimmel , to come and visit a tenant in 11 Washington Heights .	You did so.12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Actually,13 several tenants.14 MS . DUBNAU :	Yes.	But I want to 15 speak –-16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Ms. Cruz did 17 also.18 MS . DUBNAU :	–- in particular –-19 in particular about one tenant , who I don’ t need 20 to mention her name.	It’ s a young tenant.21 Because not everybody –- it’ s not only the  elderly 22 people that are suffering from these high  rents.23 Our young people are suffering  tremendously.24 So this young family that  I25 brought you to was living in a basement   apartment.2 
 2 I couldn’ t invite Ms. Adams to that  apartment,3 although I wanted to.	Why ?	Because there was 4 steps going down and it as not  actually 5 accessible , including the young mother who has  two 6 young children , had to take her children down  the 7 steps as well.8 However –- so what  happened?9 This young family was living in a   basement 10 apartment with the roaches and the rats and   no 11 heat.	And they were paying $ 1 , 400 a month in a12 rent stabilized apartment.	They had, as you will 13 recall , because you saw their apartment, that 14 there was hardly any room for that family to   live 15 in .16 So that family then moved as  a17 result of our efforts and they found an   apartment 18 that they could sublet .	They’ re now subletting a19 decent apartment for $ 1 , 200 , which they really 20 cannot afford since the father is making less than 21	$ 35 , 000 a year .22 However, they’ re going to have to 23 get out of that sublet  this November.	Now what –-24 now they have another child.	So there ’ s three 25 children in this apartment now .	Where are they 22 
2 going to be able to move, members of the   Rent 3 Guidelines Board?	Where are they going to be  able 4 to move?5 I want you to look in  your 6 hearts .	This is just one story of many,  many,7 many in our neighborhood.	Where will they move?8 The rent guidelines that you  have 9 already voted upon as a range is atrociously  high 10 and it would be a disaster for our –- not only   our 11 neighborhood but for all of New York, if   you 12 continue with those rent increases that you  have 13 voted on.14 Look in your hearts, please.15 Forget about the landlords .	The five of you,  the 16 five public members, it’ s on you, the decision  to 17 make – - to do the right thing.18 And, please, I know, Mr.  Kimmel,19 you know what I’ m talking about.	And I know all 20 of you know what I ’ m talking about .	We can no 21 longer pay these rents .	You will be responsible 22 for greater homelessness, personally responsible.23 And I hold you to that .24 Thank you.25 ( Applause. )2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.3 Dr . Horowitz.4 DR . HOROWITZ:	Chairman Kimmel,5 members of the Rent Guidelines Board, thank  you 6 for allowing me to address you .7 I come to talk about a tale  of 8 two cities and not to tell you a tale   of woe.	I9 have it good.	I live at 2 Fifth  Avenue.10 Since rent stabilization began ,11 I’ ve lived in that building when it was a  free 12 market building, 44 years ago.	I live on the 14 th 13 floor overlooking Washington Square Park and  my 14 neighbors are millionaires , multi- millionaires and 15 billionaires. I do not have a   miserable 16 experience .17 In fact, anyone who lives in  a18 Rudin- owned apartment, knows that they give more 19 than the law requires for rent stabilized  tenants.20 However, this is not true for many rent  stabilized 21 tenants around the City where the owners give  much 22 less than is required by law.	I know you’ re aware 23 of that and many live in hazardous and   unsafe 24 buildings and yet they get increases year  after 25 year after year.2 
2 Even my situation, if I live  long 3 enough , I’ m 75 years old.	God has been very  kind 4 to me and perhaps I’ ll live 25 more years, it  is 5 possible.	And if these increases continue , even 6 my situation would go into rent vacancy  decontrol 7 and I, in old age, would be driven out of the   home 8 that I have lived in now for 44 years than   at 9 greater rate.10 I realize that people come to  you 11 every year and say –- the owners come and say,  " we 12 need more. "	And the rent stabilized tenants  say,13 " roll back our rents."	Neither is possible.14 However, these are very unusual times. 9 . 9 percent 15 of my fellow New Yorkers are unemployed as   of 16 2010 , the latest year we have data for .17 Owners for the latest year  we 18 have data for, received an escalation of 5 . 819 percent in increased income.	They are doing – -20 those are the latest figures.	They are doing 21 relatively well.	Most New Yorkers are doing  not 22 so well.23 Food Stamp applications are on 24 the rise.	Church food banks are depleted.	New 25 Yorkers are hanging on by  their fingernails.	I2 
2 realize that you have to have some  reasonable 3 increases.4 Think about maybe this year 5 making it a little less than you  had planned.	New 6 Yorkers are desperately struggling and if  you 7 could consider adjusting, possibly downward,  the 8 increases that you project , not every year , not 9 rolling back rents , but just for this year ,10 consider going a little easier on my fellow  New 11 Yorkers because they’ re the other city who do  not 12 live amongst millionaires, multi- millionaires and 13 billionaires and are struggling for  survival.14 I appreciate any consideration 15 you might make in helping those that  are 16 desperately struggling to maintain their  housing.17 Thank you.18 ( Applause. )19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.20 MR . MC LAUGHLIN:	Our next 21 speaker is Naniah Terrier.22 Are you here?	Oh , she’ s coming.23 Okay.24 Our next speaker after that  will 25 be Matt Shotkin.2 
2 MS . TERRIER:	Hi everybody.	My 3 name is Naniah Terrier .4 I’ m actually originally from 5 Florida.6 A VOICE:	Louder.7 MS . TERRIER:	Sorry.	I’ m8 originally from Florida and I came to New York   in 9 2008 because my dream was to live in   New York.	I10 love New York.	I visit New York and I wanted  to 11 be reside in New  York.12 In 2008 , on my birthday on April 13 18 th, I decided to make the move.	I found a14 landlord by the name of Damian Weeks,  who 15 basically owns several properties in New York,  New 16 Jersey and Pennsylvania.17 When I decided to move away  from 18 my parents who was in Florida, to New York   in 19 2008 , I thought everything was great.	He made 20 everything sound good.	I signed a lease  and 21 things like that.	When I arrived, the  apartment 22 was nothing but perfect like he showed in   the 23 picture that he had forward e- mail to me.24 When I decided to complain , start 25 complaining about problems that needed to  be 2 
2 fixed, he started threatening to evict me,  illegal 3 evictions.	Where in March this year, he  finally 4 followed through his eviction.	He tried several 5 times to evict me.	Brought me to court and I’ m6 fighting that in the court  system.7 Then I found out that  the 8 apartment where I was residing , he  illegally 9 converted into a dorm.	He turned a basement  into 10 five rooms for college  students.11 So , basically, he also raised the 12 rents on several of us , to students -- that  place 13 is basically supposed to be  college students.	I’ m14 currently attending NYU and I am a part- time – -  I15 work part- time and I’ m a full- time student .16 If you guys –- as a   college 17 student, I ’ m asking you, not only the elderly 18 people , people who are older than me here, one  of 19 the lady that just spoke about the  young 20 generation .	I praise her for that .21 I appreciate that, you  know,22 there is older generation –- the older  generation 23 is actually watching out for us, the  young 24 generation .	As the young generation and the  gap 25 between the young and the old generation, if   you 2 
2 guys increase the rent or allow this  increase 3 taking place, the other generations that’ s coming,4 what are they going to do with this  economy?5 We are all struggling.	And I’ m6 taking student loan up to  my butt.	Please 7 consider, do not do this rent increase .8 Thank you.9 ( Applause. )10 MR . SHOTKIN:	Good evening.11 A little while ago we heard  from 12 Council Member Dan Garodnik.	And more notably ,13 from borough president , Scott M. Stringer.	Why do 14 I like Scott Stringer?	Because Scott Stringer 15 cares about affordable housing for every darn  New 16 Yorker .17 And I also side with  Dr.18 Horowitz’ comments that –- that affordable  housing 19 is important.	And Scott Stringer knows that 20 affordable housing is important and he will  keep 21 on affordable housing on the top of his radar   when 22 he becomes mayor in 2013 .23 And for the record , welcome 24 Chairman Kimmel.	The old Chairman Marvin  Markup 25 Marcus was rich and crude.	We didn’ t like his 2 

2	attitude.3
Good evening.	My name ’ s Matt 
4 Shotkin and I’ m a tenant who lives at 225  East 5 46 th Street here in Manhattan.	I used to live  a6 couple of blocks down at 307 East 44 th Street  but 7 I paid the same minimal rent as I    do now in my new 8 apartment that I did in my old  apartment.9 I detest decontrol .	It has got 10 to go.	It stinks.	Tenants are being taken to  the 11 –- the dry cleaners by  their landlord.	It takes 12 days, even weeks in order to  get repairs.	The 13 amount of rent that you pay shouldn’ t be  affected 14 by this.	Don’ t you guys know that ?15 Please rectify this and please 16 don’ t raise our rent.17 Thanks for your time this 18 evening.19 ( Applause. )20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.21 Is it Alord Allah?	Who will be 22 followed by Owen Hill, to be followed by   Tom 23 Nonnon .24 MR . ALLAH:	Good evening.	My 25 name is Alord Allah.	I’ m from the Lower East 4 
2 Side.	I’ m a member of GOLES.3 This is my son Theodore Allah  and 4 you’ ve heard it all before .	But we’ re going to 5 say, you know, we hope that having heard from   us 6 here, looking at our future becomes just a   bit 7 more weighty on a scale and  balances.8 The Rent Guidelines Board has 9 enjoyed rent increases for the last ten  years.10 The landlords have deregulated some 300 , 000 11 apartments in New York City.	They ’ ve enjoyed a12 big bonus on apartment vacancies and  alleged 13 capital improvement without a loss .14 The proposed recommended 15 Guidelines increases for a one and a  two- year 16 lease is without merit . The landlords have  enjoyed 17 some 5 . 8 percent net operating income throughout 18 the City.	And a 22 . 2 percent increase borough 19 wide.20 We are here today to request  a21 recommended lower Rent Board Guidelines  increase,22 if not a zero percent then at least below   the 23 three percent threshold for both, the one and   the 24 two- year apartment leases, keeping housing 25 affordable for when my child grows up in   ten 2 
2 years, they’ ll be housing affordable for him.3 You have an enormous population 4 of former tenants living in homeless  shelters 5 throughout the five boroughs.	We ask, is this  the 6 answer for affordable housing?7 Do you have something you want  to 8 say?9 MR . THEODORE ALLAH :	I just wish 10 that – -11 MR . ALLAH:	Your first name is 12 Theodore.13 MR . THEODORE ALLAH :	My name is 14 Theodore Allah .	And I just wish that would  all 15 come to an end so when I grow up, I’ d be able   to 16 get a house and housing and a job that ’ s17 affordable for me.18 ( Applause. )19 MR . ALLAH:	Thank you very much.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Theodore,21 thank you for coming.22 Owen Hill.23 ( No response.)24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Is Owen Hill 25 here?	Owen Hill?2 
2 ( No response.)3 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Tom Nonnon.4 MR . NONNON :	Hello.	I’ m Tom 5 Nonnon and I represent my wife , Sandy, and  myself 6 as 30 - year plus residents and tenants in 7 Stuyvesant Town.8 As actors we’ ve continued other 9 work to bridge our salaries that fall short of   our 10 dreams .11 I suggest a zero percent  increase 12 because prior MCIs and other RGB increases  have 13 given exponential profits to landlords far  beyond 14 other businesses here in New York City .15 I’ d like you guys to stop 16 rewarding stupidity.	The sale of Peter  Cooper 17 Village in Stuyvesant Town for $ 5 . 5 billion was 18 not a common sense investment and the  RGB 19 increases should not reward a bad  gamble.20 Additionally, I think there’ s a21 certain amount of corruption built into the  DHCR 22 MCI approval system. This wasn ’ t seen beforehand 23 before you had destabilization because the  owners 24 at that time would spend a solid dollar for   what 25 was being done . But now with MCI destabilizations,2 
 2 what you now have is people spending – - let’ s say 3 they will spend $ 10 , 000 to increase a vacant 4 apartment.	But they’ ll be willing to spend 5 $ 80 , 000 because that $ 80 , 000 can get them into a6 destabilized situation .7 There’ s nothing in the law that 8 says they can’ t do this.	And you guys should  be 9 able to do something about that law  too.10 We should stop rewarding failure 11 to rent apartments .	Stuyvesant Town for the last 12 several years has been leaving apartments  vacant 13 and deciding we’ ll simply rent them when we  feel 14 like doing it.15 There’ s a market for people who 16 want to rent these things but they just don’ t want 17	to pay $ 3 , 500 , $ 4 , 000 , $ 5 , 000 .18 MCIs should not be  forever .	And 19 in terms of what our State Assembly did last   year,20 they voted to approve the Rent Guidelines to   2018 21 and, meanwhile , we ’ re having to talk about rent 22 regulations now.	I’ d like to know what Christ 23 cut?	Certainly not rent regulations.24 That’ s all I have to say.25 Thank you.18 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.3 ( Applause. )4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Eugenia Aledo,5 who will be followed by Doris Rodriguez, who  will 6 be followed by Paul  Schubert.7 MS . ALEDO:	Good evening.8 My name is Eugenia and I’ m  from 9 the organization, RENA , Riverside Edgecomb 10 Neighborhood Association from Washington Heights.11 We work with the low  income 12 community.	Many of these people who are  working 13 are –- just can’ t afford another increase.14 They’ re hanging on by their fingernails.15 Some of them have already  lost 16 their apartment because they’ ve lost their job and 17 have had to take on another job which is   paying 18 them a less salary .19 Now that I saw this little  boy 20 Theodore up here speaking, I’ m recalling that last 21 year we had one particular client who came here   to 22 the RGB with her three children.	Her husband had 23 lost his job.	He got another job but it was  not 24 enough to make ends meet.	They are no longer 25 living in their apartment.	They have lost their 2 

2	apartment.3
We are in a  crisis .	People are 
4 losing their jobs and they ’ re having to make a5 decision between paying their rent and  putting 6 food on the table.	The clients that we see  are 7 really experiencing hardship.8 The Coalition for the  Homeless 9 did a study recently this year which they  stated 10 that we are –- that they’ re having 75 percent  of 11 the people in their shelters are  families.12 They’ re there because of the lack of affordable 13 housing.	Tenants need a bailout.	We need a  rent 14 freeze .15 ( Applause. )16 MS . ALEDO:	And by the way , I,17 too, am unemployed at  the moment.	I am receiving 18 unemployment and it does not cover my  monthly 19 expenses.	This is what we are facing here  and 20 now.	We need a bailout.21 Thank you.22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.23 ( Applause. )24 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Doris 25 Rodriguez.4 
2 MS . RODRIGUEZ:	Yes, sir.3 Good evening, all.4 My name is Doris Rodriguez and  I5 was born and raised in  Washington Heights.	I’ m6 also a member of RENA in the Washington  Heights 7 area.8 I went to RENA specifically for  a9 problem that – - a housing problem that I had  and 10 decided to stay to help out  people there.	Because 11 as I was waiting to be helped, I saw people   coming 12 into the office with issues.	And I just took  it 13 upon myself to help people translate from  Spanish 14 to English , because in my community where I’ m at,15 there’ s many, many immigrants that don ’ t speak our 16 language.17 As I was doing that, I decided  to 18 join RENA to help all the people that are in   need 19 of help there.	And in the short six weeks  that 20 I’ ve been there, I have come across countless  of 21 cases of people of low income and not only   low 22 income , but middle income where they become 23 unemployed .	They’ ve tried getting jobs.	They 24 can’ t get jobs .	They can’ t meet their monthly 25 payment rents.2 
2 And I’ m here today to ask you  to 3 please take into consideration to not either  give 4 an increase or , at least, the most  minimum 5 increase for these landlords.6 Thank you.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 ( Applause. )9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Paul Schubert.10 MR . SCHUBERT:	Good afternoon .11 Mr . Jonathan Kimmel, my name is 12 Paul Schubert.	I’ m known as the Rockaway Tiger.13 I’ m a very active community activist in  my 14 neighborhood, mostly public safety .15 I’ ve been able to in place 15 16 handicapped wheelchair ramps, three traffic 17 lights , two by an elementary school and made  about 18 20 traffic signals longer.19 Now I’ m appealing to you, Mr.20 Kimmel , because you have gray hair like myself .21 I’ m known as the Rockaway Tiger because I  believe 22 I practice –- Al Smith , the governor 1920 , 1912 ,23 1914 , Governor Al –- Assemblyman Al Smith  forced 24 through the Assembly and the Senate in  Albany,25 housing laws to give a man a good place to   rest.2 
2 Now, this warehousing of 3 apartments has to stop .	Al Smith was given one 4 direct order by Silent Charlie Murphy from  Tammany 5 Hall.	The order was quite simple.	Give the 6 people what they want.	Al gave us Workmen ’ s7 Compensation, Child Labor, Housing laws, Women ’ s8 Right to Vote.9 Now I’ m asking that this 10 warehousing of apartments stop and I’ m –- I’ m also 11 asking for us –- also this thing of RSC 2522   that 12 it also be improved.13 And I’ m also asking for criminal 14 penalties for landlords who do illegal  things.15 ( Applause. )16 MR . SCHUBERT:	I’ m not asking –-17 I’ m not asking for fines.	Okay.	I’ m asking for 18 criminal penalties –- community service.	Take 19 away his weekends for a year if he   illegally 20 forces somebody out.	I think that would be  –-21 that would be a good start .22 And I’ m appealing to all my 23 fellow tenants , contact your State Assembly 24 people , your State Senators, your Councilman.25 Silent Charlie Murphy said three things when  you 2 
2 came to him for help, he’ d say yes , I can  do 3 something.	No , but laws can be changed.	And the 4 third thing he would say, I would look into  it .5 And I’ m appealing not at Albany,6 yes, it’ s the last day but we can appeal to  them.7 They’ re going to come back in November .	They’ re 8 going to come back in next January .9 And democracy is not a  speculator 10 sport.	Democracy is a participation of  us 11 e- mailing and sending our elected officials our 12 concerns on a regular basis and nag and nag   and 13 nag.14 Some things have taken me  two 15 years to get done in the Rockaways , some three .16 But I got them done because persistent will   always 17 overcome resistance.	You got to be a  persistent 18 son of a  gun.19 Thank you.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.21 Dixon Kim, who will be  followed 22 by Claire Birmingham, to be followed by  Catherine 23 Walter .24 Mr . Kim is 115 .25 MR . KIM:	Can you hear me ?2 
2 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Yes .3 MR . KIM:	I’ m here representing 4 only myself and my family.	I’ ve been a resident 5 of New York my whole life. I’ m recently  retired.6 I’ m a retired civil servant.	That means that the 7 State government demanded of me that I be a   New 8 York resident the whole lifetime of  my career.	It 9 was the law.10 Now that I ’ m retired, you grant 11 these increases that I ’ m seeing, you’ re telling 12 me , Mr . Kim, your 30 years of service mean 13 nothing.	Take your little 60 percent pension  and 14 get out and take your family with you because   we 15 have a Wall Street broker or four NYU students   who 16 are willing to pay triple your  rent.17 ( Applause. )18 MR . KIM: And if you do that,19 ladies and gentlemen, no disrespect, but I   have 20 two questions for you.	One is , I know the quota 21 in this country is greed  is good.	How much money 22 is enough?23 My second question , again, no 24 disrespect ladies and gentlemen, have you  no 25 shame?2 
2 Thank you very much.3 ( Applause. )4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.5 Claire Birmingham.6 MS . BIRMINGHAM :	Hi.	I’ m Claire 7 Birmingham .	I ’ m a rent stabilized tenant.	I live 8 in the East Village.	I have done so for  about 9 eight years now, been in New York over 20   years.10 You know, I’ m not –- I ’ m sorry ,11 I’ m not a great speaker, but I just can’ t –-  every 12 year it’ s the same thing – - the –- we hear  the 13 story of the landlords they, you know, they  have 14 increases.	It ’ s really hard for them.	If it’ s15 such a hard thing, I mean, if you’ re losing  money,16 why are private equity firms buying up  rent 17 stabilized building?18 ( Applause. )19 MS . BIRMINGHAM :	You know,20 housing isn’ t a designer handbag.	It’ s not a21 European sports car. It’ s not a wide screen TV .22 It ’ s a necessity.	It’ s not –- we’ re not living in 23 these apartments because, you know , it ’ s so nice 24 to have an apartment.	This is where we live,  you 25 know.2 
2 There are luxury apartments,3 people can go live there. But there needs to   be 4 affordable housing and that’ s why I ask for  no 5 rent increase this year.6 Thank you.7 ( Applause. )8 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.9 Catherine Walter.10 MS . WALTER :	Hi.	Good evening.11 My name is Catherine Walter  and 12 I’ ve been living in New York in the East  Village 13 for 18 years.	Born in St. Vincents and raised  in 14 different areas, the Bronx being one of  them.15 My parents moved here from  Boston 16 and Philadelphia because they loved New  York.17 They believed it was a place for opportunity  and 18 they believe that it was a place that   fostered 19 communities.20 Our building was sold to  somebody 21 who doesn’ t live in New York.	They come here 22 periodically and they have now taken possession  of 23 six of our 21 units.	Two of them are being  leased 24 to modeling agencies. We have these models  coming 25 in and out , their friends, they puke in  the 2 

2	hallways.3
The building used to be  100 
4 percent rent regulated tenants .	Now we have one 5 of them is their son who  lives there.	The minute 6 he moved in, he was aggressively – -  aggressively 7 harassing the people who had been living  there 8 their whole lives.	There’ s one person who lived 9 in that building when there was nothing  there.10 There weren’ t even doors.11 The East Village used to be  a12 really bad place to live.	When I lived –-  moved 13 into there , it was a really bad place  to live.	I14 had big dogs for most of the 18 years I’ ve  lived 15 there.	Big dogs, like this big –- because  you 16 needed them.17 Now that the tenants who  stayed 18 there all that time to make it a   nice 19 neighborhood, now we’ re being pushed out because 20 –- like NYU students and models and kids  whose 21 parents are paying the rent are –- are   being 22 preferred over us who helped make  the 23 neighborhoods livable.24 ( Applause. )25 MS . WALTER :	So, you know , how 4 
2 is that fair?	We slugged through the people  like 3 on the steps and throwing up and  junkies 4 everywhere and we lived there and put businesses  –5 I had a five year lease when in that same   building 6 when that landlord bought the building , they 7 bumped the rent up by  50 percent.	So we have to 8 –- we lose our store.	And I said, I have to  keep 9 my rent stabilized apartment and so I had to   let 10 go of the store and just stay in the  apartment .11 It ’ s really unfair .	They’ re 12 coming back every few months to see who else   they 13 can push out of  the building.	And you really have 14 to look into the legalities of what people  are 15 doing to the neighborhoods .	We have landlords who 16 are flaunting our laws and it’ s the onus of  the 17 resident in that unit to find out what the   rent 18 history is .19 Half of these people don’ t even 20 realize they’ re being overcharged by 50 to 75  to 21 100 percent.	They ’ re being overcharged.	They 22 don’ t know it.	They don’ t even know they’ re in a23 rent stabilized building.	How is that –-  why 24 can’ t the City go in reverse investigation  and 25 say, where are the five last rent  stabilized 2 
2 leases that are supposed to be issued to   this 3 unit.	This is totally like –- how is it on   the 4 onus of these people just coming in for six   months 5 to figure out the laws of New York   City?6 Thank you for your  time.7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.8 ( Applause. )9 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Wendy Barrett 10 Flemming.11 ( No response.)12 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Wendy Barrett 13 Flemming?14 ( No response.)15 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Linda Davey .16 MS .

And I just want  to 22 say at this late time of day, I’ ve been  extremely 23 impressed watching your faces while I’ ve sat here.24 No matter who was speaking , every 25 one of you has looked like you were attending,   you 2 
2 were listening and you were diligently trying  to 3 follow up.	And as a citizen of New York City   and 4 a tenant, I really appreciate that and I want   to 5 say thank you.6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.7 ( Applause. )8 MS . DAVEY:	I ’ m a senior citizen 9 and I’ m a resident of Stuyvesant.	And I’ m scared.10 I have a decent job, unlike  some 11 of the people who’ ve spoken here, but I can’ t  work 12 forever.	And next week my rent stabilized -–  my 13 stabilized rent will go to about $ 2 , 500 a month.14 Now I know when you hear  people 15 talk about stabilized rent , they bandy around the 16 figure of $ 300 , $ 400 a month.	There are a lot  of 17 people like me , hard working people who pay $ 2 , 500 18 a month or more and it ’ s going up every single 19 year and every year that I get  older.20 I can’ t afford to buy so I don ’ t21 get the writeoffs like other people in  their 22 taxes.	Like my landlord gets his writeoff in  his 23 taxes.	I have to –- I ’ m a victim to whatever  you 24 people decide I have to pay every year .25 In the 15 years I’ ve lived in 2 
2 Stuyvesant Town, my rent has increased by about  50 3 percent.	How can people pay this?	How does that 4 get accepted every single year that the rents  go 5 up ?6 In Stuyvesant Town there have 7 been some ridiculous MCI increases .	In one case 8 they planted so many trees that it started to   look 9 like a forest.	The landlord made out like  a10 bandit .	The trees died and the landlord got  an 11 MCI increase forever.	It just seems that  somebody 12 isn’ t paying attention to what ’ s going on.13 In another case, my stove in  my 14 apartment was so overheated when it cooked that  it 15 burnt my hand.	The landlord wouldn’ t fix it and I16 was afraid my grandchildren would get burnt, so   I17 agreed to pay for a  new stove.	I pay $ 8 a month.18 In the ten years or so since I ’ ve been paying  for 19 that stove , I’ ve paid almost $ 1 , 000 for a dinky 20 little stove.	How does that happen?21 And I want to say to you  that 22 that $ 8 a month that they’ re making off me every 23 single month and repeated many times  throughout 24 the country –- throughout the City , it is not  even 25 considered in the rent stabilization rent that  I2 

2	pay.3
I’ m not as unfortunate as some 
4 people here, who have spoken here, but I  don’ t5 want to leave New  York City.	I love the vitality.6 I love the diversity.	I love the people.	I want 7 to stay because I love  New York.	And I hope you 8 love New York as much as I do and help people   like 9 me stay in New  York.10 New York is never going to be  the 11 same if it ’ s just for the rich and the  students.12 I know the landlords have to make a   profit .	I13 know they have to make some profit , but they’ re 14 making money or they’ d be out of business.	Please 15 help to remember the tenants like myself  who 16 really do want to stay .17 Thank you very much for 18 listening.19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.20 ( Applause. )21 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Susanne 22 Schropp, to be followed by Richard  Barr.23 MS . SCHROPP:	Good evening,24 members of the board.25 My name is Susanne  Schropp .	I ’ m4 
2 a self - employed graphic designer and I ’ ve lived in 3 the East Village for 21  years.4 I live in a dorm, an  illegal 5 dorm.	And I’ ve testified before you for the past 6 12 years.	You ’ ve seen the development in my 7 building.	We came to you when we were still   all 8 rent stabilized and now the building has been  90 9 percent deregulated.10 The new tenants are students.11 They’ re transient tenants.	They don’ t pay tax and 12 the universities they go to don’ t pay tax  either 13 in the neighborhood.	And in the summer, the 14 landlord rents the units out as summer rentals  to 15 tourists.16 This is typical for the  buildings 17 owned by my landlord.	I think you ’ ve heard of 18 them, they ’ re called the Schmone Family. Every 19 building they own, it’ s the same story .	They are 20 an eviction mill.21 Observing the patterns of  the 22 past ten years , it ’ s become evident that 23 communities are being destroyed because we  just 24 can’ t maintain anything with a transient society.25 And as for me, every year I’ m2 
2 hoping to afford health insurance.	But annual 3 increases in rent, now food and other expenses ,4 everything that’ s basically hinging on higher oil 5 prices , have not allowed me to purchase health 6 insurance yet again this year.7 As rent rises, as my rent  rises,8 it ’ s becoming increasingly difficult to pay the 9 rent because it goes up exponentially as  the 10 amount increase.11 I urge the board this year to  not 12 issue any increases, especially in buildings  where 13 ten percent or more of the units are   destabilized.14 I also urge the board to  not 15 grant any fuel surcharges.16 Thank you.17 ( Applause. )18 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.19 Richard Barr.20 Just before you start, Mr.  Barr,21 I’ d just like to say, Mr. Barr is our  last 22 registered speaker here.23 If there is anybody else in  the 24 room who would like to speak, if you could   move 25 down to the front, we will give you an   opportunity 2 

2	to do so.345
Mr . Barr.MR . BARR:	Thank you .Good evening.	My name is Richard 
6 Barr.	I pay a stabilized rent and I live in   the 7 West 80 ' s in Manhattan .8 And in years past I’ ve suggested 9 that you don’ t approach this issue with a one  size 10 fits all formula.	We only seem to hear from – -11 typically from small landlords who own a few   units 12 and are struggling to make a profit and   maybe 13 their situation has to be taken  into 14 consideration.15 Certainly the large owners who 16 own hundreds or thousands of units and maybe  are 17 making a lot of money, never come here   and 18 testify.	Their representatives or their lobbyists 19 do , perhaps.	And they don ’ t need the same kind of 20 consideration that some of these small owners  who 21 do testify do.22 And –- but it never  happens.23 It ’ s – - you always do it one size fits all .24 Similarly, every year the tenants come  with 25 poignant stories and facts and numbers and  it 6 
2 never seems to matter.	The outcome is always the 3 same.	An initial range that’ s high and it 4 ultimately gets lowered a bit but there’ s  never 5 any talk of less or zero any year, no matter   what 6 the conditions are .7 And I think part of the  problem 8 is the way the board  is appointed.	And the fact 9 that everybody ’ s appointed by a mayor who doesn’ t10 seem to care at all about rent regulations  and 11 affordable rents for people.	It’ s not on his 12 agenda , I think is part of the problem .13 And you only have to look  at 14 what’ s going on now in Albany to realize  that.15 Because we ’ re set with this terrible Ersdat Law 16 which –- which allows the State to have  control 17 over our rent regulations, not the City where  it 18 ought to be.19 So that Republicans in the  State 20 Senate who don ’ t come from New York City are 21 holding cards and this mayor whose financed  all 22 their campaigns, goes up there and goes to the   mat 23 over the – - the marriage equality issue.	And 24 that’ s fine.	But he has leverage over them.	He 25 doesn’ t seem to use any of it to get them to   pass 2 
2 something extending and improving our  tenant 3 protections because it simply doesn’ t matter to 4 him.	He’ s given them so much money he could  have 5 an effect if he wanted to, but he  doesn’ t.6 And so I’ m –- I’ m saying that the 7 way that the Rent Guidelines Board is –-   is 8 appointed, needs to be  changed .	Instead of the 9 mayor holding all the cards, appointments  should 10 be coming from the City Council, from the   borough 11 presidents .	The mayor should only have some – -12 maybe from the Controller, the Public Advocate .13 That, too, would probably require 14 a change in Albany .	Unfortunately , that I imagine 15 is also governed by this horrible  Ersdat Law.	But 16 just as the rent regulations should be under  the 17 control of the City, so too should the   operation 18 and appointments of the Rent Guidelines  Board.19 Thank you.20 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.21 ( Applause. )22 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	As I said, who 23 else would like to  speak?24 If you would please come to  the 25 podium , please state your name and we’ ll ask to 2 
2 try to stay to three  minutes.3 MS . REED:	Thank you, Mr.4 Kimmel .5 Thank you for giving me  this 6 chance .7 My name is Christine Reed.	I was 8 born in Manhattan –-  what 9 THE STENOGRAPHER:	Please spell 10 your last name .11 MS . REED:	R- e- e- d.12 I’ m a registered nurse . I13 graduated from the City Hospital School of  Nursing 14 after working for approximately three years as  a15 student nurse taking care of sick people in  New 16 York City and I worked for about 30 years in   that 17 capacity.18 I’ m now semi retired.	I do 19 volunteer work .20 If it had not been for  stabilized 21 housing, I would not have been able to help   my 22 fellow New Yorkers .23 I worked in Quality Management  at 24 Harlem Hospital.	I worked with the Director  of 25 Psychiatry there. I worked with the Director  of 2 
2 Eye Surgery over in Elmhurst.	I was given credit 3 for raising the standards of  care.4 I’ m not stupid .	But, again, I5 would not have been able to do that if it  wasn ’ t6 for rent stabilized housing.7 While I was living in  rent 8 stabilized housing , I had three gas leaks by  the 9 landlord.	I had jack hammering through  the 10 foundation of my building and my terrace,  which 11 was part of my rent  stabilized apartment.	I was 12 falsely arrested for doing this.	The landlord 13 sicced her dog on me.	I wound up in the  hospital,14 almost lost my life.	I sued for that.15 Then I had other  incidents .	I16 paid almost $ 8 , 000 in key money as a condition of 17 the lease.	I went to DCHR .	All of this is 18 documented . There is a paper trail .	There are 19 witnesses.	The key money issue was decided in  my 20 favor by DHCR.21 I’ m asking you as American 22 citizens, we talk a lot about the  constitution .23 The preamble is, we the people , not we , the 24 corporation.	Then it goes on to say defense,  wars 25 of defense , not offense.	Then the third thing is,2 
2 welfare, which begins with a capital  W .	And 3 welfare, if you look at the definition ,  talks 4 about health care.5 So from my view, we have  a6 constitutional mandate for socialized medicine .7 Going on from there, if you look the  Declaration 8 of Independence it says, we hold these truths  to 9 be self evident.	I’ m asking you to consider the 10 majority, to consider the incredible mess that  our 11 country has gotten into.	The fact that it  was 12 Wall Street derivative speculators that  created 13 this mess, so please don’ t ask us, the  poor 14 working people of this country , to pay  for 15 something that we didn ’ t cause .	Have some pity.16 Have some humanity and let us live .17 Thank you.18 ( Applause. )19 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.20 Next speaker who would like  to 21 speak.22 Again, if you would  identify 23 yourself and maybe spell your last name for  the 24 reporter.25 MS . RUF- MALDONADO:	My name is 2 
2 Elizabeth Ruf- Maldonado.	That ’ s spelled R - u- f , as 3 in flower.	And it ’ s a hyphen and then Maldonado 4 with an M.5 And I’ d like to thank you for 6 giving me the chance  to speak.	I came in this 7 morning and I –- I signed up and I wasn’ t sure   I8 was going to be able to run from work so I   haven’ t9 prepared a very eloquent speech.	But I’ d like to 10 just sort of represent the lifestyle of the  people 11 who live in this community and who are going to   be 12 affected if any anti- tenant regulations are 13 passed .14 So I’ d like to urge you all  to 15 vote for a tenant –- I ’ ve been living in  this 16 neighborhood in the Lower East Side,  Alphabet 17 City, since 1979 and I ’ ve always been in 18 stabilized housing renting .	And just to tell  you 19 a little bit about the kind of lifestyle we   have 20 in this community and what we’ re trying to 21 maintain.22 I am a theater  practitioner,23 professional.	I’ m also a college professor at  a24 college.	I make very little money at my job   but 25 I’ m proud of the work that I  do.2 
2 I work with urban adults,  mostly 3 single mothers .	And I like to work to  in 4 Washington Heights . I can’ t really afford to take 5 the subway and I can’ t really can’ t keep up with 6 my bills at this point very  well.7 So what my family and I do –-   I8 have a daughter who’ s also in the  arts .	She’ s in 9 ballet and we do nothing that is – - because of   a10 profit .	You know, we try to found gardens –-   we 11 have found new gardens .	We’ ve saved the gardens 12 so we’ ve helped beautify the neighborhood.13 We also work with Theater for  the 14 New City and with LaMama at UTC, which are two   of 15 our last community centers that  we have.	I call 16 them community centers because they serve  the 17 community and when we work there, we work   for 18 free.19 I’ m a playwright.	I’ m also an 20 actress and it ’ s not easy to keep this kind of 21 demographic going in our neighborhood.	But I22 think that that’ s what makes this neighborhood 23 great and historic and we really want to try   to 24 maintain that.25 So I want to thank you  for 2 
2 letting me speak today and I just urge you to   keep 3 the tenants in mind.4 Thank you.5 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.6 ( Applause. )7 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Next speaker 8 from the front row .9 MS . HAIGHT :	Good evening .10 My name is Karen with a  K,11 Haight , spelled H- a- i- g- h- t.12 Also, I’ m not prepared but I  just 13 wanted to stand up and be  counted.14 I moved into my East  Village 15 hovel –- it’ s still a hovel.	It’ s like a little 16 water closet type of tub and kitchen place  that 17 I’ ve been not having renovated because I don’ t18 want the rent to  rise.19 In 1979 –- I mean, I love  my 20 hovel.	It ’ s not my hovel.	It ’ s the landlord’ s21 hovel.	The latest landlord probably has  visited 22 the building once.	When he met me the first  time,23 which was really once, actually.	We’ ve met fact 24 to face once.	He said , what’ s a nice lady like 25 you living in a blank hole  like this?	That was 2 

2	my landlord.3
He purchased it, I think,  sight 
4 unseen from the previous owner who was no   better 5 in terms of really caring for the  place.6 Although, to his credit, he lived there for a   bit.7 He did some –- some improvements and, you  know ,8 raised the rent.9 I just want to say that I   have 10 been staying in this apartment for 30  years.11 Every single year thinking , well, I’ ve got to hang 12 onto my apartment.	If I don’ t have an apartment,13 I can’ t stay in New York City.14 I was born in  Tudor City.	I sunk 15 out of that income bracket .	Similar to the 16 previous speaker, I’ ve been working in the 17 non- profit sector my whole life.18 Obviously, I’ m an educated 19 person .	I ’ m a capable person but I choose to  take 20 one of the zillions of jobs that are the type   that 21 are listed on idealist . org and numerous, numerous,22 numerous non- profit jobs that are available here 23 in this City, to people presumably who are able   to 24 live in the City.	I’ d like to continue to work to 25 the day of our die , God willing, I ’ ll have that 4 
2 health because I have no retirement plan  also.3 But I’ d like to continue to be active  anyway.4 And I just want to stand up  here 5 and be counted because hanging onto this  apartment 6 year after year, after noise polluted year ,  after 7 bar downstairs year, after leaks and  horrible 8 things going on, it’ s been because it’ s –- it’ s –-9 I felt it’ s been my right. I feel like it’ s  my 10 investment .	This is my investment of  my life.	My 11 lifetime.12 I’ m not going to get anything out 13 of it except for more time to live there but   with 14 a law like this, if it gets passed , or whatever  it 15 –- I’ m not sure what the technical term is  of 16 what’ s going on right now, but if the rates  get 17 raised too much, then my investment is for   naught.18 And the promise that I sort of like bought   into 19 when I took the apartment  is broken.	So I stand 20 with everybody here in asking, begging , pleading 21 you guys, to please bear in  mind this.	Please .22 Thank you.23 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.24 Yes, our next speaker.25 MS . HAL:	Hi.	My name is Susan 2 

2	Hal.345	last name.67
It must feel wonderful –-THE STENOGRAPHER:	Spell your MS . HAL:	Spelled H- a - l.It must feel wonderful to  have 
8 the fate of millions of people in your  hands.9 People coming one after another begging you not  to 10 raise the rent .11 I ain’ t gonna beg you for 12 nothing.	I’ m here to tell you , you are forcing 13 the people of this country , this State and  this 14 City, to eat the  rich.15 ( Applause. )16 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.17 Are there any other speakers – -18 is there anybody else in the room who would   like 19 to speak?20 Sir, please come down.21 MR . RUOPP:	Good evening.22 My name is Howard James  Ruopp.23 THE STENOGRAPHER:	Spell your 24 last name.25 MR . RUOPP:	R - u- o - p- p .8 
2 My name is Howard James  Ruopp.3 And at the end of this month after 47 years   of 4 serving the impoverished ill as a  government 5 employee, medical care administrator,  hospital 6 administrator, I am going to enter into the   land 7 of having a fixed  income.8 Uncle Christy, out there in  New 9 Jersey is not giving us a cost of living   allowance 10 that is going to  increase.11 In the meantime, the rent  is 12 constantly going up.13 Uncle Bloomberg has completely 14 disemboweled a working transportation system  in 15 this City and during this harsh winter of   our 16 discontent , in Stuyvesant Town , I was completely 17 without heat.	So that any type of a thought or   a18 talk about putting in a surcharge to pay for   the 19 heat we didn’ t get it, is nothing less  than 20 outrageous .21 I am beyond the point of  making 22 any kind of appeal .	I am speaking in the name  of 23 reason .	Many people such as myself not only  have 24 contributed to the infrastructure, the 25 impoverished structure , the public health, but we 2 
2 are the ones who stay here because we make   the 3 most of every single resource in this  rich 4 environment.5 I’ m constantly going to the 6 opera, the theater , the Museum of Modern  Art.7 And, most of all, the New York Public   Library.8 Seeing our senior citizen service centers  being 9 almost abolished is absolutely less  than 10 nauseating .11 I, therefore, urge you to  act 12 with respect for us, the ones who have made   a13 contribution and will continue to do so even  if 14 the contribution at this point of our  retirement 15 is that we sit back and appreciate everything  to 16which we’ re entitled.17I thank you so  much.18( Applause. )19CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.20Another speaker.21Please take the podium .22MS . KLUGHERZ:	Hi .	My name is 23Alice Klugherz .24That’ s K- l - u- g - h- e - r- z .25I have lived here for 35 years .
2 And one of the things that really pisses me off   is 3 that students and artists can no longer come  to 4 this town.5 So beautiful buildings , like the 6 one on The Bowery, where tour buses stopped  to 7 look at, has been torn down so I feel like   there 8 is really no thought in these kind of things   and 9 that it’ s deteriorating what people come to New 10 York for.11 If you make it so that  artists 12 can’ t live here, you really destroy this City 13 completely .	We are notorious for coming  into 14 neighborhoods fixing them up and then  landlords 15 coming in and, basically, slowly booting us  out,16 as they have done in Soho and  Tribeca.17 ( Applause. )18 MS . KLUGHERZ:	And, you know,19 it ’ s at the point now there’ s like a high rise on 20 Fourth Street.	I’ m not sure why these people want 21 to live in a building like that but what I  don ’ t22 like, the bottom line, whatever my opinions  are 23 about these things , is that you need to make it  so 24 that students can come here and live here and   that 25 the people who are artists who have really  slowly 2 
2 built themselves up working for nothing can  still 3 live here.4 Thank you.5 ( Applause. )6 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	Thank you.7 Last call, is there anyone  else 8 in the room.9 Yes, please step down.10 Please state your name .11 MS . KUHN:	Good evening.12 My name is Karin Kuhn, K- u - h- n .13 I’ m not very good at this.	But I14 was really upset as I was listening to one of   the 15 speakers speak today about the people  that 16 shouldn’ t have these apartments because they – -17 they had different jobs that they were fired  from 18 and things like that.19 Well, I lived in a  rent 20 stabilized apartment and I don ’ t know if anybody’ s21 paying attention to what the economy’ s doing out 22 there, but I work in the service industry and   you 23 know what, sometimes you’ re at jobs for three  or 24 four months looking.	I’ m not young.	They want 25 the young.	The want the young to be  bartenders 2 
2 and waitresses and it’ s difficult.3 And there’ s times where it ’ s not 4 because we ’ re lazy .	It’ s because the small 5 restaurant goes under. They can’ t afford to make 6 their bills.	We lose our jobs and now it’ s  hard 7 to find a job  and compete.	And let me tell you,8 those kids are coming out of college, they ’ re 9 screaming the same thing.	They can’ t find jobs 10 either .11 But I have to support myself  and 12 I have to pay  my rent.	So I have to go for  those 13 jobs and I go and I look and I go for ten –- I14 mean right now , fortunately, thank God , I have a15 job.	But I will go for days at a time and   weeks 16 at a time and months at a time where I have    not 17 had a job.	And thank God I was able to keep   a18 little nest egg because I had this rent   stabilized 19 to carry me long enough that I could actually   get 20 myself back into the swing of  things.21 If I didn’ t have that, I’ d been 22 out a long , long time ago.	And these people that 23 have come today, please take a look at   them 24 because they’ re the ones that took a  neighborhood 25 that nobody –- none of these landlords would  have 2 

2	looked at once .3
When I was here like 25  years 
4 ago, they were looking at this place – - I used   to 5 have to go –- have the grocery store man watch   me 6 walk down the street so I wasn ’ t attacked because 7 there were druggies and the crime was  outrageous.8 And they wouldn’ t have come near it, and they’ ve 9 –- we were the ones that stuck it out, risked   our 10 lives sometimes and you heard of horrible  things 11 that happened to people and you saw people  robbed 12 and mugged .	And we were the ones that  invested 13 our lives into this to make the  communities 14 better .15 And now somebody else wants  to 16 profit .	And I don ’ t mind people profiting , but 17 you want to take away what we worked so hard   in 18 these areas that were so crime ridden to try   to 19 make it decent .	We couldn ’ t afford anything more 20 so we made the best of what we had and we    made 21 them better.	And now people want to throw us  out 22 after we did the work by the community  getting 23 together and making it better.	And now they want 24 to force us out.	Is that fair ?	It was our work 25 and our love and our loyalty to our community   that 4 

2	made it nice.3
And I find it -– I just find   that 
4 offensive that somebody should say that if we’ re 5 out of work periodically that –- and let’ s do  a6 reality, if you don’ t have people to serve or be  a7 bartender, your waitress, or clean your clothes  –-8 what are we gonna commute from like another  state 9 because we can ’ t afford to live in New York.10 Obviously, we’ re not going to do that.	That’ s11 insane .12 We need a place in New York  where 13 we can work, be near  our work.	If you look at  any 14 major –- at any place where there’ s very  rich 15 people , there’ s always a working class 16 neighborhood nearby because they have to get  to 17 work.	And they’ re the ones that are serving the 18 rich.	Now who ’ s going to serve the rich if we get 19 –- if we’ re all moved out.	You’ re certainly not 20 going to get another rich man to sit there   and 21 clean your dirty underwear .22 I mean , forgive me , but this is 23 true.	Maybe I ’ m being a little sarcastic and I24 apologize.	And I guess I don’ t have much more  to 25 say.	I thinking I ’ m making the point.4 
2 I’ m really sorry because I didn’ t3 have anything prepared .4 CHAIRMAN KIMMEL:	That’ s okay .5 MS . KUHN:	I’ m just getting 6 really upset as I was listening to this man   say 7 that we –- because there are periods where  we 8 don’ t have work and it ’ s a lot of times it ’ s not 9 due to our fault.	It’ s because the economy’ s10 putting a lot of these businesses, whether  it’ s11 service or small businesses –- shirt – - the  kid 12 that sells you the shirt, the man that sells   you 13 an ice cream cone.	It ’ s small businesses and 14 we ’ re holding on for dear life .	It’ s a bad 15 economy and when these stores go under , we  go 16 under and we’ re all unemployed and you can ’ t blame 17 us for that.18 But you can help us by letting  us 19 hang onto what little we have on these places   and,20 like I said, we took something that nobody  else 21 wanted and we made it  good .
