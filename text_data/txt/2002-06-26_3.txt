2	Our mail is irregular. We  never3 know when we get our phone  calls.4 There' s always - - everything5 just goes wrong.6	And there is so much noise  I7 couldn' t believe it. Things were falling off the8 walls, and there' s noise above you, below you.9	It was more	people raise a10 whole building in the amount of time they took  to11 renovate. And  they' re much nicer now, but  it ' s12 still kind of difficult.13 And you're so used to so  much14 harassment , you just can't relax there. I mean15 you're in just a constant state of  anxiety16 wondering what are they going to do next.  You17 know, they're always after  you.18 And personally I would like  to19 move out but it 's so expensive now. I never20 thought the rents would be this expensive to  any21 kind of affordable housing. I mean it 's just22 you can't find anything  under  like $2000 and  it ' s23 so t iny you can' t do anything.24 I mean you can't even move25 around. They are like tiny, t iny rooms and it 's10 
2 just - - we need more affordabl e  housing.3 And I just don't think it 's fair4 that they raise the rents. They' re making a5 tremendous amount of money, hand over foot .6 I mean - - I don't know what  else7 to say.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 (Audience participation .)10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma' am, there11 is a question for you.12 MS. HOLDER:	I just wanted to13 ask you - -  thank you so much  for your  testimony.14 I appreciate it.15 What kind of services are16 provided for you in your  building?17 MS. KATHLEEN LYONS:	None . I18 mean  - - what kind of services? Well , they're19 supposed  - -  they always have  someone at the desk20 who doesn' t really speak English so you don' t21 always get your phone calls.22 You are supposed to23 originally we had like linens, sheet  service,24 but , I don' t know. I prefer to use my  own.25 And then mail , they have to sort2 
2 your mail. They always lose mail all the time.  I3 mean people have lost bank notices,  everything,4 important  mail .5 I've had mail sent back to my6 brother saying deceased, not living  there7 anymore, you know. It 's just unbelievable.8 It 's very hard if you are trying9 to get a job and you're not getting your mail ,10 you know, if you' re freelancing or whatever. You11 just have no  - -  and they know everything  that you12 do. They know when you come in, when you go  out .13 It ' s very, very difficult. A lot14 of people in my building went out the window  and15 it was very, very scary.16 MS. HOLDER:	And what percentage17 of your units in your building have  permanent18 occupants in them?19 MS. KATHLEEN LYONS:	Well , out20 of 180 that  - - well , there are eight floors.21 There' s about twenty  - -  forty rooms on each side.22 Well , there are only  fifty23 people left out of the 180 tenants that  remained.24 And there should be more but people really  like25 to move out.2 
2 I mean it ' s much, much nicer3 now. It 's - - I mean my landlord' s greedy and  they4 wanted to have a TV show in there and  kept5 offering him more and more money. He wouldn' t6 take it because he didn't want them to come  in7 and see the inside of the place .8 So I mean that 's how bad it was .9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Rivera10 has a question.11 MR . RIVERA:	Yes.12 Can you tell me where this13 building is located?14 MS. KATHLEEN LYONS:	That ' s a15 problem . It 's in a very nice area . It 's on the16 Upper West Side. It 's 350 88th Street and it 's17 between Riverside and West End. So it 's a very18 desirable neighborhood, you know.19 And that 's it.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you21 very much.22 MS. KATHLEEN LYONS:	Thank you.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We appreciate24 it .25 (Audience participation.)10

ADAM WEINSTEIN:	Good14 evening, Chairman Markus and Members of the  Rent15 Guidelines Board .16 I want to begin just by thanking17 all of you for serving on the Rent  Guidelines18 Board . I know that 's something that doesn' t19 happen here all that often .20 And I know that the job is not21 remunerative .2 2	MR . CASTELLANO:	We do it for23 the money .24 (Audience participation .)25 MR . ADAM WEINSTEIN:	I also know23 
2 that if it ' s done right , it 's a job that 's very3 time consuming. And I also know that you're in  a4 position that doesn' t always make you the most5 comfortable .6 And as a real proponent of7 public service, I do want to thank you all  for8 serving on this Board and for engaging in  this9 process.10 That being said, I hope that11 from the testimony that you've heard this  morning12 from the Class A hotels, from the Class B  hotels,13 from the SRO tenants and from the rooming  house14 tenants, and I hope that when you review  the15 record that is before you, and I think that  it's16 a pretty substantial record, that you will  come17 out and determine that for all classes of hotel ,18 SRO and rooming house housing that there  should19 be no increase this year.20 I think that ' s right given the21 numbers that we've seen this year. I think that 's22 right given the populat ion that is living in23 these buildings. And I think that that is  the24 right  decision  for you folks to actually  - - to25 make a difference in preserving af fordable2 
2 housing in New York City.3 It may seem like a very small4 difference, the difference between zero  percent5 and two percent . But for a lot of peopl e here6 it 's a very large difference.7	And the ability to stay in  an8 SRO unit , in a hotel unit , in a rooming  house9 unit , the difference  can be  this two percent .10 So I hope that you will make  a11 difference in affordable housing. I hope you  will12 vote for a zero percent across the  board.13 Thank you very much for  your14 time.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	What 's your16 connection to this issue?17 MR. ADAM WEINSTEIN:	I'm the18 Project Director of the West Side SRO  Law19 Project. I 'm  sorry if I didn' t identify myself .20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I wasn' t21 aware of that. Thank you.22 COUNCILMEMBER  GALE BREWER:23 Thank you very much. Good evening. And we' re24 delighted that the West Side SRO Law Project  is25 fully funded in the budget. So they' ll be around.8 
2 (Audience participat ion. )3 COUNCILMEMBER GALE BREWER :	I'm4 Gale Brewer and I am the City  Councilmember5 representing the District on the West Side  from6 55th to 96th Street. And thank you for  allowing7 me to speak now.8 (Audience participation.)9 COUNCILMEMBER  GALE BREWER:10 District #6 has the largest number of  rent11 regulated tenants of any Council District in  the12 City. It 's got 59,851 rent regulated.13 And I'm here today to  strongly14 urge the Rent Guidelines Board to make sure  that15 landlords of rent stabilized apartments do  not16 raise the rents . I urge you to roll back rents.17 (Audience participation .)18 COUNCILMEMBER GALE BREWER:	And19 to follow up on Mr. Weinstein,  zero percent.20 (Audience participation. )21 COUNCILMEMBER GALE BREWER:	I do22 spend a lot of time going in and out some of  the23 residential hotels.24 Connie Yen	(phonetic) is here25 today to give you the example of her  building4 
2 which is, along with what Ms . Holder said or3 asked about , is primarily empty. There' s a real4 shame because  - - if we look at the  many5 opportunities for affordable housing in  a6 residential hotel like that .7 But increasing rents will8 further  - - cause further suffering for those   who9 have already borne the brunt of some of  the10 economic  downturn challenges.11	Landlords' incomes have reached12 a peak, and the most current census data  shows13 that the inflation adjusted household incomes  of14 rent stabilized tenants fell by one- half percent 15	from 1995 to 1998 .16 In 1999, the average rent17 stabilized tenant paid thirty percent of his  or18 her income for rent compared to only twenty- two19 percent in 1970.20 Tenants covered under rent21 stabilizat ion have been hurt by job losses and22 they're obviously getter older - we' re all23 getting older - and have high medical  costs.24 At this time rent  increases25 would be a particular hardship for tenants  in16 
2 Single Room Occupancy buildings  and residential3 hotels.4 I would like to continue  the5 policy of  - - or support the policy of a   zero6 percent increase particularly	for the Single Room7 Occupancy because that 's the portion that we' re8 talking about right now, but in  general.9 And my district has probably  the10 largest numbers of rent regulated in general , but11 the second largest stock of Single Room  Occupancy12 buildings and hotels. I'm in and out of  those13 buildings all the time.14 I just want  to conclude  - there15 is a longer piece here going over some of  the16 numbers that you know only too well - but  rent17 stabilization impacts an estimat ed 2.75 million18 tenants, a number that continues to increase   in19 some cases because we are unfortunately  opting20 out of Mitchell - Lama. We' ll have more challenges21 there. They never end.22 And your decision today  is23 critical for all New Yorkers who rely  on24 affordable housing from now and into the  future .25 Thank you very much.2 
2 I'll look forward to working3 with you.4 (Audience participation.)5	MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Marti6 Weithman, followed by Edward Gutowski,  Doris7 Charpentier .8	MS. MARTI WEITHMAN:	Good9	evening, Chairman and Members of the  Board.10 My name is Marti Weithman  and11 I'm a staff attorney with the East Side SRO  Law12 Project of MFY Legal Services .13 And I'm here to urge the  Board14 to vote for a zero percent increase for SROs  this15 year .16 Can you hear me?17 Rent stabilized SROs are unique18 in the rent stabilization scheme. First , as set19 forth in the Rent Stabilization Law,  in20 establishing a fair rental increase for  hotels,21 the Board must consider, quote, conditions in  the22 market for hotel accommodations and the  economics23 of hotel real estate, end  quote.24 This means that the Board  is25 specif ically mandated to consider the prof its and10 
2 the transient occupancy rate in determining  the3 guideline adjustment , if any.4	Second , unlike  other owners,5 hotel owners are permitted to profit from  non-6 rent stabilized , in this case transient guests at7 whatever rate they choose.8	Only permanent tenants, those9 who have leases, those who have been in the  same10 SRO for six months and those who have  requested11 leases, are protected by rent  stabilization.12 SRO owners continue to make  new13 and very lucrat ive uses from their properties14 whil e housing an ever- shrinking number of15 permanent  rent stabilized tenants.16 For several decades now hotel17 owners have been removing thousands of units  from18 the reach of low- income SRO tenants by using19 rooms for special needs and  transitional20 populations with enhanced funding streams  and21 renting only to transients paying market  rates.22 According to your 2002  PIOC23 report , hotel and SRO owners' expenses decreased24 over the past year by 1.5 percent allowing  their25 profits to increase even more. This must  be9 
2 considered when determining what , if any, rent3 increase should be granted for hotel owners  and4 voting to continue the proviso .5	In contrast to hotel owners,  SRO6 tenants are generally on fixed incomes  or7 struggle at subsistence level jobs,  including8 waiters, vendors and messengers. And  rent9 increases will result in major  financial10 hardships for them, or homelessness for  many.11 Many SRO tenants are workers  at12 the lowest end of the economic spectrum and  they13 were some of the hardest hit by 9/11 and  they14 have been some of the slowest to  recover.15 Weighing these factors, the16 Board should conclude that no rent  increases17 should be granted to owners of SRO hot els.18 Additionally,  the Board should19 protect the dwindling number of tenants who  rely20 on this source of housing. For exampl e, at the21 lodging houses on the Bowery, the legal  regulated22 rents range from $252 to $274 per month. And  this23 amount exceeds the public assistance  shelter24 allowance of $215 per month.25 In the event of an increase,  I6 
2 would like to urge the Board to continue  the3 proviso which provides that only an increase  be4 granted to landlords who rent seventy percent  or5 more to permanent	tenants.6 I just urge the Board to vote  a7 zero percent increase.8 Thank you.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.10 (Audience participation. )11 MR. McLAUGHLIN:	Edward12 Gutowski, and then Doris  Charpentier.13 Is Edward here?14 MR. EDWARD GUTOWSKI:	Here.15 My name is Edward Gutkowski.  I'm16 a resident - -17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Raise the18 mike up.19 MR. EDWARD GUTKOWSKI:	My name20 is Edward Gutkowski. I'm a resident of the  Anchor21 Hotel for thirteen years.22 A VOICE:	Speak up.23 MR. EDWARD GUTKOWSKI:	I'm not24 used to this.25 I don't think that the landlords10 
2 should get a rent increase because they  painted3 the walls only half way. They put  stalls  - -  on4 the bathroom stalls they put doors only half  way.5 We have something we've  had6 never before. That 's rats. We have rats now. We7 never had that before .8	I'm a sick man. I had  triple9	bypass, valve. I always have to go to the  doctor.10 And we have no cooking11 facilities . Food is very expensive in the12 restaurants . We have to eat in restaurants.13 And that 's all I have to say.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 How long did you say you lived16 there, sir?17 MR.

And then the final hotel tenant  we21 
2 have is Dan Golub.3 If there are any more hotel4 tenants, please go register at the  desk.5	MS. DORIS CHARPENTIER:	Good6 evening.7 My name is Doris Charpent ier and8 I live in a Class A Single Room  Occupancy9 residential10 A VOICE:	Use the mike.11	MS. DORIS CHARPENTIER:	Hi . I'm12 sorry.13 My name is Doris Charpentier.  I14 live in a Class A Single Room  Occupancy15 residential hotel that was formally a woman' s16 residential hotel building, Simmons House, in  the17 Upper West Side.18 Before I moved in, they  went19 through a lot of trouble with doing  renovations20 without a permit , gett ing stop work orders,21 violating  stop work orders, being sued by the22 City for running a tourist hotel when it 's23 illegal both because it 's a Class A and it 's in a24 R - 8 zoning.25 For those who don' t know, a12 
2 Class A means permanent tenants only, which  means3 you cannot rent to anyone for less than one week .4 To this very day they are still renting by  the5 night .6 In addition, I moved in almost7 two years ago. I just realized that  recently.8 They lied to me for six months and stole my  money9 for six months telling me that I could not have  a10 rent stabilized rate, that they weren' t running11 that anymore, that they were allowed to charge  a12 tourist rate and charging me the obscene rate  of13 $125 a day and $500 a week .14 Once I found out that it was,  in15 fact , covered, I asked for a lease for the sixth16 time , each time - - the first time in  writing.17 They immediately stopped accepting rent from  me,18 manufactured	non- payment and sued me. They spent19 over $10,000, forty hours at least , to a senior20 law partner suing me for  non-payment.21 Immediately after the non-22 payment ended, they started suing me in  a23 holdover . They invented a reason, not sanctioned24 by the Rent Stabilization Code or by any  other25 law in this State . And they lost that one too.2 
2 And guess what? I just found  out3 they lost it today. They're starting another  one.4 They have refused to accept payment from me  for5 four months because they are not allowed  to6 during a holdover. So now they are going to  start7 another non- payment.8 These people do not provide  the9 services that they are required to provide.  They10 do not  - - they are supposed to have a  twenty-11 four hour man at the front desk. Several  nights12 when I was not sleeping I walked by the  front13 desk, there was no one there. The front door  is14 wide open. Anybody could walk in from the  street15 anytime.16 Sure they have seven  cameras.17 But who cares? By the time the damage is  done,18 all you could do is go to a videotape. You  can't19 prevent crime if there' s nobody at the front20 desk.21 They do not deliver my mail.  I22 don't get my important mail there. I rent a  box23 because I can't trust these  people.24 I urge you to vote for a  zero25 rent increase for all of these  classifications.2 
1	4192 There is just - - I - - you know, like in  the3 Bible, if you could find one righteous hotel  SRO4 landlord, give him the increase. The rest  of5 them? Forget about it.6 (Audience participation.)7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ma' am, what8	is your address?9	MS . DORIS CHARPENTIER:	I 'm10	sorry. I didn't hear you.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	The address?12 MS. DORIS CHARPENTIER:	It 's 35013 West 58th Street on the Upper West Side,  Simmons14 House is what it used to be called. Now they  are15 known as Hotel Riverside and Riverside  Terrace.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank17 you .18 MS. VISSER:	Our last19 registered speaker in the hotel session is  Dan20 Golub . If there is anyone else who wants to21 speak, please come up to the  desk.22 A VOICE:	Dan what?23 MS. VISSER :	Dan Golub.24 MR . DAN GOLUB:	Hi! My name is25 Dan Golub . I 'm from Assemblymember Richard12 
2 Gottfried' s of fice. He' s in Albany today for the3 session but wanted me to deliver his testimony  on4 SRO increases as well as the other  increases.5	The SRO rent increase in6 unsupportable. As anyone who has witnessed  the7 conditions of most SRO housing knows, it  is8 housing of last resort. For a person with a  low9 income, even a two percent increase could  mean10 the difference between being on the street  or11 being in one' s own room.12 The Board should not approve  any13 SRO rent increase at all in order to  protect14 vulnerable housing for those who need it most  and15 who can least afford to pay  more.16 For many years, the Board has17 increased rents out of context with landlord' s18 costs. This year' s proposals are a particularly19 blatant example of this pattern because the  Board20 has proposed rent increases despit e the fact that21 the Price Index indicates that  landlords'22 operating costs decreased last  year.23 These proposals are unjust ified24 and would make life harder for all New Yorkers.  I25 urge that the Board reject  them.6 
2 For the past two years, the  RGB3 justified its high, permanent	increase in rents4 by citing the unusual , temporary surge in the5 price of heating oil. But in previous years  the6 Board authorized rent increases in spite of  the7 fact that the cost did not rise at  all.8	And this year the Board  is9 proposing	increases. This pattern def ies logic10 and invites the conclusion that the Board  seeks11 to raise rents regardless of any  justification.12 The Board should be lowering rents this year  or13 at least enacting a rent  freeze.14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. DAN GOLUB:	I do commend the16 Board for not proposing any version of the  poor17 tax. The proposal would target the  same18 vulnerable New Yorkers who had been hit  every19 year since 1994. Any surcharge on these  tenants20 would be regressive, unjust and mean  spirited.21 We should be seeking ways  to22 help the neediest residents of our City get  by23 rather than seeking to discriminate against  them.24 It is long past time to eliminate any  discussion25 of a surcharge that punishes poor people  for9 
2 being poor.3 (Audience participation. )4	MR . DAN GOLUB:	Before you5 approve these increases, please think about  what6 it means to take even a few dollars from a  poor7 family, especially  for children.8 It makes it harder for a parent9 or a grandparent	- and many low- income  tenants10 are elderly - to buy a child a book. Maybe  the11 one that didn' t get bought would have been the12 one that would have inspired the child. Maybe  it13 would have paid for cough medicine or  co-payment14 on a prescription.15 That 's reality. Low- income16 families don' t have money to spare. When you take17 money out of their pockets, you make their  lives18 and the lives of their children harder  and19 shorter.20 This Board' s historic reluctance21 to fairly administer the rent laws that  were22 enacted to ensure the affordability of housing  in23 this City underscores the need for reforming  the24 Board so that citizens with experience in  public25 service, nonprof it work or housing can serve as5 
2 public members.3 I hope that Mayor Bloomberg  and4 the City Council will consider legislat ion to5 provide much- needed reform of the Rent Guidelines6 Board.7 (Audience participation. )8	MR. DAN GOLUB:	Once again, I9	urge the Board to lower rents or at least enact  a10rentfreeze andvote against these unjustified11rentincreases.12Thank you.13(Audience participat ion .)14MS.

2 Senator Liz Krueger.3 (Audience part icipation.)4	SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:	Good5	evening.6	It 's nice to see all of you7 gentlemen again and I am particularly glad to  see8 a woman on the panel.9 (Audience participation.)10 SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:	I've11 testified here before. This is my first  time12 testifying before you as an elected off icial.13 Thank you for giving me the time tonight.  I14 appreciate it.15 Middle age has hit also. I  need16 the reading glasses.17 As was mentioned, my name is  Liz18 Krueger. I'm the State Senator for the  26th19 Senate District in the East Side of  Manhattan.20 I am here today to encourage21 you, the Board, to enact a rent rollback   - -22 (Audience part icipation.)23 SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER : - - that is24 consistent with the findings of your own  staff.25 As you know, the operating  costs7 
2 for rent stabilized apartment buildings  decreased3 this year, and any increase in rent  would4 constitute a disregard for your own  findings,5 formulas and precedent.6 It 's also a fact that almost7 every other study that has been done on  the8 rental market in New York City over the  last9 year- and- a - half has shown, whether regulated or10 not , that the rents have been decreasing by11 between five and twenty percent. So it would  be12 inconsistent with the patterns of the market  to13 see an increase in rent.14 (Audience participation.)15 SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:	For the16 many who have already stayed and many more  who17 want to testify, I'm just going to try to  bullet18 point some of my concerns, and the testimony  that19 we've shared with you is also in bull et point20 format.21 Free market conditions and  the22 rules of supply and demand do not apply to  the23 New York City rental market as we have seen  now24 since 1969 when the RGB was established to  set25 rent guidelines and counteract the effect of  an2 
2 acute housing shortage.3 Unfortunately,  the shortage4 still  exists. According to the	' 99 Housing and5 Vacancy Survey the vacancy rate is 3.19  percent.6 As you well know, a vacancy rate of less  than7 five percent creates abnormal market  conditions.8 The RGB' s mission is to construct or simulate9 normal or fair rental levels in a market  driven10 by chronic scarcity and  instability.11 Landlords, in fact , overall12 appreciate the fact that we have a  housing13 shortage. It 's good for business.14 However, unfortunately, it 's bad15 public policy and bad for the non- housing16 business and the tenants and the people who  need17 to afford housing in our City in a t ime of18 scarcity.19 In my bullet points I highlight20 what the mission of the New York State  Rent21 Guidelines Board is within the context of  the22 State Rent Stabilization Law. I'm not going  to23 read it tonight because I know all of you  are24 familiar with what your mandate  is.25 Why a rollback this year?2 
2 Your own study shows that the3 Price Index of Operating Costs decreased by  1.64 percent. It represents the first drop in  the5 history of the survey since 1969 when you  were6 founded.7 Among the reasons for this  drop8 are that the cost of fuel oil decreased  by9 thirty- six percent this year and the cost of10 ut ilities dropped by 9.9 percent.11 While landlords often  emphasize12 that their insurance costs and taxes  increased13 quite significantly over the past year, the  PIOC14 study takes these factors into account and  the15 PIOC study still decreased.16 Landlords also argued that  costs17 are likely to increase in the next calendar  year.18 They may, they may not. But the  established19 precedent of the Rent Guidelines Board is to  use20 the previous year's operating cost data. Even  if21 costs do rise next year, they can be  addressed22 next year by the RGB.23 The RGB has historically used  a24 formula known as the commensurate rent  adjustment25 to help determine annual guidelines. The formula ,2 
2 and all of its variations that have been used  by3 you, indicate that either a rent rollback or  a4 rent freeze is warrant ed this year.5 (Audience participation. )6 SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:7 Increasing rents would be a radical  departure8 from methodological	precedent that would  conflict9 with your Board' s own findings.10 Landlords,  in fact , have11 additional methods of increasing rents to  account12 for costs, such as use of MCis,  vacancy13 decontrol , hardship increases and apartment14 improvements. In fact , in my district on the East15 Side of Manhattan I can say with confidence  that16 landlords have used these options quite  liberally17 in the last few years.18 (Audience participation.)19 SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:	If a rent20 rollback, or at least a freeze, is  not21 implemented this year after September 11th,  when22 the RGB' s own research indicates a rollback is23 called for, and in the midst of a recession,  then24 when might you ever imagine not doing an  annual25 increase in rent?2 
1	4292 (Audience participation.)3 SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:	Does the4 RGB want to indicate to landlords that they  are5 guaranteed increases of at least two and  four6 percent regardless of the relevant  data,7 regardless of the fact that in the  overall8 housing market we are seeing decreases in  the9 rent costs?10 There are much larger11 implications for all of us, as I think all of  you12 on this Panel know.13 New York City is in the midst  of14 an economic recession which began  before15 September 11th. New York State has the  highest16 number of unemployed people of any state in  the17 country with the highest rate in the State  right18 here in New York City.19 The correlation of RGB  increases20 to loss of affordable housing through  factors21 such as the loss of units in rent  stabilization22 can no longer be ignored. The loss of  affordable23 housing has contributed to a negative impact  both24 for the poorest New Yorkers and on the  growing25 population in our homeless shelters. But  it 's4 
1	4302 also had a very serious impact on the  middle3 class.4 And while many of you know  me5 from the years I came and testified primarily  as6 an expert witness on behalf of lowest income  New7 Yorkers, I can tell you now as a State  Senator8 serving a district that includes middle  class9 people as well as elderly and disabled people  on10 fixed income and low- income people, that the11impact ofthe RGB is felt by everyone in  rent12regulatedhousing and in the entire  housing13market.14	In fact , when I ran for office,15I was toldthat it would be ridiculous for me  to16talk abouthousing issues as a concern for  my17district.18I can tell you now after four19 mont hs in office that housing problems,20 specif ically housing problems from tenants in21 rent regulated housing, is the number  one22 constituent	issue brought to my attention.23 (Audience participation.)24 SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:	The fact25 is unless we address the affordable  housing19 
1	4312 crisis of our City  - and I do recognize ,  and3 we've debat ed this in previous years, that the4 RGB' s mission is not to solve the problem of5 affordabl e housing per se, it has a specific6 mission to deal with the issue for rent  regulated7 housing - the fact is that unless we all  work8 together to address the problems of  affordability9 in housing for middle income as well as  low10 income and elderly and disabled New Yorkers,  we11 will never find ourselves in a position where  we12 are not going  - - getting worse  each year and13 finding ourselves in a bigger probl em for the14 people of New York.15 You have a significant16 contribution that you can play in addition to  the17 role that you're playing tonight where I hope  you18 will make the decision to freeze or roll back  the19 rents.20 You've made significant21 contributions in the past to the  public22 understanding of housing issues . And I want to23 compliment you and your staff . You come up with24 some of the best reports on housing data in  the25 State .2 
1	4322 When I've tried to get3 information from the DHCR, a State agency,  they4 keep referring me back to you for the  data.5	But you can play a more6 important role by taking on more research  about7 finding out the issues around affordable  housing8 and what could be done to resolve these issues  by9 broadening the public conversation beyond  these10 hearings each year to talk about fairness  and11 effectiveness in housing policy.12 I urge the RGB to use your power13 to adopt resolutions with respect to  legislative14 design or administration of the Rent15 Stabilization Laws.16 For instance, in 1992 you,  the17 Board , adopted a resolution calling upon the DHCR18 to look into possible violations of the Board' s19 hotel orders. I urge you, the RGB, to  produce20 resolutions calling upon DHCR to keep  more21 comprehensive data, to provide complete data  to22 the Board and to the public , and to proactively23 investigate complaints of illegal deregulation  of24 apartments, questionable MCI increases  and25 landlord harassment charges.6 
2 As a new State Senator, I  can3 tell you I look forward to working with you  and4 your staff throughout the coming years, not  just5 this one day each year, to address the  big6 picture issues on housing affordability and  the7 crisis that we find ourselves  in.8	I do believe that we can move9 the legislature and the DHCR to do more, to  do10 better.11	And I would like the help and12 assistance of you, the RGB Board. I think  you13 people in this room also would like  that14 assistance.15 So, again,16 (Audience participation.)17 SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:	to18 close tonight , I don't see how you can justify an19 increase based on your own data and analysis or20 on the realities of the housing market in  New21 York City.22 I urge you not to move an23 increase forward, and , if possible, I believe24 it 's absolutely justifiable to explore a rent25 rollback this year.12 
2 Thank you for your time.3 (Audience participation.)4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Rivera.5	MR. RIVERA:	Senator Krueger,6 thank you for coming and presenting your case  to7 us.8 I would like to ask you a9 quest ion about the complaints that you get. Are10 they just from the poor?11	SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:	No. In12 fact , in my district from 14th Street to 96th13 Street on the East Side of Manhattan, give  or14 take a few blocks zigzagging, the truth is  we15 have a statistically very low percentage of  low-16 income people. Basically the East Side  of17 Manhattan is too expensive for low- income people18 to be living there.19 We do have though approximately20 80 , 000 rent - regulated and rent - controlled units,21 many of which are filled with both older  people22 on fixed incomes, disabled , people who will23 become  disabled ,  families with  expanding numbers24 of children, people who have lived their  entire25 lives on the East Side of Manhattan and bel ieve12 
2 that they're being priced out of their homes  and3 have no alternatives.4	But it is not a population  you5 would  define as low- income. And , in fact , on some6 of the data analysis that is done by district ,7	one could argue that I have one of the  wealthiest8 districts in the City of New  York.9 And yet I am still facing10 housing crisis upon housing crisis from  my11	constituents.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder.13 MS. HOLDER:	You said you have14 written test imony.15 SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:	Yes. I16 just gave it to the gentleman.17 MS. HOLDER:	Is it for us? Could18 I have a copy?19 SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:	Oh, of20 course. I didn' t know whether that got passed to21 you.22 CHAIRMAN  MARKUS:	Well , we' ll23 get a copy.24 SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:	Okay.25 MR. RUBENSTEIN:	For every $10012 
2 that the tenant pays to their landlord , $22 of3 that is passed on in some way to New York City  in4 the form of real estate taxes and water and  sewer5 taxes.6 And in light of the fact  that7 City real estate taxes go up five percent  every8 year, water and sewer taxes are going up  six-9 and- a-half percent every year, how can we give a10 zero percent increase or rollback since the  City11 portion of the operating expenses is  increasing?12 Isn't that something that has to be  addressed?13 SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:	Well , it 's14 a bigger question. I mean technically if  you15 don' t increase my rents, then you don' t have an16 increased tax bill as a proportion of my  rent.17 (Audience participation. )18 SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:	As I say,19 it 's a bigger question. I do agree that property20 taxes continue to go up.21 From the big picture on tax22 policy  -  I think that ' s what you were really23 trying to get at - it is true that the City  of24 New York finds itself with almost only one  tax25 that they can deal with for themselves  without2 
2 going to Albany for approval.3 And Albany	- - and as a4 representative  from Albany  I concur  - - Albany5 doesn' t give the City of New York what it needs6 and it deserves both in the approval to make  its7 own decisions about its tax policies,  broader8 than simply property tax, but also,  frankly,9 doesn' t return to the City of New York anywhere10 nears its fair share of tax  dollars.11 New York State receives12 approximately $2.6 billion more in tax  revenue13 from the people of the City of New York than  we14 get back here in the City of New  York.15 It 's an issue I 've been16 continuing to raise in Albany. It was an issue  I17 raised when I voted against the State budget , in18 addition to the fact that we failed to pass  a19 commuter tax this year which would have  moved20 another $500 million into the City' s tax coffers21 and would have helped to address the imbalance  of22 how we make our decisions on taxes, to having  to23 be overly dependent on property  taxes.24 I also urge that the State of25 New York move more of its fair share of  funding2 
2 for public education back into the City so  that3 we don' t have to make tradeoffs in the City4 budget between providing the money we  desperately5 need for our public education system and  having6 to choose to cut other critical and  essential7 services .8 So I think it is a big question9 that you are asking because I think you're  really10 asking about the fairness and equity of the  City11 tax structure in relationship to property  taxes12 as well as the entire tax structure .13 I would be happy to talk about14 it longer . I don' t know that you want to take the15 time now.16 (Audience participation. )17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	One final18 question . Mr . Castellano.19 MR . CASTELLANO :	Well , among the20 big questions is one big answer, and that is,  the21 taxes that a property owner pays are  completely22 independent of a rent increase . In fact , your23 rent income can be going down and your taxes  can24 be going up .25 SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:	So it was2 
2	never a formula of - -3	MR . CASTELLANO:	Not at all. It4	is far more complicated5	SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER :	Then I6	clarify myself.7	MR. CASTELLANO:	And I have to8 tell you, I'm one of the owner representatives  on9 this Board .10 SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:	Yes, I11 know .12 MR . CASTELLANO:	I will call for13 a rent rollback when politicians vote to  roll14 back their salaries . I think that 's a fair trade.15 (Audience participation.)16 SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:	Mr .17 Cast ellano,18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You don't19 have to answer.20 SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:	I will21 roll back my salary in exchange for your  vote22 tonight.23 MR. CASTELLANO:	As a matter of24 fact ,  I'll trade my  salary for yours .25 (Audience part icipation .)8 
2 MR. CASTELLANO:	I'm taking per3 diems since thirty years old. You got a  salary.4 (Audience participation.)5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Senator, let6 me say on behalf of everybody here, we  appreciate7 your testimony. On behalf of myself , say hello to8 your father. He' s an old friend.9	SENATOR LIZ KRUEGER:	Certainly.10 But , again, Vincent , we have a11 deal , you'll take the vote for a rent rollback?12 MR. CASTELLANO:	My deal was13 completely economic. Okay? My salary for  yours.14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We are now16 going to start the  apartments.17 We are going to take one of  the18 people who needs to catch the bus. Who would  you19 like?20 In order to accommodate the21 people that are leaving, we are going to take  one22 person' s testimony.23 Penny LaForrest.24 Go ahead.25 MS. PENNY LA FORREST:	My name10 
  2 is Penny LaForrest and I'm from the Queens  League3 of United Tenants and I'm also from the  Citywide4 Tenants Coalition.5 And I've been coming before  this6 Board for about twenty years now fighting  for7 rent regulations.8 Let me start by saying that  it9 is very conspicuous that there are no  landlords10 here. They do not have to come anymore. I 'm sure11 they don't feel the need to be here  anymore12 because they do not only have two  representatives13 on the Board, but they have five public  members14 as well .15 (Audience participation.)16 MS. PENNY LA FORREST:	I'm sure17 that you will regret that you allowed me to  speak18 but I must tell you I do not recognize  the19 legitimacy of this Board. I do not see - - wait  -  2021 (Audience part icipation.)22 MS. PENNY LA FORREST:	You' re23 taking away from my time.24 I do not see one public member25 who represents the disabled , the elderly, the21 
2 working class, unorganized workers,  organized3 workers.4 I see nobody up there except5 once again the financial interests of this  City.6 So the landlords are very well7 represented, the tenants are not. And what  we8 have to do and what we should do is turn  our9 energy to changing the composition of  this10 Board - -11	(Audience participat ion.)12 MS. PENNY LA FORREST:	so13 that it - -14 (Audience participation.)15 MS. PENNY LA FORREST:	so16 that it does really and truly represent  the17 people of this City, eighty- five percent of18 whom  - and this comes out of your statistics    -19 make under $30,000 each year. And those are  the20 people who are not represented  here.21 But very quickly  - -22 (Audience participat ion.)23 MS. PENNY LA FORREST:	I24 wanted to say this.25 I teach at Riker' s Island. I12 
2	teach the poorest kids in this City . I teach the3	kids that are the result of all the  lousy4	legislat ion that you can possibly pass.5	And I will tell you this.  Woody6 Guthrie once said some people rob you with a  gun7 and some with a fountain pen . But as I would say8 to my guys, the real gangsters are sitting  up9 there.10 (Audience participat ion .)11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ida Pollack.12 MS . IDA POLLACK :	Ida Pollack13 and I come from Queens.14 I 'm  a member of the Queens15 League of United Tenants and the Citywide  Tenant16 Coalition .17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	You' re18 leaving on the bus, is that  right?19 MS. IDA POLLACK:	Yes .20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay.21 MS . IDA POLLACK:	I will pick22 up	I will pick up where this last speaker,  who23 is my mother, left off .24 Like death and taxes you're here25 again. But unlike death and taxes you're not  here12 
2 forever, because it 's a goal that these tenant s3 have set for themselves to get rid of  this4 kangaroo  court .5 I would like to direct my6 remarks to so- called public members with a7 special little remark for the most arrogant  and8 insolent fool who thinks he' s funny.9 (Audience part icipat ion.)10 MS. IDA POLLACK:	Last year, a11 former so- called public member had five people,12 mostly seniors and women, arrested and they  spent13 the night in the police station and received  an14 appointment to come back for trial .15 This was an unruly mob. This  was16 unruly, you know, to this  guy.17 Now, when I told him that  he18 usurped the power of the police and took  upon19 himself to quell this mob, he told me how hard  a20 job it was for you people to come to  this21 decision without them being fair to both  tenants22 and landlords and the City.23 Well , how else - - what a joke24 that was. When your initial premise is  grossly25 biased, everything that follows remains  grossly2 
2 biased.3 How else to explain the fact4 that for the last twenty- five or so years that5 the landlords have been whining about how  close6 they come to the brink of bankruptcy, despite  the7 fact that their own research shows that they  make8 out like bandits, especially this past year,  have9thesepublic members with rare exceptions  ever10votedagainst this landlord greed.1112The final vote is either sevento two, sometimes six to three. But should  it13ever gettocloser than that , there is always the14Chairmantoset things right .15It 's interest ing that while the16 landlords cry poverty, the big honcho of the  real17 estate industry says otherwise. At a  fundraiser18 held at the Sheraton Hotel for the then  mayoralty19 candidate, Peter Vallone, Mr . Strassberg appealed20 to the members of the real estate community to  do21 right by their friend in the City  Council.22 And I quote: New York City  is23 the place where everyone wants to live and  work24 because it is the safest and most vibrant city  in25 the world. For those of us involved in  real16 
2 estate this has meant that our property  values3 have appreciated and our loses have  been4 minimized.5 You guys should get together  on6 your stories .7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Could you8	wrap up, please .9	MS. IDA POLLACK:	Yes. I'll wrap10 up.11 How dare you propose a  six12 percent longevity tax to make up for, as  you13 claim, all of the lean years you suffered  through14 while you were gett ing six and eight , eight and15 ten and ten and twelve, fifteen and seventeen  and16 more .17 You owe us a rollback for  all18 the years - -19 (Audience participation.)20 MS.

Thank17 you.18 I 'm a senior citizen, rent19 stabilized tenant. I live in a huge  apartment20 development that has been subject to a  whole21 series of MCIS in the past ten years, about  eight22 or nine of them .23 The landlord has also made  an24 effort of trying to evict senior citizen  tenants25 who pay very low rent because they have  been12 
1	4512 there for a very long time .3 It appears that the landlords4 can once again rely on automatic increases  as5 they have been able to do since the inception  of6 the Rent Guidelines Board despite the  economic7 conditions that are now affecting  people8 throughout  the City .9 This is at a time when the  RGB10 price index is negative and the overall cost  of11 fuel is down substantially. As a result of  not12 only the World Trade Center, but of  conditions13 brought about by financial manipulation  and14 scandal , thousands of New Yorkers face economic15 distress and layoffs.16 In spite of this, the New York17 City landlords can march cheerfully onward  to18 greater prosperity and an ever brighter  future.19 I wonder when a new day will20 dawn when the Rent Guidelines Board will  finally21 show some signs of humanity and imagination  and22 begin, at the very least , to question the23 incessant demands by the landlords for  further24 excesses in profits at the expense of New  York25 tenants.2 
1	4522	Thank you .3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 (Audience participat ion .)5 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you6	very much .7	MS. VISSER :	Chandroutre8	Joseph, followed by Vajra Kilgara and Tom  Diana.9	Ms . Joseph?10	MS. CHANROUTRE JOSEPH :	Here.11	MS . VISSER :	Tom Diana?12 MR. TOM DIANA:	Yes .13 MS. VISSER:	Ms. Joseph?14 Chanroutre Joseph?15 MS. CHANROUTRE JOSEPH:	Yes .16 Good afternoon.17 I'm an owner of a nine- family18 apartment building,  rent stabilized . And  I  want19 to say that we are good landlords and we  take20 care of our apartments .21 I didn't plan to say anything.  I22 didn't know I had to talk .2 3	Anyway , for seven years I own24 this building. We did all renovations . I have a25 tenant paying $500 for a two- bedroom apartment ,24 
2 all new equipment and they would not pay  one3 penny more. And I cannot get a penny more.  And4 they can fight me in court.5	And they can live in my6 apartment , living there for three and four7 months, six months, and get away with the  money.8 And I'm saying this will  make9 owners like me lose our  buildings.10 When we can rent our place  and11 people can move in and rip it apart , we can do12 nothing about it because the law is for  the13 tenant who wants to frighten you and beat on  you14 and do all sorts of things.15 They tell you they are moving  in16 with three people, they end up with seven  people,17 they end up with ten people and you have to  pay18 the water. Who lose in the end? The owners of  the19 building.20 And you have no right to go  to21 court and you have to wait and you have to pay  to22 get them evicted while you wait to see them  break23 the building apart.24 So I would really like the  Board25 to pay attention to this as the tenants  are6 
2 crying out that they want a  rollback.3 We are getting an increase  in4 water as the gentleman speak before . Everything5 is going up. Your mortgage is going up  and6 they're ripping you apart. You have nowhere  to7 run.8 Thanks a lot.9 (Audience participation. )10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11 MS. VISSER:	Vajra Kilgara,12 followed by Tom Diana, followed by John  Stanley.13 MS. VAJRA KILGARA:	My name is14 Vajra Kilgara. I live at 521 West 127th Street  in15 Manhattan.16 I am a tenant organizer in my17 neighborhood and a member of the Board  of18 Directors of the Metropolitan Council on  Housing.19 So I have a lot of experience20 mostly hearing from tenants.21 A few years ago I took a  course22 in building maintenance at HPD back in the  days23 when  they  were  doing 7A administrators	- - when24 they were still doing 7A administrators. And  at25 that time it suddenly became clear to me  where2 
2 there is this kind of disjuncture here in  real3 estate which I think we should call unreal  estate4 here in New York, and that is that many,  many,5 many, many people buy a building as  an6 investment , as a way of  - - for their retirement7 maybe, thinking this is how we make money in  New8 York, sort of like having an oil well or a  gold9 mine in your backyard; maybe there' s a few costs,10 but not too many.11 And many of these people have  no12 more sense of how to run a building than if  they13 thought they were going to open up a  restaurant14 to make a pile of money to support themselves  and15 don't even know how to slice an  onion.16 (Audience participation.)17 MS. VAJRA KILGORA:	Why are18 people attracted to this? They don't know how  to19 run a building. They don't understand the  systems20 of the buildings. They don't know how a  boiler21 works. They don't know any of that. When  there22 are serious repairs to be made, as our  architect23 mentioned , there is this kind of stage of rage24 that it wasn' t supposed to be like this, we25 weren' t supposed to have any expenses. We were2 
2 only supposed to be able to make  money.3 (Audience participation.)4	MS. VAJRA KILGORA:	Well , part5 of the reason why people like that buy  buildings6 is because people like you vote increases  year7 after year after year so that profits  are8 guaranteed.9 (Audience participation.)10 MS. VAJRA KILGORA:	There is a11 culture of essentially treating the working  class12 people, the working people of New York,  whether13 they are working class or middle class,  basically14 the same way that Malcolm X thought of  working15 people when he was a street hustler in New  York.16 He said: As far as I was concerned , anybody who17 worked for a living was a chump. And if  anybody18 who was going to be a chump enough to work for  a19 living, then it was my job to take that  money20 away from them at the end of the  day.21 And it' s the same attitude I see22 here. What? You' re only paying fifty percent of23 your income in rent? That leaves another  fifty24 percent. Give it up.25 That ' s the attitude of this5 
2 Board that working people are chumps and that  we3 are to have our money taken away from us at  the4 end of the day. And by guaranteeing interest  to5 landlords who will not make  repairs  - -  and they6 will not make repairs because that 's not part of7 their deal - -8 (Audience participation.)9 MS. VAJRA KILGORA:	Because the10 deal that you give them is they are guaranteed  to11 have increases, increases, increases .12 If I did my job as badly as my13 landlord does their job, I'm fired. I don' t have14 a job .15 (Audience participation .)16 MS. VAJRA KILGORA:	This is not17 fair that some people pay $2000 while  other18 people pay $1000? No, it is not fair. The  remedy19 for that is in your hands, you go with the  higher20 rent . If life were fair, we would all own our own21 homes and none of us would be  here.22 (Audience participation. )23 MR. TOM DIANA:	My name is Tom24 Diana . I'm a professional	engineer. I do heavy25 construction for a living . I'm also on the board2 
2 of the Municipal Engineers.3 And I know that it doesn' t4 compare to a woman who took a two- day class from5	HPD.6 Enron is proof that  accountants7 can generate prof it out of thin air. We've all8 seen it.9 My previous testimony has  shown10 that the expenses calculated on the  hardship11 increase application are mysteriously based on  a12 percentage of the rent roll. Therefore, it has  no13 foothold in reality and is not even  available,14 the form is not even available from  DHCR.15 The major impediment to the  use16 of the Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption  is17 the loss of the ability by tenants to pass  the18 apartment on to their children. How  many19 generations are we responsible  for?20 Now we come to your own  report.21 You calculate a barebones with full rent payment ,22 no return on investment , an estimate of $400 for23 basically a one-bedroom  apartment.24 Now we come to the directors  of25 the non-prof it organizations who charge $600 a6 
2 month and come before the Board to fight for  a3 $214 increase - - rent , monthly rent.  What4 happened to all the tenants doubled up in  the5 apartments? Why not start the minimum rent  at6 $428 and match your own costs?7 Why do you require to  subsidize8 apartments cheaper than your own reports?  Why9 don' t you tell the tenants who are paying $1500 a10 month that you have decided that they should  pay11 more to protect the below- cost apartments? That 's12 not right .13 You should take the14 responsibility for this problem. Don't blame  us.15 Many owners cannot get $1500  a16 month rent. In a poorer neighborhood you  can't17 get it. So the across- the- board percentage18 increase is a phantom increase.  Okay?19 You have  - - we have repeatedly20 asked you for flat increases. Fairly  distribute21 the costs. You tell the tenants that we  are22 willing to give you a very low increase on  the23 $1500 a month apartments. Okay?24 Except that you want to protect25 the below- cost apartments. That' s not right.2 
2 Every tenant here, every landlord here,  would3 welcome a change in the percentage. Charge  the4 lower apartments that are below cost what  it5 costs them, and then the upper apartments don' t6 have to pay for it. That 's what fair.7 Okay?8	Now, just for the record, I  have9 a one-bedroom apartment here $476, a  city-10 subsidized  apartment . This is from  '96. This is  a11 Senior Citizen Rent Increase  Exemption.12 And this is what tenants do  to13 your apartments. All right? This is  fifteen14 mont hs of no rent.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You have to16 wrap up.17 MR. TOM DIANA:	Basically18 that 's it.19 I'm just saying here that  I20 would like to see - -21 (Audience participation.)22 MR. TOM DIANA:	- - all of the23 apartments - -24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.25 This is not what it ' s about . You9 
2have to keepquiet if you want to talk. We  are3going to endthis at ten.4(Audience participat ion .)5MR. TOM DIANA:	I would just6 like to say we are looking for an even  increase.7 I don't like charging tenants at the higher  end8 more and more money to subsidize apartments that  9	are $400 or $500.10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,11 sir.12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. VISSER:	John Stanley.14 The next speakers, you can move15 forward, are Sid Mill er, Sandra Miller, Robert16 Nelson, France Jonas.17 MR. JOHN STANLEY :	Good evening.18 I'm John Stanley.19 I learned to do dirty work20 today. And where is it? I didn' t write it down.21 It is having to do with having lived for a  long22 while. And the point is that I have lived  here23 since 1921. Not only have I lived that long,  I24 have lived in my apartment since  1957.25 (Audience participation.)10 
1	4622 MR. JOHN STANLEY:	And not only3 that , I have been going to the VA as an4 outpatient for forty years because I was in  World5 War II, in the ETO from '41 to  '45.6 The problem is7 (Audience participation.)8 MR. JOHN STANLEY:	- - that9 housing is a right and it has been made into  a10 racket.11 (Audience participation.)12 MR. JOHN STANLEY:	What we have13 been doing here this afternoon is engaging in  a14 class struggle. Nobody speaks of that here.  But15 it is a fact: the landlord class against  the16 deliberately deprived class, sentimentally  known17 as the poor.18 This class is deliberately19 deprived for life for no crime committed.  This20 has got to end.21 I go to the VA once or twice a22 week. I catch the bus back downtown from  23rd23 Street. I stand across the street from a set  of24 buildings. There's a former bank on the  corner25 which is now a synagogue there. Then there  are2 
1	4632 three 1880 five - story tenements.3 When I started going there  forty4 years ago, all of these buildings were  filled5 with tenants. There is a new buyer who bought  it6 about ten years ago and gradually window  by7 window was tinned over as he drove everyone  of8 these tenants out. These are the same people  who9 want to get into the real estate business to  make10 money but they drive tenants out because  they11 despise tenants.12 Tenants who have to pay all of13 this, so much of a percentage of their  wage,14 forty percent of their wage, fifty percent  of15 their wage. We are going back to the Middle  Ages.16 We are going back to feudalism and we   - -17 (Audience participation.)18 MR. JOHN STANLEY:	as the19 late great Esther Rand of Met Council once  said,20 or maybe she said it many times, landlords  are21 not lords of the land, they' re the scum of the22 earth.23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sidney25 Miller.2 
2	MR. SID MILLER:	Good evening.3	My name is Sid Miller.	I am a4	small property owner.5	I empathize with you, Members of6 the Rent Guidelines Board. You are in a  no-win7 situation. You are between a rock and a  hard8 place. You do not deserve the blame for  the9 housing crisis we are now  facing.10 The real culprit was the  New11 York State Legislature . In the mid 1940s, when12 rent control under World War II Federal OPA  was13 about to expire, the legislature was faced with  a14 tough polit ical choice.15 Number one: should Albany  allow16 rent control to sunset , then work with builders17 and property owners to increase supply,  which18 would result in competition, which would  result19 in lower housing prices; or20 Number two:21 (Audience participation .)22 MR. SID MILLER:	- - should23 Albany continue rent control on a temporary  basis24 while the problem is studied which  would25 guarantee  its own re-election.6 
2 Well , it is sixty years  later3 and the matter is still being studied.  The4 housing crisis is at epidemic  proportions.5	The bottomline is that tenants6 and property owners alike are suffering  because7 of the, quote, I will say anything to get  re-8 elected, the "what 's in it for me" attitude that9 permeates New York City housing  politics.10 Thank you.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,12 sir.13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. VISSER:	Sandra Miller,15 followed by Robert Nelson, France  Jonas.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have back-17 to-back Millers who are going to disagree  for18 sure.19 MS. SANDRA MILLER:	I might be a20 Miller, but I'm not related to  him.21 (Audience participation.)22 MS. SANDRA MILLER:	I come from23 a long line, three generations of New Yorkers  on24 both sides, one line of cultural New Yorkers  and25 one line of "New York as the fashion capital  of12 
2 the world " New Yorkers.3 Now, I am not a public  speaker4 so bear with me.5 A VOICE:	Louder.6 MS. SANDRA MILLER:	I'm angry. I7 was born in the City. I come from people who  made8 the City beautiful. And we are all involved  with9 culture and the fashion industry . My grandfather10 made dresses and gowns for the Beeches and  the11 Tishmans. He dressed the rich  people.12 My mother was a performing13 artist. She lived in those buildings on  42nd14 Street , Manhattan Plaza. She was a pioneer there.15 I could have inherited her old16 apartment when she moved in. I didn' t because I17 was already somewhere that I loved. That 's the18 home I have now for thirty- four years.19 And I'm a good tenant and  I20 helped take care of the building because we  have21 a part - time super, which part who knows.22 Anyway, I'm very angry and  I'm23 very scared because they just did a bunch  of24 capital improvements. My neighbors are all in  the25 theatre also, the theatre and other art things  in2 
2 New York, cultural people. Some of them are  out3 of work, and some of them are not performing  on4 Broadway right now. And when they do, I  can't5 afford to go see them either.6	So	New York has really7 changed a lot. I'm still willing to put up  with8 the expensiveness of it , but I'm not willing to9 put up with outrageous rents or having my  friends10 and my neighbors having to suffer. I have  a11 ninety- year old neighbor who is scared. I have12 another neighbor who is a retired worker of  the13 UN, another wonderful institution of this  City.14 We' re all here. We' re still15 here. And we' re not leaving.16 And my landlord is trying to  buy17 me out . I don't think there is any money in the18 world that I will settle on because it stinks  to19 be bought out by a landlord. It really is,  to20 have that pressure on you.21 And you're laughing because  you22 feel comfortable with that. We' re squirming down23 here and you are comfortable up  there.24 Now, please, have a heart  and25 understand that I'm coming here from my heart  and7 
2 that ' s the only way I know how to do this .3 Remember, New Yorkers who make4 this City vibrant	- -  I make your subway maps, I5 make your airport directories for you, I help  you6 find your way here. And I do it with a lot  of7 care.8	So, please, remember us.9	Thank you .10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you. I11 appreciate it.12 (Audience participation.)13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Robert14 Nelson.15 MS. VISSER:	Robert Nelson.16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Are you here,17 Mr. Nelson?18 MR. ROBERT NELSON:	Yes.19 MS. VISSER:	Would you please20 come closer to the mike: France Jonas,  followed21 by Kathleen Elvin, followed by David  Samuel.22 MR. ROBERT NELSON :	Thanks for23 giving me the opportunity to appear before  the24 Board tonight .25 My name is Robert Nelson . I'm10 
2 the President of Nelson Management Group based  in3 Forest Hills, Queens.4 My company owns some thousand5 residential units in Brooklyn, Manhattan and  the6 Bronx.7	First , I wish to emphasize that8 I understand my responsibility to the tenants  in9 my buildings . I take these responsibilities10 seriously.11 I take pride in providing12 tenants with good living conditions and  good13 services.14 I speak in opposition to the15 proposed rent increases because these  increments16 are too low. The recommended  - -17 (Audience participation.)18 MR. ROBERT NELSON:	- - two and19 four percent increases are simply not enough  to20 meet the huge increase in fixed costs  that21 building owners currently  face.22 The increases fail to provide23 enough revenue to cover such rapidly rising  fixed24 costs as insurance, as well as wat er and sewer25 and real estate taxes.8 
2 In the latest Rent Guidelines3 Board Price Index of Operat ing Costs insurance4 costs grew sixteen- and- a-half percent. But since5 September 11th our insurance costs have  increased6 in some cases by a hundred and ninety  percent.7 Add to that real estate tax8 increases in excess of six-and - a-half percent ,9 with wat er and sewer taxes increasing by six-10 and - a-half percent	- -11 (Audience participation.)12 MR. ROBERT NELSON:	- - fuel oil13 and natural costs are again on the rise,  my14 electric costs are up twenty- eight percent over15 the last twenty- four months, an increase of16 $100 , 000 in a master- met ering of a three- hundred17 unit apartment building that we own in the  Bronx.18 Essentially  the rent stabilized1920 (Audience participation.)21 MR. ROBERT NELSON:	- - building22 owners need a mechanism to recoup some of  these23 cost increases or else we, in effect , are24 subsidizing the tenants' cost of  living.25 (Audience participation.)20 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.3	MR. ROBERT NELSON:	We do not4 see the equity in these minuscule rent  increases5 for the rent stabilized tenants who have  occupied6 their apartments in excess of ten years.  Their7 rents remain low but the fixed cost that  the8 owner must pay to operate the apartments  go9 higher and higher every year.10 As I noted, I take my11 responsibilities as a building owner  seriously12 and I take pride in providing tenants with  good13 living conditions and good  services.14 But I can only continue to15 properly provide these services if I have  the16 financial resources to do the job  properly.17 The proposed rent hike is too18 low for me to meet my fixed costs.  Building19 owners require a higher increase or some  manner20 of cost recoupment if we are going to be able  to21 provide an appropriate level of housing  services22 to our tenants.23 Thank you.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.25 (Audience participation. )4 
2CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder.3If you could get some decorum4here, we' ll allbe able to speak.5Ms. Holder.6MS. HOLDER:	I'm sorry.7CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.8MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.9I appreciate your coming back  to10the microphone.I didn' t understand what you said11 at the beginning. You are an owner where?  Where12 do you have the buildings?13 MR. ROBERT NELSON:	Manhattan,14 Brooklyn and the Bronx.15 MS. HOLDER:	How many units?16 MR. ROBERT NELSON:	About a17 thousand.18 MS. HOLDER:	You have a thousand19 units?20 MR. ROBERT NELSON:	Correct.21 MR. HOLDER:	And what is the22 average rent in your buildings in the  various23 boroughs?24 MR. ROBERT NELSON:	It depends.25 I mean Manhattan  is different from Brooklyn which11 
2	is different from the Bronx.3 I can't give you an average4 (Audience participation.)5 MR. ROBERT NELSON:	- - because6 they range from7 (Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.9 (Audience part icipation. )10 MS. HOLDER:	You have a thousand11 units. In the Bronx what is your average rent  in12 the Bronx?13 MR. ROBERT NELSON:	The average14 rent in the Bronx is probably about  $750.15 MS. HOLDER:	Where in the Bronx16 are you located?17 MR. ROBERT NELSON:	In the18 Pelham Parkway section.19 MS. HOLDER:	And in Queens?20 MR. ROBERT NELSON:	We don' t21 have any units in Queens.22 MS. HOLDER:	Brooklyn.23 MR. ROBERT NELSON:	What 's the24 average rent in Brooklyn?25 MS. HOLDER:	Yes.10 
2		MR . ROBERT NELSON :	Probably 3	about  $900/$950.4 MS. HOLDER:	And in Manhattan?5 MR. ROBERT NELSON : And in6	Manhattan,	$1150.7	MS . HOLDER:	How long have you8	been in the business of being an  owner?9	MR. ROBERT NELSON:	About ten10	years.11	MS . HOLDER:	Ten years.12 Thank you.13 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr.14 Castellano, go ahead.15 MR. CASTELLANO:	Mr. Nelson,16 good to see you again. Long  time.17 I have a question.18 About a thousand units,  some19 that I would consider on prime real estate  and20 some less than prime. What percentage of  the21 thousand units would you estimate are renting  at22 preferent ial rents?2 3	MR. ROBERT NELSON:	Maybe about24 thirty- five percent.25 MR. CASTELLANO:	I would assume24 
2 that that thirty- five percent is mostly in the3 Bronx and some in Brooklyn?4	MR . ROBERT NELSON:	Mostly in5	the Bronx and Brooklyn .6 MR. CASTELLANO:	Thank you.7 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you . We8 appreciate it.9 Oh! Last question. Go ahead , Mr .10 Rivera.11	MR. RIVERA:	Of your thousand12 units, do you have any buildings that are  not13 making a profit?14 MR . ROBERT NELSON:	I'm sorry,15 sir?16 MR . RIVERA :	Do you have any17 buildings  - -  are any of your buildings not18 profit able?19 MR. ROBERT NELSON:	All the20 buildings	- - I would say - - I would say thirty-21 five percent of the buildings are not  profitable.22 Thirty- five percent of the units I should say.2 3	MR. RIVERA:	What about the24 buildings?25 MR. ROBERT NELSON:	I would say24 
2 the average would be thirty- five percent on a3 building- wide basis.4	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Right. That 's5	what he is asking .6	MR. ROBERT NELSON:	On a7	building -wide basis .8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank9	you .10 MS. HOLDER:	I need to know. So11 in Manhattan  you're saying  - -  in Manhattan you12 are saying that thirty- five percent of your units13 are not profitable in Manhattan?14 MR . ROBERT NELSON:	No, not in15 Manhattan . The boroughs .16 The question that he asked was - 1718 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All the19 units.20 MR. ROBERT NELSON :	over all21 the buildings that we own what is the  percentage22 that are non-prof itable .23 MS. HOLDER:	And even offering24 preferential  rents in the Bronx, you are saying25 your average  is - what?  - $750?18 
2MR. ROBERT NELSON:	That 's3correct.4MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.5CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,6Mr. Nelson.7MS. VISSER :	So the next8 speakers are ready: France Jonas, Kathleen  Elvin,9 David  Samuel , Laverne Jones.10 France Jonas.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is France12 Jonas here?13 Ma' am. No?14 Is France Jonas here?15 We need people to move up  when16 their name is called so that they are ready to  go17 because we want everybody to speak who wants  to18speak andweare running out of time.19MR . FRANCE L. JONAS:	Good20evening.21My name is France J. Jonas.  I'm22	a resident of Lefrak City in Queens. And I'm   here23thisevening to highlight some of the points  that24mostof the people here brought  up.25Our landlord has been playing
2 games with us in Lefrak City. For years and  years3 he doesn' t take care of the property, it runs4 down, he applies for an MCI , gets the MCI and5 makes a killing.6 And then the Rent Guidelines7 Board gives him an increase so that he makes  a8 double killing. And the tenants  suffer.9 I would like to suggest that10 really what we should have is an RGB  rent11 giveback. Really that 's about it.12 Thank you.13 (Audience participation.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 MS. VISSER:	Kathleen Elvin,16 David Samuel , Laverne Jones, Dave Powell.17 MS. KATHLEEN ELVIN:	My name is18 Kathl een Elvin.19 Thank you for being here.20 I am a New York City teacher  and21 I also provide about twenty- five units of housing22 that is in far better condition now than when  I23 bought it.24 And I am here to say that  rent25 increases of two and four percent are  certainly2 
2 not enough to continue providing decent  housing3 in New York City.4 Many of the issues that  your5 information is based on don' t include actual6 costs that owners face on a daily basis.  For7 example, we have a couple of tenants  who8 chronically don't pay rent. Every time we  take9 them to court , it costs us at least a thousand10 dollars in legal fees . We have inspections.11 There' s no apparent violat ions. But every time12 the judge says, well , the tenant would like a new13 bathtub, why don' t you give him a new bathtub and14 make him happy.15 (Audience participation. )16 MS . KATHLEEN ELVIN:	The next17 time - - the next time it 's why don't you give   him18 a new kitchen floor, make him  happy.19 I feel like a waiter being  asked20 for an extra pound of butter. And yet  these21 things cost hundreds and sometimes thousands  of22 dollars.23 And that 's the price I have to24 pay to have somebody observe their  contractual25 obligation to pay $500 rent on a three- bedroom2 
2 apartment in the Upper West Side of  Manhattan.3 VOICES:	Where?4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet .5	MS . KATHLEEN ELVIN :	In our6 neighborhood  Sanitation and Board of Health7 inspectors come two or three times a week . They8 issue violations  for almost anything.9 I walk by the building myself  at10 least twice a day . I can walk by on my way to11 work at eight o'clock in the morning and get  a12 fine at 8:15 because somebody dropped a  cardboard13 or a wrapper on the sidewalk. We have a live- in14 super and the response we get when we go down  to15 challenge a fine when the sidewalk is  cleaned16 two, three and four or five times a day, is,  well17 any time anything appears on your sidewalk, you18 are responsible for it.19 $500 a month rent on a three-20 bedroom apartment isn't paying anybody to sit   on21 my stoop and pick up every piece of litter or  dog22 poop that somebody puts  there.23 (Audience participation.)24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.25 MS. KATHLEEN ELVIN:	That cost6 
2 isn't included in the rent increase  either.3 We've had an eleven- and- a-half4 percent increase in water costs over the last  two5	years. Our insurance costs have gone up  about6 sixty percent this year.7 I also provide electricity  to8 tenants . In the past when we first bought the9 building, we got separate increases for  electric10 inclusion. There' s much greater demand on11 electricity now with faxes, computers,  everybody12 has air conditioners in every room, hair  dryers,13 halogen lamps. All of this increases  electric14 consumption. And we don' t get any increase for15 that .16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Try to wrap17 up.18 MS. KATHLEEN ELVIN:	We19 def initely need the longevity increase of six20 percent  for ten years. I have multigenerational21 tenants in apartments where you have the parents,22 the grandparent and the grandchildren, and  the23 apartment is passed on from generation  to24 generation .25 Tenants who are there  twenty-6 
2 five and thirty years, that 's fine . We love to3 have them . But everybody has to pay their fair4 share. I have to pay my fair share when I need  to5 have a repair made or I need a lawyer or I  have6 to pay the super.7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you8	wrap up?9	MS. KATHLEEN ELVIN:	Thank you10 for your attention.11 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you. We12 appreciate it .13 (Audience part icipat ion.)14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Ms. Elvin, a15 quest ion. Mr. Rivera has a question .16 (Audience participation.)17 MR . RIVERA :	Can you tell us18 where your apartment building  is?19 MS . KATHLEEN ELVIN:	In the20 lower lO O s on the West  Side of Manhattan.21 MR. RIVERA:	Exactly where? What22 street?23 MS . KATHLEEN ELVIN:	108th24 Street .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Okay . Thank10 
2	you.3	MR . RIVERA:	I have another4 question.5 I'm curious about the $500  a6 mont h rental. Is that a three -bedroom?	Is that a7 rent stabilization apartment  or  - -8 MS. KATHLEEN ELVIN:	We have - -9 MR. RIVERA:	- - or is that rent10 controlled?11 MS. KATHLEEN ELVIN:	Rent12 stabilized.13 MS. HOLDER:	I have a question.14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder,15 go ahead.16 MS. HOLDER:	I'm sorry. Where17 exactly is your building  located?18 MS. KATHLEEN ELVIN:	On 108th19 Street in Manhattan.20 MS. HOLDER:	Where?21 MS. KATHLEEN ELVIN:	Between22 Broadway  and Amsterdam.23 MS. HOLDER:	Because I used to24 live on the street. Which building	is that?25 MS. KATHLEEN ELVIN:	You know10 
2 what? I really object to being asked  that.3 (Audience participation.)4	MR. CASTELLANO:	Mr. Chair, a5	point of order, pl ease.6	MS. KATHLEEN ELVIN:	I feel very78 MR. CASTELLANO:	Point of order.9 MS. KATHLEEN ELVIN:	We are10 being abused  - -11 MR. CASTELLANO:	Point of order,12 please.13 MS. KATHLEEN ELVIN:	I do not14 feel protect ed here.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I understand16 that.17 MS. KATHLEEN ELVIN:	Thank you18 very much.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Calm down.20 (Audience participation.)21 MS. KATHLEEN ELVIN:	You did not22 live in our building.23 MS. HOLDER:	I asked a question.24 (Audience participat ion.)25 MR. CASTELLANO:	Could I raise a10 
2	point of order and be  recognized?3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Hold4	on. Go ahead, point of  order.5	MR. CASTELLANO:	The point of6 order is that this witness comes of her own   free7 will , not under oath, is being harassed by a8 member of the Board, who is  - -9	(Audience participation. )10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Please.11 MR. CASTELLANO:	To provide12 while the tenants in this room are heckling  her.13 Now she feels threatened. Now  if14 she feels threatened , she has a right to15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Let' s calm18 down.19 I agree. She has an  absolute20 right not to answer the question if she doesn' t21 feel comfortable.22 Ms. Holder is not harassing  her.23 She has a legitimate  question.24 (Audience part icipation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	If she10

KATHLEEN ELVIN:	On my21 teacher' s salary, hundreds of thousands of22 dollars.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay.24 Thank you.25 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you very10 
2	much.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.4 MS. VISSER :	David  Samuel ,5 followed by Laverne Jones, Dave Powell , Krist ina6 Piorkowska. Would you all please come to  the7 front .8 Mr. Samuel .9 MR. DAVID SAMUEL:	Yes. Thank10 you very much.11 Members of the Board , my name is12 David Samuel and I come from Lefrak City. We  have13 about 5,000 tenants in that complex, 5,000  units14 I beg your pardon. And those five  thousand15 families translate to about 32,000 people;  some16 estimate upwards to 50,000 people who live  in17 Lefrak City .18 The situation there in  Lefrak19 City is one where the landlord underserves  the20 community . We have problems with the elevators.21 Security is our number one problem when there  was22 less  - - when there was more  security, you had  a23 better security. Now we have less security and  we24 have more problems.25 The tenants' problems are  not4 
2 addressed, as I mentioned. And as a result , the3 community suffers.4 I've heard many people here5 testify about landlords benefitting  from taxes6 and benefitting from hardship and claims,  et7 cetera. But  I wonder  - -  and an additional benefit8 that the landlord in Lefrak City gains, and  that9 is, our landlord, he influenced the  tenants10 association' election to be sure that  the11 incumbents are reelected who is in their  pocket.12 (Audience participation.)13 MR. DAVID SAMUEL:	So not only14 are they gaining from these other tax, et   cetera,15 but they also influencing the tenants   association16 and making sure that the president and all  the17 members of the tenants association are in  their18 pocket.19 And thus the community  is20 underserved. They don' t challenge the MCis.21 They're benef itting from these MCis.22 So my appeal to this Board is  to23 understand that the landlord has the handle   and24 the tenants have the blade.25 And I implore you to take  into2 
2 consideration these 30,000 people in Lefrak  City3 who are being underserved and whom the  landlord4 is constantly making millions  - -  I mean he' s one5 of the top ten moguls in the country, real  estate6 moguls . He owns Newport City in New Jersey . They7 tell me now he' s even moving to China to build8 apartments.9	And the tenants in Lefrak  City10 are suffering, underserved ,  lack of  innovative  -11 - adequate elevators, broken- down elevators, lack12 of adequate security, lack of proper  maintenance,13 et cetera, et cetera.14 So I hope that you will  come15 down on the side of the  tenants.16 And we are asking, Lefrak  City,17 all 30, 000 tenants, that you not just freeze the18 rent , I mean freeze the increases, but roll it19 back .20 Thank you very much .21 (Audience participation. )22 MS. VISSER:	Dave Powell ,23 followed by Kristina Piorkowska, followed by  Lee24 Ann Freilich . Would you move forward.25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	There are10 
2 forty- four speakers left and we have a lot less3 time than that.4	So we have to - - we are  going5 change that to two minutes to try to move this   to6 make sure everybody gets to  speak.7 A VOICE:	It 's not fair.8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have9 you know, unfortunately, we get evicted at   10:30,10 you know. So we've got to be out of here at  that11 point.12 I know it 's not  fair. I13 appreciate it , but we are going to go to two14 minutes right after this  speaker.15 (Audience participation.)16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead.17 MS. LAVERNE M. JONES:	My name18 is Laverne M. Jones.19 My name is Laverne M. Jones.  I'm20 a small property owner in the City of New  York21 and I rise to speak to you of my very  serious22 concerns and those of many other small  property23 owners who find themselves in the  tenuous24 (Audience participation.)25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Quiet.9 
2 (Audience participation.)3 MS. LAVERNE M. JONES:	I've got4	the mike in my hand.5 A VOICE:	Speak up.6 MS. LAVERNE M. JONES:	And I7 rise to speak to you of my very serious  concerns8 and those of many other small property owners   who9 find themselves in the tenuous and  precarious10 position of so many of us who have bought   into11 the dream of my parents and sage advisers  over12 the years who brought us up to believe that it   is13 wise and good and safe to own your own  home.14 But in the last several  years15 things seem to be changing before our very  eyes.16 The small property owners  and17 marginal  small owners are becoming victimized  as18 much by a system of regulations as by  formerly19 desirable tenants who have become  increasingly20 untenable.21 I am here to ask you to  give22 full and appropriat e consideration to those of  us23 who are small property owners, that you  enact24 some fair and reasonable guidelines with us   in25 mind , by establishing a system which takes note7 
2	of the fact that :3	One, insurance rates have4 increased for us by as much as fifty percent ;5 many insurance companies are, thus, pulling  out6 of the New York market ;7 Costs for contractors  have8 skyrocket ed by as much as five hundred percent ;9 Contrary to the common belief ,10 fuel costs have not decreased ;11 Security has now become a  costly12 owner responsibility;13 Electrical  and plumbing labor14 rates have increased exponent ially, and those  are15 primary targets of dissatisfied  tenants.16 Likewise, the Board should  give17 serious thought to the costs perpetuat ed on  small18 property owners when, quote, tenants from heaven19 become for us tenants from hell, who are given20 the legal leeway to reside for months in  our21 properties without paying rent , who, after more22 months, are eventually evict ed and move out  in23 the dead of night after wrecking and  destroying24 our property and leaving it in an  unlivable25 condition.4 
2 The small property owner has3 been deprived of months of payments, must  afford4 extensive repairs and rebuilding before  this5 income can be retrieved.6 Small property owners need  your7 consideration and your help  now.8 Would you give some thought  to9 eliminating the two-year lease?10 Please consider approving11 unrestricted  owner occupancy.12 Do consider the fairness of13 succession rights.14 Give serious thought and15 consideration  to  full vacancy  decontrol , the16 reform of DHCR , the reform of HPD, the reform of17 Department of Buildings, some improvement of  the18 qualifying process for MCis,19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to20 wrap up.21 MS . LAVERNE M. JONES :	Yes.22 - - improving the  communication23 and coordinat ion between city agencies, the paper24 trail.25 Elimination of GOLEIEB notices2 
2	for non- primary residents.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to4 wrap up.5 None of that is within our  power6 except raise or lower rents.7 Thank you.8 MS. VISSER:	Dave Powell.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We are going10 to two minutes now. We have only  tenants.11 Dave Powell.12 MR. DAVE POWELL:	Can we start13 the clock again?14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Start the15 clock. Go ahead.16 MR. DAVE POWELL:	I'll start17 again.18 The numbers of the RGB' s own19 staff speak directly to the need for a  rent20 rollback in 2002. And the question I wish to  pose21 to the public Members of this Board is " if not22 this year,  then when? "23 This year' s data shows higher24 landlord profit than last , and an overall25 increase in prof its of nearly forty percent in10 
1	4962 the last four years. And for the first t ime, of3 course, the Price Index study has shown  a4 decrease.5 Prior to September 11th,6 stabilized tenants, whose average  annual7 household  income hovers around $27,000, were8 paying higher percentages of our incomes  than9 ever before on rent.10 Past RGB increases not only11 outpaced tenant income, but also the RGB' s own12 commensurate rent increase  formula.13 And since September 11th  we've14 seen tens of thousands of layoffs and  a15 tightening economy.16 The Coalit ion for the Homeless17 is reporting a nightly shelter population  of18 nearly 34,000 people, approximately 13 , 000 of19 whom are children. And these are the  highest20 numbers in the history of our  city.21 Furthermore, it does not take  a22 genius to realize that more dollars spent on  rent23 equals less dollars spent on the City' s many24 struggling businesses.25 I urge the public Members of2 
2 this Board not to ignore the correlation  between3 poverty, homelessness,  the economy and these4 proposed rent increases as the landlord  reps5 continually ask that you do.6 Last year' s Trojan horse was7 fuel. This year, with the RGB report ing a thirty-8 six percent decrease in fuel prices,  landlord9 lobbyists are now crying post 9/11  insurance10 rates justify increases. But , of course, while11 the rates have gone up , they will go down and our12 rents will not.13 And I want to note that14 Westchester and Nassau RGBs already voted for  a15 1.5 and 2.5 percent increases on lease  renewals16 with no additional guidelines. So how can  the17 Board rationlize further than beyond our  suburban18 neighbors?19 We call for a rent rollback.  And20 I want to remind this Board that you are not  here21 to ensure record- breaking prof its to landlords.22 You exist as a Board to carry out the  legislative23 mandate to protect tenants from, quote, unjust ,24 unreasonable  and oppressive rents	as outlined in25 the Rent Stabilization Law of  1969.2 
2 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you3 wrap up, please.4	MR. DAVID POWELL:	You are a5 regulatory body, not a referee to a  football6 game. Landlords and tenants are not two  evenly7 matched teams that are competing for equal  goals.8	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you9	wrap up, please.10 MR. DAVID POWELL:	On one hand11 you have tenants who are fighting to hold on  to12 their homes both in the short and long term,  and13 on the other hand  - -14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you15 wrap up, please .16 MR. DAVID POWELL:	Indeed, I17 will.18 is an incredibly well - funded19 real estate industry that will never be  satisfied20 with its profit margin .21 Neither you nor Mayor Bloomberg22 can equate these interests. The old line  of23 "everybody is angry, therefore we are  doing24 something right " comes from a phony paradigm. And25 if nothing else, I ask that within yourselves   you10 
2confrontthatphony paradigm.3Thank you.4(Audience participat ion.)5MS. HOLDER:	Thank you for6 coming and testifying  today.7 In your  - -  with your experience8 in organizing for your organization, how have you9 seen the housing market change over the  last10 five/ten years in New York  City?11 MR. DAVID POWELL:	Well , what I12 do for Met Council is three  things.13 Besides stuff like this, I  also14 organize buildings and I help run a hotline  that15 we do three days a week.16 And, you know, we see, you know,17 what has pretty much been testified to  today,18 which is that rents are going up  exponentially19 and landlords are using many tactics to  rent20 gouge not just these rent increases but also  MCI21 rent increases.22 We are seeing a lot of  landlords23 trying to take over buildings  for personal use24 even when they are, you know, a small  nuclear25 family taking over a twenty- unit building.6 
2 We see an increase in3 harassment .4 And we see a lot of people  being5 pushed out of this City. And as a Legal  Aid6 attorney, of which there are several on  our7 Board , I'm sure you are aware that the majority8 of people that we get , who call us in an9 immediate crisis situation, are people who are  in10 housing court on holdovers are usually  there11 because they cannot pay their  rents.12 And no rent grants are  available13 to these people because charit ies will only give14 you money if you show a future ability to  pay.15 (Audience part icipation.)16 MR. DAVID POWELL:	So rent17 increases equal eviction. I think we all  know18 that.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 Any other quest ions?21 (No response.)22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 3	MS. VISSER:	The last request24 for an owner' s speaker is Krystyna Piorkowska,25 followed by Lee Ann Freilich, Ann Quinn- Nathan,24 
2	Dena Noel .3	MS. KRYSTYNA PIORKOWSKA:	My4	name is Krystyna Piorkowska and I own two  small5	buildings just down the street from where you  are6	meeting.7 They are both over a hundred8 years old - -9	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Speak into10 the mike.11 MS . KRYSTYNA PIORKOWSKA: Excuse12 me.13 They are both over a  hundred14 years old and although I have owned them  for15 twenty- one years they still require constant16 replacement and repair and will continue to  do17 that into the future.18 You will have heard that  many19 owners are receiving MCI increases, yet I  would20 say to you that this is not applicable to  most21 small property owners who are not able to get  the22 large infusions of cash and loans which  the23 larger owners can get and under which they  can24 schedule and execute work in such a fashion  so25 that they can receive the MCI  increases.10 
2 You will probably hear how  we3 are making record incomes . Yet I can tell you4 that at two and at four percent and with  average5 rents of less than $600 a mont h, my annual6 increase will amount to some $2 , 000 while my7 property tax increase this year will exceed   that8 amount.9 Your data shows that there  has10 been a minimal	increase in expenses, yet  my11 insurance broker has advised me to set  aside12 enough money to pay for  at least	at least a13 seventy- five percent  increase in my insurance14 costs this year, an increase which in and  of15 itself will exceed any rent increases that  you16 will approve.17 Additionally, with respect  to18 fuel oil , my fuel oil costs this year are twenty19 percent higher than last  year.20 You will hear horror stories  of21 poor people who are unable to afford   significant22 increases in rent. Allow me to present my  horror23 story, a single person who is an attorney24 employed by a major law firm on Third Avenue,   one25 of the firms that would be known to all of you   if2 
2 I mentioned	its name, and who pays a rent  of3 $678. This person' s salary is well into the mid4 six figures.5 I will say to you that as  much6 as the elderly, who need to have SCRIE  limits7 raised, and the working poor who need  financial8 assistance deserve it , I will also say that  there9 are those - -10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you try11 and wrap up, please.12 MS. KRYSTYNA PIORKOWSKA:13 individuals such as my tenant who can well  afford14 non- subsidized rents, because rent stabilized15 rents are subsidized , and who are taking16 advantage of a system meant to benefit those   who17 most need assistance.18 I would ask you to consider  two19 proposals.20 That owners of less than  fifty21 units where rents fall in  Manhattan22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you23 wrap up.24 MS. KRYSTYNA PIORKOWSKA:25 specifically below $1000 fall into a  special2 
2	guidelines pool ;3	And that tenants whose  income4 falls into the top ten percent not be  protected5 by rent regulat ion of any kind .6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you .7 MS . KRYSTYNA PIORKOWSKA:	Any8questions?9(No response.)10CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.11MS. VISSER:	Lee Ann Freilich,12	Ann Quinn-Nathan, Dena Noel.13MS. LEE ANN FREILICH:	Good14evening,ladiesand gentlemen.15My name is Lee Ann  Freilich.16I am sixty- one years old. I'm a17 breast cancer survivor and I 've lived in the  same18 rent stabilized apartment on the Lower East  Side19 for the past twenty- nine years.20 For the last eleven years I  was21 gainfully employed as a registered  dietician .22 With the preexisting  condition my income was23 $1000 a month with my rent forty percent of  my24 income .25 As I said in my last  testimony17 
2 here, I was working one pay check away  from3 homelessness. Now the unforeseen worst  has4 happened. I have now contracted  multiple5 sclerosis since 9/11.6 My rent has gone up and my - -  I7 was immediately fired from my job. And so  I'm8 receiving half of the amount of dollars I  was9 receiving  and I will be getting  - - sixty- seven10 percent of my income will go for  rent.11	In my building we are living in12 a state of siege. I just also want to say  that13 the remaining two hundred dollars that I  am14 making goes for my utilities and my  supplements.15 Okay . Okay.16 I just want to say my  neighbor17 had the temerity, and her cat died , of18 complaining about mice and she was sent  an19 eviction notice charging her with  attracting20 rodents .21 This is the kind of  condition22 that exists on the Lower East Side. We live   in23 terror of making complaints. We are afraid  to24 move and now they want to tax us with a   longevity25 tax. This amounts to bureaucratic  genocide,12 
2 making the poor and elderly problem  disappear.3 Thank you.4 (Audience participation.)5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.6	MS. VISSER:	Ann Quinn- Nathan,7	Dena Noel.8	MS. ANN QUINN- NATHAN:	Ann9 Quinn- Nathan, resident in Skyview on the Hudson,10 Riverdale, New York, one of two  hundred11 stabilized tenants remaining in a  140012 approximat ely unit complex which consists of13 three buildings.14 I will not reiterate all of  the15 stories about gouging, retaliation,  harassment ,16 verbal abuse, short of physical abuse,  because17 you've heard it and I'm not going to take   undue18 time. There is only one minute and  twenty- six19 seconds left.20 I've not heard any  question21 really, except from two members, about quality   of22 life. What will my increase bring me other   than23 more  abuse , more  harassment , more physical24 ailments due to this kind of  situation.25 And it 's generated primarily9 
1	5072 towards single females in the sixty to  eighty-3 four years of age range. I think it is  untenable4 where a eighty- four year old woman is told  she5 has lived long enough, not lived long enough   in6 the unit , but lived long enough and should move7 on.8	There are forty- six states in9 this union which are in default  economically.10 WorldCom,	17,000 jobs going, if you think  it11 isn't going to affect everybody, and as well  as12 their co-ops, shareholders, you are entirely13 wrong.14 If you want to get rid of us,  it15 was done sixty- three years old by transport.16 Well, perhaps you can call it eminent domain   and17 just genocide us out of exist ence if that 's18 really what this is all  about.19 And that 's what a rent raise20 will be for us.21 Thank you.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.23 (Audience participat ion. )24 MR. DANA NOEL:	Hello, everyone.25 I'm a native New Yorker. By a nat ive New Yorker  I9 
2 mean I'm an Indian and I have relatives who   are3 living on the Shinnicock Reservation on Long4 Island.5 My ancestors sold this island  to6 Europeans for $24, and please don' t tell me7 there' s no profit.8 (Audience participat ion.)9	MR. DANA NOEL:	I said that my10 ancestors sold this island for $24 to Europeans.11 Please do not tell me there' s no profitability.12 I have ancestors  - - I have13 relatives living on the Shinnicock Reservation on14 Long Island.15 Further to that , in a country16 that 's perceived  to be democratic, there should17 be a democratic process such as a referendum.   Why18 is it that 2.7 million people in the City do  not19 vote on this themselves?20 (Audience participation.)21 MR. DANA NOEL:	Further to that ,22 in a capitalist  country  - -23 (Audience participation. )24 MR. DANA NOEL:	- - in a25 capitalist country people who profit  are10 
2 applauded for their successes.3 Well , there are two sides to4 capitalism.  You can - - well , really just one,  and5 that 's prof it. And if they are going to applaud6 the people who make money by bringing it in,  you7 are also going to reward people who spend  less8 money, who have stabilized themselves  in9 apartments that are at a low rent , which is what10 a lot of this is about , is about increasing11 rents. So let ' s not do that.12 And if , in fact , you do that ,13 why don't you include in that package going  back14 to a three-year lease as well as a two- year lease15 and a one-year lease,16 (Audience participation.)17 MR. DANA NOEL:	- - and remove18 the supplements which really, the supplements  of19 an additional surcharge of $15, remove  that20 because  that , in fact , has increased  rents21 because it has been gouging rents. Because  the22 base rent is the base rent. A tax on that  rent ,23 and then charging an increase based on that , is24 unfair and is gouging.25 And  if , in fact , stability is2 
2 not important to anyone here, then why is it  that3 at this point in time most people have moved   to4 money market  funds and federal bonds with the5 stock market being what it  is?6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Could you7	wrap up?8	MR. DANA NOEL:	That' s really9	what I want ed to say.10 And in finality, WorldCom  has11 followed in the footsteps of Enron and  their12 shares are down to eighty- three cents. So if13 anyone here is in WorldCom, you've lost  money.14 And I'm sure that makes you feel  very15 uncomfortable.16 So we don' t want to loss money17 either. Leave us where we are. Do not  increase,18 please. If you do, a three- year lease.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	All right.20 Everyone sitting here couldn' t21 sell WorldCom today.22 MR.

1	5112	MS. KEALA MONTGOMERY:	Hi! My3 name is Keala and I represent West 135th  Street4 Apart ments, Amco, one of the largest slum5 landlords in this entire  country.6	Rent increase, as everyone has7 spoke earlier, has always been a class and also   a8 race issue . We have an issue that affects9 communities of color at the highest level  because10 most cannot afford the subsidized rent they   are11 already paying.12 Many might not think  it's13 affordable for those people who live on highly14 fixed incomes and are paying  even - - even   being15 further exploited more than what they are  paying16 for, what is required for them to  pay.17 There' s a tremendous  increase in18 homelessness as a result : families, and  in19 particular  single mothers with children, who  are20 being pushed out on the  streets.21 Babies and kids are  defenseless22 and cannot defend themselves to the  Rent23 Guidelines Board. And how dare you charge an24 increased rent and push these children on  the25 streets .7 
2 (Audience participation.)3 MS. KEALA MONTGOMERY:	Are4 these members on the Board  human?5 Meanwhile,  slumlords continue to6 get tax incentives,  further outcry, while having7 violations of over a hundred or more under HPD   in8 their buildings.9 I am a single woman with no  kids10 and have to be faced going back to court , back11 and forth, no Legal Aid to represent me, have   to12 represent myself with a pro landlord judge  who13 helped in the process of evicting a tenant   for14 non- payment.15 People with color face  even16 harder challenges with the historic trend  of17 underemployment	and unemployment and18 imprisonment .19 If it wasn' t for these20 subsidized programs, there would be even  a21 greater dramatic increase in the number of   people22 living on the street.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you24 wrap up, please .25 MS. KEALA MONTGOMERY :	I'm tired2 
2 of being constantly ignored, and know that  many3 of these New Yorkers are tired of  being4 constantly ignored when it comes to no  rent5 increase. Rent is too damn high to  pay.6 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.7	(Audience participation.)8 MS. VISSER:	Priscilla Doran,9 followed by Joel Myers, April Reid,  Gregory10 Nelson.11 MS. PRISCILLA DORAN:	Priscilla12 Doran. Good evening, Board Members.13 This afternoon I have heard  the14 landlords, I have also heard the tenants. At  this15 time my statement is you should come and  visit16 53 7 West 156th Street. We cannot pay an increase17 of rent. The landlord, which was there  before,18 ran off with the money. Then the other one,   she19 died and bought two houses with the  money.20 We are still paying rent.  I'm21 holding two jobs to pay. I've raised five   kids22 without public assistance, SSI. And I can   stand23 here today at fifty- seven years old. This  should24 not be happening, a rent  increase.25 Because you come on that block,8 
2 156th Street between Amsterdam  and Broadway,3 you'll see what 's really happening: roaches,4 rats, dogs, stray cats, all this is on  that5 block. The walls in the building is falling   down.6 Outside is crumbling  down.7	Where is the landlords? Where  is8 the super to help? No. They said, the   landlords,9 they don' t repair.10 I pay my rent every month.11 Because two or three people in the building   or12 four or five people in the building don' t pay13 their rent , that means I suffer with everybody14 else.15 At least he could come  and16 repair some of these things because we are   just17 paying him rent.18 Part of the building	is public19 assistance and SSI and we still not getting   it.20 Check with Michael Bolsey  and21 you'll find how many reports that we  got22 downtown.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay. Thank24 you.25 (Audience participat ion.)8

JOEL MYERS:	Okay .4	Everybody here sees I'm  holding5	up the sign calling for a rent rollback.6 Now, many people have  talked7 about the rent rollback but it 's sort of a demand8 made on the people up here, grant us a  rent9 rollback.10 And what I'm going to say  is11	that the people up here are not really listening12 to us because they are either  political13 appoint ees - -14 (Audience participation.)15 MR. JOEL MYERS:	- - of16 politicians who are paid by the landlords or   they17 are the direct landlord representatives. And  they18 are making a pile of money.19 Every money  that we  - - every20 dollar that we don' t have, that we have paid in21 rent , is a dollar that they stick in their22 pockets.23 So they are not listening to  us24 right now.25 Now, if you talk about a  rent12 
2 rollback, we are the ones, the tenants, that   have3 the power to bring it about. If we  organize4 together and we do it together in an  organized5 way, we can withhold part or all of our  rent6 until they see that if they  - -7 (Audience participation.)8	MR. JOEL MYERS:	- - want to9 collect any rent at all , they've got to have a10 rent that is acceptable to us. And that' s the11 power that we have.12 We are two- and - a-half million13 tenants. And as an organized force, we can  put14 that together and we can roll the rents  back15 ourselves. We can roll the rents back.  They' re16 not going to do it of their own  selves.17 What have they actually  done?18 They created a situation of permanently   tripling19 rents through a deliberately  creative housing20 shortage where no public housing has been  built21 since the years of Richard Nixon. That 's what  has22 been going on.23 At one time they made money  by24 building more housing and having more  volume25 rent. Now they make money by creating   shortages9 
2 and tripling the rents as people double up or   are3 left homeless in large numbers. There are  large4 numbers of people who don' t  - -5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Myers,6	could you wrap up, please.7	MR. JOEL MYERS:	make 8 there are a lot of those people who don' t make9 fifty times of $2000 rent , which is typically10 what a studio goes for this year in certain11 neighborhoods.12 So what I say is we have  to13 mobilize  our forces. The public representatives14 up here in a certain way because they  have15 created the housing  shortages  - -16 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Mr. Myers, 1718 MR. JOEL MYERS:	- - we can't19 look to them. We have to look to our  own20 strength. We have to organize towards a  citywide21 general rent strike.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay, Mr.23 Myers. Thank you.24 (Audience participation.)25 MS. APRIL REID:	My name is18 
2	April Reid.3 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	April Reid.4 MS. APRIL REID:	My name is5 April Reid and I'm a rent stabilized tenant.   But6 I don' t have a landlord horror story because my7 landlord is actually a very good  landlord.8 But I think the reason that  my9 landlord is a good landlord is because  my10 landlord did not go into the business of  renting11 to low income and rent stabilized people with   the12 idea that he was going to make prof its that rival13 these multi -million dollars that somebody like14 Donald Trump does.15 My landlord knows that he  has16 rent stabilized tenants. He knows he has  low17 income tenants. He did the studies he needed  to18 do. He knows what his costs are going to be.   He19 made realistic adjustments to everything. And   he20 doesn't force us out. He doesn't slumlord us.  He21 lives like a landlord lives and he  understands.22 He bought buildings for low prices. He  bought23 buildings  in low- income neighborhoods. He bought24 buildings that were rent stabilized. And  he25 handles that . He does not decide I have got  to5 
2get rich offof this building even though  I3didn' t spenda million for it , even though I4don' t have aluxury apartment. He lives on  his5means.6 And I think a lot of  landlords7 are going to have to start understanding  owning8 property in New York is not the way to get  rich.9 That 's - -10 (Audience part icipation.)11 MS. APRIL REID:	- - the end of12 it. They're not going to get rich. If you want  to13 get rich, go be a partner with Donald Trump.  With14 a $40 million you can get  rich.15 But you have to look at , you16 have low incomes, you have rent stabilized,  and17 you handle it and you don' t change it after you18 have taken your tax breaks and say, okay, now   I19 want to get rich.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 (Audience participation.)22 MS. VISSER:	Gregory Nelson.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is Mr. Nelson24 here?25 MS. VISSER:	Followed by On6 
2 Davis, Jane Public , Dawn Sullivan, Rebecca  Hall.3 MR. GREGORY NELSON:	Good4 evening, Mr. Chairman and Board Members. My  name5 is Gregory Nelson. I'm a tenant of Graham  Court6 Tenants Association  managed by Residential7 Management , Inc.8 I've lived in the apartment  that9 I'm in for at least forty years now. I  obtained10 it by way of succession rights. It 's a rent11 controlled apartment.12 However, now for the past  few13 years DHCR is attempting to change records  and14 forms to reflect as though I'm in a  rent15 stabilized apartment. I guess this is some  way16 that they can manipulat e the system to increase17 my rent.18 I've suffered in that  apartment19 in many different ways with my great  grandmother20 until she passed, with conditions of negl ect ,21 constant soot , fumes from a boiler not being22 maintained  monthly, elevator problems where  when23 you open the door, you just see the elevator24 shaft.25 The boiler, and not being  clean,2 
2 those fumes have caused me great many  health3 problems  -  asthma, bronchitis,  I've even  had4 carbon monoxide  found in my blood, I suffered5 with pneumonia in February.6	A garbage problem there.  Instead7 of there being cans everything is thrown out   in8 bags. So we are starting to have problems of   rat9 infestation.10 And calling the EPA and  other11 State and City and Federal agencies about  these12 problems and the landlord's neglect , they go13 untaken care of with just the buck being  passed.14 The superintendent15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you try16 to wrap up, Mr. Nelson.17 MR. GREGORY NELSON:	Yes.18 - - has been notif ied where other19 hazardous conditions of asbestos have been   found20 in the basement of the  apartment.21 My hope being here is trying  to22 say to you folks is that I think there  should23 definitely be a zero increase and rent  rollbacks24 and that these landlords and these agencies  that25 are supposed to help and protect tenants  be7 
2 looked into and investigated and made to do   their3 jobs.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.5 (Audience participation. )6 MS. VISSER:	On Davis, followed7 by Jane PUblic, Dawn Sullivan, Rebecca Hall ,  Fred8 Sahakian.9	MR. ON DAVIS:	Good afternoon.10 I have two minutes.11 I work with the Lower East  Side.12 I work at trying to be an organizer for the  last13 three years. So in one sense I have solidarity14 with all of my colleagues here and  tenant15 neighbors in the City.16 What we are rescinding tonight ,17 a rent rollback for New York  City.18 I just want to make mention19 that , you know, I don' t know what  to say when  I20 come up to the Board because I don' t really  feel21 that much that I'm really talking to the  Board22 that is going to regulate for the City. It  seems23 like you guys are  - -  clearly have defined24 yourselves in your character and your manner and25 in your comments that you support landlords, that10 
1	5232 you are not partial	- - I mean that you are3 partial.4 And , you know, I want you to5 know that you have a responsibility which  has6 been outlined, Dave Powell outlined , as to7 regulate for reasonable rents and fairness  for8 the City overall.9 The idea of rents and  landlords10 being in business, landlord is a  business.11	And,  first of all , you know,12 it 's a poor business man who only obtains one13 stream of income, as you know. So, you know,  just14 clearly recognize that most landlords  have15 multiple streams of income. They are crying   for16 the tax on building property and this, that  and17 the other, you know.18 And I'm sure that landlords,  you19 cover your butts with other streams of income   for20 your expenses in the event that tenants don't  pay21 or whatever property they have in society .22 They can't pay the rents because23 the minimum wage pays six dollars an hour. You24 know, you multiply that by how many times?  Two25 hundred and sixty dollars a month and  working12 
2 five days a week, forty hours a week, how  the3 hell are you going to pay the rent and take   care4 of these things?5 So stop pret ending.6	Now, you know, is that the7 (unintelligible) are based on prof it. They are8 not based on human needs within our society. You9 have responsibility to recognize that. You take   a10 back seat sometimes and allow those things   to11 affect yourselves. You have a domino effect.   It12 doesn' t get any bett er. We' re living in a time13 when people are willing to put their lives   in14 spiritual hands for their own causes. You know,15 people are being homeless directly because  of16 landlord aggression and landlord harassment  and17 putting people in the  streets.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you19 wrap up, please.20 MR. ON DAVIS:	Okay.21 My last comment I want to  make22 is this because two minut es is nothing.23 Let me see in my notes.24 (Unintelligible.)25 MR. ON DAVIS:	No matter what he7 
2 thinks, when he gets on the train and sees  the3 working class people of this City struggling   to4 pay their rents to maintain their  apartments,5 when they go in the back door, they get beat   over6 the heat and get nipped in the butt by   somebody7 who maintains that landlords don' t make  enough8 money.9 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,10 Mr. Davis.11 (Audience participat ion.)12 MS. VISSER:	Jane Public,13 followed by Dawn Sullivan, Rebecca  Hall.14 MS. JANE PUBLIC:	Good evening,15 Board Members.16 First of all , I would like to17 compliment you - - yes, a compliment  to the   RGB18 for having someone up there that is  representing19 this community and the  tenants.20 My only thing now, and I  hope21 Mayor Bloomberg does see this, I would like   to22 see an Asian member up there. I would like to   see23 an openly gay member up there to be reflective   of24 the City and the tenants. And openly gay,  yes.25 (Audience participation.)2 
2 MS. JANE PUBLIC:	Everyone has3 the right to a standard of living adequat e  for4 health and well -being of him and herself and of5 their family, including food, clothing,  housing6 and medical care.7 This is drafted  - - Article  25 to8 the Declarat ion of Human Rights Bill draft ed in9 1947. I'm going to very brief. It's been a  long10 night.11 I'm asking you, please,12 Thursday, tomorrow, when you make your vote, more13 than ever since 9/11/2001 there should be no   need14 for any increase. Let 's do something historical15 in this City.16 (Audience participation.)17 MS. JANE PUBLIC:	Let 's one time18 unify the board and the tenants, the people  of19 New York. No increase. That 's all I'm asking.  No20 increase.21 God bless you.22 (Audience participation.)23 MS. VISSER:	Dawn Sullivan,24 Rebecca Hall , Fred Sahakian, David Temple.25 MS. DAWN SULLIVAN:	I'll tell2 
2 you, that clock of yours, your second hand   goes3 by faster than anything I've ever  seen.4 I'm Chair of the East  Side5 Tenants Coalition and we represent thousands   of6 tenants on the East Side of Manhattan. We  are7 very concerned about the crisis that exists   in8 the City with affordable  housing.9 I'm not going to go over all  the10 statistics. People have already done that. But   I11 do want to remind you it is not your mandate   to12 raise rents, only to make rent adjustments.  And13 you can roll back the rents. And that' s exactly14 what we are asking of  you.15 The tragedy of 9/11 has  left16 thousands of tenants unemployed and in danger  of17 losing their homes. The tragedy itself is  being18 used as an excuse to use our tax dollars   for19 corporate welfare and to subsidize the high   rents20 in Lower Manhattan.21 Rent gouging and prof iteering22 are at an all - time high and any tenant can tell23 you about the huge jumps that take place in   their24 buildings when tenants move or are driven out   of25 their homes.2 
2 In my own building one apartment3 jumped from $2000 a month to $5500 . Even anti -4 tenant newspapers are writ ing about how5 businesses are getting sick of paying  housing6 allowances to get the staff to relocate  here.7 Vacancy decontrol has cost  the8 City about 148,000 apartments. And you  people9 have to really start thinking about what MCis  are10 doing to people, what individual  apartment11 improvement increases are costing . Owners have an12 option. They can file for hardship. We don' t have13 that option.14 And I don' t know what it 's going15 to take to make you act responsibly because  you16 seem to feel that you can milk tenants in  order17 that the owners can have a ride on the  gravy18 train. It 's just not fair year after year after19 year.20 This year, if ever a year  was21 justif ied for a freeze or a rollback, this is  the22 year.23 Please, think about tenants  for24 a change. It 's been very rare in the past even25 when the Price Index has been moderate,  you've2 
2 gone way over the Price Index to give landlords3 huge prof its.4	This year, please, give us  a5 break.6 Thank you.7 (Audience participation.)8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.9 MS. VISSER:	Rebecca Hall ,10 followed by Fred Sahakian, David  Temple.11 Is Rebecca Hall here?12 (No response.)13 MS. VISSER:	Fred Sahakian?14 David Temple?15 MR. FRED SAHAKIAN:	Good16 afternoon.17 My name is Fred Sahakian.  I'm18 born and raised in New York City, raised in   a19 rent - stabilized apartment.20 MS. VISSER:	Use the mike.21 MR. FRED SAHAKIAN:	Sorry.22 My name is Fred. I was born  and23 raised in a rent - stabilized apartment with a24 disabled mom, born and raised on  welfare.25 Today I stand before you. I'm  a10 
2 young man, although I don' t feel so young3 sometimes. I'm a working man, vot er, a great  job,4 a graduate degree. And I am the example of  the5 American dream, at least I think I  am.6 And today I stand before you  and7 I have my own stabilized  apartment.8	My mom is still in that9 apartment that I was raised in, barely  surviving10 with governmental	financial assistance, and  I11 help when I can. Otherwise I'm trying to pay   my12 own bills: my college loans, my gas, my  bills,13 and the big one which is  rent.14 I just received my lease  renewal15 and I could have passed out considering the   fact16 that  I - -  in the past  two years in this building17 no repairs have been done, they don' t clean  the18 building, nothing, nothing is changed,   repairing19 nothing. Being a landlord must be great.  You20 never are out of business. You never really   have21 to compete for customers. You can provide  morbid22 living conditions and still be in business.  Now23 that's what I call the American dream. I  want24 that one day maybe.25 Landlords complain about  costs.9 
2 My friend is a landlord and she tells me  about3 these super grants when you get new windows, new4 boilers, you name it. And when it comes  to5 raising rents, she still does it. She got  free6 windows, so why does she do it? Because  it's7 expect ed.8	Today I'm asking, I guess  on9 behalf of many other New Yorkers trying to   live10 the American dream and some just basically   trying11 to live for you not to do what is  expected.12 This is my first time.  I've13 never even seen any of you before, even heard   of14 you. Don't do what is  expected.15 What, do I mean?16 Well , you can go back to the17 Mayor and the Governor and tell them what I  mean18 by that. What I mean is that when I was in   grad19 school and I took government  administration,  the20 best lesson I learned was that you must do  what21 is the best for the people every single time,   for22 the taxpayer over and over and  over.23 (Audience participat ion.)24 MR. FRED SAHAKIAN:	Whether you25 represent the landlords or whether9 
2 (Audience participat ion.)3 MR. FRED SAHAKIAN:	- - the4 public or represent anyone else, your job   sitting5 up there, you must be ethical and moral. Do  what6 is best for the people.7	Yes, landlords are people;8 believe in what ever they say. But for the total9 - for everyone  - - I'm sorry for the time - - I  ask10 today that when you go to bed tonight as  you're11 developing your vot es in your head because at12 this point you should not have votes in  your13 head , you remind yourselves to do the ethical14 thing.15 Don't do what is expect ed. Do16 what is right for the people so that I can   live17 my dream and that my mom can simply  live.18 Thank you very much.19 (Audience participat ion.)20 MS. VISSER:	David Temple,21 Teina Semorile, Ann Messner, Marcella Lowery, Liz22 Simmonds.23 MS. LIZ SIMMONDS:	Yes.24 MS. VISSER:	Okay. You're next.25 Irwin Ironstone, Jessica Walker.8 
1	5332	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Marcella,3	you're next. Sorry.4	MS. MARCELLA LOWERY:	Yes. Hi!5	Good evening.6	My name is Marcella Lowery.  I7 live on 116th Street and Seventh Avenue,  Central8 Harlem, in a landmark property that is run  by9 Residential Management	a/k/a Graham Court  Tenants10 Association, President , me.11 Okay.12 In the past , because they had13 taken this building over in 1987, we have  had14 rent strikes, many filings with DHCR, letters   to15 landlords.16 Now, this is what we've  gotten17 from 1987 to 2002 : elevators that break down,18 cracks, non- union workers in a union building,19 soot , asbestos, fumes from the basement making20 many tenants sick, poor water pressure, often   no21 hot water, a disregard for landmark rules   for22 repairs, ignoring judges' orders to  repair,23 dragging tenants back over and over and   over,24 harassment , disrespect , and the smug sense of25 entitlement.7 
2 When people complained years ago3 in Harlem, it was good enough for us. Now  that4 it's want ed back, it 's too good for us.5 After 9/11, I would think  that6 we learned something in this town. I'm a   New7 Yorker. Okay?8 We learned nothing. The greed  is9 galactical. And I want to know when you're  going10 to stop because we have a housing holocaust   in11 Harlem.12 (Audience participation.)13 MS. MARCELLA LOWERY:	They are14 trying to displace us and get rid of us.  We15 cannot afford.16 (Audience participat ion.)17 MS. MARCELLA LOWERY:	And I18 speak for the tenants and the senior  citizens,19 these rent increases. What we've got , we've got20 new windows, and then we get an MCI increase.   And21 we have paid our rent from  1987.22 Now, people sit up here, and  I'm23 not so naive. I know the deal has already   been24 cut. I know the decision' s already been made.25 It 's good of you to be here because this is like2 
2 icing on the cake. Okay? We know the  drill.3 But , my God , if you've got any4 conscience at all , if you've learned a damn  thing5 since 9/11 when we got bitch slapped in New  York6 City, think about the people, for Christ 's sake,7 for once.8 And if landlords are  suffering9 so much, let them open the books. We never  see10 books.11 (Audience participation.)12 MS. MARCELLA LOWERY:	We've got13 someone - -14 (Audience participat ion.)15 MS. MARCELLA LOWERY:16 (Unintelligible.)17 (Audience participat ion.)18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Ms. Holder.19 MS. HOLDER:	Can you tell me20 where you live in Harlem?21 MS. PRISCILLA LOWERY:	Graham22 Court , 116th, 1925 Seventh Avenue.23 MS. HOLDER: And how long  have24 you lived there?25 MS. PRISCILLA LOWERY:	I've2 
1	536 2 lived there since 1986.3 MS. HOLDER:	And what would say4 the average rent in that building  is?5 MS. PRISCILLA LOWERY:	Well, now6 the rents are close to $2000 because they've   been7 raised arbitrarily after warehousing for six8 years, which we tried to stop,  warehousing9 fourteen apartments.10 The average rent is close to 11	$875/$900.12 Now, it 's a landmark building,13 of two buildings, 79 and 86 and Broadway  that14 Landmarks approved for window restoration. We   got15 aluminum.16 MS. HOLDER:	And what are the  -17 - how many MCis did you all  have?18 MS. PRISCILLA LOWERY:	Well,19 right now it 's the windows. They haven' t put it20 through yet because there are so many  violations21 on the building that they refuse to  fix.22 You can't have judges  there,23 which are winning  - - windows  - - when they are24 telling tenants we don' t want to pay rent . We pay25 our rent. And most of the tenants that moved   up12 
2around thet ime I did have restored our3apartmentsby ourselves . We restored and stripped4and fixed.Okay?5My rent was legal when I  moved6 in and it ' s still legal . People would  say, well ,7 you got a pretty good deal in New York  City.8 Yeah, we've landscaped  the9 garden. I do my painting, my stripping,  my10 repairing, my plumbing. The landlord is getting   a11 good deal here and a good  ride.12 Don't fall for the same  sucker13 routine. Okay? Give us a break, please .14 (Audience participation.)15 MS . VISSER :	Trina Semorile .16 MS . TRINA SEMORILE :	My name is17 Trina Semorile.18 I would like to remind the  Board19 and the people left here tonight about the  recent20 tax bribery scandal of large real  estate21 landlords in New York City . There are ongoing and22 regular scandals in HPD, in DHCR and  the23 Buildings Department. They are always to  the24 disadvantage  of tenants.25 And we are the ones who  suffer.6 
2 When my apartment building  burnt3 down, the contractor did the work of  rebuilding4 it without a permit and the Buildings  Department5 refused to pursue a complaint even they had  no6 record and they had Fire Department records  that7 said they were supposed to have a  permit.8 There have been issues of fuel ,9 the price of fuel. Rents were raised because  the10 fuel had gone up. Somebody here tonight said   fuel11 had gone up.12 I want to remind you how  warm13 it 's been. It hasn' t snowed in two years.14 (Audience participation.)15 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	My landlord16 turns the heat off in March. He doesn't turn  it17 on until December sometime. But I will say  that18 this year he turned it on in October. I  almost19 fell down in shock.20 But , please, you have to face21 reality. The price of fuel may have gone up,  but22 I'm telling you they made a profit on the  fuel23 because they weren' t burning any.24 (Audience participation.)25 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	This is2 
1	5392 the first year there' s been a woman up there.  I3 want to remind you that women and  children4 comprise the majority of homeless people in  New5 York and they are the kids  homeless.6 (Audience participation.)7 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	Women8 continue to be economically  disadvantaged because9 of wage discrimination,  housing discrimination10 and the very fact that the last  mayoral11 administration in this City played out a  deep12 hatred of women particularly  against poor women.13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	And if I15 may take just a couple more seconds, I would   like16 to remind everyone that before the bottom  of17 Manhattan fell down, the last mayor  diverted18 funds that were earmarked for affordable  housing19 and said , screw you, peopl e, I'll do whatever I20 want with the money.21 The refusal to have  transparency22in governmentis what allows the corruption  to23continue.24(Audience participation.)25MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	There' s a
2 growing collection against the Rent  Guidelines3 Board and you haven' t been stopped. You've got  to4 have representation.5	MR. STAROBIN:	Excuse me. Are6 you accusing us of corrupt ion?7 (Audience participation.)8	MR. TRINA SEMORILE:	Iam9 accusing you of lack of transparency  in your10 practices, which was a favorite tactic of  the11 last administration.12 And13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	- - and I15 seem to distinctly remember when the  Rent16 Guidelines Board refused to disclose   information17 before the vot e was taken to raise our rents.18 Transparency, transparency,19 transparency.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	Do you22 remember - -2 3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	Do you25 remember - -24 
2	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.3	MS. TRINA SEMORILE:	Do you4	remember Judge Brandeis?5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We appreciate6 your vote of confidence. Thank  you.7 (Audience participation.)8	MS. VISSER:	The next speaker9 is Liz Simmonds, followed by Irwin  Ironstone,10 Jessica Walker, Matt  Viggiano.11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Go ahead , Ms.12 Simmonds.13 MS. LIZ SIMMONDS:	I am a tenant14 also at Graham Court in  Harlem.15 I'm Liz Simmonds. I've been  here16 for the past sixteen  years.17 Why must tenants pay rent  for18 services not rendered? I have had a serious   leak19 in my half bathroom for at least six years  now.20 And with each passing year, more wat er  comes21 down. And as recently as three months ago,  the22 super tells me he' ll check it .23 He looks at it and says he  can't24 find the leak.25 Approximately three years ago,12 
2 the super claimed twice that the leak was   fixed.3 So same bathroom was scraped , plastered and4 repainted at least three  times.5 Guess what? Same bathroom6 ceiling and walls are now falling in  again.7 The landlords have  violations8 that go unremedied  for years while tenants  live9 in dangerous, unhealthy apartments and  rents10 continue to escalate.11 Why is this type of  harassment12 allowed?13 Why do we continue to  have14 electrical brownouts? Approximat ely four months15 ago, my kitchen outlet sizzled and  sparked,16 (Audience participation.)17 MS. LIZ SIMMONDS:	causing18 the electricity in half of my apartment to  be19 knocked out as well as my appliance.  We20 immediately pulled wires out of the socket  and21 turned off breakers to prevent a  fire.22 Certified mail , return receipt23 letters and faxed to landlord have  gone24 unanswered ; telephone messages left are not25 returned.2 
2 With all these existing  hazards,3 I'm still paying my rent. For this  dangerous4 living, why are landlords not  penalized?5 If rents are reduced by DHCR  for6 lack of services and building violations, why  are7 lease renewals permitted with a rent  increase?8 Rents should be frozen at9 lowered rent , and when repairs have been properly10 completed, your rent should increase only  from11 that point on. If it takes fifteen years  to12 complete the repair, it should take fifteen  years13 for your rent to go up.14 (Audience participation.)15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Wrap up,16 please.17 MS. LIZ SIMMONDS:	Okay .18 There is no punitive  incentive19 to make landlords live up to their  part.20 The court system supports  the21 landlord with tenants idly standing by being  told22 to wait their turn and to keep  quiet.23 There seems to be a lot of24 animosity towards tenants in  landlord/tenant25 court . Everyone is anxious to move the case out2 
2 as fast as possible, contrary to the needs of  the3 tenants, who usually are not represented  by4 attorneys.5 Once tenants are forced to  sign6 court - ordered stips, the landlord does not honor7 the stips. If tenants do not abide by the  stip,8 they are immediately  evicted.9 If the landlord can pass on  his10 legal  fees to tenant ,11	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you12 wrap up, please.13 MS. LIZ SIMMONDS:	I am. I am.14 - - why can't I be reimbursed  for15 my vacation days used to meet that  appointment16 when the super did not show?  Okay.17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.18 (Audience participation.)19 MS. VISSER:	Irwin Ironstone.20 MR. IRWIN IRONSTONE:	My name is21 Ironstone. I have a public access TV  show.22 I would like to make a modest23 proposal. Why don't we increase the rent  twenty24 and twenty- five percent?25 You want these people here  to12 
2 move in with you.3 (Audience part icipation.)4 MR. IRWIN IRONSTONE:	If you5 have grandchildren, if you have parents who   are6 in apartments which they can't afford , that 's7 what you will do. That 's one issue.8 Again, I really feel you have  a9 very difficult job. Number one, there is   really10 not affordable housing in this City. In the   last11 mayoral  election proposals by several  candidates12 indicated that were going use $500 million   for13 the World Trade Center and about $400 or  $50014 million from Co-op - - not Co- op City - -15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Battery Park16 City.17 MR.  IRWIN IRONSTONE:	- - Battery18 Park City to fund approximately $5 billion   worth19 of new housing.20 Some of the proposals  - - and,21 again, I have been in Family Court and also   in22 Housing Court. In Housing Court ninety percent   of23 landlords, large landlords, are  represented.24 Maybe ten percent of tenants are  initially25 represented.2 
2 As far as fines, two percent  of3 actions for def iciencies, for violat ions, result4 in fines. What happens is you have a system  where5 effectively  landlords are investing. They are  not6 improving the City.7 I haven' t heard any of the8 landlords here complain saying, well , I'm  going9 to sell my apartment. Why? In the last five   years10 there' s been a hundred percent	increase in the11 value of those apartments in the  City.12 If you are talking about13 costs,14 (Audience part icipation.)15 MR. IRWIN IRONSTONE:	one of16 the issues that you have to address is there   are17 hidden costs. There are also hidden  gains.18 I think that when you look  at19 the picture  overall , you have to look at it  - -20 again, I say you have a very difficult  task.21 There are a lot of issues  here.22 I would like you also to look  at23 the Mt. Laurel decision in New Jersey  because24 what it did is it forced housing to be   integrated25 in all parts of the City. If you don' t take2 
2 action to prevent the exclusion of minorities   and3 of the poor, you are going to be forced by  court4 action effectively to do  that.5	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,6 Mr. Ironstone.7 (Audience participation.)8 MS. VISSER:	Jessica Walker,9 followed by Matthew Viggiano  for Senator Connor,10 Dorothy Williams- Pereira .11 MS. JESSICA WALKER:	Good12 evening.13 My name is Jessica Walker.  I14 reside  in a one-bedroom,  rent - stabilized15 apartment in Brooklyn.16 I am here tonight to17 respectfully urge the Board to vote against   any18 rent increases tomorrow.19 Shelter is a basic human need ,20 not unlike food and water. Without it peopl e put21 their very survival at  risk.22 Like farmers, landlords23 certainly do deserve to make a small prof it  for24 their efforts in providing basic needs.  But25 allowing landlords to get rich while the  homeless6 
2 rates spiral out of control and the working  poor3 are forced to pay more than half of their   incomes4 for a place to live is simply  unconscionable.5 The current economic climate  in6 New York City is	I'm sure you've heard all  the7 statistics a lot today . But they can be summed  up8 in a few staggering  statistics.9	First of all , tens of thousands10 of New Yorkers have been laid off since 9/11   and11 more layoffs are expected.12 Every night over 33 , 000 New13 Yorkers sleep in City shelters, 14,000 of   which14 are children. These are the highest numbers   in15 the City' s history.16 In addit ion, over 26, 000 New17 Yorkers were evicted last year, most of  those18 because they couldn' t afford to pay their  rent.19 And, of course, because of  9/11,20 higher numbers are expect ed this year.21 How landlords can even ask for  a22 raise at this critical juncture is beyond  me.23 What is fair and right and humane and just   is24 exactly the opposite, a rent  decrease.25 I hope that you will take a  bold10 
2 step tomorrow by voting against any type of  rent3 increase tomorrow, and perhaps implement a  rent4 decrease, which is obviously fair, just and  will5 appease this drastic housing situation in  this6 great City.7 And  if not , shame on you.8 (Audience participation.)9 MR. MATTHEW VIGGIANO:	Good10 evening. I'm presenting  test imony on behalf of11 Senator Martin Connor.12 The Rent Guidelines Board  must13 put an end here and now to its  annual14 determination that rents have to go  up.15 This Board should make  history16 this year by ordering rent reductions. It is  the17 right thing to do.18 For the first time in history,19 the Board has before it a negative Price Index   of20 Operating Costs. The evidence before this  Board21 provides ample basis to reduce apartment   rents.22 Furthermore, the City' s economy would benefit23 from rent reductions. Such a stimulus to  the24 economy would serve a much needed  public25 interest.2 
1	5502	A bit of legislative  history3 might also be helpful.  In 1974, Senate  Democrats4 in Albany proposed  the Emergency Tenant5 Protection Act and participated	in drafting this6 vital law. As part of the 1974  negotiations,7 statutory language was purposely  changed with8 regard to the setting of rent  guidelines.9 The former Rent  Stabilization10 Law language referred to " guidelines for rent11 increases. " But in 1974, we changed that in the12 ETPA to "guidelines for rent adjustments. "13 That change was made on  purpose.14 The Legislature  foresaw the day when inflation15 would no longer be a problem and prices would   be16 flat or decreasing.  In the EPTA the State17 Legislature  specif ically gave the Rent Guidelines18 Board authority to adjust rents downward as   well19 as to increase rents.20 In setting the guidelines  for21 2002 - 2003 , you should use your statutory22 authority to reduce rents. In the year 2002  we23 have arrived at the time of decreasing  prices.24 Your index says so.25 Fuel costs have gone down3 
2 drastically. Other costs are down. Mortgage   rates3 have plunged and owners have done  exceedingly4 well in refinancing higher rate mortgages  and5 lowering their expenses.6	Aside  from these factors, owners7 have reaped enormous profits from changes   forced8 through the Legislature in '97 by the  Governor9 and the Senate in Albany. Large vacancy   increases10 were mandat ed by statute and owners have been11 able to deregulat e tens of thousands of12 apartments through improvements to  vacant13 apartments.14 Whether all those  improvement15 were honestly done and paid for we shall   never16 know, but I suspect many apartments are  being17 deregulated that do not meet the  legal18 requirements.19 The bottom line is that  owners20 have done exceptionally well under  rent21 stabilization in recent years. Their costs are22 down and their aggregate rents are way  up.23 On the other hand, Census  Bureau24 data shows that tenants in New York City have   had25 to pay more and more of their incomes for  rent7 
2	over the last few decades.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you4	wrap up, please.5	MR. MATTHEW VIGGIANO:	Yes. This6	is the last part.7	It is time for tenants to8 receive fair considerat ion. You have it in your9 power to help hard- pressed tenants and to give  a10 shot in the arm to the City' s economy at the same11 time.12 I urge you to vote for a  rent13 decrease this year.14 (Audience participation. )15 MR. MATTHEW VIGGIANO:	Thank you16 very much.17 MS. VISSER:	Dorothy Williams-18 Pereira, followed by Steve Seltzer and  Marina19 Metalios.20 MS. DOROTHY WILLIAMS- PEREIRA:21 My name  is Dorothy Williams- Pereira. And  it ' s22 about time that we get some green of  the23 government  in New York.24 We have to elect Green  Party25 people and get people that are appointed  by8 
2 Republicans  and Democrats who vote for raising3 rents when landlords are not even doing  the4 repairs they claim to do.5 Everybody said most of6 everything. We need to expand it because  even7 those tenants that are in apartments that are  not8 regulated are living like dogs and not  getting9 heat. It 's not only the ones that are in the10 regulated apartments. We have to expand this   rent11 program to other apartments and stop the   gouging12 that landlords are doing in the  City.13 And many of the landlords don' t14 even live in the City.15 And we've got to get the  people16 off these community boards that are not  elected17 that are ruining the community, ruining the   small18 businesses in their communities and ruining their19 community in general and sit on boards and  more20 than one board and ruining our  City.21 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you22 (Audience participation.)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Reading the24 names of the remaining witnesses,  there's25 approximately twenty, and we' ll see who' s left.2

I'm  a19 tenant.20 And I ask you to approve a  rent21 rollback or at least no increase, not only  for22 the tenants' s sake, but in the long- range23interest ofthe landlords and for the  credibility24of the RentGuidelines Board.25Landlords, think of how  strong
2 your case will be in the future when your  costs3 go up, and they usually do, if you agree with  a4 rollback now when your costs are down.5 Guidelines Board: think of  how6 much stronger your credibility will be in  the7 future when you approve increases, as  sometime8 you inevitably will , and tomorrow you roll back9 rents because landlord costs have  dropped.10 As for the tenants, the  tenant11 associations,  if the Rent Guidelines Board drops12 rents tomorrow, our work will really be cut  out13 for us next time around but I'm sure  our14 ingenuity will be up to the task .15 Thank you.16 MS . MARINA METALIOS:	Hello,17 boys! Thanks for letting me testify. My name   is18 Marina  Metalios.	I'm a rent - regulated tenant. I19 live in Stuyvesant Town.20 I would like to urge you  to21 think carefully about the results of  your22 decision tomorrow and the kind of New York  that23 you will shape and to make New York more  lively24 and unique with your decision.25 A couple of words about2 
2 liveliness and uniqueness.3 As you know, we are a city  of4 renters. There are more renters in New York  City5 than owners. It 's about a two- thirds/one - third6 break. This is unique.7 You should know that there  are8 more low- income people in rent - regulated housing9 than there is in public housing in New York   City10 which is a unique function of our  privately-11 owned rental housing market.12 And New York City has  rent13 regulations. Great!14 Now, I'm not going to burden  you15 with the belief that rent regulation is  the16 linchpin solution to the affordable  housing17 problem in New York. It 's not. It is dramatically18 flawed but , as cockeyed and as flawed as it is,19 the system is progressive with regards to  income,20 houses more people of color than whites, and   is21 the reason why a lot of elderly get to stay   in22 their homes now.23 The rent regulation system to  me24 keeps New York City lively and it's the  thing25 that keeps New York City recognizable as New   York2 
2City instead ofbeing all rich, all young and  all3whit e.4And this is where you come  in.5And please knowthat we know that you are  acting6 in a very  anti - tenant game. You have heard  " the"7 story about how swollen and selfish the  system8 is, how many thousands of households were  evicted9 last year .10 Let me remind you that your  poor11 tax has contributed to the loss of 200, 00012 affordable units. Let me remind you about one   of13 the things - -  I see the clock ticking  - - there is14 no jurisdiction in the Unit ed States in which a15 full - time minimum wage earner can pay the fair16 market  rent in that jurisdiction. Nowhere.17 In New York City the household18 has to bring in over nineteen bucks an hour. So19 that means most of you can afford fair  market20 rents, but most of us  cannot.21 (Audience participation.)22 MS. MARINA METALIOS:	The task23 before you is clear. Read your own statistics,24 look at us, don' t even bother freezing. Just  roll25 the rent right back .6 
2	Thank you.3	(Audience participation. )4	MS. VISSER:	April Sandmeyer.5	MS. APRIL SANDMEYER:	I am April6 Sandmeyer. I'm a rent - stabilized , native  New7 Yorker.8 I urge you to take into9 consideration the impact of 9/11 in rolling  back10 the rents.11 Most of my rent - regulated12 friends have lost over ninety percent of  their13 incomes since 9/11, myself included , and are14 holding onto our apartments by the skin of   our15 teeth, taking cash advances on our credit cards,16 getting loans, et  cetera.17 We don' t qualify for rent18 assistance because the average rents are too   high19 that we pay.20 Everyone that I know is  paying21 fifty percent of their income or more in rent ,22 including  senior citizens and handicapped.23 At the Gustav Adolphus  Senior24 Citizen Center on East 22nd Street the  social25 worker has seen more eviction of tenants,  of6 
2 rent - regulated senior citizens since September3 11th than ever before.4 I pay over $1400 a month to  live5 in a building that has been infested with  rodents6 for over forty years. I've been trying to get  my7 apartment paint ed for the past twelve years. HPD8 just gave fifteen violations to my landlord   for9 my apartment alone.10 The tenants in my building  are11 treated like criminals because they are rent -12 regulated and afraid to complain for fear  of13 retaliation. It is criminal to approve  rent14 increases to landlords who have  violations,15 refuse to make repairs, harass tenants, find  ways16to evicttenants on trumped - up charges.17And I urge you to vote  to18decreaserents.19Thank you .20(Audience participation.)21MS . VISSER:	Josefina Ventura,22followedby Ruitang Liu, John D'Oracia.23MS. JOSEFINA VENTURA:	Good24evening,ladies and gentlemen.25My name is Josefina Ventura.  And
2 I come from the Riverside  Neighborhood3 Association  in Washington Heights.4 I'm here tonight to  strongly5 urge the Rent Guidelines Board to vot e zero6 increase for one-year leases and zero for  two-7 year leases - -8 (Audience participation.)9 MS. JOSEPHINE VENTURA:	on10 rent - regulated housing units, and to maintain the11 elimination of the poor  tax.12 Evidence from this year is  that13 landlords' operating expenses have  dropped14 significantly for the first time since the  Board15 began taking an annual survey in 1969, but at   the16 same time their profits have enormously  grown.17 The devastating impact of  the18 recession and the September 11th attack  have19 drastically increased the unemployment  of our20 low- income families. As a result , thousands of21 men, women and children end up sleeping   in22 municipal shelters each night.23 With more than 100,000 jobs  lost24 in New York since September 11th, New York25 households, in particular renter householders,2 
2 have been forced to get by with fewer and   fewer3 resources.4 Lower- wage workers have been5 pushed to the limit facing evictions due to  job6 losses or reduction in  income.7 For the Rent Guidelines Board  to8 ignore this reality would be to absolutely   ignore9 its obligation under the law to prot ect New York10 City tenants.11 I believe that the price  index12 methodology  is one- sided in favor of landlords.13 The Rent Guidelines Board relies on a study  that14 focuses on changes in their operating cost while15 ignoring changes in their income, twisting  the16 entire rent guideline process in favor of  the17 landlords.18 Why not to ask them to  open19 their books? I consider it is an obsolet e and20 unreliable method that should be  disregarded.21 It would be very fair to  the22 tenants that the Rent Guidelines Board base   any23 increases on operating  and maintenance	costs as24 well as operating  income.25 Approving2 
1	5642 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you3 wrap up, please.4 MS. JOSEPHINE VENTURA:	Yes.5 Sure.6 Approving excessive rent7 increases will simply accelerat e the8 disappearance  of affordable low rental housing9 citywide. They will force the poorest tenants  to10 make even more desperat e choices between paying11	for rent and other necessities. And they will12 contribut e to increases in homelessness  among New13 York City households.14 Enough is enough. Please do  not15 increase our rents.16 (Audience participation.)17 MS.

I  come24 from 3 1 Vesey Street in Manhattan.	I'm a rent -25 stabilized tenant.12 
2 I come here to ask you to  not3 give any increase for rent for the coming   year.4 (Audience participation.)5	MR . RUITANG LIU:	My mother and6 my two brothers we came to the Unit ed States  in7 1997. Unfortunately a year later she passed  away8 while she was working. So there was nobody   to9 take care of us.10 And after school my brother  and11 I had to work part time to support ourselves.  We12 had to pay eighty percent of our income  towards13 our rent.14 Frequently we do not have  heat15 and hot water in the buildings. However,  last16 year, the landlord was able to get several  MCI17 increases. On to my renewal increases, I had   to18 pay an additional six percent for MCI and   another19 six percent for retroactive increases.20 So that 's why I had to pay21 almost eighty percent of my income. So  it's22 terribl e.23 I just want to know, a lot  of24 immigrants just like us, they have to pay  higher25 rent and don' t have the money.6 
2 So it's ridiculous for us . And I3 just hope that you members of the Rent  Guidelines4 Boarsd vote to not increase the rent for the  next5 two years .6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS :	Thank you,7 sir.8 (Audience participation. )9	MS.

I 'm Toby
14 Thompson. I live at 12- 14 East 72nd Street , which15 are two buildings joined together to form a  six-16 story rent - stabilized apartment building with17 twenty - three apartments.18 I am speaking at the  suggestion19 of Liz Krueger because we feel that this  owner20 occupancy issue may have rent implications .21 Our building was purchased  in22 January of this year by Steven Croman,  Harriet23 Croman and Edward Croman. The new owners have  now24 indicated that they wish to empty all  twenty-25 three apartments and convert them into  one10 
2 quadruplex and one duplex to house two   families3 and their sons.4 We three are long- term rent5 tenants and we would like to read our  landlord' s6 request into the public record to illustrate  what7 we feel is an outrageous abuse of the  owner8 occupancy law and another instance of  landlord9 greed.10 This is from my Notice of  Non-11 Renewal and the Landlord' s Intention for12 redesigning  the building.13 "Harriet Croman intends, in  good14 faith, on making the apartments that comprise   the15 First , Second, Third and Fourth Floor of the16 Subject Building into one quadruplex unit  -17 wherein she and her family will  primarily18 reside . . . . At present , Harriet Croman and her19 husband , Steven Croman, have two children,  Jake20 (who is five years of age) and  Adam Joshua	(who21 is an infant). In addition, Harriet Croman22 employs a live- in nanny and will continue to  do23 so after she moves into the 72nd Street ...Unit.24 " In addition,  Harriet Croman25 intends . . .on making the apartments that comprise2

I attended Cooper6 Union.7 Before I finish the jerk's8 plea - - that 's spelled j- e- r-k - - he ends with:9	" In addition, the 72nd Street10 Lower Unit will enable Harriet Croman to  obtain11 another dog . At present , Harriet cannot obtain12 another dog ... " at their cooperative	" at 137 East13 36th Street " because the building does not allow14 dogs .15 " In fact , Harriet and Steven16 Croman were threatened with litigat ion regarding17 the dog that they presently possess ." And the18 dog' s name is Eddie.19 They take their dog to court20 with them whenever  they appear . This guy is j- e-21 r-k. There are twenty- three people living in this22 building. I've been there thirty years . Thirty23 years, thirty years. This jerk can buy a  building24 somewhere else. He doesn 't have to do this.25 Thank you .10 
2	(Audience participation.)3	MR. BILL DUBETZ:	The issue4 here is the law. The intent of law is not to   take5 a building, sell it to a person, whatever  deal6 that is made - -7	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We have no8	jurisdiction over that.9	MR. BILL DUBETZ:	The intent of10 the law is not to vacate a building of  twenty-11 four tenants so that the owner can move in  and12 jerk off and not sell this to himself .13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. VISSER:	Yarrow Regan.15 MR. BILL DUBETZ:	It 's a law.16 A VOICE:	You're now going to17 run out of time because of  this.18 MS. YARROW REGAN:	My name is19 Yarrow Regan. And I've been taken for six   non-20 payment proceedings,	four property damage  suits.21 I was arrest ed  - - my  landlord had me arrested for22 allegedly stealing a mailbox and I'm currently   in23 a holdover.24 I resided in this apartment  for25 four years.10 
2 People say to me why don' t you3 just take the rent you put in escrow and  move4 out. I would like very much to do that , but  there5 is nowhere else to go. There are no other rent -6 stabilized or affordable housing for me to  move7 into.8 This pattern of harassment  isn't9 for me alone. I've been finding out that  many10 single women are being harassed by  their11 landlords.12 We cannot afford  - -13 (Audience part icipation. )14 MS. YARROW REGAN:	We've been15 target ed. We cannot afford attorneys . The Legal16 Aid attorneys, who are the pro bono   attorneys17 that we do get , are not proactive on our behalf.18 A rent rollback would  positively19 impact on the quality of my  life.20 I lost my job as a result  of21 9/11. I have gone into debt. If I got a  rent22 rollback, I would be able to pay my debts which23 include IRS and New York State  debt.24 I still have time. Okay.25 When the new supers took over  in2 
2 my building,  the services were seriously  reduced.3 There were no  - -  there' s no cleaning of the4 lobby. They're no security. My water was cut  off5 in my kitchen for three months. I did not get  a6 rent abatement for this.7 I pay the rent to my landlord.  I8 get a reduction of services and I'm  harassed.9 On June 13th I was harassed  by10 my landlord and one of his business  partners11 standing in the hallway screaming and cursing   at12 me trying to stop me from leaving the  premises.13 This is domest ic violence. And I14 feel - -15 (Audience participation.)16 MS. YARROW REGAN:	- - that what17 should happen is that Federal laws should  be18 brought  in. The stalking laws and the Federal19 domestic violence laws should be applied to   these20 circumstances.21 (Audience participation.)22 MS. YARROW REGAN:	Every day23 when I go on the subway, I see homeless people.   I24 ride the subways, I take the Long Island  Rail25 Road. I see many homeless men, women  and2 
2	children.3	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Would you4	wrap up, please.5	MS. YARROW REGAN:	And it 's an6 outrage that one person should be homeless  in7 such a wealthy country. Maybe you don't ride  on8 the subways. Maybe you don't take  public9 transportation but I do. And it 's heartbreaking10 to see someone who does not have housing. That 's11 because the rents are too  high.12 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. VISSER:	Jenny Hurwitz.15 MS. JENNY HURWITZ:	My name is16 Jenny Hurwitz. I'm a member of the 227- 229 East17 21st Street Tenants Association.18 I have a song in my heart.19 " Landlords,  landlords,  you think20 you are free lords,21 " Landlords,  they're making money22 off my knees, lord,23 " Landlords, you bring me to  my24 knees, lord .25 11  Landlords,  if you want  to last6 
1	5772	forever. " - - anyway.3 (Audience part icipation.)4 MS. JENNY HURWITZ:	What I want5 to say besides that is that I was born in  New6 York thirty- five years ago. And my very wonderful7 grandmother, who came here from Hungary in   1920,8 she pointed  out to -  she was a social worker   -9 she pointed out to me in the 1970s, look at   those10 buildings on the west side. They're boarding  up11 the apartments. They are purposely causing  a12 housing shortage. She saw it  coming.13 (Audience participation.)14 MS. JENNY HURWITZ:	And there' s15 no reason why the richest nation in the  world16 should have homeless people. If there needs to   be17 rent control , there needs to be affordable18 housing. What 's ruining the cities of our  country19 is the fact that people cannot afford to rent   an20 apartment.21 New York City, part of the  great22 thing about it has always been  its23 multiculturalism,	its poor living next to  the24 rich, its artists.25 None of these people are  being5 
2 able to live anymore. There are the odd  landlords3 here and there who have like a one or  two- story4 house that are having trouble with a tenant  or5 something.6	But that 's not what this is7 really about. What this is about is if they  were8 losing money on these buildings, they would   sell9 them because you could sell them for a lot   these10 days.11 And there were no homeless  in12 the 1950s when I walked down the street with  my13 dad. You know, it 's - -  it's not  right. People are14 held to a minimum wage and they can't afford   to15 live.16 And the landlords complain  that17 people are doubling up, tripling up in   apartments18 and they feel that 's unfair. People wouldn' t19 double up and triple up their families if   they20 could afford their own apartment.21 So please roll back the  rents22thistime.23Thank you.24(Audience participation. )25MS.

You've probably seen him on  TV6 feeding the rescue workers from 9/11 from  his7 restaurant . It 's a beautiful thing.8 What they didn't show you on  TV9 was that he evicted a tenant who was sick in   the10 hospital .11 What they didn't show you on  TV12 is that he had a super come in and throw  out13 people's personal belongings  from our backyard14 that they had put  in there  - - people had fixed  it15 up, people who lived in this building long  before16 he bought it , and fixed up the backyard as a17 garden and they had made it a wonderful , livable18 place.19 He decided he didn 't want people20 in the backyard.	So he threw these things  out.21 A VOICE :	What' s his name?22 MR. TALBOT KATZ:	His name is23 Nino Vendome	(phonetic).24 What they didn't show you  is25 that  - - well , in our apartment we have  toxic2 
2 mold, three kinds of toxic mold. And we had  to3 have on our own penny, we had to bring in  a4 contractor at merely a cost of $10,000 to  abate5 the mold in our bathroom because every time  they6 did repairs, the landlords had repairs done   in7 our bathroom, it made the problem worse.  The8 reason we found out there was mold to begin  with9 was because from a previous repair we saw  a10 mushroom growing out of our  ceiling.11	Well , the kicker on that  is that12 after spending that $10,000, the landlord  was13 trying to evict us.14 And these landlords  complain.15 And not just us . He' s also trying to evict every16 other rent stabilized and rent controlled  tenant17 in our building.18 These landlords complain  that19 they are not getting enough money. When  a20 landlord starts making less than $200 , 000 a year,21 then they can come talk to me about the  rent22increasestheyneed.23(Audience participation.)24MS.

2 Being  on any kind commission  -  I3 don' t care whether you're an owner representative4 or tenant representative, it is a sacred duty  to5 uphold the law so that everyone will have  respect6 for the law, not for your point of view or  my7 point of view, but for the  law.8 When you hold  that  in contempt ,9 when some of you I have read have  publicly10 opposed this law and yet allowed yourselves to  be11 appointed to a commission like this, that  is12 creating a contempt for the  law.13 That responsibility has to  be14 taken very solemnly.15 Thank you.16 (Audience participation.)17 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I would point18 out , Mr. Humm, that this Board , not  just  these19 members, but other members throughout the years  -20 it 's been in existence for over thirty years, and21 every one of its actions has been litigated  and22 found to be within the constraints of the  law.23 So I think that 's very important24 for you to understand that this Board in  its25 history has not taken an act that has been   found2

2 was relocated by the City so that the  landlord3 can do this repair. The landlord never did  the4 repair.5	Of all the court orders, they6 brought  in an inspector, inspected this7 apartment. This was taken into court. I'm   still8 in an SRO. My apartment was fraudulently  taken9 away from me even though they are  still10 repairing.11 The judge came to the  apartment12 with the landlord. When I got there, he  was13 already there with the landlord when we  were14 supposed to meet outside.15 He agreed with them, although  he16 saw the violations, no water, no lights, no gas.17 Now I need to know what  recourse18 do I have. This was taken to the appeal  court.19 The appeal court , they have my papers. The20 landlord never submitted  any.21 A hearing was set. They  never22 showed up . They never told me about it. And then23 they told me that I didn' t show up.24 And right now I don' t know what25 to do. But I want to get back my apartment  which6 
2 I had since 1976. Everything I owned was left   in3 the apartment. They locked me out and they  told4 me let the landlord know what I'm going to   move.5 Why should I let the  landlord6 know when I'm going to move? I didn't want  to7 move.8 So right now I'm still in  the9 SRO which sucks because just like the  homeless10 peopl e are out in the streets suffering, a lot  of11 people are in these SROs and they're  suffering12 too: a small room, no facilities for cooking   or13 anything.14 I need to know how could I  get15 this apartment so I can live a decent quality  of16 life. I need to know who can address this,  what17 should I do.18 My apartment was  fraudulently19 taken away. The judge knowing he went along   with20 them even though after he said this apartment  was21 never inspected. They let them get  away.22 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We will take23 down your information and the staff will   look24 into it. But we really are not in a position.

18 MR. DREW KIRIAZIDES:	H , I
I'm
19 Drew Kiriazides  from the Manhattan Borough20 President 's Off ice.21 Tonight I'm going to read  the22 testimony for C. Virginia  Fields.23 Good evening, Chairman Marcus24 and Members of the Rent Guidelines  Board.25 The facts are staggeringly12 
2 obvious: building operating costs are  down,3 landlord profits are up , and real income of New4 Yorkers has declined over the last  year.5 These facts are inarguable  and6 the only conclusion one can make is that  rent7 levels should be decreased.8 And yet at the preliminary  vote9 on May 20th, the Board voted an increase which  I10 find baffling.11 If the Rent Guidelines Board  is12 not basing its decision using its own  methodology13 for determining rent , then what is it using? I14 ask you and appeal to reason and urge the  Board15 to roll back stabilized  rents.16 I could spend several minutes17 rattling off data that supports a rent  rollback.18 Actually I'm forced to kind  of19 make it brief tonight . I gave testimony to this20 gentleman to my left. So I 'll be brief.21 At the preliminary vote on  May22 20th, a Board Member stated that  rent23 stabilizat ion is obsolete and, therefore, should24 be abolished because New York City no longer  has25 a housing emergency.2 
2 I do not know from whence he3 comes, but clearly this person is not  talking4 about the City I live in, and it is not the  City5 in which I represent a multitude of  people.6 New York City has been and  is7 suffering from a severe housing crisis.  The8 homeless population is astronomical , market rate9 rents are skyrocketing out of control and  people10 are paying a huge percentage of their incomes  on11 rents.12 The burden of a rent increase13 will fall on New York' s most vulnerable14 population, those at the bottom of the  socio-15 economic ladder. These people, which include  many16 senior citizens on fixed income and low- income17 households of color, are part icularly hurting18 because of the downturn in the  economy.19 In closing, I urge you to vote20 for a rent rollback and to vote down  supplemental21 rent increases. New York City is best served by  a22 mix of incomes. It maintains diversity and  adds23 to the vitality of this great  City.24 Reducing  housing affordability25 will result in income- segregated neighborhoods,  a2 
2 problem we already experience to our detriment  .3 As this segregation continues, ultimately  the4 City on a whole becomes  diminished.5 We must fight against this .6 Thank you for this opportunity7 to testify .8 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you .9 (Audience participat ion.)10 MS. VISSER :	Richard Barr,11 followed by Susan Slocum and Jillian  Jonas.12 MR . RICHARD BARR :	My name is13 Richard Barr . I live in the west 80s. And every14 year  it 's the same show here . The landlord  lobby15 boys always sit over there smugly while  they16 orchestrate small property owners in  poor17 neighborhoods to get up and say they  are18 struggling to make ends meet , and the genuinely19 squeezed tenants testify about their plight , and20 they are at each other' s throats .21 And who is missing from all  of22 this? The landlords who have thousands of  units23 in neighborhoods where there is virtual  vacancy24 decontrol . Any time they recapture an apartment25 or induce somebody to leave, they then  renovate10 
2 or say they renovate enough to bring it up  over3 that magical $2000 mark, and then lo and behold ,4 they are getting rents five, ten and more  times5 what they got from their last stabilized  tenant.6 Why are those people never here?7 If any of them are crazy  enough8 to want to show up here, the lobbyists would  tell9 them not to dare set foot in this  place.10 And my feeling is if they  want11 an increase, let them open up their books. And  if12 you got somebody who from the combination  of13 their regulated and market rate apartments  is14 making enormous prof its, why should that person15 get one dime of increase on their  stabilized16 units?17 If there is somebody who  is18 genuinely struggling to make ends meet or  has19 nine units and opens their books and you want  to20 give them the hardship increase, so be  it.21 But not these people who  are22 making out like bandits and never have to  show23 their profit and loss  statements.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you,25 sir.2 
1	5922 MS. VISSER:	Susan Slocum.3 MS. SUSAN SLOCUM:	I'm Susan4 Slocum. I live in the East 20s. My rent  keeps5 going up because my landlord keeps putting in   for6 MCis. He doesn' t do a damn thing, and the  super7 now, instead of living in the building, lives   in8 the Bronx. That 's not even legal , but he is9 getting away with it.10 I also work as a housing11 specialist for a non- profit in Brooklyn.	I'm in12 housing court two or three days a week with   poor13 tenants. They have nowhere to go. Legal Aid  can't14 help them because there are too many  clients.15 They can't afford attorneys. All the  landlords16 have attorneys. So they turn to  me.17 And I see what they get  in18 housing court. I see landlords taking  eighty-19 five year old ladies to court for non- payment20 because they won' t recognize her SCRIE.21 Somewhere the greed has got  to22 stop.23 The courts are jammed. When  are24 you going to lower it for tenants? Something' s25 got to be fair.2 
1	5932	Thank you.3 (Audience participat ion.)4 MS. VISSER:	The last speaker5	tonight is Jillian Jonas.6	CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Is there7	anybody else in the audience that would like to8 speak?8 
9 MS. JILLIAN JONAS:	H , I
I have I
10	guess the welcomed pleasure to be the  last11	speaker.12 Anyway,  I'm here - -13 A VOICE:	Use the mike.14 MS. JILLIAN JONAS:	Iam15 speaking into the mike.16 I'm here mostly for two  primary17 reasons.18 I live in a stabilized  apartment19 obviously in the neighborhood. I have all my   own20 sets of personal catastrophes because of  it.21 A week ago I had to rescue  a22 woman in the elevator, the fire department had   to23 come, because they don' t maintain the building.24 But that' s not why I'm here.25 I'm here because I want to  kind12 
2 of give you a face of kind of the economy.  I3 can't say I'm directly affected by 9/11 but  I4 have been out of full - time work almost two years5 now. My rent has gone up by about twenty  percent6 since 1998 because of MCis, one of which is  very7 dubious,  if it actually existed , but DHCR   just8 rolled over.9 I'm facing another one. I got10 nailed with the big seven percent increase a   few11 years back thanks to Mayor  Giuliani.12 I can barely get by. I am a13 well- educated, professional woman. I have a14 master' s degree. I grew up in Manhattan. My15 parents still live here. And I can barely get  by.16 I know so many people in  similar17 situat ions to myself right now, well educated,18 upper middle class if that 's the term one wants19 to use for all the issues of class going on.  and20 I can barely get by.21 And I don' t know if you22 part icularly hear this. I am normally a  taxpaying23 citizen. I'm not right now, although I did  pay24 taxes last year. My boyfriend didn't because  he25 couldn' t file. There was nothing for him to  file.2 
2	The other issue is just that  my3 ninety- one year old grandmother, who is in a4 stabilized apartment , and who lives on a fixed5 income of $40,000 a year, so she doesn 't qualify6 for SCRIE, her rent is now almost $3 , 000 a month.7 You can do the math .8 The rest of whatever she  has9 left over goes to prescription drugs and  food.10 So I just want you to think11 about that . Think about that . There is a   human12 face to these people you seem to ignore .13 Thank you .14 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.15 (Audience part icipation.)16 MS. ANGELA McCLAIN:	Could I17 just say one thing?18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.19 MS. ANGELA McCLAIN:	I have a20 little income that I keep for  myself.21 In 1998, the Social Security22 gave us a 2 .1 percent increase. In 1999, it was23 1.1 percent. 2000 year it was 2.4. So  actually24 I've been caught twice in recent years for  the25 $15 extra.3 
2 And always I've paid about  a3 four percent increase. Just last October it  was4 six percent.5 Now with what I get from  Social6 Security, I feel like I'm going down, down,  down7 because actually they are not giving as  much8 increase as we always have to pay for the  rent.9	Do you get me?10 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	We understand11 the math.12 MS. ANGELA McClain:	Well , I13 just wanted to say that.14 Thank you.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Give your16 name to the reporter.17 MS. ANGELA McCLAIN:	Angela18 McClain.19 Oh! There is another thing  that20 crosses my mind.21 I wonder if possibly the22 insurance companies are really making money  just23 because of 9/11 happening.
