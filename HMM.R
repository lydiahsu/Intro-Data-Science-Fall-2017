## Hidden Markov Model for DNA ####
# Here we will consider a simple model to use HMM's to model DNA.
# example taken from 
# http://a-little-book-of-r-for-bioinformatics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/chapter10.html
# where you made find some more interesting examples!


nucleotides    <- c("A", "C", "G", "T") # Define the alphabet of nucleotides
probabilities1 <- c(0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.2) # Set the values of the probabilities
seqlength      <- 30                    # Set the length of the sequence
sample(nucleotides, seqlength, rep=TRUE, prob=probabilities1) # Generate a sequence

probabilities2 <- c(0.1, 0.41, 0.39, 0.1) # Set the values of the probabilities for the new model
sample(nucleotides, seqlength, rep=TRUE, prob=probabilities2) # Generate a sequence

# this is a simplistic model, as the frequencies cannot change over time which we might want.
# also, the probability of the 10th entry being A has nothing to do with the values previously,
# which again might be reasonable. known as a markov sequence model.
